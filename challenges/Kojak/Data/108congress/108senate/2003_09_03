Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill. \nYesterday, two amendments were offered and debated during the pendency \nof the bill. The chairman and ranking member are here this morning and \nare prepared to work through these amendments as well as additional \namendments that will be offered.\n  I expect a rollcall vote to occur on at least one of those amendments \nprior to the policy luncheons today. Therefore, Members should \nanticipate a vote around noon. We will alert all Senators when that \nvote is scheduled.\n  As I mentioned, the Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 for the \npolicy luncheons. I encourage Members who have amendments to the Labor-\nHHS bill to contact the managers of that legislation as soon as \npossible. It would be very helpful to have a list of amendments so that \nthe chairman and ranking member will be able to work through those \namendments in an orderly fashion.\n  I thank all Members as we go forward during the appropriations \nprocess. Most Members came back yesterday. We had a very good day and a \nvery productive day with the introduction of those amendments. We are \nmaking progress on this very important bill, and I look forward to the \nparticipation of all Members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S10991-6", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2660, which the clerk will report \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2660) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Specter amendment No. 1542, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Byrd amendment No. 1543 (to amendment No. 1542) to provide \n     additional funding for education for the disadvantaged.\n       Akaka amendment No. 1544 (to amendment No. 1542) to provide \n     additional funding for the Excellence in Economic Education \n     Act of 2001.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while the majority leader is in the \nChamber, it would be appropriate to comment about the colloquy which \nthe majority leader and I had on August 1, the last day of session \nbefore the August recess. As the majority leader stated, this bill \nwould be the first matter taken up on September 2, which we did take \nup, and gave everyone notice.\n  I made the comment at that time about the problems I have observed \nwith quorum calls taking up so much time, and I stated that it was my \nhope as manager--and which was concurred in by my distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Harkin--that we would have amendments prepared to go. \nWe got off to a start yesterday with two\n\n[[Page S10992]]\n\namendments. We were unable to find any more amendments. We have a \ncouple lined up this morning.\n  It is my hope that Members will come to the floor with their \namendments and be prepared to go and that we can work through orderly \ntime agreements and proceed, with the hope of finishing up this bill--\nat least a major part of it--by the end of the week.\n  As I said on August 1, I would like to see the Senate proceed to a \nthird reading when there are a lot of quorum calls and amendments which \nare not prepared to be offered, especially where there is adequate \nnotice, as there has been for more than a month on this bill, and as \nmatter of general Senate business of what I hope would be accomplished \nhere.\n  I understand, after discussing the matter with the assistant leader \nfor the Democrats, that there is one amendment where the Democrats may \nneed to bring all of their people in who might otherwise be absent. \nThat single amendment might have to go over to next week. If that is \nso, at least we should complete the bill with the exception of that \namendment, or as much of it as we can.\n\n  Let me urge my colleagues to come to the floor with their amendments \nand notify the managers of the bill about amendments they have so we \ncan proceed in an orderly way. It is my hope that we can work into the \nevening to debate amendments, subject to the decision of the majority \nleader, and stacking votes perhaps in the morning, if we are not to \nvote in the evening, with the same procedure available tomorrow night \nbecause there are some 40 amendments pending. It is obvious we are \ngoing to have considerable work to do and considerable debate to \naddress these amendments.\n  In advance of the August recess, I conferred with the distinguished \nchairman of the full committee, the President pro tempore, the ranking \nmember of the full committee, and many of the members of the Democratic \ncaucus who I knew would have amendments to offer so that we ought to be \nin a position to move forward.\n  Again, I urge colleagues to come to the floor with their amendments.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the majority leader is in the Chamber, \nhaving heard the distinguished manager of the bill on two separate \noccasions--yesterday and today--talking about his desire to complete \nthe bill, all members of the Appropriations Committee want to complete \nthis bill and I would like to finish this bill. The Democratic leader \nhas indicated that he wants to cooperate in any way we can to move \nthese bills along.\n  Having said that, we have some real problems. Today is Wednesday. \nTomorrow is Thursday. That is my reason for asking the distinguished \nmajority leader if he would respond. Does the leader have an idea about \nwhat we are going to do on Friday? One of the problems we have, of \ncourse, is even when we have votes on Friday, it is on a relatively \nunimportant matter most of the time. If we are going to work tomorrow, \nthere is not a chance we can complete this bill, no matter how late we \nwork tonight and Thursday.\n  We have 40 amendments we have already identified. I said to the \nmanager of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, that \nprobably 25 percent of those the managers could agree on. That still \nleaves 30 amendments. There are a number of them that are quite \ncontroversial. If we are going to leave here Thursday night, I just do \nnot think we can do it. Miracles happen.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, in response, I wish to \nrestate what our distinguished manager just said; and that is that 5 \nweeks ago, at the end of our session just prior to the recess, we did \nhave a colloquy on the floor to state the importance but also the \nabsolute necessity of having the time managed on the floor be \ndisciplined and orderly to get the amendments and, as my request I made \njust a few minutes ago, to have our colleagues come forward.\n\n  So far that is progressing well. And we are going to stay here and \nstay on the bill to finish it, which means--and we will have more to \nsay on that, and I talked to the Democratic leader last night--I expect \nwe will be voting on Mondays and Fridays.\n  I think the votes we have this Friday will be important votes. We \nhave a lot of people traveling, on both sides of the aisle, maybe more \non your side of the aisle than ours. But for many different reasons it \nis absolutely critical that we recognize, as a body, that our \nresponsibility is to complete this important piece of legislation, \nwhich means being here, and we will be here Friday. Later, as we talk, \nand people are back--I don't know how late we will be here Friday, but \nwe will be voting on substantive amendments on Friday.\n  It is critical we move ahead. I know the same discussion went on a \nlittle bit yesterday, and it went on for the week or 2 weeks on the \nEnergy bill, that we have so much to do there is no way we are going to \nbe able to finish it. So now I am getting used to it. It is true, we \nhave to debate these amendments. Whether there are 40 or 50--and I know \nthere are some very important ones--I want to share with my colleagues \nthat we do need to stay here, although hopefully we will not have to \nvote at night too much because I know people have plans. We need to \nstay here, and the managers have expressed a willingness to stay here \nat night in order to continue that business as we go forward.\n  As I told the Democratic leader yesterday, we will probably be voting \non Mondays and Fridays not just this week but over the next several \nweeks. Then if there are certain days we come to an agreement that we \ndon't need to vote, we can continue the business. And we will share \nthat with both sides of the aisle. Just one final matter: the energy \nconferees. I will hopefully have more to say about that later. But we \nwere prepared to appoint energy conferees before we left. On the \nDemocratic side of the aisle the request was made not to quite yet \nappoint those. I did mention to the Democratic leader yesterday that we \nare ready to go and do those appointments as soon as possible. I am \nvery hopeful that the leadership on your side of the aisle and our side \nof the aisle can announce that today.\n  We are ready to go. We have our conferees in line, so I would like to \ndo that. I would like to make clear that we have been ready to go for \nthe last 5 and a half weeks with our conferees. People come forward and \nsay this is a hugely important issue, so I hope we can address that.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through you to the distinguished majority \nleader, I was in a meeting yesterday with the Democratic leader, and I \nthink we are at a point where those conferees can be appointed. I am \nvery confident it can be done today.\n  Mr. President, has the bill been reported this morning?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1547 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1547.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funding for certain education and related \n                               programs)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. 306. (a) In addition to any amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated--\n       (1) an additional $20,000,000 to carry out part H of title \n     I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (dropout prevention);\n       (2) an additional $85,000,000 to carry out title III of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (language \n     instruction);\n       (3) an additional $6,449,000 to carry out part A of title V \n     of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (Hispanic-serving \n     institutions);\n       (4) an additional $4,587,000 to carry out part C of title I \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (migrant education);\n       (5) an additional $11,000,000 to carry out high school \n     equivalency program activities under section 418A of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEP);\n\n[[Page S10993]]\n\n       (6) an additional $1,000,000 to carry out college \n     assistance migrant program activities under section 418A of \n     the Higher Education Act of 1965 (CAMP);\n       (7) an additional $12,776,000 to carry out subpart 16 of \n     part D of title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (parental assistance and local family information \n     centers); and\n       (8) an additional $69,000,000 to carry out migrant and \n     seasonal Head Start programs: Provided, That such sum shall \n     be in addition to funds reserved for migrant, seasonal, and \n     other Head Start programs under section 640(a)(2) of the Head \n     Start Act.\n       (b) Of the funds appropriated in this Act for the National \n     Institutes of Health, $150,000,000 shall not be available for \n     obligation until September 30, 2004.\n       (c) The amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this \n     Act shall be deemed to be $7,105,011,000 and the amount \n     $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $6,573,489,000.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment relates to programs that help \nHispanic children. This is more than just numbers, statistics; it deals \nwith real people, kids who can be helped by special programs.\n  What does this mean? Does it mean we are spending more money to be \nspending more money? What it means is we will be spending more money to \nsave money. For every $1 we spend in our country for these programs, we \nsave $10 in welfare costs, educational costs, costs to the criminal \njustice system. These programs deal with children, I repeat.\n  One of the programs is a program called the High School Equivalency \nProgram which assists students of migrant parents who have dropped out \nof high school to earn their GED.\n  Here is what Tedrel Eubanks said:\n\n       [The high school equivalency program] exposed me to college \n     life. This was something beyond my wildest dreams. I had \n     never given any real thought to finishing high school, not to \n     mention going to college. The more I attended GED classes, \n     the more excited I became. The more time I spent on the \n     University campus taking part in various activities, the more \n     determined I became about getting my GED certificate and \n     graduating and enrolling at [Mississippi Valley State \n     University].\n\n  And that is what he did.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment I just \noffered be on my behalf and on behalf of the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Another program that is a tremendously important program \nthat is greatly affected in an adverse way by this bill we have before \nus is a program called the College Assistance Migrant Program, referred \nto as CAMP, which assists migrant students in their first year of \ncollege with personal academic counseling and stipends. These programs \nhave been enormously successful. But rather than talk about, again, \nstatistics, let me talk about a person by the name of Maria de Lurdes \nReynoso.\n  Maria said she went to the Boise State University CAMP. She said:\n\n       [The] Boise State University's CAMP scholarship has been a \n     stepping-stone in my college career. CAMP is much more than a \n     scholarship. From academic support to career opportunities, \n     CAMP helps its students become successful individuals. One of \n     the most important goals of my life was to receive a college \n     education. But more than anything, I have always wanted to \n     travel and see new places. CAMP placed me on the right track \n     and assisted me with a career and extracurricular \n     opportunities. This summer I will be traveling out of the \n     country to do an internship in Guadalajara, Mexico with the \n     Department of Commerce and the Department of Agriculture. \n     This Spring I will be graduating with a degree in \n     International Business and minors in Finance and Spanish, \n     thanks to the guidance and support of the people who make up \n     the . . . CAMP program [at Boise State University].\n\n  Mr. President, this isn't a statistic that is a throwaway. This is a \nstatistic that deals with a young lady who would have never, ever been \nable to go to college and then complete college.\n  We have another program called the Migrant Education Program. These \nfunds are used to identify and recruit migrant students, to provide \nscreening for health problems, and to provide resources to enable the \nchildren to receive appropriate medical care.\n  As to this program, I would like to take just one case history of a \nyoung person who said:\n\n       At my new school, I was identified for the Migrant \n     Education Program.\n\n  Oscar Guzman said:\n\n       The teacher who was in charge of my class helped my mother \n     with all of the paperwork and records transfer. He also \n     arranged for a health check up for me, which I continued to \n     get every year through the eighth grade. The Migrant \n     Education Program had a special reading group for migrant \n     students, which helped me with my English.\n       I am the first person in my family to go to college. My \n     parents are very proud of my decision to go to college and \n     expect me to go far. My dad always tells me that I am going \n     to [be able to] work in an air-conditioned office with a \n     secretary. My aunts and uncles are also very proud of me and \n     use me as an example for my cousins. I hope to be in a \n     position where I can make a difference in education and \n     agriculture in order to improve the lives of families like my \n     own.\n       I would not be here today if it were not for the Migrant \n     Education Program in fifth grade that put me on a path of \n     academic achievement and the other migrant programs that \n     helped me succeed.\n\n  ``Because of these programs,'' Oscar said, ``my life was made easier \nand my parents' dream of a better life for me and my brother will come \ntrue.''\n  That is what these amendments are about. These amendments are about \nimproving the lives of young people. I think we all learn a culture by \nlistening to its native language, its native tongue. Every time I hear \nsomeone speak Russian, I think of my deceased father-in-law who was \nborn in Russia. He came as a little boy. I am confident that he didn't \nspeak a word of Russian but I do know that his parents spoke extremely \nbroken English. I didn't know his parents, my wife's grandparents. I \nthink of a series in public radio recently about trying to bring back \npeople who have written books in Yiddish. Of course, both of my in-laws \nused to speak Yiddish when they didn't want me to know what was going \non. I think we learn a lot about a culture by listening to people's \nlanguages.\n  Among Latino Americans, ``aspirar'' has special meaning. It is \nsimilar to our verb ``aspire'' but it carries a greater sense of \nurgency. It invokes dreams of a better life, striving for a better \nfuture, among people who work hard just to make ends meet.\n  Children are the hope of every culture, and it is no different for \nLatino Americans. They are the youngest demographic group in our \ncountry and the fastest growing. More than one-third of Latino \nAmericans are under 18 years of age.\n  So the great aspiration of Latino Americans, as all immigrants who \nhave come to our country, is a good education for their children. We \nrecognize that with this wave of immigrants, as with previous waves of \nimmigrants, the parents are the ones who are uneducated and doing the \nmenial work. They have aspirations, desires, wishes, and prayers for \ntheir children to be able to become educated so they don't have to do \nthe menial work that they are doing.\n  We recognize that there is an unacceptable gap in academic \nachievement between Latino students and the overall student population. \nWe have agreed that it should be this Nation's policy to leave no child \nbehind. Now it is time to live up to those words.\n  That is why this amendment I have offered with Senator Bingaman--the \nHispanic education opportunity amendment--to help Latino students \nachieve dreams is important.\n  This amendment would invest an additional $210 million in our \nNation's future by strengthening these programs. I have talked about \nthe programs--not all of them--such as the Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions, the high school equivalency program, the College \nAssistance Migrant Program, the local family information centers, \ndropout prevention, bilingual education, and Head Start for children of \nmigrant workers.\n  These programs give Latino students a step up the ladder of education \nso they can realize their aspirations. The 252 Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions which have at least 25 percent Latino enrollment are the \nmain bridge between Hispanic communities and higher education. Despite \nappropriations under title V, these institutions still haven't reached \nFederal funding parity with other degree-granting institutions. This \namendment adds $6.4 million to help address this inequity.\n  The high school equivalency programs provide academic instruction, \ncounseling, computer-assisted teaching, and career awareness to migrant \nstudents studying for the GED. The Senate's bill--the one before us--\nslashes funding for these programs by\n\n[[Page S10994]]\n\n43 percent and would eliminate 23 programs to achieve a combined GED \ncompletion rate of almost 73 percent.\n\n  The proposed budget also cuts the College Assistance Migrant Program \nby $400,000. As I indicated with the example I gave earlier, these \nrecruits are important. They are talented migrant high school graduates \nand GED recipients, and this mentors them through their first year of \ncollege. Before CAMP was created, there was no record of a migrant \nchild having completed college. Since its inception, almost three-\nquarters of all CAMP students received baccalaureate degrees.\n  The existing HEP and CAMP programs serve approximately 15,000 \nstudents. Of these 15,000 students, the vast majority--about 75 \npercent--will graduate from college. They will not be welfare dependent \nand will not have problems with the criminal justice system. And, of \ncourse, they won't be creating problems in the educational system. Over \nthe next years, about 170,000 migrant children will become eligible for \nHEP, while 140,000 will qualify for CAMP. Funding for these programs \nshould be increased, not cut. That is why this amendment adds $11 \nmillion for HEP programs and $1 million for CAMP.\n  We also need to make the Head Start Program available to more \nchildren of migrant workers so they have a fighting chance to do well \nin school.\n  In Nevada, we have probably a thousand migrant students, and they \nmake up more than half the students in Amargossa in Nye County, where \nmy brother lives. These children have hard lives, and if any child ever \ndeserved a head start in school, they do. Yet we have not had a single \nmigrant Head Start Program in all of Nevada. People think of Nevada \nonly as a place where you have the bright lights of Las Vegas and Reno \nbut we have farming communities.\n  In the Amargossa Valley, there are very large dairy farms. In Lyon \nCounty, we have the largest producer of white onions in America. \nMigrant farm workers come there in waves. Yet we don't have a single \nprogram in Head Start for these children. They are left behind even \nbefore they begin school. We need to offer Head Start to 10,000 new \nmigrant children. My amendment would move us toward that goal.\n  We know parental involvement is a crucial factor in a child's school \nsuccess. That is why the local family information centers were created \nby the No Child Left Behind Act. These are community-based centers that \nprovide parents of title I students with information about their \nchildren's schools so they can get involved in their education. An \nadditional investment will strengthen the ties between Latino families \nand their children's schools. This is good for the whole community.\n  This amendment also addresses the programs for dropout prevention and \nbilingual education. Senator Bingaman and I have worked for years \ntogether on the dropout programs. We believe there should be a dropout \nczar in the Department of Education that works on nothing but doing \nsomething to prevent dropouts in our country.\n  In Nevada, we have 50,000 students with limited proficiency in \nEnglish. And Latinos have the highest dropout rate of any demographic \ngroup in our State. These programs will help Nevada, and many other \nStates, too, with growing Hispanic populations.\n  In the past, we have received Federal grants for two dropout \nprograms, at Pyramid Lake High School, a Paiute Indian school, and the \nWashoe County School District. But now the Senate HHS budget would \neliminate all funding for these programs. The amendment I have offered \nwould restore $20 million for dropout prevention.\n  None of these programs by themselves might seem that important, but \ntaken together they give Latino Americans a better chance of realizing \ntheir hopes and dreams. Just as important, these measures will \nstrengthen the American economy by building a more productive \nworkforce.\n  Already, one-third of the new workers who join our labor force are \nLatino. In 20 years, it will be half. These are the workers who will \npay taxes to keep our military strong, to educate our children, \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren, and provide our Social Security \nin the future. So, you see, our future depends on the hopes and dreams \nof our Latino neighbors.\n  Aspirar--to hope. No matter what language we speak, we all understand \nwhat that means. We all have a stake in making it possible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after conferring with the distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader, we have agreed upon a time for the vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at noon today, the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Reid amendment No. 1547 with no amendments to \nthe amendment in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend to modify that request \nfollowing the word ``vote,'' that at 11:45 a.m., the amendment recur \nand that the time until 12 o'clock be equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Reid and Bingaman and Senator Specter. In effect, we \nwill debate the matter from 11:45 a.m. until 12 o'clock and vote at 12 \no'clock.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nNevada leaves the floor, and I know he has other commitments and will \nnot hear my reply to his presentation, the question that I would \naddress to the Senator from Nevada is how he picks a figure of $210 \nmillion? As I will outline in the course of my presentation, there are \nquite a number of programs which are directed to this issue.\n  The appropriations subcommittee has considered many programs. We have \nincreased some 26 programs and decreased some 6 programs, what we \nconsider to be a balance. I ask my colleague from Nevada how he comes \nto a figure of $210 million when comparing it to all the other programs \nin this bill which are directed to this generalized effort?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we have done is meet with educators, we \nhave met with members of the Hispanic community, and we have come to \nthe conclusion that the programs that are included in this amendment \nare vital and should be increased and not decreased, and that these \nprograms are, we think, programs that, as I indicated briefly in my \nstatement, will not cost this country money but will save the country \nmoney in the long term.\n  While the figure we have come up with may not be magically correct--I \nwould like to have had more, but in working with the minority staff, we \nrecognize there is a limit to what we can do, but we believe this is a \nsmall enough number that people should simply vote to waive the Budget \nAct. And I am confident there will be a budget point of order raised \nagainst this amendment on a bill such as this bill.\n  I say to my friend that a few months ago we were going to give Turkey \n$6 billion to help us in Iraq. Maybe we should say that $200 million to \nhelp people here who are going to help our country is just as important \nas that gift we were going to make to the people of Turkey.\n  I do apologize for being rude to my friend because I always \nappreciate his efficacy. I am sure not everyone in the Senate has read \nhis book. I have. I know what a fine lawyer he is and the work he has \ndone. But probably not listening to his response will make my day \neasier because I will then not realize all the inadequacies in my \namendment and I would have to come back and respond to that argument. \nThis way I can just speak from the high level and not have to worry \nabout his--I will not say nitpicking but his really good debate. In \nthis way, I will have one of my staff tell me some of the high points \nof his debate, and I will just hit the high points when I return.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for \nthose charming, complimentary remarks. He exits the Chamber with grace. \nHe has to present a judge from his State. We will miss him. I would\n\n[[Page S10995]]\n\nprefer his being here so all of the contentions I will make will be \npresented directly to him. There are many demands on every Senator. I \nunderstand why Senator Reid cannot be present.\n  When the Senator from Nevada advanced this amendment for $210 million \nadditionally for education programs for Hispanic students, I asked him \nhow they came up with this figure. I do so in the context of chairing \nthis subcommittee which has had many hearings and has analyzed the \nneeds of Hispanic students in the context of many other needs this \nsubcommittee has to fund.\n  Without going through the entire list, I had referenced the fact that \nthe bill contains increases for some 26 programs and decreases for some \n6 programs. In making an evaluation as to what are the needs of the \nHispanic community, we have taken into account that there are many \nother programs which have been funded which are directed to the \nHispanic community or programs where the local education agency has \nfunding which can be directed to the Hispanic community, depending upon \nthe needs for that community in a given area. The needs for the \nHispanic community may vary materially in San Antonio, TX, which is \nmore heavily populated with Hispanics than, say, my hometown of \nRussell, KS, a small community on the plains of Kansas with 5,000 \npeople where the need is different.\n  One of the major education allocations of this bill is \n$12,350,000,000 on Title I grants to local education agencies. This is \ndirected to take care of the achievement gap between students in low- \nand high-poverty schools. This covers to a very material extent \ncommunities where these funds can be allocated for Hispanics.\n  Our bill also includes some $300 million for the Gear Up program \noriginated by a distinguished Member of the House of Representatives \nfrom Philadelphia, Congressman Chaka Fattah, who coordinated the \nprogram with me, with the thrust coming from the House but most of the \nfunding thrust coming from this subcommittee, where we now have some \n$300 million in this GEAR UP Program, and 70 percent of the 1.3 million \nstudents served by this program are minorities, including almost 30 \npercent who are Hispanics. I point to this GEAR UP Program as \nillustrative of a program which can accommodate the kinds of concerns \nwhich the Senator from Nevada is talking about.\n\n  Our bill also has some $665 million for the English Language \nAcquisition State Grant Program, which is designed to help students who \nhave limited English proficiency. Here again, this funding is already \navailable for Hispanics on the line where the Senator from Nevada seeks \nto add additional funding.\n  There are many other programs in this bill. For example, $13 million \nin this bill is being directed to the high school equivalency program \nwhich can be used for Hispanic students; some $15 million directed to \ncollege assistance migrant programs, which again can be used for \nHispanic students.\n  On the English Language Acquisition Grant State, which was already \nidentified, there is some $665 million, and with respect to Hispanic-\nserving institutions, more than $93 million is being directed to \ncolleges and universities which have 25 percent or more Hispanics.\n  In the context of these appropriations, it was the conclusion of the \nsubcommittee, and then the conclusion of the full committee, that the \ninterests of Hispanic students were adequately taken care of.\n  When I asked the Senator from Nevada how he picked a figure of $210 \nmillion, his response was, it is not excessive but it would be helpful; \nthat it might be good to have even more money.\n  That might be said about any program which is on the agenda, to add \nmore money.\n  The Senator from Nevada said we were considering giving substantial \nmoney to Turkey. Well, why not give a portion of that money to Hispanic \nstudents? That is a very frequently advanced argument. If we took the \ncost of the B-2 bomber, how many items in some other line could that \naccommodate?\n  The reality is that the Federal budget is gigantic. It is $2.2 \ntrillion. Does anybody know how much money that is? Not really. It is a \nstaggering amount of money. It is said that if one took a large hall \nlike the Senate Chamber there would be insufficient space to stuff \n$10,000 bills for that sum of money.\n  The Congress of the United States has, as a principal function, the \njob of appropriating, figuring out where the money goes. There may be \nsome disagreement about how much money should have been offered to \nTurkey to aid in the Iraq war, and we will hear a great deal of talk in \nthis Chamber about Iraq, not Iraq's educational program but how much \nmoney is being allocated to Iraq. I submit that the long-range \ninterests of the United States are very well served, and when we are \nsuccessful--and we will be successful--in establishing order in Iraq \nand establishing, I think, a democracy in Iraq. Democracies are \ncontagious.\n  The only democracy in the Mideast today is Israel. The Saudis' \nleadership are in fear of democracies becoming popular, as are the \nruling elites in all of the other Mideast countries.\n  I do not intend to prolong a debate about Iraq. It is my hope that \nthe President's efforts to bring in other nations, which is the banner \nheadline in this morning's press, will reach fruition. I hope there \nwill be people from other countries, especially Muslim countries, \nPakistan and Turkey, to share in the responsibility and to give the \nArab world confidence so that the United States will not carry that \nburden and our own personnel will not be subjected to the casualties \nwhich are currently present.\n\n  I mention Iraq in response to what the Senator from Nevada says about \nthe money which we have proposed to give to Turkey. So we are trying to \nmake an allocation of a gigantic sum of money, $2.2 trillion. It comes \nto this subcommittee to make an allocation on discretionary funding of \n$137.6 billion. I think we have exercised real care and thoughtfulness \nin making these allocations.\n  I would like to see additional money for many items in the line, but \nthere has to be an evaluation and an assessment of priorities. I am \naware of the political impact on having my vote, and the votes of other \nindividual Senators, be against expanding this Hispanic education \nprogram. It is worth a brief comment on the so-called 30-second \ncommercial, where individual votes are picked out and are featured at \nelection time to say to one group or another, and in this case \nHispanics, why Senator X or Senator Y ought to be defeated because \nthere was a vote against a specific matter. That does not tell even a \npart of the story as to how that vote is cast in the context of other \nprograms which are devoted to this very important issue, as I think \nthis record shows, which I have explained, and why it is with \nreluctance that I oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Yes, it would be good to have more funds here and more funds in many \nother places, but it is an overall evaluation which we have to take \ninto account. I believe a fair analysis of this program overall shows \nthat there are adequate funds being directed for this important \npurpose. How you pick $210 million in this amendment as opposed to $310 \nmillion or $410 million or $10 million remains an open question, when \nwe add up the millions of dollars which are devoted to programs and \nitems in this appropriation bill which are directable to this important \nobjective.\n  I am advised other Senators will be coming to speak on this \namendment. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has asked that \nall Republican members of the committee be available for a meeting at \nthis time. So in the absence of any other Senator wishing to speak and \nin the instance of my own presence being required at another meeting, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are awaiting other Senators to speak \non the pending amendment of the Senator\n\n[[Page S10996]]\n\nfrom Nevada, Mr. Reid. In the interim I ask other Senators to come to \nthe floor to offer amendments. Procedurally, as is well known, we can \nset aside the Reid amendment and proceed to debate other amendments.\n  The majority leader has already expressed his intention to vote \nthrough Friday, so the sooner we address these issues the sooner the \nSenate will conclude its business. I urge my colleagues to come to the \nSenate floor to offer amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak in \nfavor of the amendment that Senator Reid of Nevada has offered relating \nto funding for various programs in this appropriations bill that are of \nparticular importance to the Hispanic community. I strongly support \nSenator Reid's amendment and believe that it would be a very important \nstep for us to take in keeping the commitment that we have made to the \npeople of this country when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I have just completed spending 4 weeks in my State, most of the time \nin my State, and much of that time I was talking to people who were \ninvolved in education and were preparing for the new school year. It is \nclear that one message comes through in those discussions. That message \nis, What is the Federal Government going to do to keep its share of the \nbargain?\n  The Federal Government has imposed all sorts of new requirements on \nStates and school districts about how they are to reform education, how \nthey are to improve instruction in the schools, how they are to improve \nstudent performance in the schools. Unfortunately, when those educators \nsee that the administration, first, in its request to Congress, and \nthen the Congress itself, does not put forward the money which was \ncommitted in the No Child Left Behind Act, the cynicism on the part of \nmany people working in education is understandable.\n  The amendment the Senator from Nevada has offered is an effort to \ncorrect some of that. I strongly support it. Let me talk about one \nparticular aspect of it that I know better, perhaps, than I know some \nother parts. That relates to the dropout prevention program. This is a \nsubject that has been debated and discussed and talked about in \nWashington and at the national level for a great many years. I remember \nwhen President Bush senior, the former President Bush--not this \nPresident Bush but this President Bush's father--convened all the \nGovernors of the country to have a first and only, as far as I know to \nthis day--first and only national summit on education. That was in \nCharlottesville, VA. It was in 1989, I believe. At that time the \nGovernors and the President committed the country to a series of goals \nin education, things that we would all agree, jointly, to work on and \naccomplish over the coming 10 years. That was in 1989. That 10 years \nhas come and gone. But one of those goals was that we would ensure that \nat least 90 percent of the students who started high school actually \ncompleted high school; that we would reduce the dropout rate very \nsubstantially in this country. That was one of the goals the President \nand the Governors signed onto.\n  I should say one of those Governors was former President Bill \nClinton. Of course, there were many others who are still in key \npositions in our Government who were part of that group. The \nunfortunate reality is that after we adopted that set of goals, \nnational education goals, there was no strategy to achieve them.\n  There was absolutely nothing done here in Washington and in many \nStates, I fear, to actually get us to where we had committed to travel. \nParticularly in this area of dropout prevention, there was no Federal \nmoney committed. The first Federal money that was committed was a \ndemonstration program in fiscal year 2001. I believe we committed $10 \nmillion to a demonstration program so that for the first time the \nDepartment of Education at the national level would have some funds \navailable to help local school districts reduce the number of students \nwho were leaving school without graduating, and to reduce the number of \nstudents who were dropping out.\n  This is of particular importance in my State because in my State we \nhave a very high dropout rate. Unfortunately for everyone involved, \nthat dropout rate is concentrated in the Hispanic community. Over 40 \npercent of the students in my State are of Hispanic background, and a \ngreat many of those students--particularly young Hispanic males--leave \nschool without graduating from high school. That is not only \nunfortunate for them, but it substantially reduces their ability to be \nproductive citizens, to earn a good income, to raise a family, and to \ndo the things we all aspire to do. But it also is an unfortunate \nreality for our State's economy.\n  We do not have the ability to generate the wealth because we lack \nsome of the skilled workforce we need, and that we could have if we \nkeep those people in school longer.\n  In fiscal year 2001, the Congress stepped forward. This was before \nthe No Child Left Behind Act was enacted. We stepped forward and said, \nOK, we will commit $10 million nationally to try to deal with this \nproblem. That funding can be used to help school districts that have \nstrategies which they want to pursue to reduce the dropout rate. That \nwas an appropriate thing to do. When we had the debate and the hearings \nand the markup on the No Child Left Behind Act, we talked long and hard \nabout this problem of the dropout rate and how to come to grips with \nit. In the final bill, I was very pleased to see the administration \nagreed with the Congress, and that we authorized $125 million a year to \nbe spent to reduce the dropout rate. That bill was signed in January of \n2001. Since then, we have had two budget requests from this President. \nIn both of those budget requests--in 2001, and again this year--in each \nof the budget requests we have received, there has been zero funding \nproposed for dropout prevention. Absolutely nothing was requested for \ndropout prevention at the Federal level. The Congress stepped in last \nyear and corrected some of that. Instead of putting in $10 million, the \nCongress put in $10.9 million. I appreciate that. That was a step the \nCongress took in spite of the fact there was zero funding requested by \nthe administration.\n  This year, there are zero funds requested by the administration for \ndropout prevention. Unfortunately, this year, the bill we are \nconsidering on the Senate floor today follows the administration's \nrecommendation and contains zero funds. The House bill follows the \nadministration's recommendation and contains zero funds.\n  We are going from a situation where we committed $10 million to this \nprogram before we passed the No Child Left Behind Act to a situation \nwhere we are committing zero funds now that we have passed the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. Understandably, people in the education community \ndoubt the sincerity of those of us in Washington who keep talking about \nhow important it is to reduce the dropout rate.\n\n  Why is this dropout rate issue relevant to a discussion, or \nparticularly relevant to a discussion of No Child Left Behind? The main \nthrust of the No Child Left Behind Act was to increase accountability, \nraise standards, require more of teachers, and require more of \nstudents. The great concern which I heard in my State, and which I \nthink lots of us heard, was if we are going to do that--which is a good \nthing because we all favor higher standards, we all favor better \nperformance, we all favor better trained teachers and better performing \nstudents--but if we are going to do that, let us not kid ourselves and \nallow the students who are not keeping up to just go away and forget \nabout it. That is the concern. That is why we also put a provision in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act for some funding for dropout prevention. \nIt is not a major amount. It is $125 million a year. But it was at \nleast a commitment at the Federal level to help deal with the problem. \nIt was a commitment that the Hispanic community--at least leaders of \nthe Hispanic community who focus on education issues in my State, and \nvirtually all the leaders of the Hispanic community in my State who \nfocus on\n\n[[Page S10997]]\n\neducation issues because they understand the importance that education \nholds for their community--all of those leaders would know this was a \npriority and that we would be able to move ahead and begin to deal with \nit systematically.\n  I hope very much we can adopt Senator Reid's amendment so we can add \nsome funding and do something. I am not of the view that we are going \nto add $125 million. Senator Reid's amendment proposes to add $20 \nmillion. That is inadequate, but it certainly is much better than \nnothing, which is what we are now proposing.\n  There are other provisions in Senator Reid's amendment which I think \nare also very meritorious. He indicated in his description of the \namendment funding for the Hispanic-serving institutions. That is \nimportant funding as well. Clearly, I support the effort to add some \nreasonable increase to that. There are 157 Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions which have received money from title V. A third of those \ninstitutions that are eligible have received no assistance. These \ngrants are made on a competitive basis, and there are not enough funds \nto award grants to each of the institutions that meet the criteria.\n  The migrant program: Again, this is an area in which I think the \nFederal Government has a peculiarly important responsibility. You \ncannot expect each local State to have in place the kind of support \nsystem for migrant children of migrant families which is needed.\n  We are requiring in the No Child Left Behind Act that school \ndistricts raise the performance and the achievement level of all \nstudents. That includes those students who are students of migrant \nfamilies who come into that school district for a few months, perhaps, \nand then leave. But the school district is held accountable for the \nperformance of those students, as it should be held accountable for the \nperformance of those students.\n  The number of those students is increasing. It has grown from 624,000 \nin fiscal year 1999 to over 800,000 this year. That growth, combined \nwith the new mandates from this No Child Left Behind Act, will require \nthat additional funding be made available. So I urge all Senators to \nsupport the amendment by my colleague from Nevada.\n  These are important programs. They need to be adequately funded. We \nhave committed to fund these programs at an adequate level and, \nunfortunately, the bill before us does not do that. I hope very much \nthis amendment will be adopted. It is a very modest amendment, frankly, \ncompared to the size of the budget we are dealing with, compared to the \nsize of the appropriations in this bill itself. So I hope this modest \namendment to assist those most in need of educational services in our \ncountry can be supported.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am very pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through you to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the Senator from New Mexico has worked on these issues \nfor many years, and he keeps referring to this as the Reid amendment. \nThis is the Reid-Bingaman amendment. It is offered in that way, and it \nwas meant to be offered in that way because of the work he has done for \nthe many years prior to this.\n  The question I would like to ask the Senator: One of the provisions \nin this amendment calls for more money for afterschool programs for \nHispanic children. Does the Senator from New Mexico have the same \nproblems in New Mexico that we have in Nevada with respect to Hispanic \nchildren dropping out at larger numbers than non-Hispanic children?\n  And would the Senator also agree, for every child we are able to keep \nin school, we save the Government--State, local, and the Federal \nGovernment--money as a result of these children being able to be \neducated rather than being out on the streets, so to speak?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to the question, let me say, \nI do very much agree we have the problem in New Mexico of way too many \nof our students leaving school before they graduate. Unfortunately, a \ndisproportionately large portion of those students who leave school are \nHispanic students.\n  Now, on the second point the Senator raised, that every time one of \nthose students leaves school before he or she graduates, it may, in \nfact--and probably does--cost the Government something in various ways, \nthe main thing that I see it does is it robs the society of the benefit \nof having a better educated citizen and a more productive citizen for \nthe rest of that person's life because each of those people, if they \nwill stay in school and complete high school, has a much greater \nability to earn, a much greater ability to provide for their families. \nAnd all of that, of course, inures to the benefit of the entire \nsociety. They pay more taxes. They are able to contribute more to their \ncommunity.\n  It is a very well-chosen investment of public funds to keep these \nstudents in school. That is all we are trying to do, to say that the \nFederal Government should do something to assist school districts which \nwant to work on that problem. That is all we are saying.\n  The Federal Government cannot take the place of the school district, \nand should not be trying to, but it can, in some small way, assist \nlocal school districts which want to deal with the problem.\n  This last year, with the $10.9 million which was appropriated--this \nis in the current year, I should say--with the $10.9 million that was \nappropriated, my understanding is the Department of Education was able \nto make 24 grants to individual school districts in 19 different States \nto try to help them reduce the dropout rate. Two of those grants went \nto school districts in my home State of New Mexico. These are grants to \nassist those districts which have come up with a plan, a way to reduce \nthe dropout rate, that they want to try to implement in their own \ndistrict.\n  There are some proven strategies that have been shown to work. We \nneed to give school districts more opportunities to implement those \nstrategies. And that would be a major thrust of the amendment the \nSenator from Nevada has proposed. So I again urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I agree with the argument \nmade by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico about the importance \nof school dropout and combating that problem. This is an issue which \nhas concerned me for many years. When I was district attorney of \nPhiladelphia, the dropout problem was a major factor and a major cause \nof juvenile delinquency. When a child is not in school, not only is the \nchild not getting the education, but the child is likely to be engaged \nin not only no productive activity but in counterproductive activity, \nfrequently crime.\n  So this is an issue that I think has to be addressed. I think the \ncommittee has addressed it through the funding which we have made \navailable in this bill, although not on a categorical grant. The \ncategorical grants are where the Government makes a specification as to \nsaying a given amount of money is to be used for a specific purpose.\n  It is true we had a program called the Dropout Prevention Program for \nslightly under $11 million in the current fiscal year. But we have in \nTitle I a requirement that 1 percent of the total funding be allocated \nfor dropout or related activities, and that 1 percent amounts to some \n$80 million. So there is a very considerable sum of money which is \navailable under Title I.\n  There is also a considerable sum of money which can be used for \ndropouts under the $345 million for innovative educational programs. \nWhat we are trying to do is put funding at the local education agency. \nSo in Title I they have a very substantial sum of money--$12.3-plus \nbillion--but not to tell them exactly what to use for each specific \nitem but to leave it to the local school district.\n  When I addressed the amendment of Senator Reid earlier today, I made \na comment about the needs in San Antonio of Hispanics would be \nconsiderably different than the needs of say Russell, KS, my hometown, \na small town of 5,000 on the plains of Kansas, where it is a very \ndifferent issue. And where the Senator has Albuquerque, which has a \nmuch higher Hispanic proportion of population, it would be very \ndifferent.\n\n[[Page S10998]]\n\n  So the thrust of what the subcommittee has done in this bill is to \ntry to provide funding which leaves discretion in the local districts \nto use money for dropouts. When the Senator from New Mexico says that \n$20 million is a start, but inadequate--if I can get his exact \nlanguage--that really is a characterization which might apply to so \nmuch of the funding anywhere in this Education bill. There is always \nmore that can be added. It is hard to find a figure which is generally \nregarded as adequate, education being such a high priority.\n  But in structuring this bill, the Senator from Iowa and I, as \nmanagers, have tried to make the allocations within a budget and within \nour 302(b) allocations. I think we have made an allocation which \naddresses the needs which the Senator from New Mexico expresses. The \nSenator from New Mexico said $20 million was inadequate but better than \nnothing. Well, that characterization, I think, might be applied just \nabout anywhere in this bill or in so many other bills.\n  When the Senator from New Mexico talks about the afterschool \nprograms, that is an item of special concern to this Senator as well. \nAgain, during that lull between 3 o'clock and 7 o'clock, we find so \nmuch delinquency occurring. The subcommittee increased the allocation \non afterschool programs to $1 billion. The figure that had been in the \nPresident's budget was $600 million. We had extensive hearings.\n  It might be of some interest that Arnold Schwarzenegger had a \nlongstanding interest in this and he made a very compelling argument. I \ndon't want to get involved in the California primary, but there was a \nvery protracted hearing devoted to this subject.\n  We took the figure of $600 million, which was in the President's \nbudget, and I don't have to tell the Senator from New Mexico that \nfinding $400 million over and above what the President asked for was \nvery difficult. We recognize the things we agree on--afterschool \nprograms and dropout. I believe we have made an appropriate allocation \nof funds. It is true that $210 million is modest when you are looking \nat a $53 billion education budget. But we have tried to make \nallocations on many, many lines--for student loans, Pell grants, and \nmany other items. I think we have taken into account the concerns the \nSenator from New Mexico has articulated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and assure him \nthat I appreciate his commitment to trying to do what is right in this \narea. I know he has been substantially supportive on a lot of these \nefforts over many years. I very much appreciate that.\n  Let me try to be clear as to my understanding, and he can correct me \nif I am wrong. He has indicated that, yes, there is no money for the \nprogram that we authorized for dropout prevention--the $125 million per \nyear authorization; there are zero funds in there for that. Although \nthere was nearly $11 million in the current year funding, there is \nnothing in this upcoming year.\n  He has indicated that there are a couple of other places where school \ndistricts can use funds for this purpose if they choose to. One is that \nthey can spend up to 1 percent--or they are required to spend 1 percent \non either failing schools or dropout prevention, as I understand it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The 1 percent is for dropout, and the term used is \nrelated activities. So it is focused on dropouts. Some $80 million is \navailable for dropouts.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not doubt that there is funding \navailable for this if a school district can find it within its budget \nto use it for that purpose. The problem we have in my State--and I \nthink all over the country--is that these school districts are under \ngreater and greater pressure to increase their test scores, to \ndemonstrate improved student performance. That is where the pressure \nis. That is where the money is going to be spent, unless we have some \nfunds cordoned off that are available only for this kind of purpose--\nthis dropout prevention.\n  Clearly, everyone is well-intentioned here. A school superintendent \nor a school board will decide, OK, we have a lot of needs but the \npressure we are feeling is to get these test scores up; we have to \nconcentrate on getting these test scores up. Once that is done, a few \nyears down the road we will be able to give more attention to the kids \nwho are dropping out.\n  In the No Child Left Behind Act, we tried to say, no, we are going to \ncordon off some portion of the Federal funding that can only be used \nfor this purpose. That doesn't mean every school district has to take \nthat money or even has that need. If Russell, KS, doesn't have a \ndropout problem, they don't need to apply for one of these grants. A \nlot of communities in New Mexico have that problem and would love to be \nable to get one of these grants so they can deal with that problem. If \nit is left to them to take some of the funds they get under title I, or \nsome other basket of funding, and devote it to that purpose alone, it \nis much less likely to happen.\n  So that is why we made provisions for dropout prevention as a part of \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. That is why this Senate and this Congress \nwere persuaded to add nearly $11 million to that line item last year \nand in the current year, even though the President requested nothing. I \nthink the least we can do is do something similar in this Congress--\nperhaps $20 million is the right figure--to ensure that this program at \nthe Department of Education level, the Federal level, does not just die \nat the very time we are going around giving speeches about what a great \nthing No Child Left Behind was. That seems to me contrary to logic, and \nit is also contrary to what we told the American people we were about.\n  I see the manager wishes to speak again. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I understood the comment of the \nSenator from New Mexico, it was that the money would be available in \ntitle I if the local school board wanted to use it for dropout. That \nisn't precisely the statutory construction. The Department of \nEducation, in delineating its 2004 budget request, specifies that \nStates would reserve approximately $88 million from their allocations \nthat are title I, part A, to support dropout prevention programs in \nlocal education agencies. So the figure, more precisely, according to \ntheir budget request, is $88 million. It is to be directed to the \ndropout program.\n  So that is money for this specific program. That is why the \nadministration, in submitting the budget request, did not include the \nslightly under $11 million for a categorical grant because it is taken \ncare of in other places. The Department of Education budget request \nalso specifies the dropout funding availability innovative programs, \nwhich I mentioned earlier, of some $345 million. In the innovative \nprograms for $345 million, there is not a direction for dropouts, as \nthere is a direction for dropouts for $88 million under title I.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. My understanding is that this funding--in reference to \nstudents who have dropped out--contemplates what many States are doing, \nwhich is to use some of their title I funds for students who are in the \ncriminal justice system. This is not dropout prevention; this is taking \nstudents who have dropped out. Maybe they have dropped out because they \nhave been thrown in jail, but whatever the reason, they are no longer \nin the school system.\n  My understanding was that essentially the administration was saying \nyou are required to use at least 1 percent of the title I funds that we \nprovide to you to deal with these students who have left the system and \nare in the criminal justice system primarily. That is what States are \ndoing.\n  What we were trying to do in the provision I am arguing for and \nSenator Reid is arguing for here in the No Child Left Behind Act is to \nget ahead of the problem and say we don't want these students leaving \nthe school system. We want to help the school district to keep those \nstudents in school.\n  That is what we wanted to see funds devoted to, dropout prevention \nrather than assisting students who had already left the school system. \nAm I confused about that? Let me ask that question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be glad to respond to the question, which was in \nthe\n\n[[Page S10999]]\n\nnature of a debate, but I understand our processes here. I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, these funds are not for students \nwho have left the education program and entered the criminal justice \nsystem. There are other funds for people who are out of the education \nsystem and in the criminal justice system.\n  These funds specifically are directed to dropout prevention programs. \nThat is the language which is included in the budget request for the \nDepartment of Education which supports their request for $13 billion \nplus for title I and has the requirement for 1 percent, and the \nlanguage prevention programs is specifically here. They are using these \nfunds, as the Senator from New Mexico appropriately says, to get ahead \nof the program.\n  The long and short of it is that these are funds to prevent dropouts.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. May I ask one additional question, Mr. President?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Sure.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The chairman of the subcommittee has indicated that \nthese are funds which, in the request from the Department of Education, \nare to be allocated for this purpose. Is there language in the bill \nbefore us which specifies that a portion, some percent, is to be used \nfor dropout prevention? I am just not aware of that. If there is \nlanguage to that effect, I have not seen it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The bill does not duplicate the requirements which have \nbeen set forward in the budget request. We could put in additional \nlanguage. If the Senator would like to have that language, I would \ncertainly consider that, but I think it would be duplicative and \nunnecessary. Under existing law, under title I, the 1-percent \nrequirement is present for dropout prevention. That is the law.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will review this language and then \nperhaps be in a position to discuss further with the chairman what the \nlanguage of the bill ought to provide to ensure that funds can be made \navailable in grants to school districts in a way that they would \nactually use them for this purpose.\n  My concern is, the way the bill now stands, I do not see the \nopportunity being there for school districts to pursue these \nstrategies. For that reason, I would like to review it a little further \nand then get back in touch with the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will be delighted to work with the \nSenator from New Mexico to provide whatever assurances he would like, \nadditional assurances, that the $88 million will be for dropout \nprevention. That is the law, but, again, I will be glad to work with my \ndistinguished colleague to satisfy the concerns he has raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the two Senators have been discussing \nthis amendment, we should not be diverted from the fact that this \namendment is related to specific programs that help Hispanic children \nin America today. Dropout prevention, of course, is one of those \nprograms. We cannot lose the goal we are attempting to accomplish in \nthis amendment, and that is that we help people, and there are various \nprograms I discussed earlier today that are set forth in detail in the \namendment before the Senate. There is nothing more important than the \ndropout prevention program, but there are programs that are just as \nimportant to which this amendment is directed.\n  We are talking about, of the tens of billions of dollars in Federal \nprograms that go to education, $200 million that will be directed to \nspecific programs that will save our country huge amounts of money. It \nis estimated by some groups that for every dollar we spend in these \nprograms which are the subject matter of this amendment, the Government \nwill save up to $10.\n  I appreciate the discussion that has been held this morning between \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from New Mexico dealing \nwith dropouts, but this amendment deals with far more than just that \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of brief recapitulation, the \nthrust of the amendment by the Senator from Nevada on Hispanics I think \nhas been covered by the enumeration of programs I outlined earlier \nduring the course of this debate. There are very substantial funds \navailable in the bill, as it stands now, which can provide assistance \nfor Hispanics.\n  I concur with the Senator from Nevada that this is an important item, \nbut I do believe the Education appropriations accommodate this very key \ninterest for the specified reasons given earlier in the course of this \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada for his sponsorship of this \namendment. There has been some discussion already about the importance \nthat we as a country need to put on the extraordinary challenges we \nface with regard to the education of Hispanic children.\n  The number of school-age Hispanic children has actually grown by 61 \npercent in the last 2 years, a rate faster than any other American \ncommunity. One out of every 6 children who attends public school today \nis Hispanic.\n  Hispanic children continue to perform below their non-Hispanic peers \nin reading, math, and science. By age 9, more than one-third of Latino \nstudents in high school are enrolled at below grade level today. \nHispanic youths suffer from the highest dropout rate of any group. \nHispanics over the age of 16 are more than twice as likely to drop out \nof school as African American students and four times as likely to drop \nout today as white students.\n  In the Nation's 17 largest Hispanic-serving school districts, \nHispanics lag behind white students in reading achievement by an \naverage of 30 points and in math achievement by an average of 27 \npoints. Yet the bill before us cuts $21 million in bilingual education, \n$11 million in dropout prevention programs, $10 million in high school \nmigrant education, and $15 million in college migrant education.\n  What Senator Reid has done is simply propose to reverse these \nproposed cuts and enhance English instruction for non-native speakers, \ndropout prevention, and migrant education funding.\n  This really sets the tone for a series of amendments that I know my \ncolleagues will be offering over the course of the next several days. \nIt is important for us as a country to make the investment in education \nperhaps more than in any other endeavor in Government. If we empower \nour youth--Hispanic, African American, Asian American, Native American, \nin addition to European American--we give them the opportunity to be \nthe productive, capable, and contributing citizens we know they can be.\n  It is so much easier to build a child than to repair an adult. We are \ntalking about building children. The only way we are going to build \nthose children is to give them opportunities in education by funding \nthese programs at a level that will allow us to meet the expectations \nand, I would say, the obligations our country holds today.\n  This is a very good amendment, and I hope the Senate will support it \non a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with much of what the Democratic \nleader has said about the importance of education. In fact, I agree \nwith all of what he has said about the importance of education. But \nagain, for the reasons which have been advanced during the course of \nthis debate yesterday and today and on this amendment specifically, I \nbelieve we have accommodated a good balance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Reid-\nBingaman amendment which addresses Hispanic educational opportunities. \nThis is an extremely important measure.\n  Over the August recess, I had the opportunity to put together a \nsummit of Hispanic elected officials, families, interested people, in \nmy home State. There was an overwhelming turnout that day. We had \neveryone from elected officials to people who are active in the \ncommunity or members of the Hispanic community who just wanted to come \nand find out what we were doing at the Federal level on issues that \naffected them. The No. 1 issue people talked\n\n[[Page S11000]]\n\nabout that day was education and opportunity for the young Hispanic \nstudents in our schools, in their communities, and across the country.\n  I was astounded to listen to leaders in the community, elected school \nboard members, city council members, who told me that when they were \ngrowing up, very few people, if any people, looked at them and said: \nYou can be a success. You can pass first grade--many of them had \nflunked first grade. You can go on to college. You can become something \nin this country.\n  I think it is so important that this amendment pass so we can put the \neducation in place that says to these young students in our country \ntoday that we need them, we need them to be the next generation of \nengineers; we need them to be the next generation of teachers; we need \nthem to be the next generation of CEOs. We are missing out on an entire \nyoung population and what they can give back to this country someday in \nleadership, in economics, in paying taxes, in being viable members of \nthis community, if we do not fund opportunities for them today.\n\n  So I am very proud to be a sponsor of the Reid-Bingaman amendment and \nI encourage my colleagues to support it. It is really critical.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to talk about the Byrd amendment that was \noffered yesterday. As we all know, children across the country this \nweek are returning to school. We in the Senate now have a choice to \nmake that will determine whether they are successful in school and, \nultimately, in life. The choice is, really, will our country's most \nvulnerable children get the education they need? When we vote on the \nByrd amendment, that is really what we are going to be voting on: Are \nwe going to help low-income children succeed in school or are we going \nto leave them behind?\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership on this amendment and on so \nmany other important debates. This particular fight is one that will \nimpact many children across the country. I am not talking about a few \nkids in a few classrooms. I am not talking about kids who are well off. \nI am talking about millions of children who are growing up in poverty \ntoday. These are kids who are in the most danger of falling behind \nright now, and they are the kids who most need our help.\n  Today, it is estimated that there are 9 million needy children in \nAmerica. For many of them--in fact, for all of them--education is the \nonly way out of the poverty they see before them. Often these children \nneed extra help before and after school. They might need tutoring or \nmentoring or one-on-one attention from somebody who cares, from \nsomebody who looks at them and says: You can be somebody; you can \nsucceed in school; you can go on and be a success in this country. That \nkind of tutoring and mentoring and one-on-one attention needs to come \nfrom somebody they see in their everyday lives, and that is why this \namendment is so important.\n  Fortunately, in this country today we try to provide that one-on-one \nhelp with a program called title I. That is a program that targets \nfunding directly to disadvantaged children and to low-income schools, \nand it makes such a critical difference for so many of our vulnerable \nchildren today.\n  Unfortunately, this year, once again, the President has offered a \nbudget that falls exceedingly short of what these kids need. The budget \nthat has been proposed by the President and is now before the Senate \nwould serve only 4.1 of those 9 million needy students in our country. \nThat means we are helping fewer than half of those kids who need help \nin this country today. I think we can do better. I think we must do \nbetter, and the Byrd amendment provides $6.15 billion in additional \nfunding for title I.\n  Let me help put that number into context for everyone. The Byrd \namendment is going to help 6.2 million children. That is a huge \nimprovement over the President's plan. If we just go with the \nPresident's budget, 2.1 million disadvantaged kids are going to be left \nbehind. So I ask all of my colleagues, how do we leave behind 2 million \nchildren in this country? Do they not deserve a road out of poverty? Do \nthey not deserve an education that will help them rise above tough \ncircumstances? Of course they do. These kids will get the support they \nneed if we pass the Byrd amendment.\n\n  The Byrd amendment is not asking us to do something new or \nextraordinary. It is asking us to do what Congress and this President \nsaid they would do nearly 2 years ago when we passed the No Child Left \nBehind Act.\n  That education act was passed on two related ideas, two promises: \nFirst, that we would hold schools accountable for their progress; \nsecondly, we promised we would provide schools with the resources to \nmeet those new requirements we were putting in place.\n  Both accountability and funding are needed to make progress. Since \nthat act was passed 2 years ago, the second part of that promise has \nsimply been abandoned.\n  I have been across my State, as I know all Senators have over the \nAugust recess, and I have talked with educators and visited classrooms. \nIt is really clear that schools need help meeting these requirements. I \nthink it is important to not forget that our States today, in this \neconomy, are in no position to provide the extra funding that Congress \npromised but has not delivered. Most of our States, including mine, are \nfacing huge deficits and are cutting back on education and other \npriorities. So it is clear that the Federal Government needs to step in \nand provide this funding for our most vulnerable kids.It is not \nsomething new. It is something we said 2 years ago we would do.\n  I should also point out that this debate in the Senate is taking \nplace as many schools are now getting the results of their State tests. \nIn Washington State, a number of schools have been labeled as failing \nbecause of these test results. These schools need the resources now to \nimprove. They want to improve. They want to be held to high standards. \nThey want to meet the accountability standards we have put in place, \nbut they cannot do it with the resources that have been provided.\n  Before I conclude, I commend Senator Byrd for the way he has chosen \nto fund this amendment. The Byrd amendment uses the exact same funding \nmethod that our Republican colleagues have used to fund their \npriorities. So if anyone criticizes the Byrd amendment, I do not see \nhow they could argue against the funding source because it is exactly \nwhat has been done already.\n  With no real challenge on the funding size, that leaves us to debate \nthe substance of this amendment. I do not see how anyone could vote to \nprevent millions of low-income children from getting the help they need \nin school.\n  So let me make the choice before us as simple as possible. A vote \nagainst the Byrd amendment is a vote to leave 2 million poor kids \nbehind. A vote for the Byrd amendment will help those 2 million poor \nkids get a great education and lift them out of poverty. So I urge my \ncolleagues to hear the voices of more than 2 million children who are \ndepending on us as their lives hang in the balance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of reply, the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Nevada as to Hispanic students is adequately covered \nin other specific programs.\n  For the reasons which I have specified earlier in the course of this \ndebate, and the issue raised by Senator Byrd, seeking to move the \nfunding for title I to the fully authorized amount, is \ncharacteristically not a matter of the appropriations process to meet \nthe full authorization.\n  Yesterday, in response to the Senator from West Virginia, I had \nreferenced the appropriations bill for the year 2002 when Senator Byrd \nchaired the Appropriations Committee and the appropriated amounts were \nless than the authorized amount. In title I, the authorization was \n$13.5 billion. The appropriation was $10.35 billion, $2.850 billion \nunder. Similarly, the appropriation for improving teacher quality \neducation was $325 million under the authorized amount and the century \ncommunity learning centers was $250 million under the authorized \namount.\n  In the analysis as to the increases requested by President Bush, on \nthe 3 years of his budget request, increases have been made from $40 \nbillion to some $53 billion for a 33-percent increase. That contrasts \nvery fairly with the 3 years of President Clinton's budget increases \nfor fiscal years 1996, 1997,\n\n[[Page S11001]]\n\nand 1998 which went up from $26 billion to $32.5 billion or 23 percent. \nPicking a higher sequence, the budget requests for 1999, 2000, and 2001 \nwent from slightly under $30 billion to slightly over $40 billion, here \n33 percent.\n  I believe on the record it is demonstrable that the support in the \nbudget increases requested by President Bush have been at least as good \nas or better than the years of President Clinton and no one ever said \nthat President Clinton had shortchanged the education budget. Similar \ncredit is due to President Bush that his budget requests have not \nshortchanged the education budget.\n  To repeat what I said yesterday, my preference would have been to \nhave had a larger allocation for this subcommittee. I would like to \nhave had more money. I would like to have seen more funds in title I, \nbut on the allocation which this body passed, the Congress passed on \nthe budget resolution, the allocations which we have received on the \nso-called 302(b) allocations, an appropriate appropriation has been \nmade in these accounts.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to come to the floor. We will be voting \non the Reid amendment at noon. The plan is to vote on the Byrd \namendment shortly after we reconvene from the policy luncheons. It is \nour hope Senators will come to offer amendments and advise us where \nthey stand on the amendments. More than 40 amendments have been listed \nfor possible argument. If we are to complete this bill in a timely \nmanner, again, it is necessary for Senators to come to the floor to \noffer their amendments with the intent, at least of the managers, this \nmanager, to proceed to third reading and not to sustain long-term, \nlong-range time-consuming unproductive quorum calls.\n  In the absence of any Senator on the floor seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment we will vote on at 12 noon \nthat has been offered by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nNew Mexico has the support of many groups around America. I will \nmention just a few: National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, National \nCouncil of La Raza, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC, Migrant Legal Action \nProgram, National Association for Bilingual Education, National \nAssociation of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, National \nAssociation of State Directors of Migrant Education, National Migrant \nand Seasonal Head Start Association, National Puerto Rican Coalition, \nInc., National HEP-CAMP Association, ASPIRA Association, Inc.\n  These are just a few of the groups. I would say when this matter is \nvoted on at 12 noon today, there are no excuses. In effect, what has \nhappened is the President has recommended these programs to be \neliminated in general, dropout programs specifically. This is the \nopportunity for the Senate to speak that this is wrong. This is the \nopportunity for the Senate to recognize that there are programs that \nare important to the safety and salvation and security of this country \nother than those addressing things that explode.\n  One of the things that is important to protect the security of this \nNation is an educated population. That means educating all young \npeople, no matter their background, their ethnicity, their religion, \nwhere they come from, because it is better for us all when that occurs.\n  We will shortly begin the final 15 minutes of debate on this matter, \nand I ask that everyone realize that there are groups who believe this \namendment is important. They believe it is important because their sole \nfunction is to protect children. This amendment will help children.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are now in the \ntime where there will be 15 minutes equally divided for the proponents \nand opponents of this amendment; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I would reserve the final 3 minutes, in that we are the \nmovers of this amendment, for Senator Bingaman. That would be 3 minutes \nbefore the hour that Senator Bingaman have the final 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. When my time is up, which would be in 4\\1/2\\ minutes, would \nthe Chair so advise me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, some of my distinguished colleagues have \nasked whether we can afford to give this helping hand to a select group \nof students, namely Hispanic students. I say we cannot afford to ignore \nthem. Take, for example, Clark County, which is in Las Vegas, in \nNevada. In the Clark County School District, which is the fifth or \nsixth largest school district in America with more than a quarter of a \nmillion students, about 30 percent of the students are Latinos. This \namendment would apply to those students. We need to give a helping hand \nto the Clark County School District through additional moneys.\n  It is unfair that the President of the United States has recommended \neliminating the dropout prevention program for Hispanic students--\neliminated it. He has cut other programs to which this amendment \napplies. It is simply not right. People in Nevada will suffer as a \nresult of that.\n  Latino children have the highest dropout rate of any ethnic group in \nAmerica. It is nothing they are proud of; it is something they are \ntrying to work on. Hispanic leaders talk about education. For the Latin \nChamber of Commerce in Las Vegas, and it is a huge organization, that \nis their No. 1 priority: What are we going to do to keep our children \nin school? They have a scholarship program to send kids to a community \ncollege, to our colleges in Nevada. It is working well. But we need to \ndo something to help the public school system keep these children in \nschool.\n  We know for every dollar spent on preventing dropouts, we save more \nthan $9 in the future. Today, one in every three new workers in our \nlabor force is Hispanic. In 20 years, half of our new workers will be \nHispanic. That means the money to pay for Social Security in the \nfuture, and our national security in the future, will come from \nHispanic workers who are starting in school today. If we shortchange \nthese children, we shortchange ourselves and our children in the \nfuture. But if we invest in these children, we invest in our future.\n  This amendment, offered by Senator Bingaman and this Senator, would \nprovide a helping hand to Hispanic children by investing an additional \n$210 million in Head Start, dropout prevention, bilingual education, \ncollege assistance for children, and other programs. The fact is, there \nis an unacceptable gap in academic achievement between Latino students \nand the overall student population. We have made a promise to all \nchildren in America that we will leave no child behind. It is time to \nlive up to those words.\n  I spoke today about this being more than statistics and numbers, more \nthan cuts and percentages of cuts, but of programs that actually help \nchildren. I, today, spoke about Maria de Lurdes Reynoso, who is a \nbetter person today as a result of these programs. I spoke about \nanother young person by the name of Oscar Guzman, who is now in a \nprogram so that he is going to graduate from college. That is what this \nis all about--helping children.\n  Tedrel Eubanks of Mississippi Valley State University--one of these \nprograms allowed her to get a high school diploma and then go to \ncollege, something her family never dreamed that any one of them could \ndo.\n  We have learned this morning from actual cases about one child in the \nfamily is not only making a tremendous impression on his siblings but \non all of his cousins.\n  For every dollar spent here, we save our country $10. We are talking \nabout spending $200 million and saving the country $2 billion. My math \nmay be a\n\n[[Page S11002]]\n\nlittle bit wrong there, but you get the point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Reid-Bingaman amendment would provide \nan additional $210 million for Hispanic education. I am pleased to \nsupport it.\n  Since 1990, the number of school age Hispanic children has grown by \n61 percent. This means that one out of every six children who attends \npublic school is Hispanic. Yet, only about 60 percent of them graduate \nfrom high school. Hispanics over the age of 16 are more than twice as \nlikely to drop out of school than African-American students and four \ntimes more likely to drop out of school than white students. In the \nNation's l17 largest Hispanic-serving school districts, Hispanics lag \nbehind white students in reading achievement by an average of 30 points \nand math achievement by an average of 27 points. And according to the \n2000 census, only 8.5 percent of Hispanics between the ages of 25 and \n34 had earned a bachelor's degree.\n  These statistics are troubling, and we need to address them. After \nall, education gives individuals the tools that they need to succeed. \nBut education programs are underfunded, and the bill before us cuts $21 \nmillion from bilingual education, $11 million from dropout prevention \nprograms, $10 million from high school migrant education, and $15 \nmillion from college migrant education.\n  The Reid-Bingaman amendment would reverse these proposed cuts and \nwould increase funding for English instruction for non-native speakers, \ndropout prevention, and migrant education.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this very essential and worthwhile \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of the bill isn't here. I have \nasked unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman be recognized for the \nlast 3 minutes. No one is here for the majority to respond, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time run against the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished manager of the bill and \nothers need additional time, I will be happy to agree to that. I just \nwant to make sure there is no time wasted.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum under the previous condition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time is reserved for me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me use my 3 minutes to make the \npoint that this is a very important amendment which the Senator from \nNevada put forward to provide some additional funding for the programs \nthat are most important in assisting Hispanic students and school \ndistricts that are serving Hispanic students around our country.\n  I believe very strongly that we need to adopt this amendment. One of \nthe key provisions in it, which I spoke about earlier this morning, \nwould add $20 million for dropout prevention. That is $20 million out \nof the $125 million that is authorized in the No Child Left Behind Act. \nThe President asked for zero funds for that dropout prevention \ninitiative.\n  I believe we in Congress should add something in the current year. We \nare providing nearly $11 million. I believe this amendment would allow \nus to provide at least $20 million, which is a start and which is a \nhelp. I hope very much it will be adopted.\n  In my home State, the Farmington public schools received a grant \nunder the funding this last year for dropout prevention. It is funding \nthey are using to assist students through individualized school reentry \nsupport activities, an alternative for remediation, transition-based \nlife skills and career awareness, adult advisory and intensive \nmentoring services. They are working with these individual students who \nare at risk of dropping out.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee, \nsaid, Well, there are already funds in the bill that can be used for \nthese purposes. The funds he is referring to are funds which are \nallocated on the basis of the percentage of children and youth residing \nin locally operated correctional facilities. This is funding which is \nused by school districts to deal with this element that winds up in \ncorrectional facilities or are at risk of winding up in correctional \nfacilities.\n  What I am advocating, and what I think the Senator from Nevada is \nadvocating, is that we get out ahead of the problem and assist students \nwho are at risk of leaving school. We try to help school districts keep \nthose students in school and not wait until they get involved with the \ncorrectional system. We do not think it should be simply said, OK, if a \nkid gets thrown in jail or gets in trouble with the Department of \nJustice or the judicial system, then we will come to assist in some \nrespects.\n  This is a very meritorious amendment. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport the Reid amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I raise a point of order under section 504 \nof the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 that \nthe amendment exceeds discretionary spending limits specified in this \nsection and is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, pursuant to the Budget Act, I move to \nwaive the applicable sections of that act for purposes of the pending \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I know the hour is 12:30 and we will recess for the weekly \ncaucuses. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, be recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n               united nations security council resolution\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this morning's newspapers brought the \nwelcome news that the administration is finally waking up to the need \nto seek greater international support for and participation in our \nstabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq by seeking a new U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution. There has been a tragically long overdue \nrecognition of the importance of doing so.\n  While this welcome news was attributed to an unnamed administration \nspokesman, hopefully some named spokesman will soon confirm it. The \ndelay in arriving at this new approach, along with too much lone-\nranger, bring-them-on rhetoric, will make the effort to \ninternationalize the situation in Iraq more difficult and perhaps more \ncostly in terms of the conditions exacted by the international \ncommunity for its participation.\n  The word games that have been played by administration officials who \nhave stated that they would ``welcome'' the participation of troops of \nother nations but refused to request that participation have also not \nbeen helpful.\n  While the need to internationalize this effort and obtain a U.N. \nmandate has been apparent to many of us from the beginning, the recent \nreport of the Congressional Budget Office, requested by Senator Byrd, \nconcerning the difficulty of sustaining a large U.S. military force in \nIraq reinforces the need to reach out to the U.N. for support in this \neffort. There will not and should not be any need to compromise with \nrespect to command and control of U.S. troops. There is ample precedent \nfor the nation that provides the bulk of military forces to provide the \nsenior military commander and for the senior military commander to \nexercise overall command of all the troops participating in a U.N.-\nmandated mission.\n\n  A recent example of that approach was the case of East Timor, where \nAustralia led a coalition of the willing pursuant to a U.N. resolution \nand provided the senior military commander for the operation. Once \ncircumstances permitted it, the Australians turned over control to a \nU.N. blue helmeted peacekeeping force. The first gulf war was an \nearlier example where one nation, the United States, led a coalition of \nthe willing with U.N. sanction. There will, however, be a need for \ncompromise with respect to the control of civilian reconstruction and \npolitical development of Iraq. We should be willing to agree to a \nreasonable sharing of decisionmaking with respect to the physical and \npolitical reconstruction of Iraq. If we are willing to do so, Germany \nand Russia will proudly go along and France would then have little \nchoice, I believe, but to go along as well.\n  Statements by administration officials, when we went to the U.N. \nbefore the war, which denigrated the importance of U.N. support and the \nwork of U.N. inspectors, were counterproductive to acquiring U.N. \nbacking at that time. We must avoid a repetition of that attitude. \nGiven the pressures that have been brought to bear that were necessary \nto get the administration to seek support from the international \ncommunity, I am afraid it will be necessary to keep the pressure on the \nadministration to make the appropriate compromises to work out a new \nU.N. resolution.\n  Yesterday, three more U.S. soldiers lost their lives in Iraq, two due \nto hostile action and one in an accident. While internationalizing the \neffort in Iraq will not prevent all loss of life in the future, it \nshould help to reduce the risks and ease the burdens on U.S. forces and \nwill help convince Iraqis of international backing and support for our \nmilitary presence there, and hopefully will increase the sharing of \nintelligence that is so critical to stopping terrorists in other \nattacks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11003-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we just completed a very important vote \nprior to the break. Senator Bingaman and I offered an amendment to \nincrease funding for programs relating to Hispanic children. There was \na point of order raised and that amendment was defeated.\n  I understand that. But I have trouble understanding a communication \nreleased today from the White House. On this very day we were voting on \nimportant issues relating to Hispanic children in America, they \nreleased this communication that talks about an historic partnership to \nimprove educational opportunity for Hispanic children. This is nothing \nbut fluff, big piles of fluff.\n  When it comes to putting the programs where their mouth is, nothing \never happens. We had an opportunity this morning to vote to help \nHispanic children, and what do we get from the White House? We get a \npress release talking about an opportunity to sit down and talk. Here \nis the statement: The partners will work with local communities to \nreinforce positive expectations.\n  The positive expectations were the programs that have been cut and \neliminated by this White House.\n  I hope the American public sees what is happening. What we have from \nthe White House is nothing but piles of paper, nothing to help the \nchildren about whom I spoke earlier today, including Ted Eubanks, \nMississippi Valley State University, or Maria de Lurdes Reynoso, who \ntalked about programs that changed her life, or Oscar Guzman, who talks \nabout programs that have given his family dignity as the first person \nin his family to attend college.\n  I repeat for the third time in these few minutes, I am willing to \nunderstand the defeat that has just occurred where, with rare \nexceptions, the majority voted against the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico and me to help Hispanic children. I understand \nthat. However, to have the hypocrisy, the same day, issuing this \nrelease, ``Historic partnership to improve education for Hispanic \nAmericans,'' is absolutely ridiculous.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1552 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to join with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to introduce a bipartisan amendment to increase \nthe funding for nursing programs. I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will the report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), for herself, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n     Corzine, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered No. 1552 to amendment No. \n     1542.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for programs under the Nurse Reinvestment \n         Act and other nursing workforce development programs)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for programs and activities under the Nurse \n     Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) and for other nursing \n     workforce development programs under title VIII of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296 et seq.), there are \n     appropriated an additional $63,000,000 for such programs and \n     activities: Provided, That of the funds appropriated in this \n     Act for the National Institutes of Health, $80,000,000 shall \n     not be available for obligation until September 30, 2004: \n     Provided further, That the amount $6,895,199,000 in section \n     305(a)(1) of this Act shall be deemed to be $6,958,199,000: \n     Provided further, That the amount $6,783,301,000 in section \n     305(a)(2) of this Act shall be deemed to be $6,720,301,000.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to offer this amendment so that \nwe can really get behind our nurses in this country and deal with the \ncritical nursing shortage facing acute care facilities and other \nimportant facilities that need nurses. This is a bipartisan amendment \nto the Specter substitute amendment. I am joining with Senator Collins \nto offer this amendment, along with the other cosponsors.\n  Let me tell you what this amendment would do. It would provide $63 \nmillion to fund programs that recruit and retain nurses by helping them \npay for becoming nurses. This was created by last year's bipartisan \neffort to pass something called the Nurse Reinvestment Act and also \nother important programs to educate nurses. The Nurse Reinvestment Act \nwas an important bipartisan accomplishment in which we came together \nacross party lines to deal with the nursing shortage. This is a crisis \nthat affects patient care across the country.\n  So, what did we do? We created scholarship programs and we created \nloan forgiveness programs to bring more nurses into the profession. But \nwhile the legislation, the Nurse Reinvestment Act, created the \nauthorizing framework, it did not put money in the Federal checkbook. \nThat is our job in appropriations. We salute Senator Harkin and Senator \nSpecter for trying to fund this, but they are funding it at $15 \nmillion. You cannot keep nurses, you cannot get nurses, and you cannot \neducate nurses to be nursing faculty on $15 million. We need more \nmoney. Where there is the wallet, there is a will on the part of many \nwomen and men who want to come into nursing.\n  We are in a crisis. There are 125,000 nurse vacancies in hospitals \nnationwide. This does not even deal with nursing homes, home health \nagencies, schools, and other sites.\n  The Senator from Maine and I have been champions of home health care. \nShe has the rugged terrain of Maine and I have the mountain counties of \nMaryland, where we know our nurses get on snowmobiles to get out there \nto visit patients who need them. There are just not enough of them, and \nwe need to make sure we deal with this. In my home State of Maryland, \nthere is now a 13 percent hospital nursing shortage; 2,000 full-time \nnurses are desperately needed, not only in the bustling metropolitan \narea of the Baltimore-Washington corridor but in our rural communities. \nThe nursing shortage will only get worse and we expect it will double \nby 2010, to 275,000 nurses.\n  While we have people who want to come into nursing, we have a nursing \nfaculty shortage because nurses have so much student debt that they \nreally do not have the wherewithal to go on to the master's and \ndoctoral levels to do this.\n  I note the Senator acting as the Presiding Officer, Madam President, \nis from North Carolina. She knows we have the wonderful urban areas of \nRaleigh and Duke University, but I have talked to her about going out \nto those rural communities. They just do not have what they need in the \nway of nurses. Yet we teamed up to make sure they could use the \ncommunity college programs to get people into nursing and to stay in \nthose communities. What we are talking about is helping people who will \ncome into nursing. We will provide either scholarships or loan \nincentives if they will come into those critical shortage areas. Isn't \nthis terrific?\n  What we know is many young women and even young men are coming into \nnursing later in life and they have other responsibilities. This is why \nwe need to help them by making nursing education more affordable, \nproviding scholarships in exchange for 2 years, and also financial \nassistance to obtain advanced degrees in order to be able to get our \npeople ready for nursing education. Our amendment funds other important \nnursing programs to educate and train advanced-education nurses, such \nas nurse practitioners, and also in other areas.\n\n  Our chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee faced a very \ntight allocation. They did a fantastic job. What we need to do, though, \nis get the Senate behind them and increase the funding for these \nnursing education programs. We have all of the nursing groups behind \nus. We have groups such as the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, \nthe Men's Health Network, the Federation of American Hospitals, and \nAARP. Why? Because we know behind every great doctor there is an \noutstanding nurse.\n  We need it for patient care. Where there is a nursing shortage, there \nis going to be an impact on patient care. Our patients need it. The \nbaby boomers are getting older. The need for nurses is only going to \nexpand, and certainly by making a public investment to make nursing \neducation more available and more affordable, we are helping not only \nto educate the nurse but I believe we are making an investment in \nsaving lives, in preventive health care, and home health care.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in supporting this amendment and I \nyield the floor so others may speak about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am very pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague from Maryland in offering this important amendment to the \nappropriations bill. Senator Mikulski and I have teamed up on many \nhealth care issues, ranging from home health care, ensuring adequate \nreimbursements to diabetes research, to helping draft the Nurse \nReinvestment Act as members of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee.\n  Today we team up once again to increase the funding for the Nurse \nReinvestment Act and other nursing workforce development programs by \n$63 million. I join my colleague from Maryland in saluting the efforts \nof Senator Specter and Senator Harkin in providing some significant \nfunding for nursing education programs. Our amendment, however, would \nbring the total level of funding for these vital programs up to $175 \nmillion in fiscal year 2004. That is not up to the full authorized \nlevel, but it is an amount that we believe would allow us to make real \nprogress in remedying the extreme nursing shortage facing our Nation.\n  In fact, the United States is facing a nursing shortage of critical \nproportions. Moreover, this shortage is only expected to worsen as the \nbaby boom generation ages and their need--our need--for health care \ngrows. According to the American Hospital Association, there currently \nare more than 126,000 nursing vacancies in hospitals alone. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services estimates that by the year \n2010, there will be a shortage of 275,000 registered nurses, more than \ndouble the current number. In Maine, almost 1 out of 10 nursing \npositions at hospitals across our State is vacant.\n  We also face persistent shortages of certified nursing assistants and \nother front-line health care workers in our hospitals, home health \nagencies, nursing homes, and other health care facilities.\n  The current nursing shortage poses a significant threat to the \nability of our health care system to deliver quality care. The New \nEngland Journal of Medicine published a disturbing study last year \nwhich found that nursing shortages in hospitals are associated with a \nhigher risk of complications and even death. The study reported in the \nNew England Journal of Medicine found that patients in hospitals with \nfewer registered nurses were more likely to suffer from complications \nsuch as urinary infections and pneumonia; they were more likely to stay \nin the hospital longer; and they were more likely to die from treatable \nconditions such as shock and gastrointestinal bleeding.\n  The fact is that nurses are the eyes and ears of our hospitals. They \noften serve as an early warning system when complications begin to \ndevelop. But\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\nthe problems cannot be detected and treated early if nurses do not have \nsufficient time to spend with their patients.\n  Another study reported in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation last year found that each additional patient in a nurse's \nworkload meant an increase of about 7 percent in the likelihood that \nthe patient would die within 30 days of admission.\n  This is literally a matter of life and death. If there are more \nnurses, if hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities \nare adequately staffed with nurses, the quality of care provided to \npatients and the likelihood of a successful outcome are much higher.\n  While the situation is grave today, we face even greater threats and \ncrises in the future. Our current nursing workforce is aging. In Maine, \n61 percent of our registered nurses are at least 40 years old. As a \nconsequence, many of them will be retiring just as we aging baby \nboomers begin to place additional demands on our health care system. \nThe nursing shortage therefore is sure to worsen if we do not make the \ncritical investments today--now. We need to act more to support our \ncurrent nursing workforce and to encourage more young people to choose \nnursing as their profession.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Nursing Reinvestment Act to do just \nthat. This legislation had overwhelming bipartisan support. It \nauthorizes scholarships to nursing students who agree to provide at \nleast 2 years of service in a health care facility with a critical \nnursing shortage. It creates career ladders to help nurses and other \nhealth professionals advance in their careers. It provides loan \ncancellation for nurses with advanced degrees in exchange for teaching \nat schools of nursing.\n  Let me expand on that point.\n  Last year, I had the privilege of meeting with the nursing deans of \nHusson, the University of Maine, and what is now Eastern Maine \nCommunity College. They told me that they are being overwhelmed with \napplications from students who are eager to study nursing, but they \nsimply cannot accommodate the qualified applicants who wish to enter \nthe nursing program. The reason: A shortage of nursing professors.\n  There is a very important provision in this bill that encourages \nnurses with advanced degrees to teach at schools of nursing to help \nclose that gap and lessen that shortage so that we can start training \nmore nurses. It is not only a matter of encouraging more people to go \ninto nursing but also to make sure that we have the nursing faculties \navailable to educate these young students.\n\n  The Nursing Reinvestment Act builds on existing title 8 nursing \neducation programs that provide loan repayments to nurses, improves the \ndiversity of the nursing workforce, and expands opportunities for \nnursing education at all levels. All of these programs play a vital \nrole in recruiting nurses and making sure that they have the training \nrequired to effectively and compassionately care for their patients.\n  The promise of this new law and other nursing educational programs \nwill not be kept without an adequate investment of funds. That is why I \nfelt so strongly about joining with my colleague from Maryland in this \namendment. Increasing the funding level for these important programs to \n$175 million in fiscal year 2004 will allow them to expand to address \nnursing shortages in communities across the country.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to join us in supporting this vital \namendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment of \nSenators Mikulski and Collins that would bring the total funding in the \nbill for these programs to $175 million, the amount requested by over \n30 bipartisan Senators and groups ranging from AARP to cancer patient \ngroups to nursing and provider groups.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that more than one million \nnew nurses will be needed by the year 2010. Yet in my State of New \nYork, the number of undergraduate nursing program graduates has dropped \neach academic year since 1996.\n  Even as the workforce shrinks, the patient population is projected to \ngrow. Baby boomers across the Nation are aging, and their healthcare \nneeds will put an extra burden on the system. In New York State, the \npopulation over 80 will double by the year 2020.\n  As I travel across New York State, every type of community--urban, \nsuburban, rural--and every type of provider--hospitals, nursing homes, \nhome health agencies, hospices is affected by this shortage. All around \nthe State, nurses are facing an emergency of their own. That is why \nlast Congress I worked so hard to pass the Nurse Reinvestment Act which \nwill provide scholarships, public service announcements, and other \nprovisions to encourage people to enter the profession. But the current \nnursing shortage exists not only because fewer individuals are entering \nthe nursing profession, but also because the healthcare industry is \nhaving trouble retaining the nurses already on staff.\n  This amendment will help fund important nurse retention programs that \nwe authorized last year in the Nurse Reinvestment Act, based on proven \nworkplace principles, such as promotion of patient-centered care and \nnurse leadership, that are shown to improve retention. The amendment \ndoes not take any funding from other programs in the bill.\n  As so many studies have shown, our nursing care can often be the \ndifference in medical outcomes. For all the new technologies, talented \nsurgeons, and breakthrough drugs, I want people to remember that \nnursing care is essential in keeping our healthcare system the best in \nthe world. Study after study has cited a direct link between the type \nand quality of nursing care that is delivered and patient outcomes. We \ntrust nurses. In fact in a CNN/USA Gallop poll our Nation's nurses rank \nsecond for their honesty and integrity, with 84 percent of Americans \nrating them ``high'' or ``very high.'' If you are interested in who was \nranked first--it was firefighters, for their selfless acts of bravery \nafter the September 11 attacks.\n  We too admire nurses for their self-sacrifice, as individuals who \nembark on a caregiving profession and found themselves on September 11 \non the front lines of the battle against terrorism and bioterrorism. \nNurses were on the frontlines when anthrax first appeared, when SARS \nhit, and nurses rose to the challenge and continue to rise to the \nchallenge.\n  This is why I am so concerned about the nursing shortage. Nurses are \nmore vital than ever, and that is why we must fund these programs and \nmake good on the promise of the Nurse Reinvestment Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I rise to speak on another matter \nrelated to health care. I commend the distinguished Senators from \nMaryland and Maine for their legislation which I will be proud to \ncosponsor.\n  It is a matter I wish to address regarding the health and safety and \nwell-being of thousands of people in the area of my State of Minnesota \nsurrounding the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization conference report \nwhich was signed before the recess by 24 Republican conferees and none \nof the 14 Democrat conferees from either the Senate or the House \ncontains some very significant measures that were not provided for in \neither the Senate or the House legislation. One of those which directly \naffects my State very adversely would prohibit the use of airport \nimprovement program funds for the insulation of homes and apartments \nsurrounding the metropolitan airport that is in a DNL decibel range of \n60 to 64 DNL. That is a technical term. But it basically means that \nthose who are most severely impacted, most of whom have received some \nmitigation over the last few years through a pool of funds, including \nairport improvement funds, passenger facility funds, as well as the \nMetropolitan Airport Commission's own fees and the like, achieved a \ncertain measure of mitigation. But there are many thousands--over 8,000 \nhomeowners and an estimated 3,200 apartment dwellers--who are in the \nnext phase scheduled to be insulated. And since the airport's location \ndecision was made, the Federal Aviation Administration, as a matter of \nits record and decision, insisted that this program continue.\n  At the last minute, in a measure that was not considered by or voted \non by\n\n[[Page S11006]]\n\neither the House or the Senate in this conference report, a Senate \nconferee reportedly inserted this language into the report. Now it \ncomes back and is scheduled to come at some near date before this body \nto be voted up or down, which is, of course, the purpose of these \ncircumventions of the legislative process. They do not go through \ncommittee for up-and-down votes nor a public debate back and forth. \nThey don't go to the Senate floor for debate back and forth and a vote \nup or down. Instead, they are stuck in at the last minute in secret \nproceedings with not even all of the conferees present--certainly not \nall of the Senators present--and then it comes back in a matter that \nadversely affects thousands of people in my home State; a measure \ninserted without any notification to me, without any discussion by a \nMember of this body at the behest of a lobbyist for Northwest Airlines, \nwhich opposes this mitigation measure, and has done so and is within \nits rights to do so but is responsible for altering an agreement that \nhas been reached; a record of decision made by the FAA as part of the \napproval of this airport expansion which, if Northwest Airlines wants \nto alter or eliminate, as they say they do, it is responsible for doing \nso in a public process before a public body, and not by sneaking in an \namendment or language into a conference report that was not considered \nor voted on by either the Senate or the House.\n  I find it highly objectionable that a Senator from another State \nwould act in such a way as to adversely affect, to cause potential \nharm, if this were to go through, to thousands of constituents in my \nState without consultation, without discussion or forewarning.\n  Regretfully, this is not the only instance in this legislation of \nmatters that were added to it in conference that received no \nconsideration in either the House of Representatives or in the Senate, \nlanguage that runs directly contrary to what the Senate adopted. I \nspeak specifically of the Senate adopting the Lautenberg amendment \nwhich prohibited privatization of our air traffic control system.\n  Despite that amendment being added to the Senate bill, being the \nofficial position of the Senate, despite the fact that the House did \nnot consider the matter, as the House bill was silent on it, out of \nthis conference committee comes a report which would immediately, upon \nenactment, provide for partial privatization, for the privatization, \nfirst, of smaller airports around the country.\n  Curiously enough, certain States, those that are proponents of this \nmeasure, were exempted from inclusion because I suspect they recognized \nthat this is a highly speculative, highly risky, highly irresponsible \naction, taken with no debate or forethought but simply to fit some \ngroups' rigid ideological biases that the private sector does \neverything right and the public sector does everything wrong.\n  The trouble is, when they get elected with that ideology, they then \ngo about running Government so as to prove themselves right, and they \nsystematically dismantle functions, such as air traffic control, which \nin this country is about as perfect as a human system can be, which has \na nearly impeccable record of performance over the years, by far and \naway the best, most safety conscious, life-protecting, life-preserving \nair traffic system anywhere in the world.\n  Yet this administration wants to start to dismantle it for no cause \nwhatsoever other than, as I said, to fit its own ideology. Rather than \ncoming to this body and having that debate, rather than going to the \nHouse of Representatives and having that debate, they would rather wait \nand have conference committee time where they can sneak back in with 24 \nof their caucus Representatives and Senators and put this matter before \n535 elected representatives of the people, myself being one, who don't \nhave then any opportunity to delete it but simply to vote it up or \ndown.\n  I find this to be an egregious abuse of the legislative process, one \nthat consistently excludes Members such as myself who don't have the \nnecessary years of seniority to be appointed to these conference \ncommittees. It is bad enough that the process is so skewed in favor of \nthose who simply, by the basis of having been here for more years than \nothers, get to dominate that critical phase of the process. But it is \nintolerable to me, to this Senator--it is intolerable--when that \nauthority is abused and those conferees contrive to write legislation \nthat supersedes the legitimate authority of 100 Senators to decide \nupon--by voting, by majority rule decisionmaking--what will and what \nwill not become part of those reports which then, if they are passed \nand signed by the President, become law.\n  That is fundamentally a violation of the trust that the American \npeople put equally in each 1 of the 100 Members of this body. The \npeople of Minnesota, who sent me here, and who sent my colleague from \nacross the aisle, have the same rights to full representation from us \nas do the constituents of the Senators from any other State regardless \nof whether they have been here a longer or lesser time than I.\n\n  For my constituents' own vital interests to be harmed by a \ncontrivance of the process that has nothing to do with its integrity \nbut simply is a reflection of who has the power, who has the money, who \nhas the ability to hire full-time lobbyists to hang around these \nChambers and to slip into conference committees, at the last second, \nwhere no one else is looking or can do anything about it, measures that \nabrogate the public process in my State--I think in any State, but \ncertainly in my State--that is unacceptable and intolerable.\n  With all due respect to this institution, I cannot and will not allow \nthat measure to proceed. As I stated just before the beginning of the \nAugust recess, I will do whatever I must do to prevent the proceedings \nof this body leading up to the consideration of that measure. I hope we \ncan find 41 Members of the Senate who will oppose the conference report \nfor the 2 reasons I have just cited here and other measures that were \nalso added in conference that have an adverse effect, such matters as \nregional airline operations.\n  It also adversely affects one city, Thief River Falls, in my State of \nMinnesota. It imposes an additional $70,000-a-year funding requirement \non them. Again, it is not something that this body adopted. It is not \nsomething that the House adopted. It is something that somebody else \ndecided they wanted to add for whatever reasons.\n  If this bill is not sufficient reason for the Senate to stand up and \nput a stop to this kind of legislative freelancing through conference \ncommittees, then I think the fundamental premise of equal \nrepresentation and the equal rights of each one of us as Members has \nbeen fundamentally decimated, if not nearly destroyed--in some \ninstances is destroyed. And I, for one, am not going to be able to go \nback and explain to the people of Minnesota why I sat quietly by while \ntheir rights in this process were abrogated by somebody else usurping \nthat power and abusing it.\n  So, Madam President, I will be heard from on this matter again. I \ndon't know when the majority leader intends to bring this matter, the \nconference report, to the Senate, but prior to that time, if this \nmatter is not satisfactorily resolved, then I am going to have to \ncontinue to assert the rights of my constituents to the process that \nthis body established and should be following rather than some kind of \nlegislative freelancing, at the last split second, which totally \nabrogates their rights and my responsibilities to protect those rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I see my colleague, Senator Gregg, in \nthe Chamber and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to speak to this bill, and in a \nmoment I will have supportive charts to discuss this bill's efforts in \nthe area of education.\n  Let me begin by congratulating the chairman of the committee, Senator \nSpecter, for bringing to the floor a bill which has made major strides \nevery year since President Bush has been President, but especially this \nyear, under Chairman Specter's leadership, major strides on the issue \nof educational funding. In the context of that funding, relative to \nwhat was done when the Democratic membership controlled this Senate, or \nwhen the President was a member of the Democrat Party, the difference \nis startling.\n\n[[Page S11007]]\n\n  President Bush and the Republican Senate have made spectacular \nstrides in assisting and supporting education in this country while, at \nthe same time, doing so during a very difficult period of America's \nhistory, a period when we are fighting a war, a war which has required \nhuge resources, and a war which has required extreme attention by the \nadministration, and at a time that we have been in a period of economic \nrecession, in a period when the revenues to the Federal Government have \nbeen dropping precipitously because of that recession. Even in the \ncontext of those two very severe restraining events relative to \ndomestic program activity, this President has been willing to step \nforward and focus on the issue of education, try to improve the \neducation of America's children and support that effort with dollars.\n\n  I think before we get into a discussion of the dollars, because that \nis critical to the pending Byrd amendment, I will begin by saying this \ngoes beyond the issue of dollars, this goes into the question of the \nattitude and approach to education.\n  What President Bush has said is we can no longer afford an \neducational system which, year in and year out, in generation after \ngeneration, leaves behind especially low-income children, takes those \nchildren and runs them through the educational system and, at the end \nof their schooling period, leaves them without the skills they need in \norder to compete for and participate in the American dream. President \nBush has sounded a call to end that system and do something about the \nfailures of that system.\n  There are a lot of good-faith people, a lot of hard-working people in \nthe educational community in this country. A lot of teachers spend an \nextraordinary amount of hours, time, and extra effort to try to make \nsure their students succeed. Unfortunately, the fact is that, even \nthough we have radically increased the dollars in education over the \nlast 20 years, the performance of our children has not improved--\nespecially the performance of low-income children.\n  So President Bush said let's try a different way. That is where the \nbill, the No Child Left Behind Act, came in. It says, rather than \ncontrolling the input of legislation, rather than telling local school \ndistricts how to run their schools, let's take a different look at this \nand say, what are the children learning? Let's find out what they are \nlearning; let's shine a light on it. If they are not learning enough to \nbe competitive with their peers, or with what they need to be \nsuccessful in society, then let's put in the remedial efforts to try to \ncorrect those problems.\n  It is an unusual approach in our educational system because, \nbasically, it calls on the educational community to be accountable, to \nactually have to look at what a child is learning and determine whether \nwhat they are learning is what the community expects them to learn. The \nPresident's program, as passed by the Congress in a bipartisan \ninitiative, doesn't set a Federal standard for what a child in the \nfourth grade in Epping, NH, knows; it rather says to the people in \nEpping, you set the standard for what your children should know in the \nfourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Once you have set that standard, you \nare going to have to determine whether your children are learning to \nthat standard, and especially whether your low-income children, who \nhave historically been left behind, are learning to that standard. If \nthey are not, you are going to have to tell the parents they are not. \nYou will have to disclose to the community at large that a certain \npercentage of the children are not reaching the standards the community \nset for those children.\n  It is a radical idea for education to be held accountable, but it is \nan idea whose time has come. So far, the response of the educational \ncommunity has been very positive. Most teachers understand this is a \nlaw directed not in a negative way toward their efforts but in a \nsupportive way, trying to make sure school systems are more \naccountable--especially in those areas where you have schools that have \nnot made the grade, where a majority of low-income kids are failing. In \nother words, they are not reaching the standards of ability a fifth \ngrader should know in math or in English. In those schools, we are \ngoing to try to improve their efforts.\n\n  There is a lot of remedial activity to accomplish that. The President \nnot only set out this new initiative in the concept and the way we \napproach education--when somebody comes up with a good idea for smaller \nclassrooms, more computers, and throws out ideas without any \naccountability as to whether it produces results, instead of taking \nthat input approach, but an output approach, where you actually expect \nkids to learn and you find out if they are learning, and if they are \nnot, you do something about it, especially with low-income kids, not \nonly did he initiate that approach but he was willing to put the \ndollars into the programs that succeed in this area.\n  I think it is important to understand, as we view the debate of this \namendment specifically before us--the Byrd amendment--that the dollars \nthe President has proposed, and which the Congress passed under the \nRepublican Congress, at least, have been a radical increase in funding \nfor education at the Federal level.\n  The most significant reflection is that, as a function of the Federal \nGovernment, education has received more funding in the way of increases \nthan any other function in the Federal Government. You would not \nbelieve that if you listened to the other side of the aisle. You would \nthink it was actually being cut or not maintained. But, in fact, what \nthe President has proposed, and what we have passed as a Republican \nCongress, has been a dramatic increase in funding in education.\n  This chart reflects that. It shows that in 1996, when the Republicans \ntook control of the Congress, but most of the burst occurred in the \nlast 3 years since President Bush has come into office. The increase in \neducation has been 145 percent, whereas the increase in health and \nhuman services is 100 percent. And in defense funding, if you ask a \nperson on the street what part the Federal Government expanded fastest \nin the last 5 years, they would probably say defense because that is \nall you hear about--especially from the other side of the aisle. But \nthat is not true. Defense funding increased only a third as fast as \neducation funding.\n  That really tells only part of the story. The story is what has \nhappened in the context of this President's efforts versus that of the \nprior administration, this Republican Congress's efforts versus the \nprior Democratic Congress's efforts, because we are now hearing all \nthese amendments being thrown at us from the other side about how we \nare underfunding this or that and not doing enough funding here or \nthere.\n  But you have to ask yourself, what did they do when they were in \ncharge? Did they make the type of commitments they are now asking be \nmade by the Congress or did they maybe do substantially less and come \nforward today because it is politically enticing to do so and claim \nthese accounts are underfunded and, therefore, we have to add these \nadditional moneys?\n  Well, I think there are a couple of facts that need to be addressed \nright now. The first is President Bush's funding in comparison with \nPresident Clinton's funding. In the last year of the Clinton \nadministration, $42 billion was spent on education in this country. \nThis year, after 3 years in office, President Bush will have increased \neducation funding by 60 percent over the last Clinton budget, to $67 \nbillion. That is a huge increase and a huge commitment.\n  It goes beyond that. If you look at it by accounts, you will see what \nPresident Bush has done is stand behind his words, especially in \ncomparison to what the prior administration did. For example, in the \nentire period when the Democrats controlled the Congress and had a \nDemocratic President, their increases in title I spending were $286 \nmillion. Since the Republicans have controlled Congress--and primarily \nsince President Bush has come into office--it has gone to $1.2 billion. \nIf you total these in special education and also Pell grants--and we \nhave heard a lot of misrepresentation on the issue of Pell grants on \nthis floor--the difference is that in the period of a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress--especially since President Bush has become \nPresident--the average annual increase has been $4 billion. That \ncompares to about half a\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\nbillion dollars during the period President Clinton was in office and \nwhen there was a Democratic Congress.\n  A Republican Congress and a Republican President have basically made \nthe commitments not only in the area of policy improvement but also in \nthe area of dollars to back up that new policy.\n  It is instructive, for example, to take a look at some of the \npercentage differences between what the Republicans have done and what \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle did when they were in \ncontrol.\n  In the area, for example, of title I, our increases are 320 percent \nhigher than the increases of the Democratic membership. In the area of \nIDEA grants, our increases are 770 percent higher than the increases \nwhen the Democratic Party controlled Congress. In the area of Pell \ngrants--actually during the Clinton administration, Pell grants were \ncut; they fell in funding--under this administration, the increases \nhave been on an annual basis about 10 times higher than what the \nDemocrats did during their period. It is dramatic.\n  Overall, if you were to put it into gross terms, that $4.1 billion \nannual increase in educational funding, which has come about as a \nresult of the commitment of this President to improving education and \nbacking up those improvements with dollars, represents about an 858-\npercent increase on an annual basis over what happened when our \npredecessors were controlling the Congress and we had a different \nadministration.\n  The practical effect of this has been that we have created so much \nmore money flowing into the educational accounts at the Federal level, \nunlike what is represented across the other side of the aisle that more \nmoney is needed. In fact, what is happening is that we have put so much \nmoney into these accounts so fast under President Bush and the \nRepublican Senate that we now have a situation where a large percentage \nof the dollars which we have already appropriated cannot be spent and \nhave not been spent. In fact, of the $31 billion which has been \nappropriated under title I or the No Child Left Behind Act, $9 billion \nremains unspent. It is sitting at the Department of Education waiting \nfor the States to get to a position where they are able to draw down \nthose dollars. And this is not just from last year, this is from 2 to 3 \nyears back, the whole period of President Bush's Presidency.\n  It is not an issue of lack of dollars. In fact, it is just the \nopposite. We are putting so many dollars into the educational accounts \nat the Federal level so fast that, to make sure they are spent \ncorrectly, it has made it difficult for the money to actually be spent. \nWe, obviously, do not want to throw the money out there. It has to be \nspent pursuant to a plan. Every State has to file a plan. But as a \nresult of the increased spending coming through the Bush initiatives, \nas supported by this Congress and especially by the chairman of this \ncommittee, Chairman Specter, who has been funding these accounts, we \nnow find there is approximately $9 billion of funds which has not been \ndrawn down.\n  Today we have before us an amendment proposed by the ranking member \nof the Appropriations Committee--a man whom I greatly respect and who I \nthink all Senators respect because of his extraordinary history in the \nSenate--which is proposing to add $6 billion of spending on to the \neducational accounts. But how is it paid for? I think we need to \naddress that, too, because, of course, all these kids we are educating \nand trying to make ready to participate in the American dream are going \nto have to pay the bills we run up on them if we run them up as a \ndeficit.\n\n  So we put in place this year a budget. It was an idea that has been \nbrought back, so to say, because when the colleagues across the aisle \ncontrolled the Senate last year, they did not put in place a budget. \nWhy? Because a budget requires fiscal discipline and there were, I \nsuspect, some who did not want fiscal discipline, did not want rules \nwhich drive fiscal discipline to be put in place so that spending could \nbe controlled through budget points of order.\n  We had no budget last year. It was sort of a shock really. Here is \nthe Government of the United States functioning without a budget. It \nwas chaos--in fact, such chaos that not only did we not have a budget, \nwe did not have any appropriations passed under the leadership of the \nlast Congress, my colleagues across the aisle.\n  The first order of business when we took responsibility for this \nChamber, under the leadership of Senator Frist, was to pass all the \nappropriations bills from the prior year--almost all of them, 11 of the \n13 had to be passed in this year rather than last year when they should \nhave been passed. At any rate, we produced a budget this year, and we \npassed it.\n  What is the purpose of the budget? The purpose of the budget is to \nput in place some reasonable fiscal controls so that in a time when we \nare obviously running very high deficits as a result of a number of \nfactors--primarily the slow economy which has slowed revenues, the war \nin Iraq, and the war against terrorism--in that context where we are \ndriving, unfortunately, large deficits, not historically extraordinary \ndeficits but still very large deficits--we need to control the rate of \ngrowth in those deficits by having in place a budget which at least in \nsome accounts gives fiscal discipline. So we put in place a budget.\n  The budget allocates to each area a certain amount of money to be \nspent. Even in the context of the very severe deficit which we have--\nand it is significant--the Budget Committee, under the leadership of \nSenator Nickles, agreed to significantly increase the funding for \neducation to try to meet the goals set out by the President.\n  In the area of special education, we increased funding by over $1 \nbillion; in the area of title I, we increased funding by over $1 \nbillion in the budget; and in the area of Pell grants, we increased \nfunding by almost three-quarters of a billion dollars in the budget \neven though that meant that other accounts had to be reduced because to \nget the budget in place and have it be fiscally responsible, that \nrequired, if we were going to increase some accounts, we were most \nlikely going to have to reduce others. We did a budget, and we passed \nit in the Senate, and it was passed by the House.\n  We have in place a budget for this country, finally. We renewed the \nconcept of fiscal discipline through a budget after having abandoned it \nfor a year under the prior leadership of the Senate.\n  That budget sets out these spending goals, these spending limits \nwhich are called caps, the amounts which should be spent in these \naccounts. The leadership of this committee, Senator Specter, met those \ncaps and significantly increased by over $1 billion the spending on \nspecial education, over $1 billion the spending on title I, low-income \nkids, and almost $1 billion in spending on Pell grants.\n  Now we see these amendments coming from the other side saying: Even \nthough we have a budget, we should ignore it and we should fund all \nthese programs, not at the level that has been set by the budget or the \nlevel that has been set by the Appropriations Committee, but at the \nlevel set by the authorizing committee outside of the budget.\n  They are using a gimmick of classic proportions, advance funding, to \nclaim that they are really doing it in a fiscally responsible way. Let \nme explain what advance funding is.\n  When a Senator offers an amendment which increases spending by $6 \nbillion over what the budget allows, and then that person claims it is \npaid for because they borrow the $6 billion from next year's budget, \nthat is not fiscal responsibility. That is a game. Anybody sees that as \na gimmick. What happens next year? You are $6 billion in the hole. So \nnext year you not only have to pay that $6 billion, you have to pay on \ntop of that whatever you are going to pay for the increase in those \naccounts.\n  As a practical matter, it is doubling up the deficit. It would \nprobably be better from a practical standpoint if you did not advance \nfund and you just said: All right, we are going to add to the deficit \n$6 billion outside the budget, and we are not going to advance fund.\n  Advance funding is the worst of both worlds because it takes money \nfrom next year, which creates havoc with next year, and at the same \ntime it aggravates the budget deficit issue. So as a practical matter, \nthe $6 billion that\n\n[[Page S11009]]\n\nis proposed in this amendment will add $6 billion to the deficit, if \nnot this year, next year.\n  Who pays for that? Who pays for going outside the budget? Well, \ndeficits are paid for by the folks who come here to work, who are \nstudents in high school, who are pages. When they get out of college--\nand I presume most of them will want to go to college--they are going \nto get a job and that job is going to have a tax burden tied to it. \nThat tax burden is going to be directly related by how much we increase \nthe deficit today, because they are going to have to pay that bill down \nthe road. It is going to come to them, not to us, not to my generation, \nmost likely, but to my children's generation and to my children's \nchildren's generation.\n  So every time we break the budget, we are adding costs to our \nchildren. These are the same children we are trying to help. These are \nthe same people we are trying to help as they move through their \neducational experience. How are we going to help them when we first--\nwell, unless we follow the President's program, we will not give them a \ngreat education but, more importantly, when you pass on to them a debt \nthat is outside the discipline which is put in place to live by.\n  We put this budget in place so we would have fiscal discipline, so we \nwould not be passing on more of a deficit to our kids than is \nreasonable. Yet these amendments keep coming at us, one after another, \nsaying just add to the deficit, if not this year, next year; don't \nworry about it; it does not matter; it is for education.\n  I think it is ironic because the kids who are supposedly going to \nbenefit are the kids who are going to have to pay the costs, and as a \npractical matter it is not going to benefit them that much. Why is it \nnot going to benefit them that much? Because we already have $9.3 \nbillion of unspent money in these accounts. We have increased them so \nfast that they cannot be drawn down effectively.\n  Now let's go to another issue, this concept that the authorized level \nhas to be funded. This is a very unusual concept for Congress, because \nfor all intents and purposes Congress does not fund anything to \nauthorized levels.\n  Authorized levels are statements of intent, purpose, goodwill. What \nCongress funds is a budget and appropriated levels. But now we hear, \nalmost as a matter of sanctity, from the other side of the aisle that \nwe have to reach the authorized level or we have abandoned the children \nof America.\n  That is a very interesting concept, but they did not subscribe to \nthat concept when they were in control of the Senate. Last time the \nDemocratic membership controlled this body, which happened to be a year \nago, they brought forward an appropriations bill under Labor-HHS, which \nis the bill we are dealing with today, and they funded education. Did \nthey fund to the authorized level? No, they did not. They did not even \ncome close to funding to the authorized level.\n  This is the difference. This is the authorized level, the black line. \nThis is what the Democratic budget proposed. It is a pretty big gap, \nabout $4 billion. This was what was actually funded in the Democratic \nbill, which never passed, by the way, nor did the budget because they \ndecided they did not want a budget and they could not pass their bill.\n\n  Suddenly there has been an epiphany on the other side of the aisle. \nSuddenly, the authorized levels are sacrosanct and we must fund the \nauthorized level. Well, I suggest there is a touch of inconsistency, \nespecially in light of the track record we confront when we look at the \nfacts.\n  So we are turning to the basic underlying point, and that is this: \nFor the first time in at least a decade, and really longer, we have a \nPresident who even in a period of extreme national difficulty--war \nagainst terrorists who are set on destroying our Nation and killing \nAmericans, and have already done so--and a difficult economic period, \nalthough we are coming out of it, hopefully, a President who even \nduring those hard times, where his attention has obviously been drawn \noff, and appropriately so, to defending America and trying to get us \nback to work, has continued his focus on making sure children are \nproperly educated in this country, and he is especially focused on low-\nincome kids. That is the uniqueness of what he has done.\n  Most of us understand that a child from a better-off family is \nprobably going to be taken care of in the educational system, but the \nlow-income child, who comes mostly from broken homes and \ndisproportionately lives in urban areas, has been left behind for \ngeneration after generation.\n  Now we have a President who has said no longer and who is willing to \nmake this his purpose, even during these very difficult times when his \nattention might and has been drawn off otherwise. He has supported that \npurpose with huge increases in funding. In fact, in the first 3 years \nof the Bush administration, he increased funding more for title I in 3 \nyears than the prior administration did in 8 years by a factor of \nalmost 70 percent. The same is true in the special education accounts, \nand to a lesser extent but to a significant point in the Pell accounts. \nThis is a President who has not only put forward creative and \nimaginative policy to try to finally get a handle on the fact that so \nmany kids are not learning what they need to know in order to compete \nfor the American dream, has not only put together that policy but has \nbacked it up with real, hard dollars. In the budget this Congress \npassed, we backed up the President.\n  Today, the issue is whether we are going to hold that budget, which \nhas these very significant increases in education, or whether we are \ngoing to dramatically expand the deficit in what seems to me to be a \nbit of inconsistency in relationship to what was proposed when our \ncolleagues across the aisle were in control.\n  This committee, under the leadership of Senator Specter, this \nPresident, has done the work that needs to be done, lifted the weights \nthat need to be lifted in the area of funding education, and we should \nbe supporting this committee's mark in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for \nthose comments.\n  Before replying to Senator Mikulski and Senator Collins, we have \nanother amendment which is ready to be offered. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendment be set aside so there may be an amendment \noffered by Senator Inhofe and Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1553 to Amendment No 1542\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Allen, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1553 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the Impact Aid Program)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec.__. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for Impact Aid programs, there are \n     appropriated an additional $26,000,000 for Federal property \n     payments under section 8002 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, an additional $160,000,000 for basic \n     support payments under section 8003(b) of such Act, and an \n     additional $1,000,000 for payments for children with \n     disabilities under section 8003(d) of such Act: Provided, \n     That of the funds appropriated in this Act for the National \n     Institutes of Health, $595,000,000 shall not be available for \n     obligation until September 30, 2004: Provided further, That \n     the amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act \n     shall be deemed to be $7,082,199,000: Provided further, That \n     the amount $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act \n     shall be deemed to be $6,596,301,000.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I offer this amendment, along with my \ncolleague Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma. We do so on behalf of our other \ncosponsors: Senators Lautenberg, Conrad, Kerry, Murray, Daschle, Ben \nNelson, Johnson, Allen, Hagel, Corzine, Akaka and Clinton.\n\n[[Page S11010]]\n\n  I will yield to my colleague, Senator Inhofe, to make his statement, \nfollowing which I will make a statement about the amendment we just \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, our amendment adds $187 million to the \nImpact Aid Program. If it is accepted, that will only put us at two-\nthirds funding. It is important to understand what this is because it \nseems as if we have come back every year since 1997 and had some \nsuccess increasing the percentage of a program that was put on the \nbooks in the 1950s.\n  First, I agree with most everything the Senator from New Hampshire \nstated. When you come up with something like this, you have to look at \nit in the context of fairness and the overall budget. In this case, a \nprogram came along in the 1950s that replenishes money that was to go \nto our schools, that the Government has taken away from our schools. It \nis as simple as that. They federalize land--perhaps in conjunction with \nan Army post or Indian lands or in conjunction with a military base of \nsome kind--and when that happens, that takes the land off of the tax \nbase. So the money that would have gone from that tax base to the \nschools is no longer there. However, the kids still have to be \neducated.\n  In the wisdom of Congress in the 1950s they said: It is not fair. We \nwill have to at least treat these kids the same as other kids have been \ntreated.\n  There is an insatiable propensity for politicians to take from \nprograms and nobody will notice. This program started in the 1950s. It \nwas fully funded. It was fully funded up to 1969. In 1969, they started \ndropping down. In 1996, it was down to 50 percent. In other words, \nmoney that would have been there for the benefit of the children being \neducated, only 50 percent was getting to the kids.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, in Lawton, since 1966 the impact aid for \nFort Sill, which is located adjacent to Lawton, OK, has dropped \nsubstantially, down to one-half in 1996 compared to 1969. This \namendment would slowly bring this up to the point where we would be at \ntwo-thirds funding.\n  Let me describe what has happened since 1996. In 1996, we were at 50-\npercent funding. Until 1969, we were 100 percent, and people left the \nprogram alone. But in 1969 that changed and it went to 50-percent \nfunding. We have been successful since then, and I commend my friend, \nthe Senator from North Dakota. We do not always agree on issues. We \nhave disagreed on national missile defense. We have disagreed on \nAmeriCorps and many other issues. This issue is fairness, an issue on \nwhich conservatives, liberals, Republicans, and Democrats can agree.\n  Due to our efforts primarily, it has gone up from 50-percent funding \nin 1996 to 51 percent the next year, 57 percent the next year, 58 \npercent 2 years later and, if adopted, it will go up to two-thirds. The \nkids will still not be treated fairly, nor will the school districts. \nThey still will suffer from the fact that the land went off the tax \nbase. However, at least we are on the right trend line, and we should, \nin another 3 or 4 years, get to 100-percent funding.\n  I will relentlessly pursue this in any way we have to in order to get \nto that point.\n  Fort Towson public schools in southeastern Oklahoma will gain $51,000 \nof impact aid if fully funded. This would bring it only to two-thirds \nfunding. As a result, they are having serious problems in these school \ndistricts.\n  Oklahoma is not that much different from other States. In the State \nof North Carolina, my information is that North Carolina actually has \nmore impacted students than the State of Oklahoma. I don't know where \nNorth Dakota stands; I am sure we will hear in a moment. However, it is \na fairness issue. Oklahoma is not treated more unfairly than any other \nState but equally unfairly. The students are not getting the education \nthey need because of one thing, and that is they have had the \nfederalized land taken off their tax base.\n\n  I join my friend from North Dakota in trying to pass this amendment. \nIn doing this, a lot of kids throughout America will be treated more \nfairly. Down the road, in 5, 6, or 7 years we will find this program \nwill be 100-percent funded.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for the time he has given me \nand assure him I join him fully in getting this amendment passed for \nthe kids of Oklahoma, North Dakota, and throughout the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased to work with my friend from Oklahoma, \nSenator Inhofe. As he indicated, this is an issue that brings support \nfrom a bipartisan group of Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter sent \non April 14, 2003, to Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, signed by a \nwide variety of Members of the Senate from virtually every political \npersuasion and every corner of the philosophical structure around here. \nIt shows the widespread support for the Impact Aid Program and for the \nfunding for this program that was originally promised.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services \n         and Education, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin, \n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \n         Services and Education, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin: As you \n     know, the Senate Impact Aid Coalition was formed in 1996 to \n     promote and improve the Impact Aid Program. Our coalition has \n     grown from just four Members of Congress in 1995, to its \n     current membership of 45.\n       Our goal for Fiscal Year 2004 is to increase funding for \n     the Impact Aid Program to $1.375.4 billion, a 15 percent \n     increase over last year's conference report funding level. \n     This increase will help local school districts, which have \n     lost tax revenue as a result of the federal presence in their \n     district, to serve their communities and provide a quality \n     education. This increase is also an important step toward \n     fully funding this program, which currently receives less \n     than half of its authorized funding.\n       In a time of budget constraints, we understand that you \n     have difficult decisions ahead, but it is our firm belief \n     that as our service men and women set out to defend our \n     country, we must not forget or ignore the children they leave \n     behind. While the focus on national security and homeland \n     defense is necessary to ensure that the well being of the \n     citizens of our great country, we also believe that Congress \n     must fulfill its federal obligation.\n       As you know, Impact Aid helps to ensure that military \n     children, children residing on Indian lands and in federally-\n     owned, low-rent housing facilities, and dependents of the \n     federal government receive a quality education. We believe \n     that Congress' commitment to Impact Aid is more important \n     than ever. In addition to the funding increase of 15 percent, \n     we ask that you maintain the eligibility of all students to \n     the Impact Aid Program as defined in the No Child Left Behind \n     Act.\n       We stand committed to the Impact Aid Program and are ready \n     to work with you and your subcommittee on this very important \n     issue. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of our \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tim Johnson, Chuck Hagel, Jack Reed, John Warner, Max \n           Baucus, Jeff Bingaman, Byron L, Dorgan, James Inhofe, \n           John Kerry, Daniel Akaka, Pat Roberts, Mike Crapo, Jim \n           Bunning, Ben Nelson, Kent Conrad, Hillary Clinton, \n           Frank Lautenberg, Tom Daschle, Charles Schumer, Barbara \n           Boxer, Russell Feingold, Patty Murray, Jon Corzine, \n           Barbara Mikulski, Dick Durbin, Edward Kennedy, Maria \n           Cantwell, George Allen, Carl Levin, and Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague has well described this \nissue. This is not some extraordinary grant program, some program that \nwill deliver something for nothing to some school district in the \ncountry. This is keeping a promise. What is the promise? The promise \nwas made in 1950 that when the Federal Government comes in and takes \nland or has property that is tax exempt, the Federal Government will \nmake a payment to local school districts in lieu of local property \ntaxes. That is what the impact aid is about. We have other similar \nprograms--PILT, or payments in lieu of taxes--but essentially Impact \nAid is a promise to our local schools who still have to educate \nchildren despite their smaller tax base. Impact Aid says where we have \nproperty, and that property is tax-exempt because it belongs to the \nFederal Government--in most cases, for example, a military base--we \nwill provide impact aid to offset those costs. That is what this is, \nimpact aid.\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\n  In 1950, both President Truman and the Congress said let's do this. \nIt is not fair for the Federal Government's actions to adversely impact \na local school district's financial situation. So they created the \nImpact Aid Program to directly reimburse school districts for the loss \nof revenue caused by the Federal Government.\n  There are 1,400 school districts nationwide eligible for impact aid \npayments serving 15 million children. Let me describe just one of them. \nI toured a school one day in North Dakota some few years ago. It was a \nschool on the edge of an Indian reservation, a public school district \nbut a school district whose property base was largely tax exempt. So it \nhad very little property on its tax rolls, and therefore it could not \nbond because it had such a small property base. It could not raise a \ngreat amount of tax revenue, as well.\n  This is a school district that was in great difficulty. It had \nroughly 150 children, two toilets, one water fountain. In the classroom \nyou saw children sitting 30 in a classroom with desks an inch apart. \nMany were Native-American children. And one little girl named Rosie Two \nBears looked up at me and asked: Mr. Senator, are you going to build us \na new school?\n  Regrettably, I could not build a new school for them, but it was an \nimpact aid school. And the question of impact aid funding bears \ndirectly on how many children are in a classroom, how many lavatories \nexist, what the condition of the building is in which they are going to \nschool. In this particular building, they were holding classes in the \nlower level of the building, but some days they could not hold the \nclasses because sewer gas was backing up on that level. Part of the \nbuilding was already condemned.\n  The question for us is, When a young child walks through that \nclassroom door, are they disadvantaged by having to go to a school that \nis not in good repair? Having to go to a school where classrooms are \ncrowded? The answer is yes, of course.\n\n  I wish I could have told this little third grader, Rosie Two Bears, \nYes, I am going to build you a new school, but I couldn't do that. I \ndon't build schools. But I do come here with my colleague from Oklahoma \nto fight for adequate funding for the impact aid program, to say this \nGovernment has a responsibility to keep its promise--yes, to Rosie Two \nBears, but to other young children across this country.\n  I indicated we have 15 million children in these schools that are \neligible for impact aid. My colleague just told the Senate that if we \npass the amendment we have offered we will still only be providing two-\nthirds of the money we had originally promised years ago as a Federal \nGovernment to make up for the lost revenue in these local school \ndistricts.\n  Some say it is a matter of choice. Yes, it is a matter of choice. \nThere are unlimited needs and limited resources. I understand all that. \nWe propose an amendment that adds $187 million.\n  Let me mention one other fact. The President proposed a cut to Impact \nAid that was very significant, as all of us know. The cut was restored \nback to level funding by my colleagues, Senator Specter and Senator \nHarkin. But just restoring to level funding means these schools still \nfall behind because more children are affected in these impact aid \nschools.\n  So what Senator Inhofe and I propose is to increase Impact Aid to at \nleast two-thirds of the funding that was promised by adding the $187 \nmillion.\n  Our amendment is offset in 2004 by moving the fiscal year 2004 \nadvance-funding back to fiscal year 2003, which is exactly the same \nmethod used by the leadership to increase funding for the underlying \nbill by $2.2 billion. Some say nothing really is happening out in the \nimpact aid schools that would cause us to have to do this. Let me \ndescribe what is happening. Medical Lake Washington State School \nDistrict has scaled back its afterschool and summer programs and is not \nreplacing the four elementary schoolteachers who retired. Why? It \ndoesn't have the money. It is an impact aid school.\n  The Saint Ignatius Montana School District eliminated four teachers, \nresulting in larger class sizes, and was not able to give raises to its \nteachers.\n  The Suttons Bay Michigan School District has reduced the number of \nteaching positions and initiated a pay-to-play policy for participating \nin athletics and extracurricular activities, and reduced spending on \ntextbooks.\n  Oceanside, CA, a big school district, has had to eliminate \ntransportation for 5,000 students in grades 7 through 12, and 139 \nteachers have been let go.\n  Grand Forks North Dakota School District reduced staff, delayed \ntextbook purchases, and delayed capital expenditures for technology and \nfacility needs.\n  These are real examples of what is happening in real schools that has \nan effect on real kids entering classroom doors expecting to be able to \nlearn. We have an obligation, it seems to me, to keep our promise.\n  I said this yesterday, and let me make the point again because it is \nnot an unfair point, it seems to me. We are told that the money does \nnot exist to do everything we want to do. I fully understand and accept \nthat. So if the money does not exist to do everything, then the \nquestion is how do we prioritize that which we believe must be done? \nThe question for us is where do children rank? Where do you put kids? \nAt the top? In the middle? At the bottom? Where do our kids fall in our \npriorities?\n\n  I mentioned this yesterday and someone said maybe it was unfair that \njust a matter of months ago Mr. Wolfowitz went to Turkey and said: If \nyou let our troops go through Turkey, we will give you $26 billion, $6 \nbillion in grants and $20 billion in loans. I supported that. The next \nday I called to find out where did the $26 billion come from, $6 \nbillion of which was direct spending. They said that will come out of \nour priorities.\n  So if we had the money for Turkey and didn't spend it, maybe we could \nuse the money that we didn't spend on Turkey to spend on American kids \ngoing to classrooms that ought to be better classrooms, going to \nteachers who have to pay for their own textbooks, going to schools that \nare in disrepair, that need fixing, going to Rosie Two Bears' school to \nmake that a school we are proud of instead of having it be a school \nwhere you walk through a classroom door and discover that young \nchildren do not have quite the same opportunity because they are \ncrowded into a room and do not have the same capabilities as other \nchildren in other schools.\n  My point is that this is all a matter of priorities and choices. We \nmake the choices. Not our uncles, not our kids, not our grandpas and \ngrandmas. We make the choices.\n  I said when I started, and I want to say it again because my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania is on his feet, that I think the Senators \nfrom Pennsylvania and Iowa did exactly the right thing in restoring the \nmoney that was cut in the President's budget for impact aid. It brought \nus back to where we should be, at level funding, if the goal is only \nlevel funding. But the Senator from Oklahoma and I said, and we believe \nvery strongly, that getting us to just two-thirds of what we had \npromised we were going to offer to these school districts that are in \nsuch desperate financial trouble because they have lost their property \ntax base--just getting back to two-thirds is not an unreasonable goal. \nDoing it by adding the money we propose in this amendment is an \ninvestment in kids and an investment in this country that will be well \nworth it.\n  Again, I say as I close, if you establish priorities in this Senate, \nit seems to me the first priority is America's future, and America's \nfuture is its kids. It is the kids. And education is about preparing \nthose kids for opportunity.\n  I hope very much my colleagues will accept this amendment. It is a \nmodest amendment. It is bipartisan. It has broad support. My hope and \nexpectation would be that with those who signed the letter in April to \nthe subcommittee, with those who have cosponsored our amendment today, \nthat we will be able to have a vote and be successful in adding this \nmoney for the impact aid districts and the impact aid schools around \nthis country.\n  I know this will be a long and tortured trail on the floor of the \nSenate for this particular bill. This bill is a very important \nappropriations subcommittee bill. I serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee and I am deeply honored to do it for a very important reason. \nIt is one of the few committees these days in Congress that is truly,\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\ntruly bipartisan. We work in a way that respects each other and work \ntogether in conferences on appropriations. These are really \nconferences, not conferences in name in which one side never gets \ninvited, but real conferences. So this is a great committee.\n  The opportunity on the floor of the Senate to talk about priorities \nand adjustments in the appropriations process is an opportunity that I \ndo not want to miss. My colleague from Oklahoma would say the same. \nThis is one we do not want to miss.\n  We thank very much the Senators from Pennsylvania and Iowa for \nbuilding back that funding which the President cut. We then ask for \ntheir support for the proposition that we reach at least a two-thirds \nfunding level of that which was promise to the impact aid schools in \nthis country. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the outset I say I am very \nsympathetic to the considerations raised by the Senator from North \nDakota. But the issue is where do we find the money?\n  As I look over a long list of items where we could make offsets and \ncould have cuts, there is not an item or a line that is desirable. \nShould we cut money from the National Institutes of Health? Or from \ncommunity health centers? Or from many other lines? The judgment of the \nsubcommittee, backed up by the full committee, is that we made the \nproper allocation.\n  I appreciate the comment made by the Senator from North Dakota that \nwe did reinstate the funds. The administration had made a request which \nwould have reduced the funding from last year by $187 million. The \nsubcommittee and the full committee have put that money back. I think \nit is worth noting, since 1996 when the funding was $693 million, to \nfiscal year 2003 when the funding is $1.188 billion, that is a 71.5-\npercent increase. Regrettably, that is about as far as we can go.\n  At the appropriate time, for the information of the amendment's \nsponsors, I am constrained to raise a point of order. The leadership \nhas advised the preference is not to vote until about 5:45. That does \nnot lock in a vote but that is the leadership's position because a \nnumber of Senators are off the floor at this time.\n  I, again, urge my colleagues to bring amendments to the floor. We \nhave a list of about 40 amendments. In a relatively short amount of \ntime that quorum call sign is going to go on. As I have said on a \ncouple of occasions, on August 1 and before the recess, the majority \nleader and I had a colloquy and talked about going to third reading. My \nexperience at the Senate has been there have been long delays. Senators \ndo have amendments but wait to bring them. I know that requires \nplanning, but the Senate has been on notice for more than a month that \nthis bill would be taken up on September 2. If we are to complete \naction on this bill, we are going to have to have the cooperation of \nthe Senate.\n  If this bill is not signed by September 30, this bill will lose $3 \nbillion. That is what it will cost if this bill is not signed by the \nPresident by September 30. If there is to be any realistic chance of \nhaving the appropriations bills finished by and large by September 30, \nthere is going to have to be cooperation by Senators who have \namendments but who haven't brought them to the floor. We were assured \none Senator would be here at 4 o'clock. Now word has come that the \nSenator is not going to be ready. That puts the managers, who have the \nresponsibility for moving this bill ahead, at a severe disadvantage.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. In a minute.\n  I understand I don't have the unilateral authority to move to the \nthird reading, but I am going to try to do that if we don't have \namendments come to the floor and if we have to wait through quorum \ncalls for protected other business which is not related to this bill.\n  I would be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have an observation in the form of a \nquestion. Would it be a good incentive for those who take seriously and \ncome to the floor with amendments to offer them quickly and do so in \nrather short order, as Senator Inhofe and I have done, especially when \nit is an amendment of great merit? Would it set an example for it to be \naccepted by the chairman of the subcommittee? That probably is a \nrhetorical question. Let me ask further, if I might: What point of \norder does the Senator intend to make against amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The point of order would be under section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 that the \namendment exceeds the discretionary spending limit in this section and \nis therefore not in order.\n  The Senator raises a very tempting offer. I might almost be tempted \nto say that any amendment that gets to the floor before 3:59 we would \nbe willing to accept, meritorious or not. That is very much in the eye \nof the beholder. Of course, I can't quite do that. But I thank the \nSenator from North Dakota for his diligence in coming to the floor and \nspeaking on an earlier amendment and offering this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, what reward does the Senator from \nPennsylvania suggest for that good behavior?\n  Mr. SPECTER. What was that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was just asking what reward he would suggest for that \ngood behavior. I suggest perhaps a good lesson for others might be to \nsee this meritorious amendment accepted by the chairman. There would a \nrush here in droves to offer them very quickly. But the Senator could \nthink about that for a moment.\n  I wish to ask this question about the point of order. The amendment \nSenator Inhofe and I have offered is an amendment that dutifully \nincreases part of this bill that we think is critically important, one \nthat still falls far short on the promise that has been made over the \nyears in the funding mechanism we use. It is the funding mechanism, I \nbelieve, that in part is used in the underlying bill itself. I guess I \nam a bit confused about a point of order lying only against our \namendment or against some broader construct of what is happening here \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \nanswer to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The same defect would apply to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me make an observation. I do not \ncriticize the defect in the underlying bill. My hope is that the \nSenator will not criticize the identical defect in the amendment. What \nI have done, along with my colleague, Senator Inhofe, is offer an \namendment that embraces exactly the same approach that is used by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa in funding the \nunderlying bill. I take no exception to that at all. I am fully in \nsupport of that. Based on that, I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwill not raise a point of order against the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I do not seek to enter into a \ndisagreement with the distinguished Senator on the point he just \nraised. But as manager of the bill, I feel constrained to raise the \npoint of order at an appropriate time. I thought I would give the \nSenator from North Dakota notice of that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let the Senator from Pennsylvania and me \nand others discuss that off the floor. The only reason I raise the \nquestion is that offering an amendment which uses an identical funding \nsource or the mechanism that is identical to the funding source offered \nby the subcommittee is one that I thought would not engender a point of \norder. At any rate, we do not intend to vote on that at this moment. My \nunderstanding from the Senator from Pennsylvania is that this will \nprobably be dealt with later this afternoon. If that is the case, \nperhaps we can discuss this between now and then.\n  My hope is that the Senator from Pennsylvania will not raise a point \nof order and give us an opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the \nmerits of the amendment inasmuch as the same funding mechanism used in \nthe underlying bill and the same defect would occur in both.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor a question? If he is looking for\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\namendments, would the Senator be willing to entertain one from this \nSenator when this discussion is concluded?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Does the Senator from Minnesota have an amendment he \nwishes to offer?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I have an amendment. Recognizing the generous offer of \nthe chairman of the subcommittee with the 3:59 deadline racing to a \nconclusion, the magnitude of the offer by the Senator from North Dakota \nis so modest by comparison that it should enhance his chances.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, may I inquire of the Senator from \nMinnesota whether the amendment relates to this bill?\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator is correct. It relates to funding for the \nIDEA.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The amendment does relate to this bill?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Yes. The Senator is correct. It relates to the funding \nfor IDEA.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if the Senator has an amendment \nrelating to this bill, it certainly will be welcomed. I ask the Senator \nfrom Minnesota if he would be willing to defer offering the amendment \nto give the Senator from West Virginia an opportunity to speak for 10 \nminutes in advance of offering that amendment.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I will gladly step aside for the Senator from West \nVirginia at any time. I hope the 3:59 offer might be extended to \ninclude 30 seconds after the Senator concludes his remarks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank both of these illustrious Senators, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania who is managing the bill before the Senate, \nand I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for his courtesy \nand kindness.\n  I will be brief. I do intend to speak out of order. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may speak out of order for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the introduction of S. 1576 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1554 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1554.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase funding for part B of the Individuals with \n                      Disabilities Education Act)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. 306. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     the total amount appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to carry out parts B, C, \n     and D of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     shall be $22,109,931,000, of which $20,941,000,000 shall be \n     available to carry out part B of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (other than section 619 of such \n     Act).\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment would meet a 27-year-old \npromise made by the Federal Government to the States and to the school \ndistricts when IDEA was established. The promise was that the Federal \nGovernment would provide for 40 percent of the costs, the additional \ncosts of providing special education services to every eligible \nschoolchild. It is one of the most important commitments the Federal \nGovernment has made for public education, especially at the elementary \nand secondary levels, and the money could not be better spent on behalf \nof leaving no child behind.\n  Sadly, at least in the State of Minnesota--and I know, from the \nobservations of other Senators, in many other States--the funding \npresently is seriously inadequate to provide all of those services.\n  In Minnesota, some $250 million a year shortfall exists in funding \nfor special education which results in education dollars having to be \nshifted from regular programs and services to special education to meet \nthe statutory requirement of school districts to provide services to \nevery qualified schoolchild. The result is that in Minnesota all the \nstudents are harmed by the underfunding of special education, those who \nare the recipients of those services, as well as those who see dollars \nshifted from other programs for their benefit.\n  IDEA funding for part B for States in the current legislation before \nus is set at $9.858 billion. To bring that funding up to the 40-percent \nlevel, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would require an \nadditional IDEA part B funding of $11.082 billion. It is noteworthy \nthat the increase exceeds the appropriated amount. Another way of \nlooking at that is that the current level of appropriated dollars is \nless than half--less than half--of what is necessary to meet that 40-\npercent level that was committed to by the Congress 27 years ago.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire earlier on the \nSenate floor reference the increases in funding for special education \nthat President Bush has proposed, and I commend the President for doing \nso. I have not served during the period of time which the Senator from \nNew Hampshire referenced, so I do not have the basis for comparing the \nperiod of time during the 1990s that he referenced under the former \nadministration with the circumstances that this President is faced \nwith, but it is enough for me that President Bush has proposed in each \nof his budgets an increase in funding for special education, and he \nshould be credited for doing so.\n  But the fact remains that even with those increases up until this \nyear, the Federal share of funding for special education nationwide is \napproximately 17 percent of those total costs. In other words, still, \ndespite those increases over the last 3 years, it is less than half of \nwhat the Federal Government promised over a quarter century ago.\n  I recognize that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, with \nhis responsibilities to the budget and to an allotment for the \nsubcommittee's appropriations, has to or is likely to object to this \namendment, despite it being inserted just before the 3:59 deadline. I \nrecognize this is an amount that goes way beyond the current mandate of \nthe subcommittee. But as my colleague from North Dakota said so \neloquently just a few minutes ago, what we are really talking about as \nwe consider these different amendments in a broader sense is, What are \nour priorities as a Senate?\n  What are our priorities as a Nation? Do we really mean what we say, \nthat no child shall be left behind? Are we willing to put forward the \nnecessary resources to accomplish that? Or is that just a rhetorical \nstatement without proper attribution from the Children's Defense Fund \nand, whereas that esteemed organization has championed the resources \nand the commitments that would be necessary to actualize that \nstatement, we in this Congress and, with due respect, the \nadministration have still fallen short of that responsibility.\n  We had, when I came into office, an incredible opportunity because we \nwere looking at projected surpluses for the next decade of some $5.4 \ntrillion. That is a marked difference from the circumstances which \nPresident Clinton faced throughout most of his administration when he \nwas bringing the Nation out of the previous era of deficit spending, \nwhen he finally, through collaboration with the Congress--the Senate \nand the House--during the last 4 years of his administration succeeded \nin balancing the combined Federal budget. In fiscal year 2000, he \nachieved for the first time in 4 years--and probably for the last time \nin 40 or more years--a surplus in the non-Social Security part of the \nFederal budget; in other words, education, health care, and the like--\neverything except for Social Security, which at this point, this year, \nis running about a $155 billion projected surplus; the rest of the \nFederal budget was balanced. We had the resources projected that would \nhave kept that operating budget in a surplus mode for each of the next \n10 years, according to both the CBO and the OMB when President Bush's \nadministration\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\ntook office in January of 2001. I thought then, as I offered this \namendment at that time, that we had a tremendous opportunity we should \nnot let go by to bring this funding immediately up to the 40 percent \npromised level.\n  That year, in a bipartisan and very genuinely committed way, there \nwas an amendment that was adopted by the Senate that would have brought \nfull funding for special education up to the promised 40 percent level \nover 6 years--5 years too long in my estimation, but it passed the \nSenate. It went to conference with the House. It resulted in a \nprotracted conference committee of almost 6 months.\n  My esteemed former colleague, the departed Senator from Minnesota, \nPaul Wellstone, was championing this measure, among others, in that \nconference committee and insisting that the Senate position of building \nto 40 percent funding for special education over 6 years be honored and \nkept in the conference report. The House resisted and was adamant, and, \nunfortunately, at the very end of the conference, the Senate conferees \nagreed to the House position, causing my colleague, Senator Wellstone, \nto vote against that conference report, as did I.\n  Since then, we have all recognized that the fiscal circumstances of \nthe Federal Government have changed dramatically. I find it a little \nbit disingenuous for the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire to be \ntaking credit for the spending increases for education, which he \nascribes to this administration and this Congress; yet, every time \nsomebody from this side of the aisle proposes also to increase spending \nfor education, suddenly our side of the spending equation is bad \nspending and his side of the spending equation seems to be good \nspending. As far as I am concerned, it can be Republican spending, \nDemocratic spending, or independent spending for education, and it is \ngood spending. I don't care which administration, which session of \nCongress, or which Members of Congress can claim credit for that. I \njust want the credit to be there to be claimed because I know the \nbeneficiaries are the students of Minnesota and, I suspect, all over \nthe rest of the country.\n\n  I am also perplexed when I hear the Senator from New Hampshire, who \nchairs the HELP Committee of the Senate--his expertise and knowledge of \nthese matters is widely respected by colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. But when he says, in effect, as he did earlier today, we have \nput so much additional Federal money into public education at the K \nthrough 12 level that the school districts aren't able to spend that \nmoney fast enough--a couple of months ago, I heard the Senator state on \nthe Senate floor there was a surplus of Head Start positions available \nnationwide, so there were more slots available than there were people \nwho wanted to get their children into a Head Start program.\n  I truly hope if those surplus funds are available, be it from New \nHampshire or any other State, they will be put into a reservoir that \ncould be drawn from by other States. I know in the case of Minnesota--I \nheard the Senator from North Dakota state the same and I heard a number \nof other colleagues, including Senator Pryor of Arkansas--I ask \nunanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. He also shared the circumstances with me of the State of \nArkansas. When I run by the educators in Minnesota the assertion made \non the Senate floor that there is a surplus of Federal funding for \nthese programs, I get absolutely incredulous looks. I find far more \nconcurrence with the Senator from North Dakota, who observed teachers \nin his State who are reaching into their own pockets for hundreds, even \nthousands, of dollars, who go without expenses for basic program \nmaterials, educational materials, trips to educational enrichment \nopportunities, and the like that cannot be funded out of regular \nbudgets.\n  In Minnesota, there is an estimated $250 million shortfall of special \neducation money because of this underfunding of the Federal commitment, \nwhich I can assure my colleagues every one of those dollars would be \nspent swiftly and necessarily and would benefit students throughout my \nState if they were made available. So where these surplus dollars are \nthat States and school districts elsewhere don't need, where the \nadditional slots for programs such as Head Start are residing that are \nnot being filled, I guess I would certainly like to see where that \nexists.\n  I urge the Secretary of Education, if it is in fact the case, that \nthose funds and those slots be reallocated as swiftly as possible to \nStates like Minnesota, who need them and could benefit from them.\n  Yes, Mr. President, my amendment exceeds the budget as it exists \ntoday. I note that when the budget for this fiscal year began, we were \nlooking at a deficit, we were told, of about $260 billion, if memory \nserves me. Now we are told that we will exceed $500 billion. We are \nasked rhetorically where will the money come from for these \nexpenditures. I answer rhetorically, from the same place the other $240 \nbillion that has been added to the deficit this year will come from. \nAnd the Senator from New Hampshire is right--that will come from \npayments made by taxpayers in the future. But if we are going to spend \n$100 billion, as some experts estimate we will, over the next year in \nIraq, if we are going to spend 10 percent or 15 percent of that amount \nin Afghanistan, if we are going to spend $15 billion to address the \nAIDS crisis in Africa over the next few years, as the President \nproposed--and those are all either necessary or very worthwhile \nhumanitarian and strategic expenditures, but if we are talking about \nadditional spending on the magnitude of $15 billion, $100 billion over \nthe course of a year, how is it that we always run out of resources \nwhen it comes to children, when it comes to especially schoolchildren \nwith special needs, when it comes to those who will be left behind in \nMinnesota and I suspect will be left behind in 49 other States if these \nadditional resources are not provided?\n\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the opportunity to offer \nthis amendment. I hope it will be considered in the broader context of \nthe priorities of this body for the children of today and tomorrow. I \nrespectfully suggest it is money that will be extremely well spent. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for \na question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the manager of \nthe bill is working to set up a series of votes beginning at 5:45 p.m. \ntoday; is that right?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Correct.\n  Mr. REID. Just to alert Members, we are going to have one, possibly \nthree votes at 5:45 p.m.; is that right?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had commented earlier today that there \nwas an expectation of voting at 5:45 p.m., that there were a series of \nmeetings at the White House and other places which would keep Senators \naway from the floor until that time. I just responded to the question \nfrom the Senator from Nevada that it is the likelihood, but it is not \nlocked in, that we will vote at 5:45 p.m. How many votes we will have \nwe are not certain at this point.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for offering this \namendment. The issue on special education is one of great importance. \nThe Federal Government does have a responsibility to come to the 40 \npercent level. We have been far from it, but we have made very \nsubstantial progress. I think it is accurate to say even enormous \nprogress.\n  Over the course of the past several years, we have made major \nincreases. When I became chairman of this subcommittee in 1995, in \nconjunction with Senator Harkin, we made special education a priority, \nand for the fiscal year 1997, we increased special education by \napproximately $800 million. The next year, $700 million. The following \nyear, $500 million. The year after that, $580 million, $450 million, \n$1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, and this year there is a projected increase \nof approximately $650 million.\n\n  If you take a comparison from the year 1994, the special education \nappropriation was slightly over $2 billion,\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\n$2.05 billion. This year we are projecting it at $9.85 billion, which \nis almost four times as much, almost 400 percent, slightly less. So we \nhave moved up very materially.\n  I do not have the statistics prior to the year 1996 on the Federal \nshare per student spending, but in 1996, it was 7.3 percent. We have \nnow advanced that to 18.7 percent. We are almost halfway to 40 percent.\n  If we were to fully fund IDEA, it would take another $11 billion to \n$12 billion on top of the amount of money which we have allocated. \nWhile I have deep respect for the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMinnesota, I think it might even be possible he does not have an \nexpectation that we are going to have $11 billion or $12 billion more \nfor this item, much as we would like to and much as the Federal \ncommitment is there. But I think the progress has been enormous.\n  I make a special compliment to the senior Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Gregg, who has been at the forefront of this item, going back to \nhis earlier days in the House and his earlier days as Governor of New \nHampshire seeing the importance of this item.\n  It is an item of great importance for me. We are making a lot of \nprogress. It would be nice to do more, but I think everyone understands \nwe are far from being able to add an additional $10 billion, $11 \nbillion, $12 billion here.\n  Again, for purposes of information, I will be constrained to raise a \nbudget point of order when we take up this matter for a vote at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. President, let me again issue a call for amendments. Third \nreading may be as remote as full funding for IDEA, but it is an idea \nwhose time may come, if not this afternoon, perhaps this evening or \nperhaps tomorrow morning.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1552\n\n  Mr. President, I have not made any manager's comments on the \namendment offered by Senator Mikulski and Senator Collins on the \nnursing issue. That is an item of great concern. There is a tremendous \nnursing shortage in the United States. The Mikulski-Collins amendment \nseeks to raise the funding from $112.7 million to $175.7 million for a \n$63 million increase.\n  I note that there have been increases of a very substantial nature. \nIn 2001, there was an increase of 23 percent. In 2002, there was an \nincrease of 10.6 percent. In 2003, there was an increase of 21.6 \npercent. And the items are funded on a level this year. It is relevant \nto note that on the funding for the National Institute of Nursing \nResearch that there has been an increase this year from $130.5 million, \napproximately, to $135.5 million, for a $5 million increase.\n  I think it is also appropriate to note that we assisted the nurses in \ntheir effort to have standing to anesthesiology where we finally worked \nout an arrangement where it would be up to the Governor of each State \nto authorize payments, Medicaid-Medicare, to nurses who are so \ncertified so that they did not have to necessarily be an M.D. \nanesthesiologist. The nursing issue is one of tremendous concern.\n  As I look over the Mikulski-Collins amendment for an additional $63 \nmillion and I look over the items which we are funding in an effort to \nsee if we couldn't make some accommodation, it is a matter of staying \nwithin our 302(b) allocation or cutting somewhere. I do not think \nanyone would like to cut low-income home energy assistance or community \nhealth services or Head Start or the NIH.\n  As we wrestle with the import of the Mikulski-Collins amendment, we \nare seeking a way to, if it is possible, have some offset which would \nenable us to find a way to increase funding for nursing. But an offset \nis going to require a cut somewhere, and that is the managers' \nresponsibility to try to balance out all of the competing interests.\n  Mr. President, if there still is no Senator on the floor and no one \nhas heeded my latest call to come to the floor, in the absence of any \nSenator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dayton are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DAYTON. Also, Mr. President, I have been here this afternoon and \nhave expressed my concern for the measures in the Federal Aviation \nAdministration conference report.\n  I am not going to consume time since we are proceeding to a time of \nvoting on some of these important education amendments, including one \nof my own for funding for special education. But I do want to say again \nthat this matter, before it comes before the Senate, must be resolved, \nor I will have to be back here in more of an obstructionist mode than I \nwas called upon to do today. And that would be something I would prefer \nto avoid and see this matter resolved in some other way. I will be \nworking with my colleagues to see that occurs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Dorgan amendment No. 1553 occur today at 5:45; further \nthat following that vote, the Senate vote in relation to the Dayton \namendment No. 1554; provided that no amendments be in order to either \namendment prior to the votes; finally, there will be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, is the manager of the bill \ngoing to raise points of order on these two amendments?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I had previously stated that I would raise points \nof order.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if we might be able to accomplish that now \nto save a little time so we might not have to go through that later.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would be agreeable to doing that. With \nrespect to the Dorgan amendment, I raise a point of order, under \nsection 504 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n2004, that the amendment exceeds discretionary spending limits \nspecified in this section and is therefore not in order.\n  Mr. REID. I would move to waive that and ask unanimous consent that \nwe be able to handle both of these points of order at the same time. I \nask unanimous consent that it be in order to waive the two points of \norder en bloc. And then I would ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is agreeable with me. I had intended \nto say that as to the Dayton amendment, I raise a point of order under \nsection 302(f) of the Budget Act, as amended, that the amendment \nprovides budget authority and outlays in excess of the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocations under the fiscal year 2004 concurrent resolution on \nthe budget and is not in order. And if the Senator from Nevada is \nsaying he wants to raise two motions to waive en bloc, that is fine.\n  Mr. REID. That is the wish of the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it shall be in order to \nraise both points of order at this time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Obviously it is going to require \ntwo votes on the waiver of the points of order to the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. May I ask the Chair, the intent is to have the vote on \nthe Dorgan-Inhofe amendment followed by 2 minutes equally divided \nbetween myself and whoever, followed by a vote on waiving the Budget \nAct on my amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The statement by the Senator from Minnesota is accurate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion to waive is \nconsidered made on both points of order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I don't see any other Senator on the \nfloor to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me to, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order that the yeas and nays be allowed \non both waivers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                         A Transportation Bill\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to September 11, I proposed \nlegislation called the American Marshal Plan. This legislation received \nthe support of the National Council of Mayors and other governmental \nentities, recognizing that it was extremely important that our country \ndo something about the deteriorating infrastructure. Hearings were \nheld. We had mayors from around the country testify as to the state of \nthe infrastructure in their cities. We were moving along very well \nuntil September 11 and then we were certainly distracted from this and \nmany other things. We have been trying now for many months.\n  I am ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation. There is \nno bill more important to States--I say that without any question--\nevery 6 years than the 6-year Transportation bill. It deals with \nhighways, but it also importantly today deals with mass transit. I \nthink it is a blot on this Congress that we do not have a \nTransportation bill. We have not even had a markup in committee. I am \nterribly disappointed that this is the case. We will not be able to do \na highway bill this year.\n  It only makes sense that when we haven't had a markup in committee on \na bill that is going to handle the highway and transit needs of this \ncountry for 6 years, it takes a little bit of discussion in the \nsubcommittee, in the committee, and certainly on the floor. I would \nhope that the Republican leadership is at least anticipating that we \nwill do a reasonable extension so that States around the country can at \nleast go forward. It is better than doing no bill.\n  The State of Nevada is a rapidly growing State. We have tremendous \nhighways needs, and now with the tremendous growth that has taken place \nin the Las Vegas and Reno areas, we have mass transit needs.\n  We are in the process of opening a monorail system. We are \nanticipating a light rail system. We have needs not only for our \nhighways but also our mass transit. This is the way it is all over the \ncountry. It is beyond my ability to comprehend how we talk about all \nthat we are going to do but have not mentioned the highway bill.\n  I am reminded of your father, the chairman of the full committee, who \ndid a highway bill. I served on that committee. I have served on that \ncommittee since I have been in the Senate. The late great John Chafee \npushed a highway bill. He was a person who was able to compromise. He \nunderstood that legislation is the art of compromise. But in this forum \nwe are now in, it is either their way or no way. We have no bill.\n  I worked, when I first came here, with Senator Stafford of Vermont. \nHe is a wonderful gentleman to whom I wrote a letter recently. I can't \nremember, I think it was on his 90th birthday. He was old and still \nvery healthy. We have done a highway bill with Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Baucus. It appears we will not do a highway bill now. I think \nthat is just bad government. I don't know how anyone can take pride in \nnot having a highway bill. We have funding problems.\n  Remember, these are not taxes that we are suddenly going to assess \nthe American people to pay for highway and transit. Every time someone \ngoes to buy a gallon of gas for their car, they pay a tax; it goes into \na trust fund. We use these trust fund moneys for these bills that come \nup every 6 years. People ask, Who is paying for mass transit? A \ndecision was made many years ago that because every person we put on \nmass transit takes pressure off the highways, we would allocate about \n20 percent of our highway funds to mass transit.\n  It helps our highway programs generally. All we want to do is spend \nthe trust fund money, but this administration will not let us do that. \nThey are afraid if we spend the money in the trust fund--it should not \nbe a slush fund; it is a trust fund--they are afraid if we spend the \nmoney collected for the purpose of building highways, we will make the \ndeficit look bigger. I don't know how we could make it look bigger. The \ndeficit now is about $500 billion, and if we add the Social Security \nsurpluses, which are masking the deficit, it is near $600 billion for 1 \nyear, the largest deficit in the history of this country by far.\n  Also, people are trying to rewrite the endangered species act, clean \nair act, and historical preservation laws in a highway bill. That is \nnot the place to do that, Mr. President.\n  I hope some attention will be focused on what this Senate is not \ndoing, not passing a highway bill. If we do not do a bill at the right \ntime, we will have problems letting construction because some States \nhave very cold weather and they have to plan their construction needs \nto meet the weather of that particular State. If we fail to pass a \nlong-term bill, it takes away all the ability of State highway \nengineers, managers, and State highway directors to plan ahead. The way \nwe are able to get the most money out of the trust fund dollars is to \ndo a 6-year bill. Doing a bill a year at a time costs a lot more money.\n  There are issues that are on the must-do list. I don't know the exact \nnumber of times we have voted on whether to invoke cloture on Estrada, \nwho wants to be a circuit court judge, but I think it is seven, eight, \nmaybe 10 times. It is a total, absolute waste of the Senate's time. A \nvote has not changed from the time the first vote occurred to the last \none, but yet it is time the Senate is taking. Why aren't we spending \nthat time on the highway bill?\n  A lot of time is spent by the majority talking about the Senate \nDemocrats are so hard to deal with; they are not allowing the President \nto have his judges. We have approved--I don't know the exact number; I \nthink it is around 140--140, and we have not approved three. We waste \nso much time here on issues that do not advance the needs of this \ncountry.\n  The appropriations bill is an important bill. I think we have had \nsome important discussion and debate. Tomorrow we have 11 amendments \nlined up to be offered on this bill. It is important we move this bill \nas quickly as we can. But in the process, talking about the things that \nwe must do, I would hope people would understand the importance of a \nhighway bill: For every billion dollars we spend on highways or \ninfrastructure development generally, 47,000 jobs are created, high-\npaying jobs. That does not include the jobs that spin off from those \njobs. For every one of those 47,000 people working, they are able to \nbuy a new car, recarpet their home, buy a home, buy a TV set, and then \nin turn other people work.\n  I guess this administration is not worried about employment, which is \nobvious. The previous administration, the Clinton-Gore administration, \ncreated about 23,000,000 or 24,000,000 jobs. Going back to the time of \nHerbert Hoover, under this administration, it is the first time a \nPresident has had a net job loss, which is over 2 million jobs now. It \nseems to me it would be a good idea for this administration to join to \ndo something to push a highway bill to put out billions of dollars for \nconstruction which creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the manager of the bill, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, has made a point of order against my amendment, which I \nthink is curious. I made the point that the same point of order, I \nexpect, would lie against the entire bill. The Senator from \nPennsylvania asked the Chair that question, and the Chair said yes, \nboth my amendment and the underlying bill have the identical defect.\n  I think it is interesting that then a point of order is made against \nthis amendment. The amendment I am offering is a bipartisan amendment \nwith Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma. It provides $187 million in \nrestoration of funding to the impact aid program.\n  This is about kids. It is about helping kids and helping schools \neducate kids. This is money that is owed to these school districts. \nEven with this amendment, we will fund only two-thirds of what we \npromised we would do back in 1950.\n  Again, I make the curious point that a point of order has been made \nagainst this amendment, so we will have a vote on waiving the point of \norder. It is exactly the same point of order that I understand exists \nagainst the underlying bill, because Senator Inhofe and I used exactly \nthe same mechanism to pay for this amendment as did the folks who \nconstructed this subcommittee bill.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in waiving the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Please \ntalk to the managers and come forward to offer your amendments as soon \nas you can.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question? \nWhat time does he expect the vote in the morning?\n  Mr. FRIST. There has been no time set for a vote in the morning.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1554\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided prior \nto the vote on the Dayton amendment.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, my amendment increases funding for IDEA \npart B by $11.8467 billion for fiscal year 2004, which is the amount \nthe Congressional Budget Office has determined is necessary to bring \nFederal funding up to the 40-percent level that was promised 27 years \nago. The funding being allocated for fiscal year 2004 would provide \n18.8 percent, or less than half of that 40 percent promised over a \nquarter century ago.\n  President Bush deserves credit for increasing the funding for IDEA in \neach of his three budgets. The Senate deserves credit, along with \nPresident Bush, for increasing that funding. But the fact remains that \nwe are still less than half of what was promised 27 years ago. I know \nfor my State of Minnesota that is money that is desperately needed not \nonly for better special education but for better quality education for \nall schoolchildren because money has to be diverted from regular \nprograms over to special education. This is money we can find.\n  I propose that the budget point of order be waived, and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate be in order so that \nI can make an argument in opposition to this motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we would always like to have more money \nfor virtually every line on this appropriations bill. There has been an \nenormous increase in funding for special education--last year, $1.3 \ntrillion; the year before, $1.2 trillion; this year, an increase of \n$650 million. On a 10-year period, we have practically a 400-percent \nincrease.\n  There has been enormous progress made from 1996 when the Federal \nshare for students was 7.3 percent. Now we are almost at 19 percent, \nalmost at half of the 40-percent goal. While we would like to have \nadditional funding, it would cost about $11 billion more to adopt the \namendment and waive the Budget Act.\n  I do so reluctantly but emphatically.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the point of order made under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 42, the nays are \n54. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that one of the \nunderlying amendments is the amendment offered by Senator Robert Byrd \nof West Virginia.\n  During the August recess, I visited many of my State's cities and \nhome school districts, stopping in to meet with principals, teachers, \nparents, and students to talk about the state of education in Illinois. \nWe have many fine schools, there is no question about it. But we are \nalso being challenged by the fact that we face a sizable State deficit. \nThis year our Governor, Rod Blagojevich, had to find $5 billion in \nsavings out of our State budget, a substantial amount, making cuts in \nmany areas. He tried his best not to cut into State funding for \neducation. Despite his best efforts and the efforts of the general \nassembly, most of the school districts I visited are facing serious \nhardships.\n  Let me give one illustration. In Elgin, IL, they recently constructed \nfour new school buildings that were to be opened this year. But because \nthe Elgin School District has fallen so far behind in State and local \nassistance, they will be unable to open those buildings. So there sit \nfour brand new schools which don't have the staffing and certainly \ndon't offer better amenities than the older schools offered; they just \ncannot be opened. It is an indication of the problems faced by many \nschool districts in my State and across the Nation.\n  When President Bush was elected, he came to Congress and said he \nwanted to be the education President. He suggested that we try a \nbipartisan national approach to establishing better standards of \naccountability for education across America. The President proposed No \nChild Left Behind. It was a unique concept, one which called for \nregular testing of students to determine whether they were making \nprogress and, absent that progress, changes would have to take place in \nthe school district. You would have to find better teachers or a better \nschool environment, principals who were more efficient in delivering \neducational quality, and certainly demands would be made for better \nteachers. All of these objectives were very positive.\n  I sat on the Senate floor and behind me at this seat was Senator Paul \nWellstone of Minnesota. Paul had a passion for education, a teacher by \nhis own profession. He was a great critic of No Child Left Behind. \nDespite the fact that there was strong bipartisan support for the \nPresident's program, Paul Wellstone would stand there with his \nmicrophone day after day and speak to the Senate and the people \nwatching across America and say: Listen, tests are important, but \neducation is about more than just testing. He would say, incidentally, \nif you pass the President's bill, you are going to have to come up with \nthe money to make certain these kids have a chance. If the scores don't \nmeet the norms or standards you expect, what are you going to do? Are \nyou going to help them or merely diagnose the problem and walk away \nfrom it? He was skeptical that when the time came, we in the Congress \nwould appropriate the money to make No Child Left Behind work.\n  That was Paul Wellstone's speech day after day, week after week, \nmonth after month. Ultimately, he voted against the bill. I voted for \nit, but I remembered what he said. Then I went back to Illinois and \nvisited school district, large and small, rural and urban, districts in \ngrowing areas of our State and districts in economically depressed \nareas of our State. I found that many of them were echoing what Paul \nWellstone said in opposing No Child Left Behind. They were talking \nabout the burden on a teacher who comes to a classroom at the beginning \nof the school year realizing that teacher will ultimately be tested in \na high-stakes test at the end of the year. What that test meant to the \nstudents, to the school, and to the teacher was that in order to get \ngood grades on the test, teachers were kind of changing the way they \ntaught. They were no longer teaching in a creative and innovative \nfashion, but they were focusing on answers to the test questions. \nSchool administrators, incidentally, said: Senator, we are a little \nconcerned that the promises made by the Bush administration to send \nmoney to school districts to meet the mandates of No Child Left Behind \nare not going to be fulfilled. The promised money that was to come down \nto the school districts under title I, which is money to help reach the \nstudents who are not doing well on tests and help them to reach grade \nlevel and to succeed, the title I funds promised by the Bush \nadministration under No Child Left Behind, is not going to be there. \nThat is the money that is supposed to be there for afterschool \nprograms, so that some of these same students running into difficulties \nwould have a helping hand after school; and summer school programs for \nthe same purpose are not going to be funded under the Bush budget.\n\n  The same school administrators in Illinois said, incidentally, this \nidea of making certain that teachers meet certain levels of \nqualifications and certification is a good idea, but it takes money to \nreach those goals, to send some of these teachers back for additional \ncollege classes in science, math, or whatever their specialty might be. \nThere is no money for the school district to deal with that.\n  So I heard the story over and over. It came to my mind that Paul \nWellstone was right; No Child Left Behind was a great promise, but it \nis an unfulfilled promise because when the budget was delivered to us, \nunfortunately, the money wasn't delivered with it. Title I, which would \nhelp the No Child Left Behind Program, is underfunded by more than $6 \nbillion in the Senate bill we are considering on the floor. Six million \nkids across America are at risk of not meeting the standards if we \ndon't come to the rescue with the amendment by the Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd. In my State, it would add $255 million in title \nI funding to help more than 740,000 low-income kids meet the standards \nwe imposed--Federal standards we mandated under No Child Left Behind \nthat were mandated, but the program was not funded.\n  Over the last decade, the enrollment of low-income students in \nIllinois public schools has increased from 32 percent to more than 37 \npercent.\n  Districts across the State are really trying to comply with No Child \nLeft Behind standards, but they need the full amount of the funds \npromised to be sent to these school districts, as well as the full \nmandate of the Federal law.\n  Illinois has done a number of school funding studies, and every one \nof them shows definitively that it will take much more money to help \nkids become proficient in reading and math. It stands to reason. If you \nhave a child struggling to learn to read, that child needs more \npersonal attention. But if you have a large classroom with 30 kids or \nmore, the likelihood of personal attention is diminished. So if you do \nnot send the funds to the school district for smaller class sizes, that \nchild who is\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\ngoing to face the reading test has less of a chance of succeeding.\n  The State superintendent in Illinois testified this winter before the \nIllinois House Appropriations Committee that it will take even more \nfunding to help low-income and non-English speaking students to keep \npace with their peers academically.\n  Our State superintendent, Dr. Robert Schiller, also stated:\n\n       Based on current trends, Illinois will fall short of \n     meeting the Federal goal, set forth in No Child Left Behind, \n     of all children meeting or exceeding reading and math \n     standards by 2014.\n\n  Thirty-seven percent of Illinois students fail to meet State reading \nand math standards.\n  As is the trend nationally, Illinois has significant gaps between \nwhite and minority student achievement and between low-income students \nand their more affluent peers.\n  Last month, the Illinois State Board of Education released its early \nwarning list of school districts required to provide school choice, \nsupplemental tutoring, or take corrective action this school year. More \nthan 500 schools in my State are on the list, and the number might go \nup by the end of the month when the final calculations are made.\n  Compared to other States, Illinois has been pretty lucky as far as \neducation funding at the State level. For this next fiscal year, which \nstarted in July, the State was able to increase per pupil and \ncategorical funding to keep school districts on the road to \nimprovement. But beneath the surface, the Illinois State Board of \nEducation and our local school districts are struggling to implement \nthe requirements of the federally mandated No Child Left Behind.\n  District budgets are straining under these unfunded requirements \naddressed by the Byrd amendment. How many Senators in this Chamber \nstood up with great pride and said we are voting for No Child Left \nBehind because we believe in accountability, education is the highest \npriority in our country, and we need to be there for our kids and their \nfamilies? All of us who voted for the bill gave that speech.\n  Look what happened when the Bush budget came down. The money was not \nthere--a $6 billion shortfall in money needed in schools across \nAmerica.\n  We sent out all these wonderful speeches out to be printed in \nnewspapers, and we posed for pictures with students and teachers. But \nmonths later, when it comes to funding the bill we passed, the Bush \nadministration refuses to put the money down and this Congress followed \nsuit and put together the bill before us today which also fails to keep \nthat promise. This title I money was supposed to be the pool of \nresources from which districts would implement school improvement \nprovisions necessary to meet adequate yearly progress. Districts now \nhave to use State and local funds to try to reach those goals.\n\n  Despite an overall increase for K-12 education, more than $30 million \nin cuts and reallocations were made at the State level in my State this \nyear. This includes a significant reduction in the number of State \nboard employees, the elimination of State gifted education programs, \nthe elimination of the State family literacy initiative, and the \nstatewide math education initiative.\n  While Illinois has been successful in keeping budget cuts out of the \nclassroom, that may not be the case if our State remains in its current \nfinancial straits.\n  The impact of the Federal Government's failure to fund title I as we \npromised is more deeply felt at the school district level where the \nfinancial picture is bleaker.\n  Across Illinois, school districts are laying off teachers, cutting \nprograms, and reducing the hours of operation. Sixty-one percent of our \nschool districts are operating with deficits, and here we have a \nFederal mandate from the Bush administration under No Child Left Behind \nthat imposes new responsibilities on these school districts operating \nin a deficit and fails to fund the program.\n  Many of these school districts have had deficits for several years in \na row. This number is expected to rise about 80 percent next year. This \nspring, 62 percent of local bond proposals failed, and 55 percent of \nlocal tax referenda failed. Those are hard to pass in good times. In a \nrecession, they are particularly difficult to pass. And we had a \nrecession which began before this President came to office by a few \nmonths and which has continued unabated ever since.\n  Our State unemployment rate is about 6.6 percent in Illinois. We have \nlost 120,000 manufacturing jobs while President Bush has been in \noffice, and those numbers are duplicated across America. There is \nlittle wonder taxpayers resist the idea of increasing their property \ntaxes at a time when we are facing this recession.\n  In many areas of our State, local revenue increases have been less \nthan 5 percent because they are limited by tax caps. When local \nresources cannot be increased, it makes title I money even more \nimportant to these cash-strapped school districts.\n  For example, in my hometown of Springfield, Public School District \n186 has 36 elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. Just \nover 15,000 kids attend school in that district. Springfield has had \nfinancial challenges over the last several years and has cut more than \n$30 million from the district budget in the wake of the failed tax \nreferendum. This year, six Springfield elementary schools failed to \nmake adequate yearly progress, and they must offer public school \nchoice. Springfield needs every title I dollar the district can get to \nimprove student achievement and get the schools moving forward making \nprogress.\n  What would Springfield do with the money? I asked the superintendent, \nDr. Dianne Rutledge. She said, with more Federal funding, if Washington \nkept its promise to send money for No Child Left Behind, this is what \nthey would do with it. She would hire additional teachers to reduce \nclass sizes, and that on its face is a good idea. I have yet to meet a \nteacher who has prayed for a larger class. They want smaller classes so \nthey can focus more attention on students who need help and even more \nattention on students who are gifted who, with additional time, can do \nextraordinary things.\n\n  She would also operate reading recovery, and hire a school \nimprovement coach for each school to provide intensive and personalized \nyear-round professional development to teachers and staff.\n  If the Senate fails to adopt the Byrd amendment, there will be less \nmoney for Springfield. They will not be able to hire the teachers, and \nfewer kids will have tutors.\n  Let's look at a larger school district in my State, the Chicago \npublic school system. They educate more than 438,000 kids in K-12 in \n602 schools.\n  Eighty-five percent of the children in Chicago public schools are \ndefined as living in poverty. Roughly 90 percent are minority.\n  The Chicago public school system is, in many ways, the poster \ndistrict for setting high academic standards and adopting an aggressive \nprogram for school improvement. Ten years ago, 48 percent of Chicago's \nschoolchildren were performing in the bottom quarter of national \nachievement in reading and math. Today that number has been cut in \nhalf, first by Paul Vallis, who came in under the direction of Mayor \nDaley and brought real reform to the Chicago public school system, and \nthen followed by Arne Duncan, our current CEO of Chicago public \nschools, an extraordinary educator who is doing a great job. He \nreported last week for the first time that number has been cut in half, \nand Chicago public schools are performing above the Nation as a whole. \nThat is an amazing achievement in a district that diverse with so many \nchallenges.\n  Despite the Chicago public school system's dramatic recovery over the \nlast decade, 365 of its 602 schools have been labeled as failing to \nmake yearly adequate progress. That is more than half.\n  The Chicago public schools' budget increased this year over last. The \ndistrict has managed to avoid drastic cuts. Most of the increased funds \nare committed to certain projects, and several of the initiatives are \nspecifically to comply with Federal requirements.\n  To comply with the highly qualified teachers mandate in No Child Left \nBehind, Chicago public schools has just completed work on a brandnew $2 \nmillion database to track the qualifications of each of their 25,000 \nteachers. The Chicago public school system is\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\nlikely to have to create a similar system to track the qualifications \nof thousands of paraprofessionals.\n  Complying with the Federal mandates of President Bush's No Child Left \nBehind has led to some terrible challenges for this major city school \ndistrict. The Chicago public school system wants to invest title I \ndollars in afterschool, summer school, and extended week programs. It \nis required to use a large portion of its limited Federal resources to \nmove kids from schools that are failing to other schools.\n  What would the Chicago school system do with the money in the Byrd \namendment? We asked the finance director, John Maiorca. He would expand \nafterschool and summer school opportunities for students at risk in \nfailing the test. He would invest in supplemental education services \nand additional tutoring for these struggling students, and hire \nadditional teachers to reduce class size.\n  Two days ago, I was at the opening of the schools in Chicago. I went \nto a school on the west side known as Dodge Academy. Dodge Academy \nclosed 2 years ago because it was a failing school, but there was a \npromise made that it would improve and reopen. It has, and it is an \nexceptionally good school.\n  One can tell, walking in the door, that this is a school that is \ndestined to succeed. Not only do they have a wonderful, bright, and \nremodeled building because of a lot of hard work by the local school \ndistrict but they also have some of the brightest teachers. They are a \nschool that is trying a new concept, under the leadership of Mike \nKoldyke, that is going to bring to each of these classrooms two \nresident teachers. So for a year they are going to have teachers in \nresidence who are training to become teachers, working with veteran \nteachers, and then they will move these newly qualified teachers with \nexperience to the failing schools in the Chicago public school systems \nand try to turn them around. It is a great model. It works in \nhospitals. It can certainly work in schools. But it costs money.\n  The money from title I, which would be part of No Child Left Behind \nhad the Bush administration and this bill adequately funded it, could \nhave been used for that purpose, but it is not there. With the Byrd \namendment, it would be there, and so the Chicago public school system \nwould have that opportunity.\n  So right now we are dealing with the broken promises of No Child Left \nBehind, unfunded mandates at a time when school districts in Illinois \nand across America are struggling to survive. How can we, in good \nconscience, impose these ideas and mandates on the school districts, as \ngood as they may be, and then refuse to pay for them?\n  Senator Byrd really is calling to task all of us who voted on No \nChild Left Behind, those of us who stood so proudly by this bill and \nsaid this is the answer to America's education needs. The question now \nis: Will we produce the money it takes to make this succeed? Quite \nhonestly, if the Byrd amendment fails, the answer is no.\n  Many of the same people who took great pride in saying they co-\nauthored this program, cosponsored it, and voted for it, will turn \naround and vote against the funding for the mandates they are creating \nin school districts across America. These are unfunded mandates in the \nmiddle of a recession, at a time of State deficits, when schools are \nstruggling to survive, unfunded mandates from the Bush administration \nin No Child Left Behind.\n  The only thing the Bush administration guarantees it will pay for is \nthe test. So the test will be administered but any effort to improve \nthe scores of students will be hampered, hindered with additional \nobstacles because of the refusal of this Congress to appropriate the \nadequate funds. We need to make certain that the $6 billion shortfall \nin title I in No Child Left Behind is a shortfall that is filled, and \nfilled soon.\n  I rise in support of the Byrd amendment, commend Senator Byrd for his \nleadership, and urge all of my colleagues to put their money where \ntheir press release was. It is not just a matter of taking credit for a \nprogram. Stand up now and appropriate the funds to make it work in \nPhiladelphia, in Iowa, in Chicago, all across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations \nbill for Fiscal Year 2004 provides $137.6 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority and $134.9 billion in discretionary outlays for the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nrelated agencies. These amounts are both precisely at the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation. This is an increase of 2.3 percent in \ndiscretionary budget authority and 6.8 percent in discretionary outlays \nabove the 2003 enacted levels.\n  Including mandatory spending, the bill provides a total of $370.7 \nbillion in new budget authority and $294.6 billion in new outlays in \nFiscal Year 2004. With outlays from prior years and other completed \nactions, the Senate bill totals $456.4 billion in budget authority and \n$453.6 billion in outlays.\n  The committee-reported bill also shifts $2.2 billion in 2004 advance \nappropriations back to fiscal year 2003, pursuant to an agreement with \nthe administration. These advance appropriations were originally \nprovided in the 2003 omnibus appropriations bill to avoid circumventing \nthe 2003 spending limits, an action which the President previously \nobjected to when he signed that legislation.\n  The purpose of this shift is to allow for $2.2 billion in additional \nnondefense discretionary spending in 2004 without exceeding the budget \nresolution's discretionary spending limit. However, since the budget \nresolution set forth discretionary spending limits for fiscal years \n2003, 2004, and 2005, this shift causes the committee-reported bill to \nexceed the 2003 spending cap by $2.2 billion. Thus, a point of order \nlies against the bill which may be waived with 60 votes.\n  Finally, it is also important to note that the bill which effectuates \nthe advance appropriations shift must be signed into law before the \nbeginning of the new fiscal year on October 1, 2003, in order for it to \ncount for budget scoring purposes.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  S. 1356, LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS, 2004 SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2004, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.....................   137,601    318,766    456,367\n  Outlays..............................   134,932    318,694    453,626\nSenate committee allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................   137,601    318,766    456,367\n  Outlays..............................   134,932    318,694    453,626\n2003 level:\n  Budget authority.....................   134,476    289,398    423,874\n  Outlays..............................   126,286    289,341    415,627\nPresident's request\n  Budget authority.....................   137,587    318,766    456,353\n  Outlays..............................   133,708    318,694    452,402\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................   138,036    318,766    456,802\n  Outlays..............................   134,765    318,694    453,459\n \n    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................  .........  .........  .........\n  Outlays..............................  .........  .........  .........\n2003 level:\n  Budget authority.....................     3,125     29,368     32,493\n  Outlays..............................     8,646     29,353     37,999\nPresident's request\n  Budget authority.....................        14   .........        14\n  Outlays..............................     1,224   .........     1,224\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................

The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we just completed a very important vote \nprior to the break. Senator Bingaman and I offered an amendment to \nincrease funding for programs relating to Hispanic children. There was \na point of order raised and that amendment was defeated.\n  I understand that. But I have trouble understanding a communication \nreleased today from the White House. On this very day we were voting on \nimportant issues relating to Hispanic children in America, they \nreleased this communication that talks about an historic partnership to \nimprove educational opportunity for Hispanic children. This is nothing \nbut fluff, big piles of fluff.\n  When it comes to putting the programs where their mouth is, nothing \never happens. We had an opportunity this morning to vote to help \nHispanic children, and what do we get from the White House? We get a \npress release talking about an opportunity to sit down and talk. Here \nis the statement: The partners will work with local communities to \nreinforce positive expectations.\n  The positive expectations were the programs that have been cut and \neliminated by this White House.\n  I hope the American public sees what is happening. What we have from \nthe White House is nothing but piles of paper, nothing to help the \nchildren about whom I spoke earlier today, including Ted Eubanks, \nMississippi Valley State University, or Maria de Lurdes Reynoso, who \ntalked about programs that changed her life, or Oscar Guzman, who talks \nabout programs that have given his family dignity as the first person \nin his family to attend college.\n  I repeat for the third time in these few minutes, I am willing to \nunderstand the defeat that has just occurred where, with rare \nexceptions, the majority voted against the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico and me to help Hispanic children. I understand \nthat. However, to have the hypocrisy, the same day, issuing this \nrelease, ``Historic partnership to improve education for Hispanic \nAmericans,'' is absolutely ridiculous.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1552 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to join with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to introduce a bipartisan amendment to increase \nthe funding for nursing programs. I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will the report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), for herself, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n     Corzine, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered No. 1552 to amendment No. \n     1542.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for programs under the Nurse Reinvestment \n         Act and other nursing workforce development programs)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for programs and activities under the Nurse \n     Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) and for other nursing \n     workforce development programs under title VIII of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296 et seq.), there are \n     appropriated an additional $63,000,000 for such programs and \n     activities: Provided, That of the funds appropriated in this \n     Act for the National Institutes of Health, $80,000,000 shall \n     not be available for obligation until September 30, 2004: \n     Provided further, That the amount $6,895,199,000 in section \n     305(a)(1) of this Act shall be deemed to be $6,958,199,000: \n     Provided further, That the amount $6,783,301,000 in section \n     305(a)(2) of this Act shall be deemed to be $6,720,301,000.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to offer this amendment so that \nwe can really get behind our nurses in this country and deal with the \ncritical nursing shortage facing acute care facilities and other \nimportant facilities that need nurses. This is a bipartisan amendment \nto the Specter substitute amendment. I am joining with Senator Collins \nto offer this amendment, along with the other cosponsors.\n  Let me tell you what this amendment would do. It would provide $63 \nmillion to fund programs that recruit and retain nurses by helping them \npay for becoming nurses. This was created by last year's bipartisan \neffort to pass something called the Nurse Reinvestment Act and also \nother important programs to educate nurses. The Nurse Reinvestment Act \nwas an important bipartisan accomplishment in which we came together \nacross party lines to deal with the nursing shortage. This is a crisis \nthat affects patient care across the country.\n  So, what did we do? We created scholarship programs and we created \nloan forgiveness programs to bring more nurses into the profession. But \nwhile the legislation, the Nurse Reinvestment Act, created the \nauthorizing framework, it did not put money in the Federal checkbook. \nThat is our job in appropriations. We salute Senator Harkin and Senator \nSpecter for trying to fund this, but they are funding it at $15 \nmillion. You cannot keep nurses, you cannot get nurses, and you cannot \neducate nurses to be nursing faculty on $15 million. We need more \nmoney. Where there is the wallet, there is a will on the part of many \nwomen and men who want to come into nursing.\n  We are in a crisis. There are 125,000 nurse vacancies in hospitals \nnationwide. This does not even deal with nursing homes, home health \nagencies, schools, and other sites.\n  The Senator from Maine and I have been champions of home health care. \nShe has the rugged terrain of Maine and I have the mountain counties of \nMaryland, where we know our nurses get on snowmobiles to get out there \nto visit patients who need them. There are just not enough of them, and \nwe need to make sure we deal with this. In my home State of Maryland, \nthere is now a 13 percent hospital nursing shortage; 2,000 full-time \nnurses are desperately needed, not only in the bustling metropolitan \narea of the Baltimore-Washington corridor but in our rural communities. \nThe nursing shortage will only get worse and we expect it will double \nby 2010, to 275,000 nurses.\n  While we have people who want to come into nursing, we have a nursing \nfaculty shortage because nurses have so much student debt that they \nreally do not have the wherewithal to go on to the master's and \ndoctoral levels to do this.\n  I note the Senator acting as the Presiding Officer, Madam President, \nis from North Carolina. She knows we have the wonderful urban areas of \nRaleigh and Duke University, but I have talked to her about going out \nto those rural communities. They just do not have what they need in the \nway of nurses. Yet we teamed up to make sure they could use the \ncommunity college programs to get people into nursing and to stay in \nthose communities. What we are talking about is helping people who will \ncome into nursing. We will provide either scholarships or loan \nincentives if they will come into those critical shortage areas. Isn't \nthis terrific?\n  What we know is many young women and even young men are coming into \nnursing later in life and they have other responsibilities. This is why \nwe need to help them by making nursing education more affordable, \nproviding scholarships in exchange for 2 years, and also financial \nassistance to obtain advanced degrees in order to be able to get our \npeople ready for nursing education. Our amendment funds other important \nnursing programs to educate and train advanced-education nurses, such \nas nurse practitioners, and also in other areas.\n\n  Our chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee faced a very \ntight allocation. They did a fantastic job. What we need to do, though, \nis get the Senate behind them and increase the funding for these \nnursing education programs. We have all of the nursing groups behind \nus. We have groups such as the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, \nthe Men's Health Network, the Federation of American Hospitals, and \nAARP. Why? Because we know behind every great doctor there is an \noutstanding nurse.\n  We need it for patient care. Where there is a nursing shortage, there \nis going to be an impact on patient care. Our patients need it. The \nbaby boomers are getting older. The need for nurses is only going to \nexpand, and certainly by making a public investment to make nursing \neducation more available and more affordable, we are helping not only \nto educate the nurse but I believe we are making an investment in \nsaving lives, in preventive health care, and home health care.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in supporting this amendment and I \nyield the floor so others may speak about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am very pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague from Maryland in offering this important amendment to the \nappropriations bill. Senator Mikulski and I have teamed up on many \nhealth care issues, ranging from home health care, ensuring adequate \nreimbursements to diabetes research, to helping draft the Nurse \nReinvestment Act as members of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee.\n  Today we team up once again to increase the funding for the Nurse \nReinvestment Act and other nursing workforce development programs by \n$63 million. I join my colleague from Maryland in saluting the efforts \nof Senator Specter and Senator Harkin in providing some significant \nfunding for nursing education programs. Our amendment, however, would \nbring the total level of funding for these vital programs up to $175 \nmillion in fiscal year 2004. That is not up to the full authorized \nlevel, but it is an amount that we believe would allow us to make real \nprogress in remedying the extreme nursing shortage facing our Nation.\n  In fact, the United States is facing a nursing shortage of critical \nproportions. Moreover, this shortage is only expected to worsen as the \nbaby boom generation ages and their need--our need--for health care \ngrows. According to the American Hospital Association, there currently \nare more than 126,000 nursing vacancies in hospitals alone. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services estimates that by the year \n2010, there will be a shortage of 275,000 registered nurses, more than \ndouble the current number. In Maine, almost 1 out of 10 nursing \npositions at hospitals across our State is vacant.\n  We also face persistent shortages of certified nursing assistants and \nother front-line health care workers in our hospitals, home health \nagencies, nursing homes, and other health care facilities.\n  The current nursing shortage poses a significant threat to the \nability of our health care system to deliver quality care. The New \nEngland Journal of Medicine published a disturbing study last year \nwhich found that nursing shortages in hospitals are associated with a \nhigher risk of complications and even death. The study reported in the \nNew England Journal of Medicine found that patients in hospitals with \nfewer registered nurses were more likely to suffer from complications \nsuch as urinary infections and pneumonia; they were more likely to stay \nin the hospital longer; and they were more likely to die from treatable \nconditions such as shock and gastrointestinal bleeding.\n  The fact is that nurses are the eyes and ears of our hospitals. They \noften serve as an early warning system when complications begin to \ndevelop. But\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\nthe problems cannot be detected and treated early if nurses do not have \nsufficient time to spend with their patients.\n  Another study reported in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation last year found that each additional patient in a nurse's \nworkload meant an increase of about 7 percent in the likelihood that \nthe patient would die within 30 days of admission.\n  This is literally a matter of life and death. If there are more \nnurses, if hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities \nare adequately staffed with nurses, the quality of care provided to \npatients and the likelihood of a successful outcome are much higher.\n  While the situation is grave today, we face even greater threats and \ncrises in the future. Our current nursing workforce is aging. In Maine, \n61 percent of our registered nurses are at least 40 years old. As a \nconsequence, many of them will be retiring just as we aging baby \nboomers begin to place additional demands on our health care system. \nThe nursing shortage therefore is sure to worsen if we do not make the \ncritical investments today--now. We need to act more to support our \ncurrent nursing workforce and to encourage more young people to choose \nnursing as their profession.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Nursing Reinvestment Act to do just \nthat. This legislation had overwhelming bipartisan support. It \nauthorizes scholarships to nursing students who agree to provide at \nleast 2 years of service in a health care facility with a critical \nnursing shortage. It creates career ladders to help nurses and other \nhealth professionals advance in their careers. It provides loan \ncancellation for nurses with advanced degrees in exchange for teaching \nat schools of nursing.\n  Let me expand on that point.\n  Last year, I had the privilege of meeting with the nursing deans of \nHusson, the University of Maine, and what is now Eastern Maine \nCommunity College. They told me that they are being overwhelmed with \napplications from students who are eager to study nursing, but they \nsimply cannot accommodate the qualified applicants who wish to enter \nthe nursing program. The reason: A shortage of nursing professors.\n  There is a very important provision in this bill that encourages \nnurses with advanced degrees to teach at schools of nursing to help \nclose that gap and lessen that shortage so that we can start training \nmore nurses. It is not only a matter of encouraging more people to go \ninto nursing but also to make sure that we have the nursing faculties \navailable to educate these young students.\n\n  The Nursing Reinvestment Act builds on existing title 8 nursing \neducation programs that provide loan repayments to nurses, improves the \ndiversity of the nursing workforce, and expands opportunities for \nnursing education at all levels. All of these programs play a vital \nrole in recruiting nurses and making sure that they have the training \nrequired to effectively and compassionately care for their patients.\n  The promise of this new law and other nursing educational programs \nwill not be kept without an adequate investment of funds. That is why I \nfelt so strongly about joining with my colleague from Maryland in this \namendment. Increasing the funding level for these important programs to \n$175 million in fiscal year 2004 will allow them to expand to address \nnursing shortages in communities across the country.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to join us in supporting this vital \namendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment of \nSenators Mikulski and Collins that would bring the total funding in the \nbill for these programs to $175 million, the amount requested by over \n30 bipartisan Senators and groups ranging from AARP to cancer patient \ngroups to nursing and provider groups.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that more than one million \nnew nurses will be needed by the year 2010. Yet in my State of New \nYork, the number of undergraduate nursing program graduates has dropped \neach academic year since 1996.\n  Even as the workforce shrinks, the patient population is projected to \ngrow. Baby boomers across the Nation are aging, and their healthcare \nneeds will put an extra burden on the system. In New York State, the \npopulation over 80 will double by the year 2020.\n  As I travel across New York State, every type of community--urban, \nsuburban, rural--and every type of provider--hospitals, nursing homes, \nhome health agencies, hospices is affected by this shortage. All around \nthe State, nurses are facing an emergency of their own. That is why \nlast Congress I worked so hard to pass the Nurse Reinvestment Act which \nwill provide scholarships, public service announcements, and other \nprovisions to encourage people to enter the profession. But the current \nnursing shortage exists not only because fewer individuals are entering \nthe nursing profession, but also because the healthcare industry is \nhaving trouble retaining the nurses already on staff.\n  This amendment will help fund important nurse retention programs that \nwe authorized last year in the Nurse Reinvestment Act, based on proven \nworkplace principles, such as promotion of patient-centered care and \nnurse leadership, that are shown to improve retention. The amendment \ndoes not take any funding from other programs in the bill.\n  As so many studies have shown, our nursing care can often be the \ndifference in medical outcomes. For all the new technologies, talented \nsurgeons, and breakthrough drugs, I want people to remember that \nnursing care is essential in keeping our healthcare system the best in \nthe world. Study after study has cited a direct link between the type \nand quality of nursing care that is delivered and patient outcomes. We \ntrust nurses. In fact in a CNN/USA Gallop poll our Nation's nurses rank \nsecond for their honesty and integrity, with 84 percent of Americans \nrating them ``high'' or ``very high.'' If you are interested in who was \nranked first--it was firefighters, for their selfless acts of bravery \nafter the September 11 attacks.\n  We too admire nurses for their self-sacrifice, as individuals who \nembark on a caregiving profession and found themselves on September 11 \non the front lines of the battle against terrorism and bioterrorism. \nNurses were on the frontlines when anthrax first appeared, when SARS \nhit, and nurses rose to the challenge and continue to rise to the \nchallenge.\n  This is why I am so concerned about the nursing shortage. Nurses are \nmore vital than ever, and that is why we must fund these programs and \nmake good on the promise of the Nurse Reinvestment Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I rise to speak on another matter \nrelated to health care. I commend the distinguished Senators from \nMaryland and Maine for their legislation which I will be proud to \ncosponsor.\n  It is a matter I wish to address regarding the health and safety and \nwell-being of thousands of people in the area of my State of Minnesota \nsurrounding the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization conference report \nwhich was signed before the recess by 24 Republican conferees and none \nof the 14 Democrat conferees from either the Senate or the House \ncontains some very significant measures that were not provided for in \neither the Senate or the House legislation. One of those which directly \naffects my State very adversely would prohibit the use of airport \nimprovement program funds for the insulation of homes and apartments \nsurrounding the metropolitan airport that is in a DNL decibel range of \n60 to 64 DNL. That is a technical term. But it basically means that \nthose who are most severely impacted, most of whom have received some \nmitigation over the last few years through a pool of funds, including \nairport improvement funds, passenger facility funds, as well as the \nMetropolitan Airport Commission's own fees and the like, achieved a \ncertain measure of mitigation. But there are many thousands--over 8,000 \nhomeowners and an estimated 3,200 apartment dwellers--who are in the \nnext phase scheduled to be insulated. And since the airport's location \ndecision was made, the Federal Aviation Administration, as a matter of \nits record and decision, insisted that this program continue.\n  At the last minute, in a measure that was not considered by or voted \non by\n\n[[Page S11006]]\n\neither the House or the Senate in this conference report, a Senate \nconferee reportedly inserted this language into the report. Now it \ncomes back and is scheduled to come at some near date before this body \nto be voted up or down, which is, of course, the purpose of these \ncircumventions of the legislative process. They do not go through \ncommittee for up-and-down votes nor a public debate back and forth. \nThey don't go to the Senate floor for debate back and forth and a vote \nup or down. Instead, they are stuck in at the last minute in secret \nproceedings with not even all of the conferees present--certainly not \nall of the Senators present--and then it comes back in a matter that \nadversely affects thousands of people in my home State; a measure \ninserted without any notification to me, without any discussion by a \nMember of this body at the behest of a lobbyist for Northwest Airlines, \nwhich opposes this mitigation measure, and has done so and is within \nits rights to do so but is responsible for altering an agreement that \nhas been reached; a record of decision made by the FAA as part of the \napproval of this airport expansion which, if Northwest Airlines wants \nto alter or eliminate, as they say they do, it is responsible for doing \nso in a public process before a public body, and not by sneaking in an \namendment or language into a conference report that was not considered \nor voted on by either the Senate or the House.\n  I find it highly objectionable that a Senator from another State \nwould act in such a way as to adversely affect, to cause potential \nharm, if this were to go through, to thousands of constituents in my \nState without consultation, without discussion or forewarning.\n  Regretfully, this is not the only instance in this legislation of \nmatters that were added to it in conference that received no \nconsideration in either the House of Representatives or in the Senate, \nlanguage that runs directly contrary to what the Senate adopted. I \nspeak specifically of the Senate adopting the Lautenberg amendment \nwhich prohibited privatization of our air traffic control system.\n  Despite that amendment being added to the Senate bill, being the \nofficial position of the Senate, despite the fact that the House did \nnot consider the matter, as the House bill was silent on it, out of \nthis conference committee comes a report which would immediately, upon \nenactment, provide for partial privatization, for the privatization, \nfirst, of smaller airports around the country.\n  Curiously enough, certain States, those that are proponents of this \nmeasure, were exempted from inclusion because I suspect they recognized \nthat this is a highly speculative, highly risky, highly irresponsible \naction, taken with no debate or forethought but simply to fit some \ngroups' rigid ideological biases that the private sector does \neverything right and the public sector does everything wrong.\n  The trouble is, when they get elected with that ideology, they then \ngo about running Government so as to prove themselves right, and they \nsystematically dismantle functions, such as air traffic control, which \nin this country is about as perfect as a human system can be, which has \na nearly impeccable record of performance over the years, by far and \naway the best, most safety conscious, life-protecting, life-preserving \nair traffic system anywhere in the world.\n  Yet this administration wants to start to dismantle it for no cause \nwhatsoever other than, as I said, to fit its own ideology. Rather than \ncoming to this body and having that debate, rather than going to the \nHouse of Representatives and having that debate, they would rather wait \nand have conference committee time where they can sneak back in with 24 \nof their caucus Representatives and Senators and put this matter before \n535 elected representatives of the people, myself being one, who don't \nhave then any opportunity to delete it but simply to vote it up or \ndown.\n  I find this to be an egregious abuse of the legislative process, one \nthat consistently excludes Members such as myself who don't have the \nnecessary years of seniority to be appointed to these conference \ncommittees. It is bad enough that the process is so skewed in favor of \nthose who simply, by the basis of having been here for more years than \nothers, get to dominate that critical phase of the process. But it is \nintolerable to me, to this Senator--it is intolerable--when that \nauthority is abused and those conferees contrive to write legislation \nthat supersedes the legitimate authority of 100 Senators to decide \nupon--by voting, by majority rule decisionmaking--what will and what \nwill not become part of those reports which then, if they are passed \nand signed by the President, become law.\n  That is fundamentally a violation of the trust that the American \npeople put equally in each 1 of the 100 Members of this body. The \npeople of Minnesota, who sent me here, and who sent my colleague from \nacross the aisle, have the same rights to full representation from us \nas do the constituents of the Senators from any other State regardless \nof whether they have been here a longer or lesser time than I.\n\n  For my constituents' own vital interests to be harmed by a \ncontrivance of the process that has nothing to do with its integrity \nbut simply is a reflection of who has the power, who has the money, who \nhas the ability to hire full-time lobbyists to hang around these \nChambers and to slip into conference committees, at the last second, \nwhere no one else is looking or can do anything about it, measures that \nabrogate the public process in my State--I think in any State, but \ncertainly in my State--that is unacceptable and intolerable.\n  With all due respect to this institution, I cannot and will not allow \nthat measure to proceed. As I stated just before the beginning of the \nAugust recess, I will do whatever I must do to prevent the proceedings \nof this body leading up to the consideration of that measure. I hope we \ncan find 41 Members of the Senate who will oppose the conference report \nfor the 2 reasons I have just cited here and other measures that were \nalso added in conference that have an adverse effect, such matters as \nregional airline operations.\n  It also adversely affects one city, Thief River Falls, in my State of \nMinnesota. It imposes an additional $70,000-a-year funding requirement \non them. Again, it is not something that this body adopted. It is not \nsomething that the House adopted. It is something that somebody else \ndecided they wanted to add for whatever reasons.\n  If this bill is not sufficient reason for the Senate to stand up and \nput a stop to this kind of legislative freelancing through conference \ncommittees, then I think the fundamental premise of equal \nrepresentation and the equal rights of each one of us as Members has \nbeen fundamentally decimated, if not nearly destroyed--in some \ninstances is destroyed. And I, for one, am not going to be able to go \nback and explain to the people of Minnesota why I sat quietly by while \ntheir rights in this process were abrogated by somebody else usurping \nthat power and abusing it.\n  So, Madam President, I will be heard from on this matter again. I \ndon't know when the majority leader intends to bring this matter, the \nconference report, to the Senate, but prior to that time, if this \nmatter is not satisfactorily resolved, then I am going to have to \ncontinue to assert the rights of my constituents to the process that \nthis body established and should be following rather than some kind of \nlegislative freelancing, at the last split second, which totally \nabrogates their rights and my responsibilities to protect those rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I see my colleague, Senator Gregg, in \nthe Chamber and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to speak to this bill, and in a \nmoment I will have supportive charts to discuss this bill's efforts in \nthe area of education.\n  Let me begin by congratulating the chairman of the committee, Senator \nSpecter, for bringing to the floor a bill which has made major strides \nevery year since President Bush has been President, but especially this \nyear, under Chairman Specter's leadership, major strides on the issue \nof educational funding. In the context of that funding, relative to \nwhat was done when the Democratic membership controlled this Senate, or \nwhen the President was a member of the Democrat Party, the difference \nis startling.\n\n[[Page S11007]]\n\n  President Bush and the Republican Senate have made spectacular \nstrides in assisting and supporting education in this country while, at \nthe same time, doing so during a very difficult period of America's \nhistory, a period when we are fighting a war, a war which has required \nhuge resources, and a war which has required extreme attention by the \nadministration, and at a time that we have been in a period of economic \nrecession, in a period when the revenues to the Federal Government have \nbeen dropping precipitously because of that recession. Even in the \ncontext of those two very severe restraining events relative to \ndomestic program activity, this President has been willing to step \nforward and focus on the issue of education, try to improve the \neducation of America's children and support that effort with dollars.\n\n  I think before we get into a discussion of the dollars, because that \nis critical to the pending Byrd amendment, I will begin by saying this \ngoes beyond the issue of dollars, this goes into the question of the \nattitude and approach to education.\n  What President Bush has said is we can no longer afford an \neducational system which, year in and year out, in generation after \ngeneration, leaves behind especially low-income children, takes those \nchildren and runs them through the educational system and, at the end \nof their schooling period, leaves them without the skills they need in \norder to compete for and participate in the American dream. President \nBush has sounded a call to end that system and do something about the \nfailures of that system.\n  There are a lot of good-faith people, a lot of hard-working people in \nthe educational community in this country. A lot of teachers spend an \nextraordinary amount of hours, time, and extra effort to try to make \nsure their students succeed. Unfortunately, the fact is that, even \nthough we have radically increased the dollars in education over the \nlast 20 years, the performance of our children has not improved--\nespecially the performance of low-income children.\n  So President Bush said let's try a different way. That is where the \nbill, the No Child Left Behind Act, came in. It says, rather than \ncontrolling the input of legislation, rather than telling local school \ndistricts how to run their schools, let's take a different look at this \nand say, what are the children learning? Let's find out what they are \nlearning; let's shine a light on it. If they are not learning enough to \nbe competitive with their peers, or with what they need to be \nsuccessful in society, then let's put in the remedial efforts to try to \ncorrect those problems.\n  It is an unusual approach in our educational system because, \nbasically, it calls on the educational community to be accountable, to \nactually have to look at what a child is learning and determine whether \nwhat they are learning is what the community expects them to learn. The \nPresident's program, as passed by the Congress in a bipartisan \ninitiative, doesn't set a Federal standard for what a child in the \nfourth grade in Epping, NH, knows; it rather says to the people in \nEpping, you set the standard for what your children should know in the \nfourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Once you have set that standard, you \nare going to have to determine whether your children are learning to \nthat standard, and especially whether your low-income children, who \nhave historically been left behind, are learning to that standard. If \nthey are not, you are going to have to tell the parents they are not. \nYou will have to disclose to the community at large that a certain \npercentage of the children are not reaching the standards the community \nset for those children.\n  It is a radical idea for education to be held accountable, but it is \nan idea whose time has come. So far, the response of the educational \ncommunity has been very positive. Most teachers understand this is a \nlaw directed not in a negative way toward their efforts but in a \nsupportive way, trying to make sure school systems are more \naccountable--especially in those areas where you have schools that have \nnot made the grade, where a majority of low-income kids are failing. In \nother words, they are not reaching the standards of ability a fifth \ngrader should know in math or in English. In those schools, we are \ngoing to try to improve their efforts.\n\n  There is a lot of remedial activity to accomplish that. The President \nnot only set out this new initiative in the concept and the way we \napproach education--when somebody comes up with a good idea for smaller \nclassrooms, more computers, and throws out ideas without any \naccountability as to whether it produces results, instead of taking \nthat input approach, but an output approach, where you actually expect \nkids to learn and you find out if they are learning, and if they are \nnot, you do something about it, especially with low-income kids, not \nonly did he initiate that approach but he was willing to put the \ndollars into the programs that succeed in this area.\n  I think it is important to understand, as we view the debate of this \namendment specifically before us--the Byrd amendment--that the dollars \nthe President has proposed, and which the Congress passed under the \nRepublican Congress, at least, have been a radical increase in funding \nfor education at the Federal level.\n  The most significant reflection is that, as a function of the Federal \nGovernment, education has received more funding in the way of increases \nthan any other function in the Federal Government. You would not \nbelieve that if you listened to the other side of the aisle. You would \nthink it was actually being cut or not maintained. But, in fact, what \nthe President has proposed, and what we have passed as a Republican \nCongress, has been a dramatic increase in funding in education.\n  This chart reflects that. It shows that in 1996, when the Republicans \ntook control of the Congress, but most of the burst occurred in the \nlast 3 years since President Bush has come into office. The increase in \neducation has been 145 percent, whereas the increase in health and \nhuman services is 100 percent. And in defense funding, if you ask a \nperson on the street what part the Federal Government expanded fastest \nin the last 5 years, they would probably say defense because that is \nall you hear about--especially from the other side of the aisle. But \nthat is not true. Defense funding increased only a third as fast as \neducation funding.\n  That really tells only part of the story. The story is what has \nhappened in the context of this President's efforts versus that of the \nprior administration, this Republican Congress's efforts versus the \nprior Democratic Congress's efforts, because we are now hearing all \nthese amendments being thrown at us from the other side about how we \nare underfunding this or that and not doing enough funding here or \nthere.\n  But you have to ask yourself, what did they do when they were in \ncharge? Did they make the type of commitments they are now asking be \nmade by the Congress or did they maybe do substantially less and come \nforward today because it is politically enticing to do so and claim \nthese accounts are underfunded and, therefore, we have to add these \nadditional moneys?\n  Well, I think there are a couple of facts that need to be addressed \nright now. The first is President Bush's funding in comparison with \nPresident Clinton's funding. In the last year of the Clinton \nadministration, $42 billion was spent on education in this country. \nThis year, after 3 years in office, President Bush will have increased \neducation funding by 60 percent over the last Clinton budget, to $67 \nbillion. That is a huge increase and a huge commitment.\n  It goes beyond that. If you look at it by accounts, you will see what \nPresident Bush has done is stand behind his words, especially in \ncomparison to what the prior administration did. For example, in the \nentire period when the Democrats controlled the Congress and had a \nDemocratic President, their increases in title I spending were $286 \nmillion. Since the Republicans have controlled Congress--and primarily \nsince President Bush has come into office--it has gone to $1.2 billion. \nIf you total these in special education and also Pell grants--and we \nhave heard a lot of misrepresentation on the issue of Pell grants on \nthis floor--the difference is that in the period of a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress--especially since President Bush has become \nPresident--the average annual increase has been $4 billion. That \ncompares to about half a\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\nbillion dollars during the period President Clinton was in office and \nwhen there was a Democratic Congress.\n  A Republican Congress and a Republican President have basically made \nthe commitments not only in the area of policy improvement but also in \nthe area of dollars to back up that new policy.\n  It is instructive, for example, to take a look at some of the \npercentage differences between what the Republicans have done and what \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle did when they were in \ncontrol.\n  In the area, for example, of title I, our increases are 320 percent \nhigher than the increases of the Democratic membership. In the area of \nIDEA grants, our increases are 770 percent higher than the increases \nwhen the Democratic Party controlled Congress. In the area of Pell \ngrants--actually during the Clinton administration, Pell grants were \ncut; they fell in funding--under this administration, the increases \nhave been on an annual basis about 10 times higher than what the \nDemocrats did during their period. It is dramatic.\n  Overall, if you were to put it into gross terms, that $4.1 billion \nannual increase in educational funding, which has come about as a \nresult of the commitment of this President to improving education and \nbacking up those improvements with dollars, represents about an 858-\npercent increase on an annual basis over what happened when our \npredecessors were controlling the Congress and we had a different \nadministration.\n  The practical effect of this has been that we have created so much \nmore money flowing into the educational accounts at the Federal level, \nunlike what is represented across the other side of the aisle that more \nmoney is needed. In fact, what is happening is that we have put so much \nmoney into these accounts so fast under President Bush and the \nRepublican Senate that we now have a situation where a large percentage \nof the dollars which we have already appropriated cannot be spent and \nhave not been spent. In fact, of the $31 billion which has been \nappropriated under title I or the No Child Left Behind Act, $9 billion \nremains unspent. It is sitting at the Department of Education waiting \nfor the States to get to a position where they are able to draw down \nthose dollars. And this is not just from last year, this is from 2 to 3 \nyears back, the whole period of President Bush's Presidency.\n  It is not an issue of lack of dollars. In fact, it is just the \nopposite. We are putting so many dollars into the educational accounts \nat the Federal level so fast that, to make sure they are spent \ncorrectly, it has made it difficult for the money to actually be spent. \nWe, obviously, do not want to throw the money out there. It has to be \nspent pursuant to a plan. Every State has to file a plan. But as a \nresult of the increased spending coming through the Bush initiatives, \nas supported by this Congress and especially by the chairman of this \ncommittee, Chairman Specter, who has been funding these accounts, we \nnow find there is approximately $9 billion of funds which has not been \ndrawn down.\n  Today we have before us an amendment proposed by the ranking member \nof the Appropriations Committee--a man whom I greatly respect and who I \nthink all Senators respect because of his extraordinary history in the \nSenate--which is proposing to add $6 billion of spending on to the \neducational accounts. But how is it paid for? I think we need to \naddress that, too, because, of course, all these kids we are educating \nand trying to make ready to participate in the American dream are going \nto have to pay the bills we run up on them if we run them up as a \ndeficit.\n\n  So we put in place this year a budget. It was an idea that has been \nbrought back, so to say, because when the colleagues across the aisle \ncontrolled the Senate last year, they did not put in place a budget. \nWhy? Because a budget requires fiscal discipline and there were, I \nsuspect, some who did not want fiscal discipline, did not want rules \nwhich drive fiscal discipline to be put in place so that spending could \nbe controlled through budget points of order.\n  We had no budget last year. It was sort of a shock really. Here is \nthe Government of the United States functioning without a budget. It \nwas chaos--in fact, such chaos that not only did we not have a budget, \nwe did not have any appropriations passed under the leadership of the \nlast Congress, my colleagues across the aisle.\n  The first order of business when we took responsibility for this \nChamber, under the leadership of Senator Frist, was to pass all the \nappropriations bills from the prior year--almost all of them, 11 of the \n13 had to be passed in this year rather than last year when they should \nhave been passed. At any rate, we produced a budget this year, and we \npassed it.\n  What is the purpose of the budget? The purpose of the budget is to \nput in place some reasonable fiscal controls so that in a time when we \nare obviously running very high deficits as a result of a number of \nfactors--primarily the slow economy which has slowed revenues, the war \nin Iraq, and the war against terrorism--in that context where we are \ndriving, unfortunately, large deficits, not historically extraordinary \ndeficits but still very large deficits--we need to control the rate of \ngrowth in those deficits by having in place a budget which at least in \nsome accounts gives fiscal discipline. So we put in place a budget.\n  The budget allocates to each area a certain amount of money to be \nspent. Even in the context of the very severe deficit which we have--\nand it is significant--the Budget Committee, under the leadership of \nSenator Nickles, agreed to significantly increase the funding for \neducation to try to meet the goals set out by the President.\n  In the area of special education, we increased funding by over $1 \nbillion; in the area of title I, we increased funding by over $1 \nbillion in the budget; and in the area of Pell grants, we increased \nfunding by almost three-quarters of a billion dollars in the budget \neven though that meant that other accounts had to be reduced because to \nget the budget in place and have it be fiscally responsible, that \nrequired, if we were going to increase some accounts, we were most \nlikely going to have to reduce others. We did a budget, and we passed \nit in the Senate, and it was passed by the House.\n  We have in place a budget for this country, finally. We renewed the \nconcept of fiscal discipline through a budget after having abandoned it \nfor a year under the prior leadership of the Senate.\n  That budget sets out these spending goals, these spending limits \nwhich are called caps, the amounts which should be spent in these \naccounts. The leadership of this committee, Senator Specter, met those \ncaps and significantly increased by over $1 billion the spending on \nspecial education, over $1 billion the spending on title I, low-income \nkids, and almost $1 billion in spending on Pell grants.\n  Now we see these amendments coming from the other side saying: Even \nthough we have a budget, we should ignore it and we should fund all \nthese programs, not at the level that has been set by the budget or the \nlevel that has been set by the Appropriations Committee, but at the \nlevel set by the authorizing committee outside of the budget.\n  They are using a gimmick of classic proportions, advance funding, to \nclaim that they are really doing it in a fiscally responsible way. Let \nme explain what advance funding is.\n  When a Senator offers an amendment which increases spending by $6 \nbillion over what the budget allows, and then that person claims it is \npaid for because they borrow the $6 billion from next year's budget, \nthat is not fiscal responsibility. That is a game. Anybody sees that as \na gimmick. What happens next year? You are $6 billion in the hole. So \nnext year you not only have to pay that $6 billion, you have to pay on \ntop of that whatever you are going to pay for the increase in those \naccounts.\n  As a practical matter, it is doubling up the deficit. It would \nprobably be better from a practical standpoint if you did not advance \nfund and you just said: All right, we are going to add to the deficit \n$6 billion outside the budget, and we are not going to advance fund.\n  Advance funding is the worst of both worlds because it takes money \nfrom next year, which creates havoc with next year, and at the same \ntime it aggravates the budget deficit issue. So as a practical matter, \nthe $6 billion that\n\n[[Page S11009]]\n\nis proposed in this amendment will add $6 billion to the deficit, if \nnot this year, next year.\n  Who pays for that? Who pays for going outside the budget? Well, \ndeficits are paid for by the folks who come here to work, who are \nstudents in high school, who are pages. When they get out of college--\nand I presume most of them will want to go to college--they are going \nto get a job and that job is going to have a tax burden tied to it. \nThat tax burden is going to be directly related by how much we increase \nthe deficit today, because they are going to have to pay that bill down \nthe road. It is going to come to them, not to us, not to my generation, \nmost likely, but to my children's generation and to my children's \nchildren's generation.\n  So every time we break the budget, we are adding costs to our \nchildren. These are the same children we are trying to help. These are \nthe same people we are trying to help as they move through their \neducational experience. How are we going to help them when we first--\nwell, unless we follow the President's program, we will not give them a \ngreat education but, more importantly, when you pass on to them a debt \nthat is outside the discipline which is put in place to live by.\n  We put this budget in place so we would have fiscal discipline, so we \nwould not be passing on more of a deficit to our kids than is \nreasonable. Yet these amendments keep coming at us, one after another, \nsaying just add to the deficit, if not this year, next year; don't \nworry about it; it does not matter; it is for education.\n  I think it is ironic because the kids who are supposedly going to \nbenefit are the kids who are going to have to pay the costs, and as a \npractical matter it is not going to benefit them that much. Why is it \nnot going to benefit them that much? Because we already have $9.3 \nbillion of unspent money in these accounts. We have increased them so \nfast that they cannot be drawn down effectively.\n  Now let's go to another issue, this concept that the authorized level \nhas to be funded. This is a very unusual concept for Congress, because \nfor all intents and purposes Congress does not fund anything to \nauthorized levels.\n  Authorized levels are statements of intent, purpose, goodwill. What \nCongress funds is a budget and appropriated levels. But now we hear, \nalmost as a matter of sanctity, from the other side of the aisle that \nwe have to reach the authorized level or we have abandoned the children \nof America.\n  That is a very interesting concept, but they did not subscribe to \nthat concept when they were in control of the Senate. Last time the \nDemocratic membership controlled this body, which happened to be a year \nago, they brought forward an appropriations bill under Labor-HHS, which \nis the bill we are dealing with today, and they funded education. Did \nthey fund to the authorized level? No, they did not. They did not even \ncome close to funding to the authorized level.\n  This is the difference. This is the authorized level, the black line. \nThis is what the Democratic budget proposed. It is a pretty big gap, \nabout $4 billion. This was what was actually funded in the Democratic \nbill, which never passed, by the way, nor did the budget because they \ndecided they did not want a budget and they could not pass their bill.\n\n  Suddenly there has been an epiphany on the other side of the aisle. \nSuddenly, the authorized levels are sacrosanct and we must fund the \nauthorized level. Well, I suggest there is a touch of inconsistency, \nespecially in light of the track record we confront when we look at the \nfacts.\n  So we are turning to the basic underlying point, and that is this: \nFor the first time in at least a decade, and really longer, we have a \nPresident who even in a period of extreme national difficulty--war \nagainst terrorists who are set on destroying our Nation and killing \nAmericans, and have already done so--and a difficult economic period, \nalthough we are coming out of it, hopefully, a President who even \nduring those hard times, where his attention has obviously been drawn \noff, and appropriately so, to defending America and trying to get us \nback to work, has continued his focus on making sure children are \nproperly educated in this country, and he is especially focused on low-\nincome kids. That is the uniqueness of what he has done.\n  Most of us understand that a child from a better-off family is \nprobably going to be taken care of in the educational system, but the \nlow-income child, who comes mostly from broken homes and \ndisproportionately lives in urban areas, has been left behind for \ngeneration after generation.\n  Now we have a President who has said no longer and who is willing to \nmake this his purpose, even during these very difficult times when his \nattention might and has been drawn off otherwise. He has supported that \npurpose with huge increases in funding. In fact, in the first 3 years \nof the Bush administration, he increased funding more for title I in 3 \nyears than the prior administration did in 8 years by a factor of \nalmost 70 percent. The same is true in the special education accounts, \nand to a lesser extent but to a significant point in the Pell accounts. \nThis is a President who has not only put forward creative and \nimaginative policy to try to finally get a handle on the fact that so \nmany kids are not learning what they need to know in order to compete \nfor the American dream, has not only put together that policy but has \nbacked it up with real, hard dollars. In the budget this Congress \npassed, we backed up the President.\n  Today, the issue is whether we are going to hold that budget, which \nhas these very significant increases in education, or whether we are \ngoing to dramatically expand the deficit in what seems to me to be a \nbit of inconsistency in relationship to what was proposed when our \ncolleagues across the aisle were in control.\n  This committee, under the leadership of Senator Specter, this \nPresident, has done the work that needs to be done, lifted the weights \nthat need to be lifted in the area of funding education, and we should \nbe supporting this committee's mark in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for \nthose comments.\n  Before replying to Senator Mikulski and Senator Collins, we have \nanother amendment which is ready to be offered. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendment be set aside so there may be an amendment \noffered by Senator Inhofe and Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1553 to Amendment No 1542\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Allen, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1553 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the Impact Aid Program)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec.__. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for Impact Aid programs, there are \n     appropriated an additional $26,000,000 for Federal property \n     payments under section 8002 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, an additional $160,000,000 for basic \n     support payments under section 8003(b) of such Act, and an \n     additional $1,000,000 for payments for children with \n     disabilities under section 8003(d) of such Act: Provided, \n     That of the funds appropriated in this Act for the National \n     Institutes of Health, $595,000,000 shall not be available for \n     obligation until September 30, 2004: Provided further, That \n     the amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act \n     shall be deemed to be $7,082,199,000: Provided further, That \n     the amount $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act \n     shall be deemed to be $6,596,301,000.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I offer this amendment, along with my \ncolleague Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma. We do so on behalf of our other \ncosponsors: Senators Lautenberg, Conrad, Kerry, Murray, Daschle, Ben \nNelson, Johnson, Allen, Hagel, Corzine, Akaka and Clinton.\n\n[[Page S11010]]\n\n  I will yield to my colleague, Senator Inhofe, to make his statement, \nfollowing which I will make a statement about the amendment we just \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, our amendment adds $187 million to the \nImpact Aid Program. If it is accepted, that will only put us at two-\nthirds funding. It is important to understand what this is because it \nseems as if we have come back every year since 1997 and had some \nsuccess increasing the percentage of a program that was put on the \nbooks in the 1950s.\n  First, I agree with most everything the Senator from New Hampshire \nstated. When you come up with something like this, you have to look at \nit in the context of fairness and the overall budget. In this case, a \nprogram came along in the 1950s that replenishes money that was to go \nto our schools, that the Government has taken away from our schools. It \nis as simple as that. They federalize land--perhaps in conjunction with \nan Army post or Indian lands or in conjunction with a military base of \nsome kind--and when that happens, that takes the land off of the tax \nbase. So the money that would have gone from that tax base to the \nschools is no longer there. However, the kids still have to be \neducated.\n  In the wisdom of Congress in the 1950s they said: It is not fair. We \nwill have to at least treat these kids the same as other kids have been \ntreated.\n  There is an insatiable propensity for politicians to take from \nprograms and nobody will notice. This program started in the 1950s. It \nwas fully funded. It was fully funded up to 1969. In 1969, they started \ndropping down. In 1996, it was down to 50 percent. In other words, \nmoney that would have been there for the benefit of the children being \neducated, only 50 percent was getting to the kids.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, in Lawton, since 1966 the impact aid for \nFort Sill, which is located adjacent to Lawton, OK, has dropped \nsubstantially, down to one-half in 1996 compared to 1969. This \namendment would slowly bring this up to the point where we would be at \ntwo-thirds funding.\n  Let me describe what has happened since 1996. In 1996, we were at 50-\npercent funding. Until 1969, we were 100 percent, and people left the \nprogram alone. But in 1969 that changed and it went to 50-percent \nfunding. We have been successful since then, and I commend my friend, \nthe Senator from North Dakota. We do not always agree on issues. We \nhave disagreed on national missile defense. We have disagreed on \nAmeriCorps and many other issues. This issue is fairness, an issue on \nwhich conservatives, liberals, Republicans, and Democrats can agree.\n  Due to our efforts primarily, it has gone up from 50-percent funding \nin 1996 to 51 percent the next year, 57 percent the next year, 58 \npercent 2 years later and, if adopted, it will go up to two-thirds. The \nkids will still not be treated fairly, nor will the school districts. \nThey still will suffer from the fact that the land went off the tax \nbase. However, at least we are on the right trend line, and we should, \nin another 3 or 4 years, get to 100-percent funding.\n  I will relentlessly pursue this in any way we have to in order to get \nto that point.\n  Fort Towson public schools in southeastern Oklahoma will gain $51,000 \nof impact aid if fully funded. This would bring it only to two-thirds \nfunding. As a result, they are having serious problems in these school \ndistricts.\n  Oklahoma is not that much different from other States. In the State \nof North Carolina, my information is that North Carolina actually has \nmore impacted students than the State of Oklahoma. I don't know where \nNorth Dakota stands; I am sure we will hear in a moment. However, it is \na fairness issue. Oklahoma is not treated more unfairly than any other \nState but equally unfairly. The students are not getting the education \nthey need because of one thing, and that is they have had the \nfederalized land taken off their tax base.\n\n  I join my friend from North Dakota in trying to pass this amendment. \nIn doing this, a lot of kids throughout America will be treated more \nfairly. Down the road, in 5, 6, or 7 years we will find this program \nwill be 100-percent funded.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for the time he has given me \nand assure him I join him fully in getting this amendment passed for \nthe kids of Oklahoma, North Dakota, and throughout the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased to work with my friend from Oklahoma, \nSenator Inhofe. As he indicated, this is an issue that brings support \nfrom a bipartisan group of Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter sent \non April 14, 2003, to Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, signed by a \nwide variety of Members of the Senate from virtually every political \npersuasion and every corner of the philosophical structure around here. \nIt shows the widespread support for the Impact Aid Program and for the \nfunding for this program that was originally promised.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services \n         and Education, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin, \n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \n         Services and Education, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin: As you \n     know, the Senate Impact Aid Coalition was formed in 1996 to \n     promote and improve the Impact Aid Program. Our coalition has \n     grown from just four Members of Congress in 1995, to its \n     current membership of 45.\n       Our goal for Fiscal Year 2004 is to increase funding for \n     the Impact Aid Program to $1.375.4 billion, a 15 percent \n     increase over last year's conference report funding level. \n     This increase will help local school districts, which have \n     lost tax revenue as a result of the federal presence in their \n     district, to serve their communities and provide a quality \n     education. This increase is also an important step toward \n     fully funding this program, which currently receives less \n     than half of its authorized funding.\n       In a time of budget constraints, we understand that you \n     have difficult decisions ahead, but it is our firm belief \n     that as our service men and women set out to defend our \n     country, we must not forget or ignore the children they leave \n     behind. While the focus on national security and homeland \n     defense is necessary to ensure that the well being of the \n     citizens of our great country, we also believe that Congress \n     must fulfill its federal obligation.\n       As you know, Impact Aid helps to ensure that military \n     children, children residing on Indian lands and in federally-\n     owned, low-rent housing facilities, and dependents of the \n     federal government receive a quality education. We believe \n     that Congress' commitment to Impact Aid is more important \n     than ever. In addition to the funding increase of 15 percent, \n     we ask that you maintain the eligibility of all students to \n     the Impact Aid Program as defined in the No Child Left Behind \n     Act.\n       We stand committed to the Impact Aid Program and are ready \n     to work with you and your subcommittee on this very important \n     issue. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of our \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tim Johnson, Chuck Hagel, Jack Reed, John Warner, Max \n           Baucus, Jeff Bingaman, Byron L, Dorgan, James Inhofe, \n           John Kerry, Daniel Akaka, Pat Roberts, Mike Crapo, Jim \n           Bunning, Ben Nelson, Kent Conrad, Hillary Clinton, \n           Frank Lautenberg, Tom Daschle, Charles Schumer, Barbara \n           Boxer, Russell Feingold, Patty Murray, Jon Corzine, \n           Barbara Mikulski, Dick Durbin, Edward Kennedy, Maria \n           Cantwell, George Allen, Carl Levin, and Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague has well described this \nissue. This is not some extraordinary grant program, some program that \nwill deliver something for nothing to some school district in the \ncountry. This is keeping a promise. What is the promise? The promise \nwas made in 1950 that when the Federal Government comes in and takes \nland or has property that is tax exempt, the Federal Government will \nmake a payment to local school districts in lieu of local property \ntaxes. That is what the impact aid is about. We have other similar \nprograms--PILT, or payments in lieu of taxes--but essentially Impact \nAid is a promise to our local schools who still have to educate \nchildren despite their smaller tax base. Impact Aid says where we have \nproperty, and that property is tax-exempt because it belongs to the \nFederal Government--in most cases, for example, a military base--we \nwill provide impact aid to offset those costs. That is what this is, \nimpact aid.\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\n  In 1950, both President Truman and the Congress said let's do this. \nIt is not fair for the Federal Government's actions to adversely impact \na local school district's financial situation. So they created the \nImpact Aid Program to directly reimburse school districts for the loss \nof revenue caused by the Federal Government.\n  There are 1,400 school districts nationwide eligible for impact aid \npayments serving 15 million children. Let me describe just one of them. \nI toured a school one day in North Dakota some few years ago. It was a \nschool on the edge of an Indian reservation, a public school district \nbut a school district whose property base was largely tax exempt. So it \nhad very little property on its tax rolls, and therefore it could not \nbond because it had such a small property base. It could not raise a \ngreat amount of tax revenue, as well.\n  This is a school district that was in great difficulty. It had \nroughly 150 children, two toilets, one water fountain. In the classroom \nyou saw children sitting 30 in a classroom with desks an inch apart. \nMany were Native-American children. And one little girl named Rosie Two \nBears looked up at me and asked: Mr. Senator, are you going to build us \na new school?\n  Regrettably, I could not build a new school for them, but it was an \nimpact aid school. And the question of impact aid funding bears \ndirectly on how many children are in a classroom, how many lavatories \nexist, what the condition of the building is in which they are going to \nschool. In this particular building, they were holding classes in the \nlower level of the building, but some days they could not hold the \nclasses because sewer gas was backing up on that level. Part of the \nbuilding was already condemned.\n  The question for us is, When a young child walks through that \nclassroom door, are they disadvantaged by having to go to a school that \nis not in good repair? Having to go to a school where classrooms are \ncrowded? The answer is yes, of course.\n\n  I wish I could have told this little third grader, Rosie Two Bears, \nYes, I am going to build you a new school, but I couldn't do that. I \ndon't build schools. But I do come here with my colleague from Oklahoma \nto fight for adequate funding for the impact aid program, to say this \nGovernment has a responsibility to keep its promise--yes, to Rosie Two \nBears, but to other young children across this country.\n  I indicated we have 15 million children in these schools that are \neligible for impact aid. My colleague just told the Senate that if we \npass the amendment we have offered we will still only be providing two-\nthirds of the money we had originally promised years ago as a Federal \nGovernment to make up for the lost revenue in these local school \ndistricts.\n  Some say it is a matter of choice. Yes, it is a matter of choice. \nThere are unlimited needs and limited resources. I understand all that. \nWe propose an amendment that adds $187 million.\n  Let me mention one other fact. The President proposed a cut to Impact \nAid that was very significant, as all of us know. The cut was restored \nback to level funding by my colleagues, Senator Specter and Senator \nHarkin. But just restoring to level funding means these schools still \nfall behind because more children are affected in these impact aid \nschools.\n  So what Senator Inhofe and I propose is to increase Impact Aid to at \nleast two-thirds of the funding that was promised by adding the $187 \nmillion.\n  Our amendment is offset in 2004 by moving the fiscal year 2004 \nadvance-funding back to fiscal year 2003, which is exactly the same \nmethod used by the leadership to increase funding for the underlying \nbill by $2.2 billion. Some say nothing really is happening out in the \nimpact aid schools that would cause us to have to do this. Let me \ndescribe what is happening. Medical Lake Washington State School \nDistrict has scaled back its afterschool and summer programs and is not \nreplacing the four elementary schoolteachers who retired. Why? It \ndoesn't have the money. It is an impact aid school.\n  The Saint Ignatius Montana School District eliminated four teachers, \nresulting in larger class sizes, and was not able to give raises to its \nteachers.\n  The Suttons Bay Michigan School District has reduced the number of \nteaching positions and initiated a pay-to-play policy for participating \nin athletics and extracurricular activities, and reduced spending on \ntextbooks.\n  Oceanside, CA, a big school district, has had to eliminate \ntransportation for 5,000 students in grades 7 through 12, and 139 \nteachers have been let go.\n  Grand Forks North Dakota School District reduced staff, delayed \ntextbook purchases, and delayed capital expenditures for technology and \nfacility needs.\n  These are real examples of what is happening in real schools that has \nan effect on real kids entering classroom doors expecting to be able to \nlearn. We have an obligation, it seems to me, to keep our promise.\n  I said this yesterday, and let me make the point again because it is \nnot an unfair point, it seems to me. We are told that the money does \nnot exist to do everything we want to do. I fully understand and accept \nthat. So if the money does not exist to do everything, then the \nquestion is how do we prioritize that which we believe must be done? \nThe question for us is where do children rank? Where do you put kids? \nAt the top? In the middle? At the bottom? Where do our kids fall in our \npriorities?\n\n  I mentioned this yesterday and someone said maybe it was unfair that \njust a matter of months ago Mr. Wolfowitz went to Turkey and said: If \nyou let our troops go through Turkey, we will give you $26 billion, $6 \nbillion in grants and $20 billion in loans. I supported that. The next \nday I called to find out where did the $26 billion come from, $6 \nbillion of which was direct spending. They said that will come out of \nour priorities.\n  So if we had the money for Turkey and didn't spend it, maybe we could \nuse the money that we didn't spend on Turkey to spend on American kids \ngoing to classrooms that ought to be better classrooms, going to \nteachers who have to pay for their own textbooks, going to schools that \nare in disrepair, that need fixing, going to Rosie Two Bears' school to \nmake that a school we are proud of instead of having it be a school \nwhere you walk through a classroom door and discover that young \nchildren do not have quite the same opportunity because they are \ncrowded into a room and do not have the same capabilities as other \nchildren in other schools.\n  My point is that this is all a matter of priorities and choices. We \nmake the choices. Not our uncles, not our kids, not our grandpas and \ngrandmas. We make the choices.\n  I said when I started, and I want to say it again because my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania is on his feet, that I think the Senators \nfrom Pennsylvania and Iowa did exactly the right thing in restoring the \nmoney that was cut in the President's budget for impact aid. It brought \nus back to where we should be, at level funding, if the goal is only \nlevel funding. But the Senator from Oklahoma and I said, and we believe \nvery strongly, that getting us to just two-thirds of what we had \npromised we were going to offer to these school districts that are in \nsuch desperate financial trouble because they have lost their property \ntax base--just getting back to two-thirds is not an unreasonable goal. \nDoing it by adding the money we propose in this amendment is an \ninvestment in kids and an investment in this country that will be well \nworth it.\n  Again, I say as I close, if you establish priorities in this Senate, \nit seems to me the first priority is America's future, and America's \nfuture is its kids. It is the kids. And education is about preparing \nthose kids for opportunity.\n  I hope very much my colleagues will accept this amendment. It is a \nmodest amendment. It is bipartisan. It has broad support. My hope and \nexpectation would be that with those who signed the letter in April to \nthe subcommittee, with those who have cosponsored our amendment today, \nthat we will be able to have a vote and be successful in adding this \nmoney for the impact aid districts and the impact aid schools around \nthis country.\n  I know this will be a long and tortured trail on the floor of the \nSenate for this particular bill. This bill is a very important \nappropriations subcommittee bill. I serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee and I am deeply honored to do it for a very important reason. \nIt is one of the few committees these days in Congress that is truly,\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\ntruly bipartisan. We work in a way that respects each other and work \ntogether in conferences on appropriations. These are really \nconferences, not conferences in name in which one side never gets \ninvited, but real conferences. So this is a great committee.\n  The opportunity on the floor of the Senate to talk about priorities \nand adjustments in the appropriations process is an opportunity that I \ndo not want to miss. My colleague from Oklahoma would say the same. \nThis is one we do not want to miss.\n  We thank very much the Senators from Pennsylvania and Iowa for \nbuilding back that funding which the President cut. We then ask for \ntheir support for the proposition that we reach at least a two-thirds \nfunding level of that which was promise to the impact aid schools in \nthis country. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the outset I say I am very \nsympathetic to the considerations raised by the Senator from North \nDakota. But the issue is where do we find the money?\n  As I look over a long list of items where we could make offsets and \ncould have cuts, there is not an item or a line that is desirable. \nShould we cut money from the National Institutes of Health? Or from \ncommunity health centers? Or from many other lines? The judgment of the \nsubcommittee, backed up by the full committee, is that we made the \nproper allocation.\n  I appreciate the comment made by the Senator from North Dakota that \nwe did reinstate the funds. The administration had made a request which \nwould have reduced the funding from last year by $187 million. The \nsubcommittee and the full committee have put that money back. I think \nit is worth noting, since 1996 when the funding was $693 million, to \nfiscal year 2003 when the funding is $1.188 billion, that is a 71.5-\npercent increase. Regrettably, that is about as far as we can go.\n  At the appropriate time, for the information of the amendment's \nsponsors, I am constrained to raise a point of order. The leadership \nhas advised the preference is not to vote until about 5:45. That does \nnot lock in a vote but that is the leadership's position because a \nnumber of Senators are off the floor at this time.\n  I, again, urge my colleagues to bring amendments to the floor. We \nhave a list of about 40 amendments. In a relatively short amount of \ntime that quorum call sign is going to go on. As I have said on a \ncouple of occasions, on August 1 and before the recess, the majority \nleader and I had a colloquy and talked about going to third reading. My \nexperience at the Senate has been there have been long delays. Senators \ndo have amendments but wait to bring them. I know that requires \nplanning, but the Senate has been on notice for more than a month that \nthis bill would be taken up on September 2. If we are to complete \naction on this bill, we are going to have to have the cooperation of \nthe Senate.\n  If this bill is not signed by September 30, this bill will lose $3 \nbillion. That is what it will cost if this bill is not signed by the \nPresident by September 30. If there is to be any realistic chance of \nhaving the appropriations bills finished by and large by September 30, \nthere is going to have to be cooperation by Senators who have \namendments but who haven't brought them to the floor. We were assured \none Senator would be here at 4 o'clock. Now word has come that the \nSenator is not going to be ready. That puts the managers, who have the \nresponsibility for moving this bill ahead, at a severe disadvantage.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. In a minute.\n  I understand I don't have the unilateral authority to move to the \nthird reading, but I am going to try to do that if we don't have \namendments come to the floor and if we have to wait through quorum \ncalls for protected other business which is not related to this bill.\n  I would be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have an observation in the form of a \nquestion. Would it be a good incentive for those who take seriously and \ncome to the floor with amendments to offer them quickly and do so in \nrather short order, as Senator Inhofe and I have done, especially when \nit is an amendment of great merit? Would it set an example for it to be \naccepted by the chairman of the subcommittee? That probably is a \nrhetorical question. Let me ask further, if I might: What point of \norder does the Senator intend to make against amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The point of order would be under section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 that the \namendment exceeds the discretionary spending limit in this section and \nis therefore not in order.\n  The Senator raises a very tempting offer. I might almost be tempted \nto say that any amendment that gets to the floor before 3:59 we would \nbe willing to accept, meritorious or not. That is very much in the eye \nof the beholder. Of course, I can't quite do that. But I thank the \nSenator from North Dakota for his diligence in coming to the floor and \nspeaking on an earlier amendment and offering this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, what reward does the Senator from \nPennsylvania suggest for that good behavior?\n  Mr. SPECTER. What was that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was just asking what reward he would suggest for that \ngood behavior. I suggest perhaps a good lesson for others might be to \nsee this meritorious amendment accepted by the chairman. There would a \nrush here in droves to offer them very quickly. But the Senator could \nthink about that for a moment.\n  I wish to ask this question about the point of order. The amendment \nSenator Inhofe and I have offered is an amendment that dutifully \nincreases part of this bill that we think is critically important, one \nthat still falls far short on the promise that has been made over the \nyears in the funding mechanism we use. It is the funding mechanism, I \nbelieve, that in part is used in the underlying bill itself. I guess I \nam a bit confused about a point of order lying only against our \namendment or against some broader construct of what is happening here \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \nanswer to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The same defect would apply to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me make an observation. I do not \ncriticize the defect in the underlying bill. My hope is that the \nSenator will not criticize the identical defect in the amendment. What \nI have done, along with my colleague, Senator Inhofe, is offer an \namendment that embraces exactly the same approach that is used by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa in funding the \nunderlying bill. I take no exception to that at all. I am fully in \nsupport of that. Based on that, I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwill not raise a point of order against the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I do not seek to enter into a \ndisagreement with the distinguished Senator on the point he just \nraised. But as manager of the bill, I feel constrained to raise the \npoint of order at an appropriate time. I thought I would give the \nSenator from North Dakota notice of that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let the Senator from Pennsylvania and me \nand others discuss that off the floor. The only reason I raise the \nquestion is that offering an amendment which uses an identical funding \nsource or the mechanism that is identical to the funding source offered \nby the subcommittee is one that I thought would not engender a point of \norder. At any rate, we do not intend to vote on that at this moment. My \nunderstanding from the Senator from Pennsylvania is that this will \nprobably be dealt with later this afternoon. If that is the case, \nperhaps we can discuss this between now and then.\n  My hope is that the Senator from Pennsylvania will not raise a point \nof order and give us an opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the \nmerits of the amendment inasmuch as the same funding mechanism used in \nthe underlying bill and the same defect would occur in both.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor a question? If he is looking for\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\namendments, would the Senator be willing to entertain one from this \nSenator when this discussion is concluded?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Does the Senator from Minnesota have an amendment he \nwishes to offer?\n  Mr. DAYTON. I have an amendment. Recognizing the generous offer of \nthe chairman of the subcommittee with the 3:59 deadline racing to a \nconclusion, the magnitude of the offer by the Senator from North Dakota \nis so modest by comparison that it should enhance his chances.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, may I inquire of the Senator from \nMinnesota whether the amendment relates to this bill?\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator is correct. It relates to funding for the \nIDEA.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The amendment does relate to this bill?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Yes. The Senator is correct. It relates to the funding \nfor IDEA.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if the Senator has an amendment \nrelating to this bill, it certainly will be welcomed. I ask the Senator \nfrom Minnesota if he would be willing to defer offering the amendment \nto give the Senator from West Virginia an opportunity to speak for 10 \nminutes in advance of offering that amendment.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I will gladly step aside for the Senator from West \nVirginia at any time. I hope the 3:59 offer might be extended to \ninclude 30 seconds after the Senator concludes his remarks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank both of these illustrious Senators, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania who is managing the bill before the Senate, \nand I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for his courtesy \nand kindness.\n  I will be brief. I do intend to speak out of order. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may speak out of order for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the introduction of S. 1576 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1554 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1554.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase funding for part B of the Individuals with \n                      Disabilities Education Act)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. 306. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     the total amount appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to carry out parts B, C, \n     and D of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     shall be $22,109,931,000, of which $20,941,000,000 shall be \n     available to carry out part B of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (other than section 619 of such \n     Act).\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment would meet a 27-year-old \npromise made by the Federal Government to the States and to the school \ndistricts when IDEA was established. The promise was that the Federal \nGovernment would provide for 40 percent of the costs, the additional \ncosts of providing special education services to every eligible \nschoolchild. It is one of the most important commitments the Federal \nGovernment has made for public education, especially at the elementary \nand secondary levels, and the money could not be better spent on behalf \nof leaving no child behind.\n  Sadly, at least in the State of Minnesota--and I know, from the \nobservations of other Senators, in many other States--the funding \npresently is seriously inadequate to provide all of those services.\n  In Minnesota, some $250 million a year shortfall exists in funding \nfor special education which results in education dollars having to be \nshifted from regular programs and services to special education to meet \nthe statutory requirement of school districts to provide services to \nevery qualified schoolchild. The result is that in Minnesota all the \nstudents are harmed by the underfunding of special education, those who \nare the recipients of those services, as well as those who see dollars \nshifted from other programs for their benefit.\n  IDEA funding for part B for States in the current legislation before \nus is set at $9.858 billion. To bring that funding up to the 40-percent \nlevel, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would require an \nadditional IDEA part B funding of $11.082 billion. It is noteworthy \nthat the increase exceeds the appropriated amount. Another way of \nlooking at that is that the current level of appropriated dollars is \nless than half--less than half--of what is necessary to meet that 40-\npercent level that was committed to by the Congress 27 years ago.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire earlier on the \nSenate floor reference the increases in funding for special education \nthat President Bush has proposed, and I commend the President for doing \nso. I have not served during the period of time which the Senator from \nNew Hampshire referenced, so I do not have the basis for comparing the \nperiod of time during the 1990s that he referenced under the former \nadministration with the circumstances that this President is faced \nwith, but it is enough for me that President Bush has proposed in each \nof his budgets an increase in funding for special education, and he \nshould be credited for doing so.\n  But the fact remains that even with those increases up until this \nyear, the Federal share of funding for special education nationwide is \napproximately 17 percent of those total costs. In other words, still, \ndespite those increases over the last 3 years, it is less than half of \nwhat the Federal Government promised over a quarter century ago.\n  I recognize that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, with \nhis responsibilities to the budget and to an allotment for the \nsubcommittee's appropriations, has to or is likely to object to this \namendment, despite it being inserted just before the 3:59 deadline. I \nrecognize this is an amount that goes way beyond the current mandate of \nthe subcommittee. But as my colleague from North Dakota said so \neloquently just a few minutes ago, what we are really talking about as \nwe consider these different amendments in a broader sense is, What are \nour priorities as a Senate?\n  What are our priorities as a Nation? Do we really mean what we say, \nthat no child shall be left behind? Are we willing to put forward the \nnecessary resources to accomplish that? Or is that just a rhetorical \nstatement without proper attribution from the Children's Defense Fund \nand, whereas that esteemed organization has championed the resources \nand the commitments that would be necessary to actualize that \nstatement, we in this Congress and, with due respect, the \nadministration have still fallen short of that responsibility.\n  We had, when I came into office, an incredible opportunity because we \nwere looking at projected surpluses for the next decade of some $5.4 \ntrillion. That is a marked difference from the circumstances which \nPresident Clinton faced throughout most of his administration when he \nwas bringing the Nation out of the previous era of deficit spending, \nwhen he finally, through collaboration with the Congress--the Senate \nand the House--during the last 4 years of his administration succeeded \nin balancing the combined Federal budget. In fiscal year 2000, he \nachieved for the first time in 4 years--and probably for the last time \nin 40 or more years--a surplus in the non-Social Security part of the \nFederal budget; in other words, education, health care, and the like--\neverything except for Social Security, which at this point, this year, \nis running about a $155 billion projected surplus; the rest of the \nFederal budget was balanced. We had the resources projected that would \nhave kept that operating budget in a surplus mode for each of the next \n10 years, according to both the CBO and the OMB when President Bush's \nadministration\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\ntook office in January of 2001. I thought then, as I offered this \namendment at that time, that we had a tremendous opportunity we should \nnot let go by to bring this funding immediately up to the 40 percent \npromised level.\n  That year, in a bipartisan and very genuinely committed way, there \nwas an amendment that was adopted by the Senate that would have brought \nfull funding for special education up to the promised 40 percent level \nover 6 years--5 years too long in my estimation, but it passed the \nSenate. It went to conference with the House. It resulted in a \nprotracted conference committee of almost 6 months.\n  My esteemed former colleague, the departed Senator from Minnesota, \nPaul Wellstone, was championing this measure, among others, in that \nconference committee and insisting that the Senate position of building \nto 40 percent funding for special education over 6 years be honored and \nkept in the conference report. The House resisted and was adamant, and, \nunfortunately, at the very end of the conference, the Senate conferees \nagreed to the House position, causing my colleague, Senator Wellstone, \nto vote against that conference report, as did I.\n  Since then, we have all recognized that the fiscal circumstances of \nthe Federal Government have changed dramatically. I find it a little \nbit disingenuous for the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire to be \ntaking credit for the spending increases for education, which he \nascribes to this administration and this Congress; yet, every time \nsomebody from this side of the aisle proposes also to increase spending \nfor education, suddenly our side of the spending equation is bad \nspending and his side of the spending equation seems to be good \nspending. As far as I am concerned, it can be Republican spending, \nDemocratic spending, or independent spending for education, and it is \ngood spending. I don't care which administration, which session of \nCongress, or which Members of Congress can claim credit for that. I \njust want the credit to be there to be claimed because I know the \nbeneficiaries are the students of Minnesota and, I suspect, all over \nthe rest of the country.\n\n  I am also perplexed when I hear the Senator from New Hampshire, who \nchairs the HELP Committee of the Senate--his expertise and knowledge of \nthese matters is widely respected by colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. But when he says, in effect, as he did earlier today, we have \nput so much additional Federal money into public education at the K \nthrough 12 level that the school districts aren't able to spend that \nmoney fast enough--a couple of months ago, I heard the Senator state on \nthe Senate floor there was a surplus of Head Start positions available \nnationwide, so there were more slots available than there were people \nwho wanted to get their children into a Head Start program.\n  I truly hope if those surplus funds are available, be it from New \nHampshire or any other State, they will be put into a reservoir that \ncould be drawn from by other States. I know in the case of Minnesota--I \nheard the Senator from North Dakota state the same and I heard a number \nof other colleagues, including Senator Pryor of Arkansas--I ask \nunanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. He also shared the circumstances with me of the State of \nArkansas. When I run by the educators in Minnesota the assertion made \non the Senate floor that there is a surplus of Federal funding for \nthese programs, I get absolutely incredulous looks. I find far more \nconcurrence with the Senator from North Dakota, who observed teachers \nin his State who are reaching into their own pockets for hundreds, even \nthousands, of dollars, who go without expenses for basic program \nmaterials, educational materials, trips to educational enrichment \nopportunities, and the like that cannot be funded out of regular \nbudgets.\n  In Minnesota, there is an estimated $250 million shortfall of special \neducation money because of this underfunding of the Federal commitment, \nwhich I can assure my colleagues every one of those dollars would be \nspent swiftly and necessarily and would benefit students throughout my \nState if they were made available. So where these surplus dollars are \nthat States and school districts elsewhere don't need, where the \nadditional slots for programs such as Head Start are residing that are \nnot being filled, I guess I would certainly like to see where that \nexists.\n  I urge the Secretary of Education, if it is in fact the case, that \nthose funds and those slots be reallocated as swiftly as possible to \nStates like Minnesota, who need them and could benefit from them.\n  Yes, Mr. President, my amendment exceeds the budget as it exists \ntoday. I note that when the budget for this fiscal year began, we were \nlooking at a deficit, we were told, of about $260 billion, if memory \nserves me. Now we are told that we will exceed $500 billion. We are \nasked rhetorically where will the money come from for these \nexpenditures. I answer rhetorically, from the same place the other $240 \nbillion that has been added to the deficit this year will come from. \nAnd the Senator from New Hampshire is right--that will come from \npayments made by taxpayers in the future. But if we are going to spend \n$100 billion, as some experts estimate we will, over the next year in \nIraq, if we are going to spend 10 percent or 15 percent of that amount \nin Afghanistan, if we are going to spend $15 billion to address the \nAIDS crisis in Africa over the next few years, as the President \nproposed--and those are all either necessary or very worthwhile \nhumanitarian and strategic expenditures, but if we are talking about \nadditional spending on the magnitude of $15 billion, $100 billion over \nthe course of a year, how is it that we always run out of resources \nwhen it comes to children, when it comes to especially schoolchildren \nwith special needs, when it comes to those who will be left behind in \nMinnesota and I suspect will be left behind in 49 other States if these \nadditional resources are not provided?\n\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the opportunity to offer \nthis amendment. I hope it will be considered in the broader context of \nthe priorities of this body for the children of today and tomorrow. I \nrespectfully suggest it is money that will be extremely well spent. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for \na question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the manager of \nthe bill is working to set up a series of votes beginning at 5:45 p.m. \ntoday; is that right?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Correct.\n  Mr. REID. Just to alert Members, we are going to have one, possibly \nthree votes at 5:45 p.m.; is that right?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had commented earlier today that there \nwas an expectation of voting at 5:45 p.m., that there were a series of \nmeetings at the White House and other places which would keep Senators \naway from the floor until that time. I just responded to the question \nfrom the Senator from Nevada that it is the likelihood, but it is not \nlocked in, that we will vote at 5:45 p.m. How many votes we will have \nwe are not certain at this point.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for offering this \namendment. The issue on special education is one of great importance. \nThe Federal Government does have a responsibility to come to the 40 \npercent level. We have been far from it, but we have made very \nsubstantial progress. I think it is accurate to say even enormous \nprogress.\n  Over the course of the past several years, we have made major \nincreases. When I became chairman of this subcommittee in 1995, in \nconjunction with Senator Harkin, we made special education a priority, \nand for the fiscal year 1997, we increased special education by \napproximately $800 million. The next year, $700 million. The following \nyear, $500 million. The year after that, $580 million, $450 million, \n$1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, and this year there is a projected increase \nof approximately $650 million.\n\n  If you take a comparison from the year 1994, the special education \nappropriation was slightly over $2 billion,\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\n$2.05 billion. This year we are projecting it at $9.85 billion, which \nis almost four times as much, almost 400 percent, slightly less. So we \nhave moved up very materially.\n  I do not have the statistics prior to the year 1996 on the Federal \nshare per student spending, but in 1996, it was 7.3 percent. We have \nnow advanced that to 18.7 percent. We are almost halfway to 40 percent.\n  If we were to fully fund IDEA, it would take another $11 billion to \n$12 billion on top of the amount of money which we have allocated. \nWhile I have deep respect for the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMinnesota, I think it might even be possible he does not have an \nexpectation that we are going to have $11 billion or $12 billion more \nfor this item, much as we would like to and much as the Federal \ncommitment is there. But I think the progress has been enormous.\n  I make a special compliment to the senior Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Gregg, who has been at the forefront of this item, going back to \nhis earlier days in the House and his earlier days as Governor of New \nHampshire seeing the importance of this item.\n  It is an item of great importance for me. We are making a lot of \nprogress. It would be nice to do more, but I think everyone understands \nwe are far from being able to add an additional $10 billion, $11 \nbillion, $12 billion here.\n  Again, for purposes of information, I will be constrained to raise a \nbudget point of order when we take up this matter for a vote at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. President, let me again issue a call for amendments. Third \nreading may be as remote as full funding for IDEA, but it is an idea \nwhose time may come, if not this afternoon, perhaps this evening or \nperhaps tomorrow morning.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1552\n\n  Mr. President, I have not made any manager's comments on the \namendment offered by Senator Mikulski and Senator Collins on the \nnursing issue. That is an item of great concern. There is a tremendous \nnursing shortage in the United States. The Mikulski-Collins amendment \nseeks to raise the funding from $112.7 million to $175.7 million for a \n$63 million increase.\n  I note that there have been increases of a very substantial nature. \nIn 2001, there was an increase of 23 percent. In 2002, there was an \nincrease of 10.6 percent. In 2003, there was an increase of 21.6 \npercent. And the items are funded on a level this year. It is relevant \nto note that on the funding for the National Institute of Nursing \nResearch that there has been an increase this year from $130.5 million, \napproximately, to $135.5 million, for a $5 million increase.\n  I think it is also appropriate to note that we assisted the nurses in \ntheir effort to have standing to anesthesiology where we finally worked \nout an arrangement where it would be up to the Governor of each State \nto authorize payments, Medicaid-Medicare, to nurses who are so \ncertified so that they did not have to necessarily be an M.D. \nanesthesiologist. The nursing issue is one of tremendous concern.\n  As I look over the Mikulski-Collins amendment for an additional $63 \nmillion and I look over the items which we are funding in an effort to \nsee if we couldn't make some accommodation, it is a matter of staying \nwithin our 302(b) allocation or cutting somewhere. I do not think \nanyone would like to cut low-income home energy assistance or community \nhealth services or Head Start or the NIH.\n  As we wrestle with the import of the Mikulski-Collins amendment, we \nare seeking a way to, if it is possible, have some offset which would \nenable us to find a way to increase funding for nursing. But an offset \nis going to require a cut somewhere, and that is the managers' \nresponsibility to try to balance out all of the competing interests.\n  Mr. President, if there still is no Senator on the floor and no one \nhas heeded my latest call to come to the floor, in the absence of any \nSenator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dayton are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DAYTON. Also, Mr. President, I have been here this afternoon and \nhave expressed my concern for the measures in the Federal Aviation \nAdministration conference report.\n  I am not going to consume time since we are proceeding to a time of \nvoting on some of these important education amendments, including one \nof my own for funding for special education. But I do want to say again \nthat this matter, before it comes before the Senate, must be resolved, \nor I will have to be back here in more of an obstructionist mode than I \nwas called upon to do today. And that would be something I would prefer \nto avoid and see this matter resolved in some other way. I will be \nworking with my colleagues to see that occurs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Dorgan amendment No. 1553 occur today at 5:45; further \nthat following that vote, the Senate vote in relation to the Dayton \namendment No. 1554; provided that no amendments be in order to either \namendment prior to the votes; finally, there will be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, is the manager of the bill \ngoing to raise points of order on these two amendments?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I had previously stated that I would raise points \nof order.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if we might be able to accomplish that now \nto save a little time so we might not have to go through that later.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would be agreeable to doing that. With \nrespect to the Dorgan amendment, I raise a point of order, under \nsection 504 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n2004, that the amendment exceeds discretionary spending limits \nspecified in this section and is therefore not in order.\n  Mr. REID. I would move to waive that and ask unanimous consent that \nwe be able to handle both of these points of order at the same time. I \nask unanimous consent that it be in order to waive the two points of \norder en bloc. And then I would ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is agreeable with me. I had intended \nto say that as to the Dayton amendment, I raise a point of order under \nsection 302(f) of the Budget Act, as amended, that the amendment \nprovides budget authority and outlays in excess of the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocations under the fiscal year 2004 concurrent resolution on \nthe budget and is not in order. And if the Senator from Nevada is \nsaying he wants to raise two motions to waive en bloc, that is fine.\n  Mr. REID. That is the wish of the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it shall be in order to \nraise both points of order at this time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Obviously it is going to require \ntwo votes on the waiver of the points of order to the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. May I ask the Chair, the intent is to have the vote on \nthe Dorgan-Inhofe amendment followed by 2 minutes equally divided \nbetween myself and whoever, followed by a vote on waiving the Budget \nAct on my amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The statement by the Senator from Minnesota is accurate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion to waive is \nconsidered made on both points of order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I don't see any other Senator on the \nfloor to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me to, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order that the yeas and nays be allowed \non both waivers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                         A Transportation Bill\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to September 11, I proposed \nlegislation called the American Marshal Plan. This legislation received \nthe support of the National Council of Mayors and other governmental \nentities, recognizing that it was extremely important that our country \ndo something about the deteriorating infrastructure. Hearings were \nheld. We had mayors from around the country testify as to the state of \nthe infrastructure in their cities. We were moving along very well \nuntil September 11 and then we were certainly distracted from this and \nmany other things. We have been trying now for many months.\n  I am ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation. There is \nno bill more important to States--I say that without any question--\nevery 6 years than the 6-year Transportation bill. It deals with \nhighways, but it also importantly today deals with mass transit. I \nthink it is a blot on this Congress that we do not have a \nTransportation bill. We have not even had a markup in committee. I am \nterribly disappointed that this is the case. We will not be able to do \na highway bill this year.\n  It only makes sense that when we haven't had a markup in committee on \na bill that is going to handle the highway and transit needs of this \ncountry for 6 years, it takes a little bit of discussion in the \nsubcommittee, in the committee, and certainly on the floor. I would \nhope that the Republican leadership is at least anticipating that we \nwill do a reasonable extension so that States around the country can at \nleast go forward. It is better than doing no bill.\n  The State of Nevada is a rapidly growing State. We have tremendous \nhighways needs, and now with the tremendous growth that has taken place \nin the Las Vegas and Reno areas, we have mass transit needs.\n  We are in the process of opening a monorail system. We are \nanticipating a light rail system. We have needs not only for our \nhighways but also our mass transit. This is the way it is all over the \ncountry. It is beyond my ability to comprehend how we talk about all \nthat we are going to do but have not mentioned the highway bill.\n  I am reminded of your father, the chairman of the full committee, who \ndid a highway bill. I served on that committee. I have served on that \ncommittee since I have been in the Senate. The late great John Chafee \npushed a highway bill. He was a person who was able to compromise. He \nunderstood that legislation is the art of compromise. But in this forum \nwe are now in, it is either their way or no way. We have no bill.\n  I worked, when I first came here, with Senator Stafford of Vermont. \nHe is a wonderful gentleman to whom I wrote a letter recently. I can't \nremember, I think it was on his 90th birthday. He was old and still \nvery healthy. We have done a highway bill with Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Baucus. It appears we will not do a highway bill now. I think \nthat is just bad government. I don't know how anyone can take pride in \nnot having a highway bill. We have funding problems.\n  Remember, these are not taxes that we are suddenly going to assess \nthe American people to pay for highway and transit. Every time someone \ngoes to buy a gallon of gas for their car, they pay a tax; it goes into \na trust fund. We use these trust fund moneys for these bills that come \nup every 6 years. People ask, Who is paying for mass transit? A \ndecision was made many years ago that because every person we put on \nmass transit takes pressure off the highways, we would allocate about \n20 percent of our highway funds to mass transit.\n  It helps our highway programs generally. All we want to do is spend \nthe trust fund money, but this administration will not let us do that. \nThey are afraid if we spend the money in the trust fund--it should not \nbe a slush fund; it is a trust fund--they are afraid if we spend the \nmoney collected for the purpose of building highways, we will make the \ndeficit look bigger. I don't know how we could make it look bigger. The \ndeficit now is about $500 billion, and if we add the Social Security \nsurpluses, which are masking the deficit, it is near $600 billion for 1 \nyear, the largest deficit in the history of this country by far.\n  Also, people are trying to rewrite the endangered species act, clean \nair act, and historical preservation laws in a highway bill. That is \nnot the place to do that, Mr. President.\n  I hope some attention will be focused on what this Senate is not \ndoing, not passing a highway bill. If we do not do a bill at the right \ntime, we will have problems letting construction because some States \nhave very cold weather and they have to plan their construction needs \nto meet the weather of that particular State. If we fail to pass a \nlong-term bill, it takes away all the ability of State highway \nengineers, managers, and State highway directors to plan ahead. The way \nwe are able to get the most money out of the trust fund dollars is to \ndo a 6-year bill. Doing a bill a year at a time costs a lot more money.\n  There are issues that are on the must-do list. I don't know the exact \nnumber of times we have voted on whether to invoke cloture on Estrada, \nwho wants to be a circuit court judge, but I think it is seven, eight, \nmaybe 10 times. It is a total, absolute waste of the Senate's time. A \nvote has not changed from the time the first vote occurred to the last \none, but yet it is time the Senate is taking. Why aren't we spending \nthat time on the highway bill?\n  A lot of time is spent by the majority talking about the Senate \nDemocrats are so hard to deal with; they are not allowing the President \nto have his judges. We have approved--I don't know the exact number; I \nthink it is around 140--140, and we have not approved three. We waste \nso much time here on issues that do not advance the needs of this \ncountry.\n  The appropriations bill is an important bill. I think we have had \nsome important discussion and debate. Tomorrow we have 11 amendments \nlined up to be offered on this bill. It is important we move this bill \nas quickly as we can. But in the process, talking about the things that \nwe must do, I would hope people would understand the importance of a \nhighway bill: For every billion dollars we spend on highways or \ninfrastructure development generally, 47,000 jobs are created, high-\npaying jobs. That does not include the jobs that spin off from those \njobs. For every one of those 47,000 people working, they are able to \nbuy a new car, recarpet their home, buy a home, buy a TV set, and then \nin turn other people work.\n  I guess this administration is not worried about employment, which is \nobvious. The previous administration, the Clinton-Gore administration, \ncreated about 23,000,000 or 24,000,000 jobs. Going back to the time of \nHerbert Hoover, under this administration, it is the first time a \nPresident has had a net job loss, which is over 2 million jobs now. It \nseems to me it would be a good idea for this administration to join to \ndo something to push a highway bill to put out billions of dollars for \nconstruction which creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the manager of the bill, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, has made a point of order against my amendment, which I \nthink is curious. I made the point that the same point of order, I \nexpect, would lie against the entire bill. The Senator from \nPennsylvania asked the Chair that question, and the Chair said yes, \nboth my amendment and the underlying bill have the identical defect.\n  I think it is interesting that then a point of order is made against \nthis amendment. The amendment I am offering is a bipartisan amendment \nwith Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma. It provides $187 million in \nrestoration of funding to the impact aid program.\n  This is about kids. It is about helping kids and helping schools \neducate kids. This is money that is owed to these school districts. \nEven with this amendment, we will fund only two-thirds of what we \npromised we would do back in 1950.\n  Again, I make the curious point that a point of order has been made \nagainst this amendment, so we will have a vote on waiving the point of \norder. It is exactly the same point of order that I understand exists \nagainst the underlying bill, because Senator Inhofe and I used exactly \nthe same mechanism to pay for this amendment as did the folks who \nconstructed this subcommittee bill.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in waiving the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Please \ntalk to the managers and come forward to offer your amendments as soon \nas you can.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question? \nWhat time does he expect the vote in the morning?\n  Mr. FRIST. There has been no time set for a vote in the morning.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1554\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided prior \nto the vote on the Dayton amendment.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, my amendment increases funding for IDEA \npart B by $11.8467 billion for fiscal year 2004, which is the amount \nthe Congressional Budget Office has determined is necessary to bring \nFederal funding up to the 40-percent level that was promised 27 years \nago. The funding being allocated for fiscal year 2004 would provide \n18.8 percent, or less than half of that 40 percent promised over a \nquarter century ago.\n  President Bush deserves credit for increasing the funding for IDEA in \neach of his three budgets. The Senate deserves credit, along with \nPresident Bush, for increasing that funding. But the fact remains that \nwe are still less than half of what was promised 27 years ago. I know \nfor my State of Minnesota that is money that is desperately needed not \nonly for better special education but for better quality education for \nall schoolchildren because money has to be diverted from regular \nprograms over to special education. This is money we can find.\n  I propose that the budget point of order be waived, and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate be in order so that \nI can make an argument in opposition to this motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we would always like to have more money \nfor virtually every line on this appropriations bill. There has been an \nenormous increase in funding for special education--last year, $1.3 \ntrillion; the year before, $1.2 trillion; this year, an increase of \n$650 million. On a 10-year period, we have practically a 400-percent \nincrease.\n  There has been enormous progress made from 1996 when the Federal \nshare for students was 7.3 percent. Now we are almost at 19 percent, \nalmost at half of the 40-percent goal. While we would like to have \nadditional funding, it would cost about $11 billion more to adopt the \namendment and waive the Budget Act.\n  I do so reluctantly but emphatically.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the point of order made under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 42, the nays are \n54. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that one of the \nunderlying amendments is the amendment offered by Senator Robert Byrd \nof West Virginia.\n  During the August recess, I visited many of my State's cities and \nhome school districts, stopping in to meet with principals, teachers, \nparents, and students to talk about the state of education in Illinois. \nWe have many fine schools, there is no question about it. But we are \nalso being challenged by the fact that we face a sizable State deficit. \nThis year our Governor, Rod Blagojevich, had to find $5 billion in \nsavings out of our State budget, a substantial amount, making cuts in \nmany areas. He tried his best not to cut into State funding for \neducation. Despite his best efforts and the efforts of the general \nassembly, most of the school districts I visited are facing serious \nhardships.\n  Let me give one illustration. In Elgin, IL, they recently constructed \nfour new school buildings that were to be opened this year. But because \nthe Elgin School District has fallen so far behind in State and local \nassistance, they will be unable to open those buildings. So there sit \nfour brand new schools which don't have the staffing and certainly \ndon't offer better amenities than the older schools offered; they just \ncannot be opened. It is an indication of the problems faced by many \nschool districts in my State and across the Nation.\n  When President Bush was elected, he came to Congress and said he \nwanted to be the education President. He suggested that we try a \nbipartisan national approach to establishing better standards of \naccountability for education across America. The President proposed No \nChild Left Behind. It was a unique concept, one which called for \nregular testing of students to determine whether they were making \nprogress and, absent that progress, changes would have to take place in \nthe school district. You would have to find better teachers or a better \nschool environment, principals who were more efficient in delivering \neducational quality, and certainly demands would be made for better \nteachers. All of these objectives were very positive.\n  I sat on the Senate floor and behind me at this seat was Senator Paul \nWellstone of Minnesota. Paul had a passion for education, a teacher by \nhis own profession. He was a great critic of No Child Left Behind. \nDespite the fact that there was strong bipartisan support for the \nPresident's program, Paul Wellstone would stand there with his \nmicrophone day after day and speak to the Senate and the people \nwatching across America and say: Listen, tests are important, but \neducation is about more than just testing. He would say, incidentally, \nif you pass the President's bill, you are going to have to come up with \nthe money to make certain these kids have a chance. If the scores don't \nmeet the norms or standards you expect, what are you going to do? Are \nyou going to help them or merely diagnose the problem and walk away \nfrom it? He was skeptical that when the time came, we in the Congress \nwould appropriate the money to make No Child Left Behind work.\n  That was Paul Wellstone's speech day after day, week after week, \nmonth after month. Ultimately, he voted against the bill. I voted for \nit, but I remembered what he said. Then I went back to Illinois and \nvisited school district, large and small, rural and urban, districts in \ngrowing areas of our State and districts in economically depressed \nareas of our State. I found that many of them were echoing what Paul \nWellstone said in opposing No Child Left Behind. They were talking \nabout the burden on a teacher who comes to a classroom at the beginning \nof the school year realizing that teacher will ultimately be tested in \na high-stakes test at the end of the year. What that test meant to the \nstudents, to the school, and to the teacher was that in order to get \ngood grades on the test, teachers were kind of changing the way they \ntaught. They were no longer teaching in a creative and innovative \nfashion, but they were focusing on answers to the test questions. \nSchool administrators, incidentally, said: Senator, we are a little \nconcerned that the promises made by the Bush administration to send \nmoney to school districts to meet the mandates of No Child Left Behind \nare not going to be fulfilled. The promised money that was to come down \nto the school districts under title I, which is money to help reach the \nstudents who are not doing well on tests and help them to reach grade \nlevel and to succeed, the title I funds promised by the Bush \nadministration under No Child Left Behind, is not going to be there. \nThat is the money that is supposed to be there for afterschool \nprograms, so that some of these same students running into difficulties \nwould have a helping hand after school; and summer school programs for \nthe same purpose are not going to be funded under the Bush budget.\n\n  The same school administrators in Illinois said, incidentally, this \nidea of making certain that teachers meet certain levels of \nqualifications and certification is a good idea, but it takes money to \nreach those goals, to send some of these teachers back for additional \ncollege classes in science, math, or whatever their specialty might be. \nThere is no money for the school district to deal with that.\n  So I heard the story over and over. It came to my mind that Paul \nWellstone was right; No Child Left Behind was a great promise, but it \nis an unfulfilled promise because when the budget was delivered to us, \nunfortunately, the money wasn't delivered with it. Title I, which would \nhelp the No Child Left Behind Program, is underfunded by more than $6 \nbillion in the Senate bill we are considering on the floor. Six million \nkids across America are at risk of not meeting the standards if we \ndon't come to the rescue with the amendment by the Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd. In my State, it would add $255 million in title \nI funding to help more than 740,000 low-income kids meet the standards \nwe imposed--Federal standards we mandated under No Child Left Behind \nthat were mandated, but the program was not funded.\n  Over the last decade, the enrollment of low-income students in \nIllinois public schools has increased from 32 percent to more than 37 \npercent.\n  Districts across the State are really trying to comply with No Child \nLeft Behind standards, but they need the full amount of the funds \npromised to be sent to these school districts, as well as the full \nmandate of the Federal law.\n  Illinois has done a number of school funding studies, and every one \nof them shows definitively that it will take much more money to help \nkids become proficient in reading and math. It stands to reason. If you \nhave a child struggling to learn to read, that child needs more \npersonal attention. But if you have a large classroom with 30 kids or \nmore, the likelihood of personal attention is diminished. So if you do \nnot send the funds to the school district for smaller class sizes, that \nchild who is\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\ngoing to face the reading test has less of a chance of succeeding.\n  The State superintendent in Illinois testified this winter before the \nIllinois House Appropriations Committee that it will take even more \nfunding to help low-income and non-English speaking students to keep \npace with their peers academically.\n  Our State superintendent, Dr. Robert Schiller, also stated:\n\n       Based on current trends, Illinois will fall short of \n     meeting the Federal goal, set forth in No Child Left Behind, \n     of all children meeting or exceeding reading and math \n     standards by 2014.\n\n  Thirty-seven percent of Illinois students fail to meet State reading \nand math standards.\n  As is the trend nationally, Illinois has significant gaps between \nwhite and minority student achievement and between low-income students \nand their more affluent peers.\n  Last month, the Illinois State Board of Education released its early \nwarning list of school districts required to provide school choice, \nsupplemental tutoring, or take corrective action this school year. More \nthan 500 schools in my State are on the list, and the number might go \nup by the end of the month when the final calculations are made.\n  Compared to other States, Illinois has been pretty lucky as far as \neducation funding at the State level. For this next fiscal year, which \nstarted in July, the State was able to increase per pupil and \ncategorical funding to keep school districts on the road to \nimprovement. But beneath the surface, the Illinois State Board of \nEducation and our local school districts are struggling to implement \nthe requirements of the federally mandated No Child Left Behind.\n  District budgets are straining under these unfunded requirements \naddressed by the Byrd amendment. How many Senators in this Chamber \nstood up with great pride and said we are voting for No Child Left \nBehind because we believe in accountability, education is the highest \npriority in our country, and we need to be there for our kids and their \nfamilies? All of us who voted for the bill gave that speech.\n  Look what happened when the Bush budget came down. The money was not \nthere--a $6 billion shortfall in money needed in schools across \nAmerica.\n  We sent out all these wonderful speeches out to be printed in \nnewspapers, and we posed for pictures with students and teachers. But \nmonths later, when it comes to funding the bill we passed, the Bush \nadministration refuses to put the money down and this Congress followed \nsuit and put together the bill before us today which also fails to keep \nthat promise. This title I money was supposed to be the pool of \nresources from which districts would implement school improvement \nprovisions necessary to meet adequate yearly progress. Districts now \nhave to use State and local funds to try to reach those goals.\n\n  Despite an overall increase for K-12 education, more than $30 million \nin cuts and reallocations were made at the State level in my State this \nyear. This includes a significant reduction in the number of State \nboard employees, the elimination of State gifted education programs, \nthe elimination of the State family literacy initiative, and the \nstatewide math education initiative.\n  While Illinois has been successful in keeping budget cuts out of the \nclassroom, that may not be the case if our State remains in its current \nfinancial straits.\n  The impact of the Federal Government's failure to fund title I as we \npromised is more deeply felt at the school district level where the \nfinancial picture is bleaker.\n  Across Illinois, school districts are laying off teachers, cutting \nprograms, and reducing the hours of operation. Sixty-one percent of our \nschool districts are operating with deficits, and here we have a \nFederal mandate from the Bush administration under No Child Left Behind \nthat imposes new responsibilities on these school districts operating \nin a deficit and fails to fund the program.\n  Many of these school districts have had deficits for several years in \na row. This number is expected to rise about 80 percent next year. This \nspring, 62 percent of local bond proposals failed, and 55 percent of \nlocal tax referenda failed. Those are hard to pass in good times. In a \nrecession, they are particularly difficult to pass. And we had a \nrecession which began before this President came to office by a few \nmonths and which has continued unabated ever since.\n  Our State unemployment rate is about 6.6 percent in Illinois. We have \nlost 120,000 manufacturing jobs while President Bush has been in \noffice, and those numbers are duplicated across America. There is \nlittle wonder taxpayers resist the idea of increasing their property \ntaxes at a time when we are facing this recession.\n  In many areas of our State, local revenue increases have been less \nthan 5 percent because they are limited by tax caps. When local \nresources cannot be increased, it makes title I money even more \nimportant to these cash-strapped school districts.\n  For example, in my hometown of Springfield, Public School District \n186 has 36 elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. Just \nover 15,000 kids attend school in that district. Springfield has had \nfinancial challenges over the last several years and has cut more than \n$30 million from the district budget in the wake of the failed tax \nreferendum. This year, six Springfield elementary schools failed to \nmake adequate yearly progress, and they must offer public school \nchoice. Springfield needs every title I dollar the district can get to \nimprove student achievement and get the schools moving forward making \nprogress.\n  What would Springfield do with the money? I asked the superintendent, \nDr. Dianne Rutledge. She said, with more Federal funding, if Washington \nkept its promise to send money for No Child Left Behind, this is what \nthey would do with it. She would hire additional teachers to reduce \nclass sizes, and that on its face is a good idea. I have yet to meet a \nteacher who has prayed for a larger class. They want smaller classes so \nthey can focus more attention on students who need help and even more \nattention on students who are gifted who, with additional time, can do \nextraordinary things.\n\n  She would also operate reading recovery, and hire a school \nimprovement coach for each school to provide intensive and personalized \nyear-round professional development to teachers and staff.\n  If the Senate fails to adopt the Byrd amendment, there will be less \nmoney for Springfield. They will not be able to hire the teachers, and \nfewer kids will have tutors.\n  Let's look at a larger school district in my State, the Chicago \npublic school system. They educate more than 438,000 kids in K-12 in \n602 schools.\n  Eighty-five percent of the children in Chicago public schools are \ndefined as living in poverty. Roughly 90 percent are minority.\n  The Chicago public school system is, in many ways, the poster \ndistrict for setting high academic standards and adopting an aggressive \nprogram for school improvement. Ten years ago, 48 percent of Chicago's \nschoolchildren were performing in the bottom quarter of national \nachievement in reading and math. Today that number has been cut in \nhalf, first by Paul Vallis, who came in under the direction of Mayor \nDaley and brought real reform to the Chicago public school system, and \nthen followed by Arne Duncan, our current CEO of Chicago public \nschools, an extraordinary educator who is doing a great job. He \nreported last week for the first time that number has been cut in half, \nand Chicago public schools are performing above the Nation as a whole. \nThat is an amazing achievement in a district that diverse with so many \nchallenges.\n  Despite the Chicago public school system's dramatic recovery over the \nlast decade, 365 of its 602 schools have been labeled as failing to \nmake yearly adequate progress. That is more than half.\n  The Chicago public schools' budget increased this year over last. The \ndistrict has managed to avoid drastic cuts. Most of the increased funds \nare committed to certain projects, and several of the initiatives are \nspecifically to comply with Federal requirements.\n  To comply with the highly qualified teachers mandate in No Child Left \nBehind, Chicago public schools has just completed work on a brandnew $2 \nmillion database to track the qualifications of each of their 25,000 \nteachers. The Chicago public school system is\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\nlikely to have to create a similar system to track the qualifications \nof thousands of paraprofessionals.\n  Complying with the Federal mandates of President Bush's No Child Left \nBehind has led to some terrible challenges for this major city school \ndistrict. The Chicago public school system wants to invest title I \ndollars in afterschool, summer school, and extended week programs. It \nis required to use a large portion of its limited Federal resources to \nmove kids from schools that are failing to other schools.\n  What would the Chicago school system do with the money in the Byrd \namendment? We asked the finance director, John Maiorca. He would expand \nafterschool and summer school opportunities for students at risk in \nfailing the test. He would invest in supplemental education services \nand additional tutoring for these struggling students, and hire \nadditional teachers to reduce class size.\n  Two days ago, I was at the opening of the schools in Chicago. I went \nto a school on the west side known as Dodge Academy. Dodge Academy \nclosed 2 years ago because it was a failing school, but there was a \npromise made that it would improve and reopen. It has, and it is an \nexceptionally good school.\n  One can tell, walking in the door, that this is a school that is \ndestined to succeed. Not only do they have a wonderful, bright, and \nremodeled building because of a lot of hard work by the local school \ndistrict but they also have some of the brightest teachers. They are a \nschool that is trying a new concept, under the leadership of Mike \nKoldyke, that is going to bring to each of these classrooms two \nresident teachers. So for a year they are going to have teachers in \nresidence who are training to become teachers, working with veteran \nteachers, and then they will move these newly qualified teachers with \nexperience to the failing schools in the Chicago public school systems \nand try to turn them around. It is a great model. It works in \nhospitals. It can certainly work in schools. But it costs money.\n  The money from title I, which would be part of No Child Left Behind \nhad the Bush administration and this bill adequately funded it, could \nhave been used for that purpose, but it is not there. With the Byrd \namendment, it would be there, and so the Chicago public school system \nwould have that opportunity.\n  So right now we are dealing with the broken promises of No Child Left \nBehind, unfunded mandates at a time when school districts in Illinois \nand across America are struggling to survive. How can we, in good \nconscience, impose these ideas and mandates on the school districts, as \ngood as they may be, and then refuse to pay for them?\n  Senator Byrd really is calling to task all of us who voted on No \nChild Left Behind, those of us who stood so proudly by this bill and \nsaid this is the answer to America's education needs. The question now \nis: Will we produce the money it takes to make this succeed? Quite \nhonestly, if the Byrd amendment fails, the answer is no.\n  Many of the same people who took great pride in saying they co-\nauthored this program, cosponsored it, and voted for it, will turn \naround and vote against the funding for the mandates they are creating \nin school districts across America. These are unfunded mandates in the \nmiddle of a recession, at a time of State deficits, when schools are \nstruggling to survive, unfunded mandates from the Bush administration \nin No Child Left Behind.\n  The only thing the Bush administration guarantees it will pay for is \nthe test. So the test will be administered but any effort to improve \nthe scores of students will be hampered, hindered with additional \nobstacles because of the refusal of this Congress to appropriate the \nadequate funds. We need to make certain that the $6 billion shortfall \nin title I in No Child Left Behind is a shortfall that is filled, and \nfilled soon.\n  I rise in support of the Byrd amendment, commend Senator Byrd for his \nleadership, and urge all of my colleagues to put their money where \ntheir press release was. It is not just a matter of taking credit for a \nprogram. Stand up now and appropriate the funds to make it work in \nPhiladelphia, in Iowa, in Chicago, all across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations \nbill for Fiscal Year 2004 provides $137.6 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority and $134.9 billion in discretionary outlays for the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nrelated agencies. These amounts are both precisely at the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation. This is an increase of 2.3 percent in \ndiscretionary budget authority and 6.8 percent in discretionary outlays \nabove the 2003 enacted levels.\n  Including mandatory spending, the bill provides a total of $370.7 \nbillion in new budget authority and $294.6 billion in new outlays in \nFiscal Year 2004. With outlays from prior years and other completed \nactions, the Senate bill totals $456.4 billion in budget authority and \n$453.6 billion in outlays.\n  The committee-reported bill also shifts $2.2 billion in 2004 advance \nappropriations back to fiscal year 2003, pursuant to an agreement with \nthe administration. These advance appropriations were originally \nprovided in the 2003 omnibus appropriations bill to avoid circumventing \nthe 2003 spending limits, an action which the President previously \nobjected to when he signed that legislation.\n  The purpose of this shift is to allow for $2.2 billion in additional \nnondefense discretionary spending in 2004 without exceeding the budget \nresolution's discretionary spending limit. However, since the budget \nresolution set forth discretionary spending limits for fiscal years \n2003, 2004, and 2005, this shift causes the committee-reported bill to \nexceed the 2003 spending cap by $2.2 billion. Thus, a point of order \nlies against the bill which may be waived with 60 votes.\n  Finally, it is also important to note that the bill which effectuates \nthe advance appropriations shift must be signed into law before the \nbeginning of the new fiscal year on October 1, 2003, in order for it to \ncount for budget scoring purposes.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  S. 1356, LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS, 2004 SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2004, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.....................   137,601    318,766    456,367\n  Outlays..............................   134,932    318,694    453,626\nSenate committee allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................   137,601    318,766    456,367\n  Outlays..............................   134,932    318,694    453,626\n2003 level:\n  Budget authority.....................   134,476    289,398    423,874\n  Outlays..............................   126,286    289,341    415,627\nPresident's request\n  Budget authority.....................   137,587    318,766    456,353\n  Outlays..............................   133,708    318,694    452,402\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................   138,036    318,766    456,802\n  Outlays..............................   134,765    318,694    453,459\n \n    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................  .........  .........  .........\n  Outlays..............................  .........  .........  .........\n2003 level:\n  Budget authority.....................     3,125     29,368     32,493\n  Outlays..............................     8,646     29,353     37,999\nPresident's request\n  Budget authority.....................        14   .........        14\n  Outlays..............................     1,224   .........     1,224\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................

Mr. President, my purpose tonight is to say a few \nwords about a 10-day visit to Africa that the Presiding Officer, and I, \nand four other Members of the Senate completed last Friday. But I \nlistened with great interest to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois. I did not want him to leave on such a sad note about the \neconomy, and I thought I would give him some late-breaking news.\n  The Wall Street Journal today has a headline: ``Manufacturing \nExpanded In August.''\n\n       The manufacturing sector expanded for the second \n     consecutive month in August, providing further evidence that \n     the economy's hardest-hit sector may finally be on the \n     rebound.\n\n  I thought it would be important that the Senator have that in mind \nbecause we are all deeply concerned about the number of Americans who \nare looking for jobs and do not have them.\n  The President talked about that on Labor Day. Every one of us, \nRepublican and Democrat, feel that way. This is a piece of good news.\n  The Wall Street Journal said today:\n\n       The Institute for Supply Management said its monthly survey \n     of manufacturing conditions rose to 54.7 from 51.8 in July. A \n     result above 50 generally indicates expansion. Many key \n     segments of the report, meanwhile, showed similar strength, \n     including components that measure new orders for manufactured \n     goods and overall production. The results came on the heels \n     of otherpositive manufacturing news in recent weeks. . . .\n\n  Now, this is the Wall Street Journal, not the White House talking, \nincluding the Federal report last week that showed new orders for \ndurable goods or items built in the last 3 years or longer, so they \nrose 1 percent in July.\n  Now, obviously we are all concerned about manufacturing jobs \ndisappearing. They have been disappearing for a long time. I remember \nwhen the Saturn plant moved to Tennessee in the mid-1980s. It hired \n5,000 people. If it had done that 30 years ago and built the same \nnumber of cars, it would have needed to hire 30,000 people.\n  So while manufacturing is up, manufacturing employment is still down \nand is a source of great concern to all of us. I thought that piece of \ngood news might be interesting to the Senator from Illinois and others \ntonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11021-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wish to comment very briefly on education, which we \nare debating, and the Senator spoke eloquently about it. I was Governor \nof my State. I was U.S. Secretary of Education for awhile. The facts \nare basically these: Federal funding for education has been \nconsistently up, under Democrats and under Republicans.\n  It must be confusing to people who hear us debate in the Senate \nbecause it sounds as though we are reading off completely different \nhistory books. The fact is, it is up, and State funding is either down \nor level.\n  It is important for teachers, principals, and others in their \ncommunities to know that the real pressure they are feeling is not from \nFederal dollars, which are up, but from State dollars, which are level \nor down. The Federal Government funds about 7 percent. Seven cents out \nof every dollar that goes for elementary and secondary education in \nAmerica comes from the Congress. Ninety-three cents out of every dollar \ncomes from the States or local government. So that is the real problem.\n  The Congress recognized that this year by appropriating a large \namount of money for the States. I think it was $20 billion that we sent \nto the States on a one-time basis. For Tennessee, it was about $400 \nmillion. That is a lot of money for us. Our State used that, half of it \nin the rainy day fund and half of it in Medicaid. That took a little \npressure off Medicaid. That helped education.\n  So it is important for people to know that in all of this debate, \nFederal funding is up. I, for one, want to look at Leave No Child \nBehind this year and next year, its first 2 years of operation. I was \nnot here when it passed. I was not here to vote for it as the Senator \nfrom Illinois said he did. If it turns out after a year or two of \noperation that it is indeed a federally unfunded mandate, then I am \ngoing to be one of those Senators who wants to add money to fix that \nproblem.\n  I spent a lot of time as a Governor saying do not send me a rule \nwithout money. I do not think it is good to leave the impression that \nsomehow the Federal Government is not funding education. We only fund 7 \npercent of elementary and secondary education, and that funding is up. \nIt is the States that are having problems, and States have a variety of \noptions for dealing with that.\n  Many States have cut taxes over the last 10 years. That is a good \npolicy if it can be done, but if it is done, it comes right out of \neducation usually.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11021-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11021-S11023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. My purpose this evening is very briefly to make a few \ncomments about the visit to four countries in Africa that six Members \nof this body took during the last 2 weeks of August. The delegation was \nled by the majority leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. It \nincluded the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nMinnesota. I was there and three others. We visited four countries: \nSouth Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, and Namibia. It was an eye-opening \nand, for me, an eye-popping experience in many cases.\n  I have the privilege of serving as the chairman of the Subcommittee \non African Affairs, so I am very interested in Africa. It was my second \nvisit there in the last 3 years. Before I make a few comments about it, \nI want to simply observe how much we owe Senator Frist, our majority \nleader, for teaching us a great deal not just about Africa but about \nthe HIV/AIDS problem which was the subject of our visit to Africa.\n  Senator Frist has been there a long time. When nobody else much was \ntalking about HIV/AIDS, he was. He helped change some very important \nminds in this body. He has been an important adviser to the President \nof the United States and is an inspiration to us. When we left to come \nhome after 10 days, he stayed for 5 days, went to Kenya and Sudan, and \noperated on people who have very little medical care, which he has done \nevery year. We owe him a lot for his leadership on the subject.\n\n  Within a few weeks, the Congress will be considering the nomination \nof Randall Tobias to be the new AIDS czar, the person in charge of what \nwe are going to try to do. Also, Congress will almost surely fund \nPresident Bush's recommendation that we spend $15 billion in 14 African \nand Caribbean countries to fight the disease which we call HIV/AIDS. It \nwill be my purpose in our subcommittee and as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, to make sure this taxpayer money, the largest public health \nexpenditure ever, will be spent wisely. This evening, in summary \nfashion, while it is still fresh in my mind, I will make a few \nsuggestions to Mr. Tobias, who is not yet confirmed by the Senate. I \nhope he will be. I know in this quiet time he is not allowed to do \nanything or say anything out of respect for the Senate, and it is a \ngood time for him to make a plan for a fast start. If I were to make a \nplan for a fast start for Mr. Tobias, President Bush's designated AIDS \nczar, to be considered for confirmation by this body shortly, these \nwould be my suggestions:\n  No. 1, I suggest Mr. Tobias go to Africa. I don't see how it is \npossible to understand the enormity of the disease if you do not go to \nAfrica. The disease has delivered a death sentence to 29 million \nAfricans, a number so large that it is hard to imagine. Go to Africa in \norder to make good spending decisions. Go to Africa in order to cut red \ntape. A commander of a major battle should be where the action is. \nWhile there, show some respect for the African way. We are very proud \nof the American way; the Africans are proud of their way. It is a \nlittle different.\n  When in Namibia, where we were, I suggest you play the Namibian \nnational anthem and leave it to the local\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\nmayor to say, as he said to us ``God bless America.''\n  No. 2, I suggest making needles and blood transfusions safe. It seems \nto me this is the surest, fastest way to save lives when dealing with \nHIV/AIDS. Senator Jeff Sessions of this body has made a project of \nreminding Members a number of people are infected by contaminated \nneedles and by other unsafe health practices. The estimate would be \nthat at least 175,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa this year will be \ninfected with the HIV virus because of unsafe health practices. That \nmeans needles that are dirty, that have been used before, that have \ncontaminated blood. That is just 5 percent of all of those in sub-\nSaharan Africa who will be infected, but it is a huge number of people, \n175,000 people. By comparison, in the United States, only 40,000 people \nare infected with HIV/AIDS every year. In one hospital we visited in \nNamibia, health workers were recapping the needles they had already \nused and in the process risked pricking themselves with a used needle \nthat could have infected blood on it.\n  A third suggestion: save the babies. This is also something that can \nbe gotten off to a very fast start because it is already occurring. In \nBotswana, nearly 40 percent of pregnant women are HIV positive. One in \nthree of the babies they bear will be HIV positive. Administering the \ndrug nevirapine to the mother and then to the child after birth will \nreduce this risk to 1 in 10. Congress has already appropriated millions \nto start to create an AIDS-free generation. In Botswana, which only has \n1.5 million residents, 100 babies are born each week infected with the \nHIV virus. In the United States, by comparison, less than 100 a year \nare born so infected.\n\n  Four, make inexpensive drugs widely available. There is no vaccine \nand no cure for HIV/AIDS. We sometimes talk around that. There is no \nvaccine and there is no cure, but there are medicines that prolong \nlife. These antiretroviral drugs are cheaper than ever.\n  In Namibia last week we were told that the cost was $160 per person \nper year, dramatically more inexpensive than they have ever been \nbefore. In South Africa, we were told the availability of these \ntreatments can decide whether 5 million infected South Africans will \ndie in the next 5 years of HIV/AIDS or whether they might die in the \nnext 20 years. That is the choice for just one country.\n  No. 5, encourage rapid tests and routine tests. Most Africans who are \ninfected with HIV/AIDS do not know it. They are reluctant to find out \nbecause of the stigma attached to having it known you are HIV infected. \nNew rapid tests report results in 20 minutes. Citizens can find out the \nresults in a single visit. The inexpensive treatments, the $160 \ntreatments, provide a new incentive to take the tests. Not a lot of \nAfricans want to take a test and be told they would die of HIV/AIDS \nwhen there is no treatment. There is little incentive to get that bad \nnews. Now there is incentive to get immediate news with the possibility \nof treatment.\n  Next, teach the ABC's--that stands for abstain, be faithful, and use \ncondoms. Using this approach the country of Uganda in Africa has \nreduced its infection rate from 20 percent to 8 percent; 90 percent of \nAIDS is transmitted by sexual intercourse, something many Africans and \nmany Americans do not know.\n  Janet Museveni is the First Lady of Uganda. She visited with many of \nthe Senators earlier this year and talked about her ABC plan. She \nencourages A and B more than C. This is her quote: ``I am not \ncomfortable,'' says the First Lady of Uganda, ``with the thought that \nthe extinction of an entire continent could depend upon a thin piece of \nrubber.''\n  No. 7, form an AIDS corps. We heard everywhere we went the greatest \nneed is for manpower and training. Hospitals need doctors, clinics need \nnurses, nonprofits need counselors to recruit patients and to hold the \nhands of those who are dying.\n  Create a private sector clearinghouse for Americans to go to Africa \nfrom 3 months to 2 years. Connect the volunteers with structures in \nAfrica. I have introduced a bill to create an AIDS corps and I worried \nabout whether volunteers should go for 3 months or for 1 year or for 2 \nyears. There are plenty of options. I hope Mr. Tobias, if confirmed, \nwill take all of the efforts already underway to take volunteers who \nare willing to go to Africa and connect them with one of the \noutstanding programs we saw there. There is plenty to do and a great \nmany Americans who want to go, and they would be welcome.\n  No. 8, dig some water wells. In Mozambique, 3 of 4 children's deaths \nunder the age of 5 are caused by diseases carried by unclean water. \nSince AIDS destroys immune systems, victims of all ages live longer \nwith clean water.\n  One nonprofit agency, Living Water International was the name, I \nbelieve, showed the visiting Senators a well that was dug in a rural \narea for just $2,800. We saw there two boys who were filling 10-gallon \nwater cans, five of them, which they would carry each day in a wagon to \ntheir home which was 6 miles away. That was their job every day: 6 \nmiles to the well, fill up the cans, 6 miles back.\n\n  Forty percent of rural Africans do not have this much access to clean \nwater.\n  Here are my last two suggestions. Focus on logistics. We saw faith-\nbased and nonprofit organizations impressively active everywhere we \nwent: The Salvation Army in Johannesburg, the Catholic AIDS \norganization in Namibia, Harvard, and Baylor, and the Gates Foundation \nin Botswana. A surprising number of talented U.S. Government people are \nalready on the ground. The country director in Namibia for the Centers \nfor Disease Control is a pediatrician who has been there for 12 years \nin Africa. He knows a lot about what to do. So my suggestion to Mr. \nTobias is, while you are making your 10-year plan in this first few \nmonths, ride the horses that are already running in Africa. Accelerate \nwhat is already happening. There is a lot going on and the challenge is \nnot to plan, the challenge is how do you get it done.\n  Finally, move fast, but do not spend too fast. I imagine we are going \nto have a pretty good debate about that in the Senate. I have already \nheard some people say let's spend $2 billion and others say let's spend \n$2.5 and others say let's spend $3 billion. The fact is, we are going \nto spend $15 billion of taxpayers' money in fighting HIV/AIDS in 14 \ncountries and the Caribbean. We are going to do it over 5 years. We \nneed to keep in mind that the African system cannot absorb too much \nmoney too quickly. There are treatment guidelines to prepare and to \nteach. They are very complicated. There is a staff to recruit. There \nare patients to find and persuade. There are health organizations to \nestablish.\n  For example, perhaps the most impressive program we saw was operated \nby a mining company, Anglo-Gold in South Africa. They are taking this \nseriously in a country where the Government is taking it less \nseriously. They are making an all-out effort to identify the 25,000 \nemployees infected with HIV/AIDS that they have, one-third of their \ntotal employment, and give them a chance to have the treatment that \nwill prolong their productive life. They set a goal of recruiting 1,000 \npeople in the first year to do this, but try as they might they only \ncould recruit 622. So, we need to be aware that we may have to ramp \nthis program up as we go and we ought not to waste money in the first \nyear that would be better spent in the third, fourth, or fifth year.\n  You saw it as I saw it, Mr. President. Botswana's life expectancy has \ndropped from 72 years of age to 34 years of age because of HIV/AIDS. In \nNamibia, teachers miss school to visit sick colleagues and attend their \nfunerals. Two or three generations of South African children will grow \nup without parents. In Windhoek last year, a local journalist told me, \n``Please get it across, how much we appreciate President Bush's $15 \nbillion grant. It puts a human face on America.''\n  I hasten to say we in the Congress are a little jealous of our \nprerogative to make that grant. But the AIDS authorization bill passed \nunanimously. It had support of Democrats as well as Republicans as well \nas the President, and it is something we should be proud to work on.\n  If I could make these three final observations. I was thinking, \nflying home, that if a diabolical person, an evil person, had to think \nof a way to destroy a country, that this would be\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\nwhat he might do. No. 1, invent a new disease that had never been heard \nof before for which there is no vaccine and no cure, that pronounces a \ndeath sentence. No. 2, think of a way to transmit that disease that \ninvolves the most powerfully reliable human impulse, which is sexual \nactivity. And, No. 3, introduce that disease into countries that are \nthe poorest in the world and have almost no health structure to deal \nwith the disease and in which the discussion of sexual activity is \ntaboo.\n\n  That is exactly what has happened with HIV/AIDS. As I look back on \nthose four countries we saw--South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, and \nNamibia--these are four countries, with a little exception for \nBotswana, where 30 years ago they were under some kind of colonial \nrule. Then the people who are in power in the government today fought \nagainst that rule for their freedom, they were guerrillas and they were \nat war. Then typically there was a civil war to decide who of the \nwinners would govern. And now they are in charge in all four of those \ncountries. They are doing well, in terms of their governance. They are \nbuilding their democracy very well. And the governance is something \nthey can be proud of.\n  But all of a sudden out of left field comes this AIDS, just as they \nare reaching their freedom and just as they are in charge. We saw the \nwife of Nelson Mandela, Graca Machel, who said to us: It took us aback. \nWe weren't prepared. We weren't ready for it.\n  It seems like a cruel, terrible trick to play on people who for 30 \nyears have struggled to gain their freedom and find themselves in \ncharge of their own destiny.\n  Finally, I think we saw a good deal of hope. We saw leaders who, in \nspite of the terrible odds they face, are committed to fighting it. We \nsaw people from all over the world, really, who were there, \nvolunteering their help. We saw faith-based organizations holding \nhands, taking care of orphans, finding patients.\n  My sense of Africa is that for a long time it has generally been \nignored by our country. Presidents have sometimes gone but only as an \nafterthought. I suspect Africa presents such challenges today, not just \nwith HIV/AIDS but in other ways, that it will begin to attract some of \nthe brightest, most intelligent people in the world, many of them \nAfricans who have left to go to other parts of the world, and I believe \nthey will come home.\n  I saw this morning on C-SPAN the discussion about Ghana and the \nenergy minister who was born in Ghana and was educated in Minnesota. He \nwas the managing partner of Deloitte and Touche for all of Africa, and \nhe decided to go back to Ghana and help build that country.\n  America was built that way, by people who saw great challenge here \nand came to help build the country. I suspect Africa may be that sort \nof challenge. I am glad our President has devoted himself in such a \nstrong way to it. I hope he continues that over the next several years. \nI believe if he does, when he goes back to Crawford, TX at the end of 8 \nyears, it will be one of the great accomplishments of his \nadministration.\n  I hope the Senate continues to put partisanship aside and to support \nthe $15 billion and do it in an orderly way. I commend our leader for \nhis insistence on it. I was privileged to be a part of the delegation \nthat went for 2 weeks and it will certainly redouble my interest and \nattention to our responsibilities to the people of Africa.\n  I thank the Senate for giving me the opportunity to present this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11023-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PAUL WELLSTONE VETERANS HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation to \nname the Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis, MN, after the \nlate Senator Paul Wellstone. It would be a great tribute to my departed \nfriend and colleague, who worked tirelessly to improve the lives of \nveterans throughout Minnesota and across our Nation.\n  During the August recess, I met with the leaders of major veterans' \norganizations in Minnesota. Several have formally expressed their \nsupport for bestowing this honor on Senator Wellstone. Others, while \nnot taking official positions, are now aware of the legislation and our \nintentions to proceed with it. So, I believe that the path is clear in \nMinnesota for this legislation to be enacted with very broad support.\n  Senator Wellstone served for seven years on the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, where he fought tirelessly for more generous \nbenefits and expanded services, including health care, for the men and \nwomen who served our Nation with great courage and dedication, and who \nnow deserve far better than many are receiving or not receiving. In \naddition, he and his dedicated staff enabled countless veterans \nindividually to receive benefits, medical care, and other services \nwhich were wrongly denied them. While living, and after his tragic \ndeath last year, Senator Wellstone has been a hero to many thousands of \nveterans throughout Minnesota and across our Nation. Many of them have \nprovided the impetus and support for this legislation.\n  It is my hope that this measure might receive swift and favorable \nconsideration by the Senate, and that it then be sent to the House for \nits concurrence and to the President for his signature, prior to the \nfirst anniversary of Senator Wellstone's death.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11023-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in \nWashington, DC. On August 21, 2003, a transgendered woman was murdered. \nHer nude body was found about 2 a.m. in a wooded area near Malcolm X \nAvenue and 2nd Street, SE.\n  The woman, identified by friends as Emonie Kiera Spaulding, 25, was \nthe second transgendered woman to die of gunshot wounds and the third \nto be shot in the District during a 5-day period. The D.C. police \ndepartment have arrested a suspect.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11023-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11023-S11024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nMitchell, IN. Army Specialist Ronald ``Ronnie'' Allen, Jr., 22 years \nold, was killed near Balad on August 25, 2003 when the Army unit he was \nriding in was struck by another vehicle. Ronnie joined the Army with \nhis entire life before him. He chose to risk everything to fight for \nthe values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around \nthe world.\n  Ronnie was the 14th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He leaves behind his mother, Jyl \nHarrison, and his stepfather, Derek Harrison, and their children \nAndrea, Nathan and Eric. Today, I join Ronnie's family, his friends, \nand the entire Mitchell community in mourning his death. While we \nstruggle to bear our sorrow over his death, we can also take pride in \nthe example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. \nIt is this courage and strength of character that people will remember \nwhen they think of Ronnie, a memory that will burn brightly during \nthese continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Ronald Allen, Jr. told his family he was proud to be serving his \ncountry in Iraq because he felt like he could make a real difference \nthere. He told them he was proud to be a soldier and that he loved his \ncountry. Today, his family remembers him as a true American hero, and \nwe honor the sacrifice he made while serving his country.\n  Ronald dreamed of joining the military as a young man and even early-\nenlisted in the Army during his junior year of high school. Two weeks \nafter he graduated from Mitchell High School\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\nin 2000, Ronald left home to begin full-time duty at Fort Carson in \nColorado. He was assigned to the 502d Personnel Service Battalion, 43d \nArea Support Group.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Ronald Allen, Jr.'s \nsacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed \nthe families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot \ndedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave \nmen, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far \nabove our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor \nlong remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did \nhere.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years \nago, as I am certain that the impact of Ronald's actions will live on \nfar longer than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Ronald Allen, Jr. in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Ronald's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I also wish today to honor the accomplishments of the \nHoosier soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 293d Infantry Regiment, and the \n1st Battalion, 152d Infantry Regiment, from the Indiana National Guard, \nwho have become the first National Guard battalions in the Nation to \nreceive the Combat Infantry award since the Korean war.\n  The Combat Infantry award is a highly coveted honor given by the \nDepartment of the Army to soldiers who have satisfactorily performed \ninfantry duties as part of a unit that participated in ground combat. \nThe Infantry badge honors soldiers who have operated under the worst \nconditions, yet still successfully performed his or her mission in a \ncombat environment. In addition, medics who supported the soldiers will \nreceive the Combat Medical Badge. I am immensely proud that these \nIndiana battalions have become the first units in more than 50 years to \nearn this distinction.\n  All members of the battalions will receive the Combat Infantry award \nas a symbol of our Nation's gratitude for the bravery they demonstrated \nand the sacrifices they and their families have made during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. The 1st Battalion, 293d Infantry Regiment, and the 1st \nBattalion, 152d Infantry Regiment, are the first Indiana National Guard \nunits to go into combat since World War II. As this award recognizes, \nthey have made an exemplary return to battle, honoring themselves and \ntheir home State of Indiana through their efforts.\n  The battalions have been stationed in Iraq for more than 5 months. \nDuring their time in Iraq, the soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 293d \nInfantry Regiment, have provided security for the Talil Air Force Base, \na key airstrip in Southern Iraq. The unit took over responsibility for \nthe base just days after the war's deadliest battle took place on April \n1 to secure control of the airstrip. The members of the 1st Battalion, \n152d Infantry Regiment, have engaged in a wide range of missions, \nincluding guarding the Baghdad Airport, one of the most strategically \nimportant sites in Iraq.\n  I am proud to honor the soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 293d Infantry \nRegiment, and the 1st Battalion, 152d Infantry Regiment. The thoughts \nand prayers of all Hoosiers are with them as they continue their role \nin rebuilding Iraq. May God watch over the soldiers as they complete \ntheir duty and may God bless the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I further rise today to honor the heroic service of \nUnited States Army Cpl Damien Luten, 24, of Indianapolis, IN. Corporal \nLuten was a member of the U.S. Army's 507th Maintenance Company, which \ncrossed into Iraq from Kuwait on March 21, 2003, as part of a convoy \nsupporting a patriot missile battalion, during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  On March 23, 2003, the 507th Maintenance Company was ambushed by \nIraqi military forces and irregulars in the city of An Nasiriyah. \nAccording to the U.S. Army, Corporal Luten's convoy found itself in a \ndesperate situation due to a navigational error caused by the combined \neffects of the operational pace, acute fatigue, isolation and the harsh \nenvironmental conditions. The tragic results of this error placed the \nsoldiers of the 507th Maintenance Company in a torrent of fire from \nIraqi soldiers who attacked the isolated convoy.\n  Eleven of the company's 33 soldiers were killed in combat or later \ndied from injuries. Seven soldiers were captured in the attack, \nincluding PFC Jessica Lynch who was later rescued by American Marines. \nThis toll, though devastating, may have been much greater had it not \nbeen for the valorous acts of soldiers such as Corporal Luten, who \nsought to protect his unit by attempting to return fire with the unit's \nonly .50-caliber machine gun. However, the machine gun failed and as \nCorporal Luten was reaching for his M-16, he was wounded in the right \nleg by enemy fire. Corporal Luten has been awarded the Purple Heart for \nthe wound he received in combat.\n  As I reflect on Corporal Luten's service, I am reminded of a quote by \nDouglas MacArthur:\n\n       The soldier, above all other people prays for peace, for he \n     must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.\n\n  The United States will be eternally grateful for the courage and \nbravery Corporal Luten exhibited on the field of battle.\n  Corporal Luten is expected to return to his base in Fort Bliss, TX, \nwhere he will have at least one more surgery on his leg. This will be \nthe ninth surgery Corporal Luten has undergone to repair his injured \nleg. If Corporal Luten has his way, his injury will not mark the end of \nhis military service. He plans to re-enlist and enter the Army's \nChaplain Corps when his current tour concludes in April 2004.\n  I know that all Hoosiers share my deep sense of pride in Corporal \nLuten and all of the men and women of our Armed Forces from Indiana who \nsafeguard our freedom. My thoughts and prayers are with him as he \ncontinues his recovery and begins his new service in the Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11024-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and \nrecognize Women's Equality Day on August 26, 2003. As well as \ncelebrating Women's Equality Day, this day is also a celebration of the \n80th anniversary of the Equal Rights Amendment Campaign.\n  This year's celebration being hosted by the Advisory Boards on the \nStatus of Women of Essex, Bergen, and Union Counties in New Jersey is \nthe 155th observance of Women's Equality Day.\n  One of the most important people in the fight for women's equality \nwas Alice Paul. Alice Paul was born in Mt. Laurel, NJ, and spent her \nentire life fighting for women's rights. She believed that men and \nwomen should be equal partners in society. She led the final, \nsuccessful campaign for a women's right to vote. She inspired thousands \nto join the struggle as she stood up to Congress and the President.\n  Understanding that securing the right to vote was only the first \nstep, Alice Paul authored the Equal Rights Amendment and drafted and \nlobbied for gender equality language in the United Nations Charter and \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. Alice Paul is a great example that one \nperson can make a difference and motivate others to take up a noble \ncause.\n  Today, because of Alice Paul and numerous other women who preceded \nand followed her, we're getting closer to true equality for women.\n  It is important that we recognize Women's Equality Day. Since the \ndays\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\nof women's suffrage, we have witnessed a wonderful growth in the \ninfluence and contributions of women to our politics, our economy, and \nour culture. Although women are not yet full partners in American \nsociety, we will continue the work of Alice Paul and remember her on \nWomen's Equality Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11025-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CELEBRATING THE ``WOMEN OF\n                                 L/A''\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to call my \ncolleagues' attention to an awards dinner being held in the Lewiston/\nAuburn communities of Maine. This event, ``Celebrating the Women of L/\nA,'' honors those women who have demonstrated, through their \naccomplishments and their caring, a significant impact on their \ncommunity.\n  The women honored in the Twin Cities' celebration have accomplished a \ngreat deal. Women across the country have soared through space, raised \nchildren, developed life-saving medicines, cared for a loved one, \nestablished businesses, and quietly improved the lives of those in \ntheir families and their communities. This special Maine dinner not \nonly recognizes the business or scientific accomplishments of women, \nbut also, all that these honorees bring to their families and their \ncommunities.\n  Those submitting nominations were asked to describe briefly what it \nwas about the nominee that made her such a special and important part \nof the community. Here are a few examples: ``She has coordinated \ncharity work of many organizations such as the collection of money, \nclothing, coal, wood, groceries, stoves, furniture, and toys for the \nRelief Society; organized the sponsorship for a maternity room and \nchildren's room at Central Maine Medical Center; and selected children \nto receive assistance from churches.''\n  ``Mom works hard. She helps me. She takes me swimming. She gets me \ntoys. She takes me shopping. We have girl-time. We go to the movie \ntheater. She makes me dinner. She helps me clean. We cuddle on the \ncouch and watch movies.''\n  ``When you need her, she's there. When you're not sure you want \nanyone around, she's still there for you--especially with her children. \nShe's had to cope with the tragic death of her mother and had many set \nbacks, and still she has maintained the strength to be there for all of \nus.''\n  ``She is a lifeline. She has been there for me through several tough \ntimes in my life, lending her support or sometimes just a sympathetic \near. She has never judged me, as others have, for my less than \nbrilliant choices in life. No matter what the cost, she is always there \nto defend my decisions to anyone who may have something to say. Though \nher schedule is busy, she always makes time for me and for that I value \nher friendship.''\n  ``She is a professional in her field. She takes her job very \nseriously and always gives it her all to help people. She is a very \nloyal, dedicated individual who works hard for what she has.''\n  ``Mothers influence their children's lives in profound ways. My mom's \ninfluence has been no exception to that statement. She lived through \nthe nightmare of seeing two brothers seriously injured during World War \nII and married a man that served during the Korean War. Yet, as far \nback as I can remember, my Mom was always cheerful and optimistic.''\n  ``My mother has never had time for herself, and now has her own \nhealth needs that she must attend to. Nevertheless, she still tends to \nthe needs of others before taking care of herself. Not only has she \nmourned her husband, father and mother in law, but she has also had to \nmourn her mother and her only sibling, a brother. My mother has made \nthe most of the sorrow and hardships and she has been an inspiration to \nso many people, and a wonderful role model for all of her children.''\n  There are so many more testimonials that were received on behalf of \nthe honorees. They speak to the importance and influence that these \nwomen have had on their families, their friends, and their communities.\n  I am honored to pay tribute to the following Women of L/A: Judy \nMerced, Crystal Brissette, Sandy Barnies, Linda Saucier, Gail L. \nRichard, Lorraine Yvonne Poulin Sheehy, and Etta Y. Mitchell.\n  They each are so deserving of this recognition, and I congratulate \nthem as they are recognized for their efforts in the home, the \nworkplace, and in the community. These women represent so many others \nfor whom no public praise has been made. I offer my thanks and best \nwishes to all the women of L/A for making our community such a strong \nand vibrant place to live, work, and raise a family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11025-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11025-S11026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SALUTE TO ROBERT C. WOOD\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize \nand honor Robert C. Wood, former Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and president of the University of Massachusetts, as he \ncelebrates his 80th birthday this month.\n  I first met Robert Wood when he was a member of President Kennedy's \nCambridge ``Brain Trust'' in 1960, and I have had the pleasure of \nconsulting with him on many issues since that time.\n  Robert C. Wood is a remarkable man who has made even more remarkable \ncontributions to the people of this Nation through a combination of \noutstanding scholarship and public service. He has worked tirelessly to \nimprove opportunities for all, be it in obtaining a high quality \neducation, ensuring access to housing for low-income families, or \ndeveloping policies and programs that guide urban development and local \ngovernments across the country.\n  Professor Wood was raised in north Florida during the Great \nDepression and, along with his two brothers, learned the values of \neducation and hard work from his mother, who was a school teacher, and \nhis father, a shoe salesman. A full scholarship enabled him to attend \nPrinceton University, but his studies were interrupted by service as an \ninfantry sergeant in World War II where he saw action in the Battle of \nthe Bulge. After the war, the G.I. Bill enabled him to earn a doctorate \nin Government and Political Economy at Harvard University, and he \nreturned to Florida to apply his professional skills to that state's \nLegislative Reference Bureau.\n  He was soon recruited from Florida to the Federal Bureau of the \nBudget during the Truman Administration and, after that, took a \nteaching appointment at Harvard. This was a critical time in the \ndevelopment of new ideas about American cities, and Robert Wood was a \nmajor author of these new ideas. His first book, ``Suburbia, its People \nand Their Politics,'' took the term ``suburbia'' and placed it firmly \ninto the center of political thinking and analysis. His next book, \n``1400 Governments: The Political Economy of the New York Region'' is \nregarded as a classic in analysis of the dynamics of local governments \nand the factors that inhibit their effectiveness. It was at this time \nthat Professor Wood helped my brother John draft a speech on the \nAmerican City that he used in a rally in Pittsburgh during his 1960 \npresidential campaign. It was the first speech on American cities ever \ndelivered by a presidential candidate.\n  We in Washington took note, and Professor Wood was asked to chair the \ntask force that recommended the establishment of a new Cabinet level \nDepartment, the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He then \nwent on to be the first Undersecretary of the new Department, serving \nunder the first ever African American Cabinet Secretary, Secretary \nRobert C. Weaver, and succeeding him as Secretary in 1969. During these \nyears, Robert Wood along with Secretary Weaver supported and \nimplemented key legislative initiatives that dramatically improved and \nexpanded federally assisted housing and urban development programs in \nthe United States, including the Model Cities Act of 1966, the Housing \nAct of 1968 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. These critical programs \nin urban development continued long after the Johnson administration, \nas well as future administrations, Democratic and Republican alike.\n  Professor Wood returned to Boston and continued his work with a focus \non education and the expansion of opportunity to all. He became \nPresident of the University of Massachusetts where he oversaw the \ndevelopment of a new medical school in Worcester and a new campus in \nBoston. He particularly fostered a college of Public and Community \nService at the Boston Campus. In\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\n1976, he stepped forward to offer a site at the Boston Campus for the \nKennedy Presidential Library where it stands today.\n  While focused on higher education, Robert Wood also became a key \nplayer in elementary and secondary education. While at the university, \nhe chaired the Citywide Coordinating Council, which was charged with \noverseeing the court ordered desegregation of the Boston Public School \nSystem. Later, the School Committee chose him to be Superintendent of \nSchools, where he labored intensively to find long-term solutions to \nthe dilemmas of school desegregation and school quality in a city \nrecently torn by racial strife.\n  In 1983, Wesleyan University invited him to become the Henry Luce \nProfessor of Democratic Institutions and the Social Order, and \nProfessor Wood dedicated the next ten years to teaching and inspiring \nfuture leaders to take up the work of public service. Today, his former \nstudents can be found in town halls and statehouses across the country \nas well as in the halls of government in Washington, DC.\n  In recognition of this rare career combining groundbreaking \nscholarship with dedicated public service, the American Political \nScience Association gave Robert C. Wood its Hubert H. Humphrey Award in \n1986.\n  In 1993, Professor Wood returned to Boston and the Boston campus of \nthe University of Massachusetts where he continued as a teacher of \nstudents and a mentor of public officials and academic colleagues.\n  His contributions to individuals, institutions and to our Nation have \nbeen great, and I thank him and wish him a happy birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11026-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE SAUGUS BOYS OF SUMMER\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Kerry, \nI welcome this opportunity to congratulate the Little League baseball \nteam of Saugus, MA for their extraordinary season and their outstanding \nperformance in the recent Little League World Series.\n  Throughout those wonderful weeks in August, these 12 young players--\nRyan Bateman, Tyler Calla, Craig Cole, Anthony DiSciscio, David \nFerreira, Tyler Grillo, Joe Kazabuski, Matthew Muldoon, Yano \nPetruzzelli, Dario Pizzano, Mark Sacco, and Michael Scuzzarella--their \nManager Rob Rochenski, and their coaches, Mike Ferreira and Bob Calla, \nshowed us how thrilling the Nation's great pastime can be, and how well \nit can be played.\n  With great skill and great teamwork, they won the State Championship. \nThey won the New England Championship. They reached the United States \nChampionship game. And in every exciting game they played, the team was \nhard working and dedicated, and they consistently maintained the \nhighest level of sportsmanship.\n  All of their hard work and talent took the team as far as any \nMassachusetts team in Little League history. In doing so, they captured \nthe hearts of people across Massachusetts and in many parts of the \nNation as well.\n  In the World Series, this remarkable team of young men sent our \nspirit soaring with four straight one-run victories. And none was more \ndramatic than their final victory of the tournament--a stunning, come-\nfrom-behind success. The team lost a six-run lead in the final regular \ninning, and then went down by three runs in extra innings. But they \nnever gave up. They demonstrated their courage and determination and \nachieved an amazing comeback in their last at bat. By the score of 14-\n13, they prevailed in one of the greatest games in Little League World \nSeries history.\n  In the end, the Saugus team was defeated in the U.S. Championship \nfinal, and finished in fourth place among the more than 7,000 Little \nLeague All Star teams that participated in the tournament worldwide--a \nbrilliant accomplishment by any standard.\n  Fifty years after the original Boys of Summer rose to greatness, \nbaseball fans throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts celebrated \nour own Boys of Summer in their spectacular success last month. With \ngreat pride, I extend my and Senator Kerry's heartfelt congratulations \nto our ``Boys of Summer'' and their parents, families and fans who gave \nthem such strong support. I'm extremely proud of them and their \naccomplishments. I wish them great success in the years ahead--and I \nhope the Red Sox scouts were taking notice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11026-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JANE STEPHENSON\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I pay tribute to Jane Stephenson, \na former college administrator and founder of the New Opportunity \nSchool for Women, NOSW. Ms. Stephenson's charity and innovation has \ngiven many women in eastern Kentucky a renewed vigor for life and an \nimproved sense of self-worth.\n  In 1987, Ms. Stephenson founded NOSW as an institution of free \ninstruction for women of Appalachia. Headquartered in Berea, KY, NOSW \ndraws women from all over the Appalachian region for 3 weeks of classes \nin job hunting, public speaking, literature, self-defense, and personal \nstyle. Additionally, students of NOSW are afforded opportunities to \nvisit cultural institutions such as the Kentucky Horse Park and the \nCincinnati Art Museum. Most women enrolled in NOSW are middle-aged and \ncome from low income homes. Were it not for Ms. Stephenson's benevolent \nvision, these women would have little opportunity to improve their \npositions in society.\n  In addition to encouraging self-awareness and improvement, Ms. \nStephenson and NOSW instill the importance of community service in \nstudents. Often, graduates from NOSW find new jobs in the social \nservice sector as a result of their experience as care givers fostered \nby NOSW. Other graduates continue their education. In fact, \napproximately 75 percent of the 400 alumni of NOSW have either pursued \nGEDs and college degrees, or found new employment opportunities.\n  Ms. Stephenson retired as director of the school several years ago, \nbut she still serves in the capacity of teacher and fundraiser. She is \nan exemplar of charity and selflessness and is one to be emulated \nnationwide. Ms. Stephenson's vision has reaped innumerable benefits in \nthe lives of hundreds of women of Appalachia. I thank the Senate for \nallowing me to pay tribute to this remarkable woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11026-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARJORIE BROOKS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as Senators, we are accustomed to \nthe glare of the public spotlight which sometimes gives us more credit \nthan we deserve. There are those, however, who work tirelessly for \nthose in their community without such recognition.\n  I wish to recognize one of those persons who works behind the scenes \nto make our country a better place to live. Marjorie Brooks, of Glover, \nwas killed on Monday, August 25, 2003 while responding to a person in \nneed.\n  Brooks was riding in an emergency vehicle that rolled over enroute to \nassist at the scene of a vehicle accident.\n  Marjorie Brooks was captain and president of the Barton Emergency \nMedical Services and had served on the squad for more than 25 years. \nShe was planning to retire in September.\n  ``Marge and her family are really a part of the history of emergency \nmedical services in Barton, the Northeast Kingdom, and Vermont as a \nwhole,'' said Dan Manz, chief of Emergency Medical Services for the \nState Department of Health. ``Marge has embodied the best of community-\nbased emergency medical care. She touched thousands of lives as an \nEMT.'' I couldn't have said it better myself.\n  The State of Vermont, including all those she served, has suffered a \ngreat loss in her death. I hope her family, including her son, Phil \nBrooks, who is the Secretary-Treasurer of the Barton EMS, finds the \nstrength they need in coping with this tragic loss.\n  Marjorie was a true public servant, and Vermont mourns her \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11026-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11026-S11027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF WILLIAM E. JOHNSON\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \noutstanding achievements and public service of Mr. William E. Johnson.\n  I have had the honor of working with Bill over the years. This month \nBill will be honored for his 40 years of dedication and service to the \ncitizens of Audrain County and the State of Missouri.\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\n  As a pioneer for home health in Audrain County, Bill was instrumental \nin the Audrain City-County Health Unit establishing a home health \nagency in 1963 which has since expanded to include four more home \nhealth units. Bill has also taken a considerable leadership role in \nhome health care serving as president of the Missouri Alliance for Home \nCare, MAHC, from 1981 to 1982 and as a member of the board of MAHC for \n9 years between 1977 and 1988. There is no question that he has been an \ninnovator in the field of home health care in Missouri.\n  While Bill continues to display tireless commitment to home health \ncare, which includes serving as administrator for the Audrain City-\nCounty Health Unit for the last 35 years, his generosity and hard work \nfor the health and well being for the citizens of Audrian County and \nMissouri expands well beyond that of home health care. In addition to \nbeing a leader in the inception of the Rural Health Administrators, \nserving on the Partnership Council of the Department of Health/Local \nHealth Department and serving on the Partnership Council Environmental \nCommittee he has been active in the Department of Health and Senior \nServices, the Meals on Wheels program and as a member of the Audrain \nCounty Human Development Corporation since 1965.\n  Today I ask the Senate to join me in honoring Bill's distinguished \ncareer in public health and public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11027-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WALTER ``SALTY'' BRINE'S 85TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, on August 5, 2003, an icon in my home \nState of Rhode Island celebrated his 85th birthday. Walter ``Salty'' \nBrine was hired by WPRO-AM in 1942 and took over as morning host in \n1943 where he stayed for 50 years.\n  Salty entertained Rhode Islanders on radio and television with his \nenthusiasm, family friendly programming and his love for Rhode Island \nand its coastline. In fact, it is his love for the water which earned \nhim the nickname ``Salty.'' But, Salty's contribution to Rhode Island \nhas been more than just entertainment. He has been a consistent \nsupporter of charitable organizations and an inspiration for the \ndisabled.\n  Brine has been a role model for Rhode Islanders and has been named a \nmember of the National Commission for the March of Dimes, National \nCommission on Muscular Dystrophy, and both the President's and Rhode \nIsland's committees on the employment of the handicapped. He has been a \nsupporter of the Meeting Street School for Crippled Children and the \nRhode Island Association for Retarded Children. Brine was named the \nrecipient of the 1999 Nellie A. Greenwood Humanitarian Award and \nnumerous other honors have been bestowed on Salty by organizations such \nas the Cranston Jaycees, Rhode Island Big Brother, Veterans of Foreign \nWars and American Legion.\n  Brine lent his support to the Lt. Governor's Rhode Island Fights Back \nProgram that asked the public to help support local businesses that \nsuffered after September 11.\n  Brine's love for the water has led to his involvement in the \npreservation of State beaches and waterways. He is on the Board of \nTrustees of Save the Bay and in 1990, a State beach was named in his \nhonor.\n  As an on air personality it was Salty's folksy, contagious enthusiasm \nthat endeared him to the Rhode Island public. Almost every lifelong \nRhode Islander, young and old, can remember Brine's winter storm school \nclosings announcements, highlighted by a line that has become a unique \npart of Rhode Island culture, ``No school Foster-Glocester!''\n  Brine dominated morning radio on WPRO for decades and he remained a \nratings winner until he left WPRO in 1993, though he continued to make \nthe famous school closing announcements from home during snowy Rhode \nIsland winters. WPRO's broadcast center is now named after him.\n  I first glimpsed Salty back in the 1950s when he came to visit his \nson, Wally, at St. Matthew's School in Cranston. Wally and I were grade \nschool classmates. Salty was the first ``celebrity'' I ever saw in \nperson. Almost 50 years later, he's still the best as well as the \nfirst.\n  In the early days of television Brine developed ``Salty Brine's \nShack,'' a children's show that ran on Channel 12 from 1958 to 1968. \nMany still remember Brine closing the show telling kids to ``Brush your \nteeth and say your prayers.''\n  Rhode Island has certainly been lucky to have Salty Brine and in an \ninterview with the Providence Journal Brine expressed a mutual love, \n``I've been very lucky,'' he said. ``I've had the most wonderful \nassociation with the State of Rhode Island anyone could ever \nhave.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11027-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11027-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/03/senate-section/article/S11027-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 802(c), the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions was discharged from the further consideration of \nthe following join resolution, which was placed on the calendar:\n\n       S.J.

A bill to revise the boundary of Harpers Ferry National \nHistorical Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to expand \nthe park boundaries for the Harpers Ferry National Historic Park. \nHarpers Ferry, located at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah \nRivers, is one of West Virginia's jewels. Its place in American \nhistory, coupled with the natural scenic beauty of the park and its \nsurroundings, make for a one-of-a-kind experience for local residents \nand visitors alike. Now is the time to move forward with that effort.\n  Harpers Ferry has been the backdrop for remarkable historic events. \nHere, in one setting, several themes in America's story converge: \nexploration, industry and transportation, the question of slavery, the \nCivil War, and the natural splendor of our Nation.\n  We are taught that the Lewis and Clark Expedition began in Wood \nRiver, IL, on the Mississippi River in 1804. But, in fact, Harpers \nFerry also contributed to that important historic expedition by \nproviding a cache of supplies that helped sustain these brave explorers \nas they traveled to the Pacific Ocean and back.\n  One of Harpers Ferry's most famous incidents occurred in 1859 when \nthe fierce abolitionist leader John Brown and a small band of raiders \nheld Federal troops at bay in the Federal arsenal. John Brown's capture \nfueled the growing tensions on the issue of slavery.\n  The property includes the operational Baltimore & Ohio train station, \nand it borders a part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Both the \nrailroad and the canal made Harpers Ferry a key transit point during \nthe Civil War.\n  In September 1862, 37,000 Union and Confederate troops wrestled for \nthe control of Harpers Ferry. Over the course of 4 days, a famous West \nVirginian, GEN Thomas Jonathan ``Stonewall'' Jackson, battled Union \ntroops that were under the leadership of COL Dixon Miles in the area of \nSchoolhouse Ridge and Bolivar Heights. When it was over, the largest \nsurrender of Union soldiers, 12,500 in all, occurred. Jackson's victory \nallowed GEN Robert E. Lee to carry his fight further to Sharpsburg, MD, \nwhere the bloodiest single day battle of the Civil War the Battle of \nAntietam--was fought.\n  Harpers Ferry's rich history is matched only by its great natural \nbeauty. Throughout the year, residents and visitors alike can be seen \nenjoying fishing, hiking, biking, horseback riding, rafting, canoeing, \nkayaking, and much more in this scenic park. In the summer of 2001, the \nPeregrine Falcon Restoration Project began at the park. Since that \ntime, 12 peregrine falcon chicks have been released across the Potomac \nRiver on Maryland Heights. This and other efforts are underway to \nrestore these incredible raptors to their native nesting sites in the \nAppalachian region.\n  Today, the park is home to a vast array of outdoor and recreational \nopportunities. The historical, recreational, and ecological \nsignificance\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\nsuggests that the time is right to expand the boundaries of Harpers \nFerry National Historic Park. The boundary expansion has the support of \na number of groups, including the Friends of Harpers Ferry, the Harpers \nFerry Conservancy, and the Civil War Preservation Trust.\n  Harpers Ferry became a part of the National Park System in 1944. My \nlegislation would expand its boundary by 1,240 acres, from its current \n2,505 acres to 3,745 acres. In order to educate local residents about \nthe expansion process, I directed the National Park Service, in the \nyear 2000, to conduct a public outreach program. As part of that \nprogram, the Park Service asked for public response to potential \nexpansion. Since the publication of the study, some lands have been \npurchased under the current acquisition ceiling. Further, the larger \nexpansion proposal, which would be authorized by the passage of my \nlegislation, has the strong support of 94 percent of the responders.\n  So, Mr. President, we must do all that we can to protect such very \nspecial places. Therefore, I am proud to introduce this legislation \nthat I hope will protect an important place for West Virginia and the \nNation as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1579. A bill to provide for the continuation of the Pediatric \nResearch Initiative; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                S. 1579\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nextend the special immigrant religious worker program; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Religious \nWorkers' Act of 2003. It provides permanent authority for 5,000 visas \nper year for non-minister religious workers. These religious workers \nfulfill a need in the religious communities around this nation. I would \nlike to thank Senators Kennedy and  Chambliss for cosponsoring this \nbill.\n  The provision relating to the ``non-minister'' religious workers was \nenacted through the Immigration Act of 1990. Prior to 1990, churches, \nsynagogues, mosques, and their affiliated organizations experienced \nsignificant difficulties in trying to gain admission for a much needed \nminister or other persons necessary to provide religious services to \nthe communities. Through the 1990 Act, Congress recognized that \nreligious institutions deserved to be on equal footing as the business \nand educational institutions in terms of having their human resources \nneeds addressed.\n  I would like to quote from a letter written by the last Mother \nTheresa to Senator Abraham shortly before her passing, asking for \ncontinuation of this visa category when it was about to sunset in 1997. \nMother Theresa said:\n\n       It means so much to our poor people, to have Sisters who \n     understand them and their culture. It takes a long time for a \n     Sister to understand the people and a culture, so now our \n     Society wants to keep our Sisters in their mission countries \n     on a more long-term basis. Please help us and our poor by \n     extending this law.\n\n  The simple plea of this great humanitarian speak volumes regarding \nwhy this law is needed.\n  In addition, I recently received a letter from Bishop Thomas Wenski, \nChairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on \nMigration. Bishop Wenski tells me that the religious workers covered by \nthis act would provide humanitarian services to the most needy, such as \nshelter and nutrition. They would care for and minister to the sick, \naged, and dying in hospitals. They counsel adolescents and others \nsuffering hardship, and support families in crisis. Bishop Wenski \nfurther advises that there is a ``rapid decrease in the number of \nAmericans turning to religious vocations. . . . In these times of \nuncertainty, it is more important than ever that faith based \norganizations be able to serve the communities through the essential \nservices provided by religious workers.''\n  The extension would allow religious organizations to continue their \nimportant programs and would provide a measure of stability that \nreligious organizations need to set long term objectives.

A bill to mitigate the harm to individuals through the \nNation who have been victimized by identity theft, to prevent identity \ntheft, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation \ncritical to helping victims of identity theft. This legislation, the \nIdentity Theft Victims Assistance Act, passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent in the 107th Congress, and I look forward to its passage again \nthis Congress. Last year, the legislation had strong bipartisan \nsupport, as evidenced by the fact that Senator Mike Enzi is \ncosponsoring it again. The bill has broad support from law enforcement, \nconsumers' groups, and privacy advocates. Last year, the National \nCenter for the Victims of Crime, the Fraternal Order of Police, \nConsumers Union, Identity Theft Resource Center, U.S. Public Interest \nGroup, Police Executive Forum, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, and \nAmazon.com supported the bill. Twenty-two State Attorneys General \nsigned a letter supporting the legislation.\n  Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in the country. The \nFederal Trade Commission found that complaints of identity theft \nincreased 87 percent between 2001 and 2002, and over 161,000 complaints \nwere received by the agency last year. A July 2003 study by Gartner \nInc. found that there was a 79-percent increase in identity theft in\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\nthe past year alone. Identity theft now accounts for 43 percent of \nconsumer fraud complaints and leads the list of consumer frauds. It is \nan insidious crime because it often occurs without the victim's \nknowledge, yet leaves scars on their credit records and reputations \nthat can last for years, and cost thousands of dollars to repair.\n  The Secret Service has estimated that consumers lose $745 million to \nthe problem each year, and this number is clearly growing as the number \nof identity thefts increases. When a victim realizes that his or her \nidentity was stolen it's just the beginning of their troubles. The FTC \nestimates that it costs the average victim $1,000 in long-distance \nphone calls, notary charges, mailing costs and lost wages to get his or \nher financial life back in order after an identity thief strikes. The \nIdentity Theft Resource Center estimates that average identity theft \nvictims spend 175 hours to clear their records.\n  But the costs are not confined to consumers--identity theft hits \nbusinesses and the economy, too. Identity theft-related losses suffered \nby MasterCard and Visa jumped from $79.9 million in 1996 to $144.3 \nmillion in 2000. One study estimates that by 2006 identity theft will \ncost the financial institution sector alone $8 billion per year.\n  To take just one of many examples from my state, Jenni D'Avis of Mill \nCreek, Washington, had her Social Security number stolen when a thief \ntook her mail and found the number listed on a letter from her \ncommunity college. The criminal used the number to obtain a state \nidentification card, and in turn used that to get credit. In just 23 \ndays, the thief ran up $100,000 in bad debt--all in Jenni's name. Once \nshe became aware of the problem, she had to become a ``Nancy Drew,'' \nand track down information. Businesses were reluctant to give her the \ninformation she needed to determine the extent of the problem and clear \nher name and credit record. She is still repairing the damage.\n  Sadly, Jenni's story is not unique. Victims of identity theft have \ndifficulty restoring their credit and regaining control of their \nidentity, in part, because they have no simple means to show creditors \nand credit reporting agencies that they are who they say they are. In \norder to prove fraud, a victim often needs copies of creditors records, \nsuch as applications and information, and records from the companies \nthe identity thief did business with. Ironically, victims have \ndifficulty obtaining these business records because the victim's \npersonally identifying information does not match the information on \nfile with the business.\n\n  This bill fixes that problem. The Identify Theft Victims Assistance \nAct creates a standardized national process for a person to establish \nhe or she is a victim of identity theft for purposes of tracing \nfraudulent credit transactions and obtaining the evidence to repair \nthem. It requires the Federal Trade Commission to make available a \nsimple certificate that, when notarized, provides certainty to \nbusinesses and financial institutions that the person is who they claim \nto be, is a victim of identity theft, and has filed claims with both \nlocal law enforcement and the FTC. With this document in hand, the \nvictim can then obtain from businesses the records they need.\n  The need for a national system is readily apparent, as identity theft \nis increasingly a crime that crosses State lines. One of the greatest \nchallenges identity theft presents to law enforcement is that a stolen \nidentity is used to create false identities in many different \nlocalities in different states. Although identity theft is a federal \ncrime, most often, state and local law enforcement agencies are \nresponsible for investigating and prosecuting the crimes. Yet law \nenforcement has yet to fully recognize the serious nature of the \nproblem or to develop a coordinated investigative strategy. For \nexample, in the case of Michael Calip of Centralia, Washington, \nidentity thieves not only ran up $60,000 in debts, they also committed \ncrimes using his name--trashing his credit record and creating a \ncriminal record. Michael tracked the thieves to Wyoming, but had \ndifficulty convincing local authorities there to pursue his case.\n  My bill for the first time also permits a victim to designate the \ninvestigating agency, either local or State law enforcement or Federal \ninvestigators, to act as their agents in obtaining evidence of identity \ntheft. This both eases the burden on the victim and aids police in \ninvestigating suspected identity theft rings. In addition it requires \nthe existing Identity Theft Coordinating Committee to consult with \nState and local law enforcement agencies.\n  Acquiring the evidence of the fraudulent use of identity currently \ncan be an enormous and time-consuming problem for victims. The Identity \nTheft Victims Assistance Act makes this job easier by establishing that \nany business presented with the FTC certificate identifying the person \nas a victim of identity theft, together with a police report and a \ngovernment issued photo ID must deliver copies of all the financial \nrecords that document the fraud to the victim within 20 days. This is a \ncritically important change from current law because it guarantees that \nvictims will be able to obtain the evidence they need while also \nproviding businesses more certainty that they are not violating \nsomeone's privacy or providing sensitive information to the wrong \nparties. It also provides new liability protections for businesses that \nmake a good faith effort to assist victims of identity theft.\n  Of course, the greatest harm to consumers victimized by theft of \ntheir identity is often a bad credit rating or a poor credit score that \nresults from fraudulent use of the consumer's identity. According to \nthe FTC, it often takes about a year for people to discover someone is \nusing personal information for fraudulent purposes, allowing \nsignificant damage to otherwise stellar credit records. Even after a \nconsumer reports to a credit reporting agency that they have been \nvictimized by identity theft, the consumer often can not get the \nreporting agencies to block reporting of activities that resulted from \nthe identity theft.\n  My bill again requires that presentation of the FTC certificate, \npolice report and photo identification establish that the person is in \nfact a victim of identity theft and requires credit-reporting agencies \nto block information that appears on a victim's credit report as a \nresult of the identity theft. It also changes current law that requires \nindividuals to bring suit against a credit reporting agency within two \nyears from the time the agency commits a violation of laws on fair \nreporting of credit. This makes little sense, since it may be years \nbefore a misrepresentation comes to the attention of a victim of \nidentity theft. The bill requires that the statute of limitations begin \nticking from the time when a consumer discovers or has reason to know \nthat a misrepresentation by a credit reporting agency has occurred.\n  The bill leaves in place State laws that are more stringent and \nprovides that either Federal prosecutors or State Attorney Generals may \nenforce this law.\n  Jenni and Michael's stories illustrate the unique problems victims of \nidentity theft face. Although penalties exist for identity thieves, no \nremedies are available for their victims. The scope of the problem is \nmade worse because it's too easy for a criminal to steal someone's \nidentity and cause serious harm before the theft is even discovered. \nAnd when these criminals cross state lines, it can be even harder for \nvictims to trace the problem and repair the damage. For these reasons, \nit's imperative that we pass federal legislation for the victims of \nidentity theft.\n  The government, creditors and credit reporting agencies have a shared \nresponsibility to assist identity theft victims mitigate the harm that \nresults from frauds perpetrated in the victim's name. We need to build \nup the law enforcement network, already started by the Federal Trade \nCommission and other federal agencies under the Identity Theft and \nAssumption Deterrence Act of 1998. We need to further improve law \nenforcement coordination, particularly between the various local and \nstate jurisdictions combating identity theft and the associated crimes.\n  We also need to provide better and timelier information to businesses \nso they can head off fraud before it happens. That is why my bill also \nexpands the jurisdiction of the interagency coordinating committee \nestablished under the Internet False Identification Act of 2000. \nCurrently, the coordination committee has the mandate to study\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\nand report to Congress on federal investigation and enforcement of \nidentity theft crimes. The Identity Theft Victims Assistance Act \nbroadens the mandate for the coordinating committee to consider state \nand local enforcement of identity theft law and specifically requires \nthe committee to examine and recommend what assistance the federal \ngovernment can provide state and local law enforcement agencies to \nbetter coordinate in the battle against identity theft.\n  There is no doubt about the scope of the problem: identity theft is \nalready a major problem, and it's getting worse. We must provide \nvictims with the tools they need to regain control of their lives. The \nIdentity Theft Victims Assistance of 2003 will help victims of identity \ntheft recover their identity and restore their good credit. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to promptly enact this bill into \nlaw.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Identity Theft Victims \n     Assistance Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The crime of identity theft is the fastest growing \n     crime in the United States. According to a recent estimate, \n     7,000,000 Americans were victims of identity theft in the \n     past year, a 79 percent increase over previous estimates.\n       (2) Stolen identities are often used to perpetuate crimes \n     in many cities and States, making it more difficult for \n     consumers to restore their respective identities.\n       (3) Identity theft cost consumers more than $745,000,000 in \n     1998 and has increased dramatically in the last few years. It \n     has been estimated that identity theft victims within the \n     business community lose an average of $17,000.\n       (4) Identity theft is ruinous to the good name and credit \n     of consumers whose identities are misappropriated, and \n     consumers may be denied otherwise deserved credit and may \n     have to spend enormous time, effort, and money to restore \n     their respective identities.\n       (5) As of the date of enactment of this Act, a national \n     mechanism does not exist to assist identity theft victims to \n     obtain evidence of identity theft, restore their credit, and \n     regain control of their respective identities.\n       (6) Consumers who are victims of identity theft need a \n     nationally standardized means of--\n       (A) establishing their true identities and claims of \n     identity theft to all business entities, credit reporting \n     agencies, and Federal and State law enforcement agencies;\n       (B) obtaining information documenting fraudulent \n     transactions from business entities;\n       (C) reporting identity theft to consumer credit reporting \n     agencies.\n       (7) Business entities, credit reporting agencies, and \n     government agencies have a shared responsibility to assist \n     victims of identity theft to mitigate the harm caused by any \n     fraud perpetrated in the name of the victims.\n\n     SEC. 3.
