Mr. President, I will be back a little later this morning, \nbut I do want to take an opportunity, seeing our distinguished \nPresident pro tempore in the chair today, to comment on an issue I know \nhe feels strongly about as well as I, and that is the issue of physical \nactivity and nutrition and the growing obesity epidemic in the United \nStates.\n  It is an issue that has, thank goodness, received increasing \nattention over the last several weeks and months; that is, obesity, the \nepidemic now in the United States, and its very direct impact on one's \noverall health, whether it is quality of life or how long one lives.\n  Despite tremendous gains in public health in this country and, \nindeed, around the world, America remains the most overweight country \non the globe. Indeed, it is taking its toll in a way that people are \nonly now beginning to realize. But thank goodness they are.\n  In fact, earlier this year, the CDC, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, released data showing that lack of physical activity and \npoor nutrition are the second leading causes of death in the United \nStates of America. That is second only to smoking. In fact, if recent \ntrends continue, obesity can soon overtake smoking as the leading cause \nof death in the United States. Looking at the recent trends, it is very \nlikely that, indeed, will be the case.\n  The good news about that, and I would also say about smoking--\nalthough smoking is such a powerful addiction, it has been shown to be \nsuch a challenge--but the good news about the obesity epidemic we are \nseeing is, through education and a change in lifestyle alone we can \nprevent this epidemic from occurring. We can prevent this killing.\n\n  The trend has been over the last 30 years. It is one of these \nproblems that has been around. We have always had obesity for whole \ndifferent reasons. But for new reasons--lack of activity, poor \nnutrition, promotion of poor nutrition--we have had this trend of \nobesity skyrocketing over a 30-year period. I am very hopeful that by \ndoing our part in the Senate, as elected representatives, as leaders, \nthrough the hearing process, through education, through serving as \ndirect examples, we can help turn this tide and again reverse it over \nthe next several years.\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\n  The CDC, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the U.S. \nSurgeon General have come together to recommend that, for adults, 30 \nminutes of moderate-intensity activity 5 or more days a week will \nactually stabilize and reverse the trends we have seen. It is clear \nthat additional physical activity will have even increased benefits on \nthe part of the body that I specialized on, the heart, but also chronic \ndiseases such as diabetes, probably some cancers, clearly lung disease \nas well. Again, if we can all concentrate on that 30 minutes.\n  In terms of weight gain, it is not clear yet. We can't accurately \npredict and say this is how much exercise you need to do to prevent \nweight gain or reverse weight gain because it is such an individual \nmatter. But we all know physical activity plays a very prominent role \nin reversing weight gain. It is an important aspect of weight control. \nIt helps promote caloric balance. It helps promote general well-being. \nIn fact, it also helps control appetite.\n  I mention all this, and I am delighted you will see a lot of Senators \nand staff members wearing one of these little pedometers. I happen to \nhave one on now. I am a little embarrassed to open up and read how many \nsteps I have taken today. As of 9:30 this morning I have only taken 625 \nsteps. That is too little because by the end of the day I need to have \ntaken a recommended 8,000 or 10,000 steps.\n  In fact, yesterday I only took about 4,500 steps. So I need to reach \nmy goal of 8,000 to 10,000 over the course of the day. What it does \ncause me to do is at least think about, instead of taking the elevator \nright outside the doors, to walk up those two flights of steps, or \ninstead of riding in a car a block or two blocks or three blocks, go \nahead and walk on the beautiful day that we have outside. The feedback \none gets really helps you think, and then hopefully gives you sort of \nsecondary reinforcement to incorporate that into your lifestyle.\n  The daily step goals can vary. What I encourage people to do is wear \nthese little inexpensive pedometers. All they do is measure your steps. \nThey do that fairly accurately. People's steps are different lengths, \nbut they give you a way to monitor the activity you do each day, but \nthen also how much you can improve by altering your lifestyle just a \nlittle bit. That feedback is very important in terms of changing \nlifestyle.\n\n  During last week--and we will see how long it lasts; I hope it will \nbe for a while--all of my staff have gone out and gotten these little, \ntiny plastic devices which they are wearing. This week we are going to \nbe measuring our baselines to see where we are, and then we will see in \nthe future how much improvement there is. In fact, later today we will \nall go out and take a little jog around The Mall. All of us will try \nbringing our counts up. We try to do a lot within our own Senate \ncommunity. I encourage my colleagues to do the same. It is really a \nmatter of raising awareness and changing our lifestyles, which will \ndefinitely improve health.\n  I thank the CDC Foundation and the America on the Move organization \nfor supplying us with these devices. I should also mention for those of \nmy colleagues and others who are listening today who wish to find out \nmore about the pedometers and the importance of daily exercise, two Web \nsites. The one I highly recommend is the CDC Web site. I will give my \ncolleagues both those addresses. The Web site for America on the Move \nis www.americaonthemove.org. The Web site for the CDC is www.cdc.gov.\n  You don't have to run. You can walk. You can use a pedometer doing \nthat, and you can make great strides toward a healthier lifestyle.\n  A couple of key points:\n  The 30-minute minimum does not have to be done at one time in terms \nof the official recommendations. You can do it in three 10-minute \nintervals over the course of the day. You want to be walking at a fast \nenough intensity where it will make a difference enough to accelerate \nthe heart rate modestly for each of those 10-minute periods.\n  Finally, I will close with the best part of all of this, which is \nthat it is never too late. No matter what age you are, you can actually \nchange your overall health status, your quality of life, and how long \nyou live if you decide today to change your lifestyle. It will make a \ndifference. It doesn't matter how old you are, how unfit your baseline \nis, or how inactive you are. Current research shows that starting a \nmore active lifestyle through exercise can make you healthier and \nimprove your quality of life.\n  That is my health tip for day. It is a little bit about what we do as \nphysicians, as one who exercises regularly, and as one who believes it \ncan make a difference. I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair, \nthe distinguished President pro tempore, is a religious exerciser.\n  I wanted to make that very brief statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3200-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our Constitution has vested the Senate \nwith the responsibility of advising and consenting on the President's \nnominations.\n  Throughout the full range of administration appointments--from top \nCabinet officials, to Federal judges, to boards and commissions--the \nSenate's role is to speak for the American people and ensure the \nhighest standards of public service are maintained throughout our \nGovernment.\n  We have exercised this oversight authority with extraordinary \nrestraint. Democrats have sought to participate in the nomination \nprocess and work together with the administration and the majority in a \nbipartisan fashion to confirm public servants in the highest traditions \nof our Nation.\n  Regrettably, the administration has chosen to reject the course of \nbipartisanship, even though Democrats have tried to accommodate the \nPresident's goal of filling judicial vacancies. The Senate has \nconfirmed a record 173 Federal judges, rejecting only 3.\n  These three judges were far outside the mainstream and had troubling \nrecords of judicial activism in service to extreme ideology. They were \nrejected for that reason.\n  In spite of the Senate's judgment, the President has chosen to take \nthe unprecedented step of using recess appointments to bypass the \nSenate on two occasions. First, in order to appoint Charles Pickering \nto the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. And second, to appoint William \nPryor to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  At no point has a President ever used a recess appointment to install \na rejected nominee on to the Federal bench. And there are intimations \nthat there will be even more recess appointments in the coming months.\n  These actions not only poison the nomination process, but they strike \nat the heart of the principle of checks and balances that is one of the \npillars of the American democracy.\n  This cannot continue. What is at stake here is not just a few \nnominations. What is at stake is the Senate's obligation to represent \nthe American people and check unrestrained executive power.\n  This White House is insisting on a radical departure from historic \nand constitutional practices. They have broken the process and we want \nto fix it.\n  And we stand ready to fix it. I have spoken to the majority leader \nabout my serious concerns.\n  Let us be clear: We will continue to cooperate in the confirmation of \nFederal judges, but only if the White\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\nHouse gives us assurances that it will no longer abuse the process and \nthat it will once again respect our Constitution's essential system of \nchecks and balances.\n  Sadly, this is not the only area in which the administration has \nchosen to cast aside traditions of bipartisanship and cooperation.\n  One of the minority's less visible yet vital responsibilities is the \nnaming of Democratic candidates to sit on government boards and \ncommissions.\n  These boards span the entire range of government responsibilities, \nfrom engaging young people in community and national service, to \noverseeing financial markets, to supervising the security of America's \nnuclear facilities, to protecting Americans from illegal energy company \nprice-gouging.\n  They may not get a lot of headlines, but the public servants who sit \non these boards perform an extraordinary service to their Nation and \nhave a direct influence on the security, prosperity, health, and well-\nbeing of the American people.\n  Once again, Democrats have tried to work in a bipartisan fashion. In \nthe 108th congress alone, we have confirmed 419 of the President's \nnonjudicial nominations.\n  Because of the importance of these boards, many have a statutory \nrequirement of bipartisanship. Others have bipartisan participation by \nlong-established practice.\n  Their purpose is not simply to serve one party or another, or the \nadministration in power at the moment, but the entire Nation. In order \nto provide our Nation with responsible stewardship, these boards must \nresist political manipulation and partisan divisions.\n  For decades, the nomination and confirmation process has honored the \nunique and vital role of these boards and commissions. During the \nClinton administration, for instance, Republican nominations were \nconsidered and approved, even when the nominees were outspoken \nopponents of administration policy.\n  The same was true during the administrations for Ronald Reagan and \nGeorge H.W. Bush.\n  During the current administration, however, that standard has been \ncast aside. And a divisive form of political gamesmanship has been \nallowed to extend to the nomination process. Talented candidates are \nbeing prevented from serving their Nation. The views and communities \nthey represent are not being heard. And the American people are losing \nout as a result.\n  Among the candidates rejected by the administration are potential \nnominees to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, the Export-Import Bank, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service, and many more.\n  Let me give you a brief background on just a few of these rejected \ncandidates.\n  For instance, Warren Stern. Early in 2003, Mr. Stern was recommended \nto serve in the Democratic position on the Defense Nuclear Facilities \nBoard. Shortly afterward, he was rejected on the grounds that he did \nnot have ``enough scientific background.''\n  The charge is absurd on its face. Mr. Stern has degrees in physics, \nnuclear engineering, and national security studies. He was selected as \nthe State Department's Senior coordinator for Nuclear Safety, and he \ncoordinates the work of the Department of Energy and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission in the field of international nuclear safety \npolicy.\n  Last July, while his nomination was supposed to be under \nconsideration at the White House, the State Department conferred upon \nhim the Superior Honor Award, for ``developing and implementing a \ndiplomatic and technical strategy for the control of dangerous \nradioactive materials.''\n  At a time when our intelligence community tells us that America's \nnuclear facilities are being targeted by terrorists, Mr. Stern brings \nan extraordinary range and depth of experience that will make America \nsafer. But he is being denied the chance to serve for no reason.\n  Take Dr. Chon Noriega. Dr. Noriega was nominated in March of 2003 to \nthe Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He was recommended because \nDemocrats believe that Public Broadcasting can do much more to reach \nout to America's growing Hispanic community.\n  As the Nation's foremost academic authority on Hispanic media, Dr. \nNoriega is uniquely suited to help the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting achieve this goal. Dr. Noriega is the Associate Director \nof UCLA's Chicano Studies Research Center and the author of eight books \non the topic of Hispanic media.\n  America's Hispanic community could have no more passionate or \neffective advocate than Dr. Noriega. Yet the administration has once \nagain refused to nominate a superbly qualified candidate, and the \nNation's largest minority community has one less advocate as a result.\n  Finally, and perhaps most absurdly, is the administration's refusal \nto nominate Judge Patricia Wald to the Legal Services Corporation. \nJudge Wald served on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia for 20 years, the last 5 as its chief judge.\n  After her retirement from the circuit court, she was asked to serve \nas a judge on the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia.\n  Judge Wald is a brilliant jurist, whose probity, integrity, and \ncommitment to the American legal system are unassailable. So respected \nis she that just last month, President Bush asked her to sit on the \ncommission investigating the collection and use of intelligence leading \nup to the Iraqi War.\n  If she can be trusted with the responsibility of restoring confidence \nin the intelligence system on which America's security depends, surely \nshe is qualified and trustworthy enough to help extend legal \nrepresentation to Americans who cannot afford it.\n  Democrats have tried to work together with the administration to \ncontinue the bipartisan process of nominations, both for boards and for \nthe Federal bench.\n  Repeatedly, we have asked the administration to conduct the \nnomination process in a bipartisan manner, and we have been denied.\n  The administration has crossed a line and it is time it pulls back. \nWe can no longer stand by and watch this critical aspect of our \nresponsibilities be undermined by the intrusion of partisan politics.\n  Whether it is a nomination to a board or a lifetime appointment to \nthe Federal bench, we cannot allow the Senate's role to be disregarded.\n  Once we have confidence that the integrity of this process is \nrestored, Democrats will be accommodating to the White House's \nnominations.\n  We hoped for a different result, but the administration has left us \nno choice. I ask my Republican colleagues to reach out to \nadministration officials and urge them to return this process to its \ntraditions of bipartisanship and cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The deputy Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Democratic leader leaves the floor, Mr. \nPresident, through you to the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, \nis it true we have approved 173 Federal judges during the time \nPresident Bush has been President?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As of this day, March 26, I answer the Senator from \nNevada, we have approved 173 judges and 419 nonjudicial nominations by \nthis administration. I don't know whether the nontraditional \nnominations is some kind of record over 3 years, but we now know the \njudicial record of 173 has not been equaled.\n  So the answer is yes, we have cooperated as fully as any Congress has \nin accommodating an administration with regard to appointments it \nconsiders to be of value to the country. We are only asking for similar \nconsideration of the nominations and a recognition of the importance of \nthe constitutional process of advise and consent, which is why I \nexpressed the concern this morning about the recess appointments of \nthose judges who have not been confirmed in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask, through the Chair to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, it is also true, is it not, that 173 judges have \nbeen approved; we have been, through your direction, very selective and \nturned down five, two of whom the President has done an unusual thing \nof making recess appointments. So right now, there are I believe three \nwho have in effect been turned down.\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. There have only been 3 out of \n173 now that have not been given the authority to serve on the bench \nand, as I said, for good reason--either their unwillingness to \ncooperate with the nominating process or fulfill their obligation to \nprovide information regarding their positions, or the fact that they \nhave clearly demonstrated extreme positions on issues that fall way \noutside the mainstream of philosophical thinking and prevented their \nconfirmation.\n  The Senator is correct: 173 is the accurate number today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and if I am out of \nline, the Chair in his capacity as the Senator from the State of Alaska \ncan object--to speak for up to 15 minutes in morning business rather \nthan 10.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3202-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3202-S3203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ATTACKING THE MESSENGER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when you cannot attack a man's ideas, attack \nthe man. Sadly, that is what we have seen over the last few days in the \ncase of Richard Clarke, a dedicated public servant.\n  Before this week, few Americans knew who Mr. Clarke was. But now, \naccording to this morning's Washington Post, 9 out of 10 people in \nAmerica know who Richard Clarke is.\n  Those who did know Mr. Clarke knew him as a person who has devoted \nhis entire adult life to serving his country and keeping our country \nsafe.\n  As a distinguished Senator, Bob Kerrey said yesterday--and he knows a \nthing or two about patriotism--Clarke did many things to keep this \ncountry safe, that none of us will ever know about. That is the nature \nof counterterrorism.\n\n  Mr. Clarke has served four Presidents--three Republicans and one \nDemocrat. In fact, he called the first President Bush the best national \nsecurity professional he had ever worked for. That goes to the very \nbasic knowledge that President Bush, among his other assets, was also \nhead of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Mr. Clarke worked in the State Department, and then led the \ncounterterrorism effort in the White House for more than 10 years.\n  This is how important he was and how much confidence everyone had in \nhis abilities: On the day of the tragedy of September 11, he was put in \ncharge--I repeat, put in charge--of coordinating the White House \nresponse. Even today, after he retired from public service, Mr. Clarke \ncontinues to make a contribution to our national security.\n  Mr. Clarke has raised a few questions, important questions, such as: \nWas fighting terrorism a real priority for the Bush administration \nprior to September 11, or was it down the list of national security \nconcerns, behind things such as missile defense?\n  According to an Associated Press story, President Bush's national \nsecurity team met almost 100 times prior to September 11, but terrorism \nwas the topic of only 2 of these sessions.\n  The next question: What actions were we taking to knock out Osama bin \nLaden and his henchmen, who had already successfully attacked several \nU.S. targets overseas?\n  Mr. Clarke says President Clinton was obsessed with this.\n  What were we doing in the first part of 2001, after President Clinton \nleft office and was no longer there, obsessed in some way to get rid of \nOsama bin Laden? As you know, President Clinton ordered a missile \nlaunch in an attempt to get Osama bin Laden.\n  The next question deals with the Predators, unmanned aerial vehicles. \nThese vehicles were developed 36 miles from Las Vegas in Indian \nSprings. These vehicles were and are an essential part of the weapons \ncomplex that is in Nevada. People do not realize that 40 percent of the \nairspace of this very large State of Nevada is restricted military \nairspace. One of the reasons is you can test the Predator, and what it \ncan do and what it cannot do, because of the vast amount of airspace we \nhave in Nevada. So I have a special interest in the Predator because of \nits basing in Nevada.\n  Question: Were we following Mr. Clarke's recommendations to utilize \nthis tremendous tool more effectively in the fight against terror?\n  How much has the war in Iraq helped or hindered our war on terrorism?\n  Finally, one of the questions Richard Clarke asks: There were at \nleast two of the September 11 hijackers in our country, if terrorism \nwas a top priority, why weren't airport personnel on the lookout for \nthese known terrorists?\n  These are questions Richard Clarke has asked, reasonable questions.\n  I refer to today's Washington Post, a front-page story, written by \nMike Allen. Among other things, this newspaper article says--similar \narticles are being run all over America. After Clarke asked these \nquestions, here is what Mike Allen said:\n\n       So this week, his aides--\n\n  President Bush's aides--\n\n     turned the full power of the executive branch on Richard A. \n     Clarke, formerly the administration's top counterterrorism \n     official, who charges in his new book that Bush responded \n     lackadaisically in 2001 to repeated warnings on an impending \n     terrorist attack.\n\n  When you cannot attack a man's ideas, or even his questions, you \nattack the man.\n  Allen goes on further to say:\n\n       They questioned the truthfulness of Clarke's claims, his \n     competence as an employee, the motives behind the book's \n     timing, and even the sincerity of the pleasantries in his \n     resignation letter and [his] farewell photo session with \n     Bush.\n\n  Just a few others things out of this long article:\n\n       James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional \n     and Presidential Studies of American University, said he was \n     stunned by the ferocity of the White House campaign [against] \n     Clarke.\n\n  Thurber goes on also to say:\n\n       They are vulnerable, which is why they are attacking so \n     hard. You have to go back to Vietnam or Watergate to get the \n     same feel about the structure of argument coming out of the \n     White House against Clarke's statements.\n\n  The article states:\n\n       A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the \n     Press, conducted Monday through Wednesday, found significant \n     public interest in Clarke's criticisms, with nearly nine in \n     10 . . . Americans surveyed saying they had heard of them \n     [heard of his ideas]. Of those polled, 42 percent said they \n     had heard ``a lot'' about his claims and 47 percent said they \n     had heard ``a little.''\n\n  Ninety percent of the people in America are aware of what is going on \nwith these ferocious attacks.\n  Are these legitimate questions? Is it a legitimate question to find \nout why the national security team met 100 times and only twice \ndiscussed terrorism? It is a legitimate question. It deserves a \nlegitimate answer.\n  President Clinton was obsessed with taking out Osama bin Laden. Why \nwasn't the President of the United States, George W. Bush, obsessed \nwith taking out Osama bin Laden? It is a valid question.\n  Why wasn't the Predator aircraft used to find and destroy Osama bin \nLaden and his operations? It is a question Richard Clarke raises. It \ndeserves an answer.\n  Another question he raises--and America understands this; the people \nin Nevada understand this--how much has the war in Iraq helped or \nhindered the war on terrorism? That is a question that is running \nthrough the fiber of the American people.\n  Finally, Richard Clarke asks:\n\n       Why weren't we doing something to get rid of the terrorists \n     who we already knew were here?\n\n  These are legitimate questions. I think there could be legitimate \ndifferences about the answers to these questions. We should be debating \nthese issues and not whether Clarke's meeting with the President, when \nhe left, was sincere, or attacking him personally about his not being a \ngood employee. I do not think that is the right way to answer these \nquestions.\n  When you cannot attack a man's ideas, you attack the man. That is \nwrong.\n  The questions that have been raised are legitimate, and they deserve \nanswers. We should be debating these issues in a way that reflects the \ngravity and the seriousness of this challenge to our Nation. There is \nnot a single one of these questions that has been asked that is not \nserious.\n  I think it is sad that, based on what we have seen in the past from \nthis administration--I guess I should not be surprised. Any time this \nadministration is faced with tough questions they do not want to \nanswer, they respond by making personal attacks.\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\n  Here on the floor yesterday I talked about what they have tried to do \nto demonize and damage Senator Tom Daschle. He is the leader of the \nDemocratic Senate. He has been the titular head of the Democratic \nParty, and there have been very personal attacks directed toward him, \nquestioning his patriotism--a man who served in the U.S. military--\nattacking his family, attacking his religiosity--whether he is a proper \nmember of his church. These are not proper responses.\n  Senator Daschle, as he did today, came to the floor and said he does \nnot believe the White House is handling the nominations of statutory \nDemocratic nominations; they are rejecting them, and they are rejecting \nthem for no cause.\n  Why doesn't someone come and defend that, say we are rejecting all \nthese 36 people because they are all bad people and not qualified? No, \nthey are not willing to do that. They go after Senator Daschle. They \ndid it to former Senator Max Cleland, one of the most courageous, \ninspirational, wonderful people I have ever met in my life.\n  Senator Cleland went to Vietnam, volunteered to go, a strapping man, \n6 foot 4. You would never know it now because you never see him stand. \nHe only has one leg. He has no arms. I am sorry. He has no legs, and he \nhas one arm. For him to get dressed every morning is a 2-hour ordeal. A \nman with always a smile on his face, a man who, prior to his serious \ninjury, was honored with the Silver Star in Vietnam for his gallantry. \nBut that was not enough.\n  He was attacked personally for not being patriotic because he did not \nsupport the President's version of homeland security. With untold \namounts of money, he was defeated in his reelection bid in Georgia.\n  He was the original cosponsor of the bill to create a Department of \nHomeland Security, long before President Bush supported such an idea. \nBut this was not good enough. They attacked him, not his ideas.\n  When the President finally came around and agreed we needed a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, Mr. Cleland did not agree with him on \nall the details about how the employees should be classified. Fair \nenough. Debate the issues and discuss your differences. But this \nadministration condoned campaign TV ads that compared Max Cleland, who \nlost three limbs, to Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Can you \nimagine that?\n  Zell Miller, my friend--I care a great deal about him--doesn't vote \nwith us a lot on issues. He is a Democrat and has been his whole life. \nHe doesn't vote with the Democrats as I think he should, but I respect \nhis voting in a way that he believes is appropriate for his conscience. \nBut Zell Miller, being the patriot he is and knowing the sacrifices Max \nCleland has made for his country, said:\n\n       My friend Max deserves better than to be slandered like \n     this.\n\n  Congratulations to Zell Miller. I have read his book, his second \nbook. He has written one on the Marine Corps I have not read. I \ncongratulate him. I have great respect for my friend Zell Miller. I \nappreciate very much his stepping out, doing his very best to protect \nand defend his friend Max Cleland. Every Member of the Senate agrees on \nthis side of the aisle with what Zell did.\n  Senator Cleland was not the only person. I talked about Senator \nDaschle. If you want to read an interesting book, read Paul O'Neill's \n``The Price of Loyalty.'' Paul O'Neill is one of America's great \nbusinessmen. He was chief executive officer of Alcoa Corporation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to speak for another 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. No one would ever question his business acumen and his \nRepublican Party credentials. He, as Secretary of the Treasury, didn't \nthink the President conducted his office appropriately. He was asked to \nresign and left and wrote a book about his experiences in the \nWhite House as Secretary of the Treasury. Rather than trying to \nfactually discount his book statements, they went after him. He \nquestioned economic policies, foreign policy issues, and was denounced \nas a person who did not know what he was talking about or doing. It is \na lot easier to attack a man personally than it is to defend the \neconomic policies that have controlled our country. It is a lot easier \nto attack a man personally than it is defend the economic policies that \nhave contributed to the largest deficit in history, the worst record in \njobs since Herbert Hoover. It is easier, but that doesn't mean it is \nright.\n\n  It wasn't right to leak the name of an undercover CIA agent because \nher husband said the President was mistaken about claiming Iraq had \npurchased uranium from Africa. Can you imagine that? An undercover CIA \noperative, someone who could be subject to be killed. Not only could \nthat woman be subject to be harmed, but what about all the contacts she \nhad. She was an undercover spy for America, and the White House, in an \neffort to disparage this man who disagreed with the administration on \nwhether there was uranium that had come to Iraq from Africa, rather \nthan questioning whether that was a fact, went after his wife.\n  It wasn't right to compare Senator Cleland to a murderer like Osama \nbin Laden, to attack Senator Daschle. These kinds of personal attacks \nare known as ad hominem arguments. That is Latin for ``to the man.'' As \na logical term, it means instead of refuting the point or argument \nbeing presented, you attack the person presenting it. In short, if you \ndon't like the message, attack the messenger. Aristotle called ad \nhominem arguments a fallacy of logic. They are the last recourse of \nthose who can't debate an issue on its merits. The purpose of an ad \nhominem attack is to either convince your opponent to stop arguing or \nto convince the audience to stop listening. Sometimes it works, but it \nhasn't worked here. Nine out of every 10 Americans know of Richard \nClarke's story. I don't think Richard Clarke is going to be \nintimidated.\n  I don't know him. To my knowledge, I have never spoken to him. I \nthink the American people want an honest discussion of the questions \nthis patriot is raising. This administration is attacking its critics. \nThey are firing them, such as Larry Lindsey, or threatening to fire \nthem, such as Mr. Foster, for telling the truth.\n  Larry Lindsey tried to tell the truth about how much the war was \ngoing to cost. He said it would cost $100 billion. He got fired. But he \nwas way short. Last year alone we appropriated over $150 billion. \nGeneral Shinseki, when he told the truth about how many troops we would \nneed, got fired. It is a matter of record. Foster wanted last year to \ntell us how much Medicare would cost. He was told if he said a word, he \nwould be fired, if he told the truth about the cost of Medicare.\n  This administration does not take questions well. It is too bad. In \nAmerica we have a right to ask questions about what our Government is \ndoing. Those questions deserve honest answers and debate, not threats \nand personal attacks.\n  I thank my colleagues. I am sorry they had to wait. I usually try not \nto speak very long. No one was here when I started. I certainly \napologize for using more than my 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak for 15 minutes, and I may yield some time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3203-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3203-S3205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MISSTATEMENTS ABOUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, allow me to respond to some of the \ncomments we have heard this morning, both from the minority leader and \nthe minority whip. While it has been a rather broad attack on the \nadministration on a number of different fronts, there are a couple of \nthings I would like to direct my comments to by way of response.\n  I only wish that when we had differences of policy, we would confine \nour disagreements to policy and not make egregious errors of fact. \nWhile everybody has a right to their opinion, no one has a right to be \nwrong about the facts, or to misstate them in such a patently \ninaccurate way. My intention is to try to correct some of these \nmisstatements that have been made by the minority leader, as well as \nthe minority whip.\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\n  Really, they relate to two different areas. As I said, the attack has \nbeen rather broad and varied, but I have chosen to talk about the issue \nof nominations and the minority whip's comments with regard to Mr. \nRichard Clarke.\n  Let me first talk about Mr. Richard Clarke. I had the pleasure of \nmeeting Mr. Clarke several years ago when I was attorney general of the \nState of Texas. We had him come down to the State and consult with us \non the issue of cyber-terrorism, an area that most people in this \ncountry probably haven't thought a lot about but which is very \nimportant to our national security. Indeed, Mr. Clarke brought with him \ntremendous credentials in terms of his experience in counterterrorism \nworking, as he did, during the Clinton administration, and then for a \nwhile under the administration of President George W. Bush.\n  Mr. President, I think it is blatantly unfair of Mr. Clarke, \nnotwithstanding his credentials in counterterrorism, which I admire, to \nsuggest that this President who was in office roughly 8 months before \nthe attacks of September 11 was responsible for the 9/11 incident, when \nin fact the administration of President Bill Clinton, in which Mr. \nClark worked, stood by and did not respond adequately to ever-\nescalating attacks against this country by Osama bin Laden and by al-\nQaida.\n  It was in 1993 that Osama bin Laden directed al-Qaida's first \nsuccessful attack on American soil, blowing up a car bomb in the \nbasement garage of the World Trade Center, killing 6 and wounding \n1,000. And then, in 1996, there was another attack against the United \nStates Air Force's Khobar Towers barracks in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 \nAmericans and wounding 515 Americans and Saudis. Then, in 1998, U.S. \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania were attacked by al-Qaida suicide \nbombers who killed 234 people and wounded more than 5,000. And then, in \n2000, al-Qaida attacked USS Cole, killing 17 American sailors and \nwounding 39.\n  Mr. President, I think it is only fair to ask where Mr. Clarke was \nduring these ever-escalating attacks by al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden \nagainst Americans. The truth is, he was working in the Clinton White \nHouse in counterterrorism. I am confident he was doing everything he \nthought he could do. But if you have read some of his remarks, \napparently he felt he was not getting a good response out of the \nPresident and others; indeed, he was prevented from briefing President \nClinton on some of these attacks. The Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency himself was not allowed to give daily briefings to \nPresident Clinton, as he currently does and as he has done since the \nbeginning of the Bush administration.\n  So I would say Mr. Clarke's motives for making these reckless \nallegations against President Bush and the Bush administration just \ndon't ring true. Indeed, perhaps they are a diversion from his \nresponsibility and the responsibility of the previous administration \nwhen it came to never adequately responding to Osama bin Laden and al-\nQaida attacks until, of course, the terrible day of September 11.\n  Indeed, if you listen to some of President Bush's critics and the \ncomments made by the minority whip and others on this very floor and in \nthe press, you would say they are complaining that the President didn't \ndo enough when it comes to fighting the war on terror. Of course, just \na few short days ago, before Mr. Clarke's book came out, these same \ncritics were saying the President had done too much, and that his \npolicy and the Nation's policy of preemptive attack against our \nenemies--that is, not waiting until we are attacked and more Americans \nare killed, but going after the sleeper cells and the terrorists where \nthey live before they can attack and thus protecting American citizens \nand American property in that way.\n  So really I don't see how they can have it both ways. By saying on \none hand, if you believe Mr. Clarke, the administration didn't do \nenough, but then if you listen to other critics, just a few short days \nago they were saying this President, this administration, did too \nmuch--you cannot have it both ways. I think the American people \nunderstand that. They also understand what is happening in the Senate \nand elsewhere, when this administration is attacked for leading the war \non terror.\n  The truth is--and I think the American people recognize this--that no \none has demonstrated greater leadership and greater commitment to \nprotecting Americans and America's national interests on the war on \nterror than President George W. Bush--no one. The American people know \nthat. It is just not right to try to suggest otherwise. It certainly \ncontradicts those assertions and contradicts all of the facts I have \nonly spoken about. If necessary, we can revisit this at a later time.\n  I also want to respond to some of the comments made by the minority \nleader about the nominations process and his claim that Democrats have \nextended an open hand of bipartisanship in an attempt to confirm \nnominees to various boards and commissions and to the Federal bench.\n  The truth is, again, Mr. President, we are all entitled to our \nopinions and our policy differences. Indeed, I think the American \npeople expect us to fight on this floor, rhetorically speaking, for \nthose positions we believe in and which we believe are in the best \ninterest of the American people. What they should also expect is that \nwe would not come here and make such inaccurate statements of fact \nabout this supposed bipartisanship when it comes to our Democratic \ncolleagues on the nominations issue.\n  I have the honor of serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where \nwe have seen unprecedented obstruction of President Bush's judicial \nnominees. Indeed, never before in the history of the United States of \nAmerica have a handful of Democrats--handful of any party--been able to \nsuccessfully block a bipartisan majority from confirming President \nBush's highly qualified judicial nominees.\n  I heard the minority leader talk about a highly qualified Hispanic \nnominee who he believes should be confirmed to a position. I was \nreminded of the terrible treatment that Miguel Estrada received at the \nhands of this same leadership on the Democratic side.\n  This immigrant from Honduras came to the United States when he was 17 \nyears old. He could barely speak English. He taught himself the English \nlanguage, went on to graduate from two of America's most prestigious \ninstitutions of higher learning, and went on to rise to the top of the \nlegal profession. He represented the U.S. Government in 15 arguments \nbefore the United States Supreme Court. Arguing a case before the \nUnited States Supreme Court is the Super Bowl when it comes to the \nlegal profession.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that Miguel Estrada was a highly qualified, \nvery successful appellate lawyer, someone enormously qualified to serve \non the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, he was denied the \ncourtesy of an up-or-down vote. No one suggests that any Senator who \nthinks they should vote against a nominee should not do so.\n  Certainly, we should all vote our own conscience, and we will be held \naccountable by the voters at the next election, but what has happened \nis a bipartisan majority was simply obstructed by the gamesmanship and \nthe unprecedented way in which this President's judicial nominees have \nbeen treated, such as Miguel Estrada, who represents the manifestation \nof the American dream.\n  Miguel Estrada's dream came to a crashing halt when he hit the glass \nceiling imposed by the Democratic minority in the Senate. There is no \nnice way to put it. It is ugly, it is partisan, and it is unworthy of \nthe Members of this body and those of us who are sworn to protect the \npublic interest rather than special interests.\n  While sitting in my office listening, I was also astonished to hear \nthe minority leader talk about the President's use of recess \nappointments when it comes to Charles Pickering, whom he appointed to \nserve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and Bill Pryor, who was \nappointed during a recess by the President to the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. What they did not tell the American people is, the \nonly reason the President had to use the power that is very clearly \nconferred upon him in the U.S. Constitution is because of this \nunprecedented obstruction by the Democratic minority in the Senate, \nwhich denied these two highly qualified nominees, Charles Pickering,\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\nnow Judge Pickering of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and Judge \nBill Pryor, an up-or-down vote.\n  The only reason they resorted again to this unprecedented \nobstruction, denying them even the courtesy of an up-or-down vote, is \nbecause they knew if allowed to vote, a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate would confirm those appointments.\n  Here again, we are entitled to have policy differences and, indeed, \nwe will, but the suggestion that somehow President Bush used these \nrecess appointments in some sort of unauthorized or inappropriate way \nis false. The fact is, during the course of this country's history, \nrecess appointment power has been used more than 300 times. To suggest \nthat President Bush has somehow gone outside the power conferred upon \nhim under the U.S. Constitution is not true.\n  Sometimes I am amazed that people can say things with a straight \nface. I expect them to wink or otherwise indicate they know they are \ntrying to pull a fast one, but the fact is the suggestion, the \ninference that those speakers would ask the American people to draw \nfrom their comments are just not true.\n  President Clinton used recess appointments. Frequently, former \nPresidents used recess appointments of one kind or another when they \nwere not able to get their nominees confirmed on the timetable they \nwanted for whatever reason, but that is a power clearly conferred upon \nthe President under the U.S. Constitution.\n  Can I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his \ncourtesy.\n  Finally, I will say that serving on the Judiciary Committee has been \na startling experience for this Senator, a new member of the Senate \ncoming, as I did, to this body expecting that all Senators would want \nto try to work through our differences in a way that reaches consensus \nand in a way that allows us to do our job.\n  Unfortunately, the Judiciary Committee has spiraled down into \npartisan dysfunction in a way that is, frankly, not very pleasant, and \nit is not doing the best job we can and should be doing for the \nAmerican people.\n  The truth is, what we see happening is a handful of special interest \ngroups that seem to be calling the tune, and Senators, unfortunately, \nresponding to that and blocking President Bush's nominees. We saw \nduring the revelation of a number of memos that came to light that, \nindeed, some of these interest groups were trying to manipulate the \noutcome in lawsuits that were pending on the court of appeals.\n  One very sensitive case affecting our entire Nation was an \naffirmative action case. That case involved the University of \nMichigan's affirmative action policies. The memos reveal that nominees \nwere being blocked and slow-peddled in an effort to have an impact on \nthat litigation. It is not right.\n  Now I know my colleagues, all of us on the Judiciary Committee, have \ndecried the way in which some of these memos came to light. The truth \nis, an overzealous, misguided staffer accessed computer files of both \nRepublican and Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nreleased those publicly. We have had the Sergeant at Arms conduct an \ninvestigation. Indeed, a number of us have asked the appropriate \nprosecutor to investigate it to see if criminal charges should be \nbrought concerning the way in which these memos came to light. But just \nas the Pentagon Papers, years ago, were accessed unlawfully, they \ndemonstrate a very real public policy concern that I do not think we \ncan ignore.\n  There are two things that have happened. One is the taking of the \nmemos, and the other is the inappropriateness the conduct revealed.\n  As I close my remarks, I again thank my colleague from Minnesota for \nhis courtesy by allowing me to speak first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3205-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3205-S3207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \n20 minutes to make my remarks. I do not believe I will need all that \ntime, but I would ask to have that available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Texas, with \nwhom I shared a very instructive tour of Iraq last July--we sweltered \ntogether in 115 degrees--I have the greatest regard for him in working \nwith him on these various matters. I do respectfully say in response to \nhis comment about the 9/11 questions that have been raised, and \nsupposedly my colleagues wanting to have things both ways, his words, I \ncannot for the life of me figure out how he and others on that side of \nthe aisle could suggest that President Clinton is to blame for \nsomething that occurred over 8\\1/2\\ months after he left office, but \nPresident Bush is not to blame for something that happened 8\\1/2\\ \nmonths after he took office and is not blamed for anything related to \nit since. I don't understand how that is anything other than trying to \nhave it both ways and also not making much sense at all.\n\n  I think both of us would be well served to let the Commission make \nits determinations and recognize that our most important task is to \nmake sure it never happens again. We share that desire here, for all \n100 of us are Americans first and partisans second or third or \nsomewhere else. Let's hope the truth all comes forth so that, most \nimportantly, we can understand what we need to do to make sure this \ncountry is safe every day and night for the rest of my lifetime and \nyours and all the rest of our children to follow.\n  I want to shift to another subject. Yesterday's Washington Post had \nan article about the famous magician, Henry Houdini, and the dispute \nwhether or not his magic tricks should be disclosed to the public. It \nmade me think, as I was looking back on the events that occurred in the \nSenate this last week, that we have our own magic tricks. One of them \nis this disappearing legislation trick. Unfortunately, it is one of too \nmany, too clever sleight of hand tricks that are employed in this body. \nI think, in fact, we need more of a return to reality if we are going \nto serve the vital interests of the people I represent in Minnesota, \nand others around the country.\n  At the start of the week, for those who may not have been following \nthis moment by moment, we were considering a bill that was entitled a \nJOBS Act. If ever there was a situation facing America and the over 8 \nmillion Americans who do not have jobs right now that needs a serious \ndose of reality, that is at the top of the list. Senator Tom Harkin, my \ncolleague from Iowa, was offering an amendment that would either have \nthis body choose to support or oppose the Department of Labor's taking \novertime pay, the 1\\1/2\\ times an hourly pay required for those working \novertime. In this case, this group would be over 8 million Americans \nworkers--police officers, other law enforcement officials, \nfirefighters, teachers, middle-class working Americans. These are hard-\nworking Americans working overtime to earn extra money to improve their \nlives or just to try to make ends meet; to raise their families, send \ntheir kids to college, or just get them through junior high school; \ntake care of an aging or sick parent, help pay for the prescription \ndrugs for those elderly parents or nursing homes for them, which costs \nabout the same these days.\n  We had an agreement reached before the bill came to the floor between \nthe Republican and Democratic leaders that there would be a vote on the \nHarkin amendment. That was the promise that was made to all of us. But \nsuddenly here was this Senate's disappearing act, this sleight-of-hand \ntrick that even the famous Harry Houdini could not have matched. That \nbill just disappeared from the Senate floor and was replaced by another \nbill which was voted upon and passed last night.\n  Monday, now, we are told we will be taking up another bill but not \nthe JOBS Act. Where did it go? When will it come back? Will it come \nback at all? Actually, that pretty well describes the Republican job \nrecord under President Bush. Millions of jobs disappear. No one knows \nwhen they are coming back. No one knows if they are coming back. \nSecretary of Treasury John Snow, testifying before a congressional \ncommittee just 2 weeks ago, said the lack\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nof job recovery in this country was ``a mystery.''\n\n  Vice President Cheney doesn't even seem to know the jobs are leaving. \nHe said earlier this month:\n\n       If the Democratic policies had been pursued over the last 2 \n     or 3 years, we would have not had the kind of job growth we \n     have had.\n\n  At the time he offered that compelling insight, the country \nofficially had 2\\1/4\\ million fewer jobs than when he and President \nBush took office just over 3 years ago. So I would have to agree with \nthe Vice President on that point; if the Democratic policies had been \npursued over the last 2 or 3 years, we would not have had the kind of \njob growth we have had. Perhaps he was confused and was referring to \nthe kind of job growth Halliburton has had instead of the United \nStates.\n  The Vice President, by the way, has shown his own disappearing magic \ntricks. Just before he became Vice President, in the 5 years preceding \nthat time, he was the chief executive officer of Halliburton \nCorporation, which is the world's largest oil and gas services company. \nIt is also now the largest contractor for American forces in Iraq \nhaving received contracts worth over $11 billion in the last year, most \nof them without any competitive bidding.\n  Vice President Cheney reported earnings of $44 million during his 5 \nyears there. He claims he has ``severed all my ties'' with that \ncompany. Yet he continues to receive deferred compensation worth \napproximately $150,000 a year, and he has stock options worth more than \n$18 million. That is the executive version of overtime pay. He gets \npaid for hours he hasn't worked after he has left the company.\n  The Vice President has announced he will donate the proceeds from his \nsale of the stock options at some point in the future to charity, and \nthat is a good disappearing taxes trick because that charitable \ndeduction eliminates taxes on that amount of future income, $18 \nmillion, which is presumably why he is waiting to give that money to \ndeserving charities until he can make even more of that money again.\n  But the even more curious magic trick, according to an article in New \nYorker magazine by Jane Mayer last month, on the Vice President's own \nofficial biography posted on his White House Web site, he has been a \n``businessman,'' but any mention of his 5 years as chief executive \nofficer of Halliburton Corporation just before he became Vice President \nhas disappeared. He got paid over $44 million, he has over $18 million \nmore still to come, and it is not even worth mentioning? I guess that \nis what ``severing all my ties with the company'' means with the Vice \nPresident. He keeps getting paid but stops mentioning it.\n  President Bush has his own missing jobs magic tricks. He tries to \nmake more jobs appear than really exist. Last month, he released a \nreport called the Economic Report of the President. It forecast 900,000 \nmore jobs for that month than actually existed. That slight discrepancy \nwas perhaps while the Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao, whose agency \npublishes the Economic Report of the President, tried to make President \nBush's signature on the report disappear. She said 3 weeks ago, after \nthe report was made public: ``He doesn't sign the report.''\n  She is going to have to make a lot of page 4's disappear where the \nsignature, ``George W. Bush,'' or some version of that name, certainly \nlooks to exist. But maybe the signature, like the 900,000 jobs, are \njust illusions.\n  Secretary Chao, who has done some very good things on behalf of \nMinnesota, for which I am very grateful to her, was also reportedly one \nof the people who wanted the Senate's vote on the Harkin amendment to \ndisappear. After all, it is her rule, by administrative fiat, that is \nthe one revoking those overtime protections for 8 million of her fellow \nAmericans.\n\n  There is no magic in that trick, for those are real Americans and \ntheir families. It is a mean trick. It is an unfair trick. It is being \nperformed by one unelected Cabinet official, although I suspect there \nare some elected officials behind her. And we, the elected \nrepresentatives of those 8 million Americans, are told we will not be \nallowed to vote on that matter. Who claims to have that right to tell \nus that we can't vote, after we have been promised that we would have \nthat opportunity to do so? Whoever it is may have the power under \nSenate rules, but they don't have the right. And they are wrong to do \nit.\n  Meanwhile, the President is out looking, himself, for those 900,000 \nmissing jobs that weren't there. Last month, at a carefully staged and \nscripted meeting with some business owners that was designed to show \nhow the President's big tax cuts for the rich and super rich, which the \nmajority of colleagues here passed--how they are fueling economic \nrecovery and job creation across America, one business owner proudly \ndisclosed that as a result of the President's tax cuts worth an \nundisclosed amount of money to him personally, he might be able to hire \ntwo or three people.\n  The President, according to the report, seized that comment like a \ndrowning man grabbing a floating leaf. The President said:\n\n       When he [the businessman] says he's going to hire two more, \n     that's really good news. A lot of people are feeling \n     confident and optimistic about our future, so they can say I \n     am going to hire two more.\n\n  They can sit here and tell the President in front of all the cameras, \nI am going to hire two more people. That is confidence. That is pretty \nconfident, inspiring stuff, isn't it? Of course, the President has an \nundergraduate degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, and presumably \nknows math himself. But I will still point out it takes a lot more than \na business owner feeling optimistic about hiring two people to make his \njob forecast for the last month reality. At two jobs per televised \nPresidential meeting--bear with me, I only have one Yale undergraduate \ndegree, but it was cum laude--it will take 450,000 televised \nPresidential meetings to make up for the missing 900,000 jobs. That is \nthe last month. That is only part of the over 2\\1/4\\ million jobs that \nhave disappeared since the President started his job in January of \n2001, which partly explains why he is applying for 4 more years of \novertime. It also explains why, in the view of this American, he should \nnot get it.\n  This part of the act is a little confusing, even for a magic show. \nBear with me and follow closely. For all of those lost jobs in our \neconomy, we are not yet able to bring them back. Yet the Senate JOBS \nbill disappeared without being voted on. So the American people should \nbe concerned. Right? The answer is no, because it is really not a jobs \nbill. It is called a ``jobs'' bill, but it is not really about creating \njobs. It is about giving tax breaks to the corporations--$114 billion \nworth of tax breaks which they might or might not use to create jobs \nwhich might or might not be in the United States. It was given the \ntitle of the JOBS Act even though it was primarily not about restoring \nthose missing American jobs.\n  In fact, it was given that title probably because it is not a jobs \nbill, but its sponsors wanted the American people to believe it is a \njobs bill. They will think, Wow, that is a good Congress. They just \npassed a JOBS Act, although we didn't pass the JOBS Act. It \ndisappeared. But not to worry, because again it won't do that much to \nadd jobs, anyway--at least not the way it is drafted.\n  How is that for a sleight-of-hand trick? Masters of illusion right \nhere in Washington. Houdini and David Copperfield would have to be \namazed.\n  But, unfortunately, all this hocus-pocus--now you see it, now you \ndon't--leads us to believe one thing, but it is really something else. \nAll of those deceptions do not deal with reality. As my colleagues \nknow, each lost job is some American's very real nightmare. Being \nunemployed for so long they are using up their unemployment \ncompensation, have little or no income and still can't find a decent \njob is no illusion.\n  The average length of time for America's 8 million unemployed \ncitizens who have been out of work is now the longest in 20 years. The \nnumber of manufacturing jobs and good, decent-paying jobs in this \ncountry is the lowest in 53 years.\n  That is real. The hardships, the pain and suffering of those lost \njobs have caused the real Americans, good people in Minnesota--and I am \nquite sure everywhere else in this country--people who want to work, \nwho do not want a handout, who want jobs. They want the chance to work \nand earn their American dreams, and to work overtime and get paid for \nit.\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\n  By the way, our colleagues should recall that overtime--the 1\\1/2\\ \ntimes or more requirement of additional pay for those additional hours \nworked--provides an incentive for expanding companies, to add new jobs, \nto replace old ones they have taken away, rather than paying the 1\\1/2\\ \ntimes for that additional work they need. Employers have a choice. They \ncan choose to pay overtime instead of adding additional jobs. Overtime \nis good pay for those workers who want to earn more money. It is good \nfor the economy because those additional dollars they earn are almost \nalways going immediately right into spending for needed products and \nservices. But it is also a good inducement for creation of new jobs to \nincrease production.\n\n  But even my Republican colleagues and evidently the Bush \nadministration don't want us to even have a vote on this amendment on \nwhat they are calling a JOBS bill. They are also complaining to my \ncolleagues and me on this side of the aisle that we want to offer some \nother amendments to change this bill. Yes, we do. They say our \namendments are not germane. That is legislative language for not being \nrelevant, not related to the content of the bill we are considering. \nOvertime pay is certainly relevant to the people in Minnesota I \nrepresent--police officers, firefighters, laborers, and nurses.\n  Another amendment which Republicans say is not germane would extend \nunemployment benefits. During the last 2 months alone 760,000 Americans \nhave exhausted their unemployment benefits. That is no illusion. That \nis real-life hardship and pain for real Americans and for their \nfamilies.\n  I think the sponsors of this so-called JOBS Act should explain to \nthose 760,000 of their fellow citizens why restoring their unemployment \nbenefits is not germane or is not relevant to their bill. I think those \n760,000 Americans would then see clearly this so-called JOBS Act is not \nrelevant to jobs--not to their jobs, not to restoring jobs, not to \nreplacing jobs, not to preventing more jobs from being sent overseas.\n  In fact, one of my amendments, which I think is highly germane, would \neliminate the $36 billion for tax breaks for U.S. corporations for \ntheir overseas operations. Why in the world would we want to provide \nmore tax incentives for U.S. corporations to create more jobs in other \ncountries? We can't prevent it, but we certainly shouldn't encourage \nit. We shouldn't use more American tax incentives to put more Americans \nout of work and add to budget deficits their children will have to pay \nfor, if they are lucky enough to have jobs.\n  My amendment would eliminate that lunacy. It will demand every dollar \nin this $114 billion of corporate tax cuts be justified according to \none clear measure: How will it result in more jobs, new jobs, and \nrestore jobs in the United States for our citizens now? Not maybe, not \nprobably, not next month, but definitely and provably and now.\n  That is the kind of JOBS Act America needs. That is the JOBS Act \nAmericans need, and they need it done now. People losing overtime need \nthis bill now. People who have lost their unemployment benefits need \nthis bill now. People who are losing jobs still at this time in America \noverseas need this bill now--not the JOBS bill, but the one we want to \namend to make a real jobs bill for America.\n  I am for the majority leader bringing this bill back to the floor \nnext Monday. We are scheduled to bring up welfare reform. That is an \nimportant subject. But the experts would tell me the No. 1 key to the \nsuccessful welfare program is a job at the end of the program.\n  Let us bring the JOBS Act, so-called, back first and scrutinize every \nsingle dollar it proposes to spend for its job effect for Americans \nnow. No more magic tricks. This is the time for honest, truthful \nreality. Let us get to work starting next Monday in the Senate putting \nAmerica back to work--all Americans. That would be real bipartisanship.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3207-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3207-S3210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OUTRAGEOUS CHARGES BY RICHARD CLARKE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in about 30 minutes or so, we will be \nclosing. Before doing that, I want to spend a few minutes talking about \nan occurrence and a series of events over the course of the past week \nstemming from comments and testimony by a former State Department civil \nservant named Richard Clarke.\n  In a book that is scheduled to be released for sale by the parent \ncompany of the CBS network, Mr. Clarke makes the outrageous charge that \nthe Bush administration, in its first 7 months in office, failed to \nadequately address the threat of Osama bin Laden. There has been a \nfulminating in the media and by some Senators about this book. I want \nto take this opportunity to reflect a bit on this, because I am deeply \ndisturbed by the charges that have been made by Mr. Clarke. I am \ndisturbed, in part, by the way it has been handled by some of our \ncolleagues and by the media itself.\n  I am troubled by the charges. I am equally troubled someone would \nsell a book that trades on their former service as a Government insider \nwith access to classified information, our Nation's most valuable \nintelligence, in order to profit from the suffering surrounding what \nthis Nation endured on September 11, 2001.\n  I am troubled that Senators on the other side of the aisle are so \nquick to accept such claims. I am troubled that Mr. Clarke has had a \nhard time keeping his own story straight. I don't personally know Mr. \nClarke--I have met him--although I take it from press accounts that he \nhas been involved in the fight against terrorism for the past decade.\n  As 9/11 demonstrates, that decade was a period of growing peril, a \nperiod of unanswered attacks against the United States. It is self-\nserving, I believe, that Mr. Clarke asserts that the United States \ncould have stopped terrorism if only the three Presidents he served had \nlistened to Mr. Clarke. In fact, when Mr. Clarke was at the height of \nhis influence as the terrorism czar for President Clinton, the United \nStates saw the first attack on the World Trade Center, saw the attack \non the U.S. Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia, the attacks on the two \nU.S. embassies in Africa, the attack on the USS Cole, and the planning \nand implementation for the 9/11 attacks.\n\n  The only common denominator throughout those 10 years of unanswered \nattacks was Mr. Clarke himself, a consideration that is clearly driving \nhis effort to point fingers and to shift blame. He was the only common \ndenominator throughout that period.\n  This pointing fingers, this shifting blame I will come back to \nbecause if we look at all the data and all the evidence, it becomes the \ncommon theme.\n  While the reasons may be open to debate and discussion, the previous \nadministration's response to these repeated attacks by al-Qaida was \nclearly inadequate--a few cruise missiles lobbed at some, at best, \nquestionable targets. Al-Qaida could only have been encouraged by their \nrecord of success in the absence of a serious and a sustained response \nby the United States during that period.\n  After 10 years of policies that failed to decisively confront and to \neliminate that threat from al-Qaida, Clarke now suggests that those \nfirst 7 months of the Bush administration is where the blame should \nlie. Again, after 10 years of attack after attack with an inadequate \nresponse, with Mr. Clarke being the common denominator, to put the \nblame almost entirely on the first 7 months of the Bush administration \nto me is shifting blame and finger-pointing.\n  What is interesting is that what we heard this week has not always \nbeen Mr. Clarke's view of the events leading up to September 11. This \nweek, a transcript was released of a press interview that Mr. Clarke \ngave in August of 2002, not that long ago. I will submit for the Record \nthe full transcript, but I do want to cite a portion of this interview \nreviewing in glowing terms the policies of the Bush administration in \nfighting terrorism. I will be quoting exactly from the interview:\n  Richard Clarke:\n\n       Actually, I've got about seven points. Let me just go \n     through them quickly.\n\n  Again, these are Mr. Clarke's words:\n\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\n\n       The first point, I think the overall point is, there was no \n     plan on Al Qaeda that was passed from the Clinton \n     administration to the Bush administration.\n\n  No plan.\n  Mr. Clarke's words:\n\n       Second point is that the Clinton administration had a \n     strategy in place, effectively dating from 1998. And there \n     were a number of issues on the table since 1998. And they \n     remained on the table when that administration went out of \n     office--issues like aiding the Northern Alliance in \n     Afghanistan, changing our Pakistan policy, changing our \n     policy towards Uzbekistan. And in January 2001, the incoming \n     Bush administration was briefed on the existing strategy. \n     They were also briefed on these series of issues that had not \n     been decided on in a couple of years.\n\n  Mr. Clarke continues, using his exact words:\n\n       And the third point is the Bush administration decided \n     then, you know, mid-January, to do two things. One, \n     vigorously pursue the existing policy, including all of the \n     lethal covert action findings, which we've now made public to \n     some extent.\n       And the point is, while this big review was going on, there \n     were still in effect, the lethal findings were still in \n     effect. The second thing the administration decided to do is \n     to initiate a process to look at those issues which had been \n     on the table for a couple of years and get them decided.\n       So, point five, that process which was initiated in the \n     first week in February, decided in principle, in the spring \n     to add to the existing Clinton strategy and to increase CIA \n     resources, for example, for covert action, five-fold, to go \n     after Al Qaeda.\n       The sixth point, the newly-appointed deputies--and you had \n     to remember, the deputies didn't get into office until late \n     March, early April. The deputies then tasked the development \n     of the implementation details of these new decisions that \n     they were endorsing, and sending out to the principals.\n\n  I am still reading verbatim through the interview. His words:\n\n       Over the course of the summer--last point--they developed \n     implementation details, the principals met at the end of the \n     summer, approved them in their first meeting, changed the \n     strategy by authorizing the increase in funding five-fold, \n     changing the policy on Pakistan, changing the policy on \n     Uzbekistan, changing the policy on the Northern Alliance \n     assistance.\n       And then changed the strategy from one of rollback with Al \n     Qaeda over the course [of] five years, which it had been, to \n     a new strategy that called for the rapid elimination of Al \n     Qaeda. This is in fact the time line.\n\n  Those are the words of Richard Clarke during a series of questions I \nwill make a part of the Record. I will take the final question, in the \ninterest of time, to Mr. Clarke. Question:\n\n       You're saying that the Bush administration did not stop \n     anything that the Clinton administration was doing while it \n     was making the decisions, and by the end of the summer had \n     increased money for covert action five-fold. Is that correct?\n\n  Mr. Clarke's answer:\n\n       All of that's correct.\n\n  Madam President, I went through the interview in detail like that \nbecause you can see clearly how out of sync it is. It is almost just \nthe opposite of what he said this week, and it is important for us to \nunderstand, if we are going to look at Mr. Clarke's credibility, this \njuxtaposition, this contrast, how dissimilar to what comes out of his \nmouth it actually is.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FRIST. This is not the only account in which Mr. Clarke changes \nhis story. In lengthy testimony before the congressional joint inquiry \nthat reviewed the events surrounding the September 11 attacks, Mr. \nClarke is equally effusive in his praise for his actions of the Bush \nadministration. It is my hope we will be able to get that testimony \ndeclassified. That request has been made so all Senators may review it \nand discuss it as well. But it is effusive praise under oath.\n  I do not know what Mr. Clarke's motive is. I have no earthly idea \nwhat his motive for these charges is. Is it personal gain? Is it \npartisan gain? Is it in some way personal profit? Is it animus because \nof his failure to win a promotion with the Bush administration? I just \ndo not know. None of us is going to ever know. But one thing is clear, \nand that is his motive could not possibly be to bring clarity or true \nunderstanding of how we avoid future September 11 attacks.\n  There are five points I would like to make, five points that I find \nabsolutely inexplicable about Mr. Clarke's performance this past week. \nI have waited to come to the floor until the end of the week because I \ncouldn't really believe what Mr. Clarke was saying, based on what we \nknow of his past performance and his participation in the former \nadministration. I wanted to have time, and I will make these five \npoints in a quick fashion.\n  Point No. 1: In an e-mail to the National Security Adviser 4 days \nafter the September 11 attacks, Mr. Clarke expressed alarm that ``when \nthe era of national unity begins to crack'' an effort to assign \nresponsibility for the 9/11 attacks will begin.\n  Mr. Clarke, in the e-mail, then proceeds to lay out in detail a \ndefense of his own personal actions before the attack and those of the \nentire administration, all of that spelled out in the e-mail.\n  Mr. Clarke clearly, when we look at his e-mail, was consumed by the \ndesire to dodge any blame for the 9/11 attacks; while at the very same \nmoment rescuers were still searching the rubble at the site of the \nWorld Trade Center looking for survivors, he was looking for some way \nto dodge blame for himself. In my mind, this offers some insight, maybe \neven perfect insight, as to what drove him to write his book.\n\n  The second point, in August 2002, the interview I read, Mr. Clarke \ngave a thorough account of the Bush administration's very proactive \npolicy against al-Qaida. When presented with that interview, Mr. Clarke \ntries to explain away that media performance, the interview itself, by \nsuggesting, well, I just gave the interview in that way as a loyal \nservant to the administration.\n  A loyal administration official? Does Mr. Clarke understand the \ngravity of the issues this body, we in the Congress, the United States, \nis facing as we review through that 9/11 Commission the gravity of the \ncharges that have been made by him?\n  If in the summer of 2001 he saw the threat from al-Qaida as grave as \nhe now says it was, and if he found the response of the administration \nso inadequate, as he now says it was, why did he wait until Sunday, \nMarch 21 of 2004 to make his concerns known? It simply does not make \nsense.\n  There is not a single public record of Mr. Clarke making any \nobjection whatsoever in the period leading up to or following the 9/11 \nattacks. There is nothing in the public record. There is no threat from \nhim to resign. There is no public protest. There is no plea to the \nPresident, to the Congress, to the public to heed the advice he now \nsays was ignored.\n  If Mr. Clarke held his tongue because he was loyal, then shame on him \nfor putting policies above principle, but if he is manufacturing these \ncharges for some sort of personal profit or some sort of political \ngain, he is a shame to this Government. Fortunately, I have not had the \nopportunity to work with such an individual who would write solicitous \nand self-defending e-mails to his supervisor, the national security \nadviser, and then by his own admission lie to the press out of some \nself-conceived notion of loyalty, to reverse himself on all accounts \nfor the sale of a book, a book which obviously is very popular. It is \nselling now as I speak.\n  The third point I would like to make is Mr. Clarke told two entirely \ndifferent stories under oath. In July 2002, in front of the \ncongressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, Mr. Clarke \nsaid under oath the administration actively sought to address the \nthreat posed by al-Qaida during its first 7 months in office.\n  It is one thing for Mr. Clarke to dissemble in front of the media, in \nfront of the press, but if he lied under oath to the Congress, it is a \nfar more serious matter. As I mentioned, the Intelligence Committee is \nseeking to have Mr. Clarke's previous testimony declassified so as to \npermit an examination of Mr. Clarke on the two differing accounts. \nLoyalty to any administration will be no defense if it is found he has \nlied before Congress.\n  Fourth, notwithstanding Mr. Clarke's efforts to use his book first \nand foremost to redirect, to shift blame, to shift attention from \nhimself, it is also clear Mr. Clarke and his publisher did adjust the \nrelease date of his book in order to make maximum gain from the \npublicity around the 9/11 hearings.\n  Assuming the controversy around this series of events does, in fact, \ndrive\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nthe sales of his book, Mr. Clarke will make a lot of money for exactly \nwhat he has done.\n\n  I personally find this to be an appalling act of profiteering, of \ntrading on insider access to highly classified information and \ncapitalizing upon the tragedy that befell this Nation on September 11, \n2001.\n  Mr. Clarke must renounce any plan to personally profit from this \nbook.\n  Finally, it is understandable why some of the families who lost loved \nones on that tragic and horrible day, September 11, find Mr. Clarke's \nperformance this week appealing. The simple answers to a terrible \ntragedy, to the very human desire to find an answer of why, to help \nexplain why on that beautiful fall day 2\\1/2\\ years ago a series of \nevents shattered their lives forever.\n  In his appearance before the 9/11 Commission, Mr. Clarke's theatrical \napology on behalf of the Nation was not his right, was not his \nprivilege, and was not his responsibility. In my view, it was not an \nact of humility but it was an act of arrogance and manipulation.\n  Mr. Clarke can and will answer for his own conduct, but that is all. \nRegardless of Mr. Clarke's motive or what he says or implies in his new \nbook, the fact remains this terrible attack was not caused by the \nGovernment of the United States of America. No administration was \nresponsible for the attack. Our Nation did not invite the attack. The \nattack on 9/11 was the evil design of a determined and hate-filled few \nwho slipped through the defenses of a nation, a nation that treasures \nits freedoms, that treasures its openness, that treasures its \nconvenience. That our defenses failed is cause enough to review the \nsequence of events leading up to that awful day, and we must and will \nunderstand how to do better, balancing our determination to protect our \nNation with that equal resolve to protect our liberties.\n  The answer to Mr. Clarke's--and I clearly feel they are self-\nserving--charges is that, in fact, we all bear that responsibility, and \nwe recognize that. Every one of us who served in Government before and \nat the time of the 9/11 attacks also has the responsibility to do our \nbest to avoid such tragedy in the future. If we are to learn lasting \nlessons from the examination of the 9/11 attacks, it must be toward \nthis end, not an exercise in finger pointing, not an exercise in blame \nshifting, not an exercise in political score settling.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              Transcript: Clarke Praises Bush Team in '02\n\n       (Washington.--The following transcript documents a \n     background briefing in early August 2002 by President Bush's \n     former counterterrorism coordinator Richard A. Clarke to a \n     handful of reporters, including Fox News' Jim Angle. In the \n     conversation, cleared by the White House on Wednesday for \n     distribution, Clarke describes the handover of intelligence \n     from the Clinton administration to the Bush administration \n     and the latter's decision to revise the U.S. approach to Al \n     Qaeda. Clarke was named special adviser to the president for \n     cyberspace security in October 2001. He resigned from his \n     post in January 2003.)\n       Richard Clarke. Actually, I've got about seven points, let \n     me just go through them quickly. Um, the first point, I think \n     the overall point is, there was no plan on Al Qaeda that was \n     passed from the Clinton administration to the Bush \n     Administration.\n       Second point is that the Clinton administration had a \n     strategy in place, effectively dating from 1998. And there \n     were a number of issues on the table since 1998. And they \n     remained on the table when that administration went out of \n     office--issues like aiding the Northern Alliance in \n     Afghanistan, changing our Pakistan policy--uh, changing our \n     policy toward Uzbekistan. And in January 2001, the incoming \n     Bush administration was briefed on the existing strategy. \n     They were also briefed on these series of issues that had not \n     been decided on in a couple of years.\n       And the third point is the Bush administration decided \n     then, you know, in late January, to do two things. One, \n     vigorously pursue the existing policy, including all of the \n     lethal covert action findings, which we've now made public to \n     some extent.\n       And the point is, while this big review was going on, there \n     were still in effect, the lethal findings were still in \n     effect. The second thing the administration decided to do is \n     to initiate a process to look at those issues which had been \n     on the table for a couple of years and get them decided.\n       So, point five, that process which was initiated in the \n     first week in February, uh, decided in principle, uh in the \n     spring to add to the existing Clinton strategy and to in \n     crease CIA resources, for example, for covert action, five-\n     fold, to go after Al Qaeda.\n       The sixth point, the newly-appointed deputies--and you had \n     to remember, the deputies didn't get into office until late \n     Mach, early April. The deputies then tasked the development \n     of the implementation details, uh, of these new decisions \n     that they were endorsing, and sending out to the principals.\n       Over the course of the summer--last point--they developed \n     implementation details, the principals met at the end of the \n     summer, approved them in their first meeting, changed the \n     strategy by authorizing the increase in funding five-fold, \n     changing the policy on Pakistan, changing the policy on \n     Uzbekistan, changing the policy on the Northern Alliance \n     assistance.\n       And then changed the strategy from one of rollback with Al \n     Qaeda over the course of five years, which it had been, to a \n     new strategy that called for the rapid elimination of Al \n     Qaeda. That is in fact the timeline.\n       Question. When was that presented to the president?\n       Clarke. Well, the president was briefed throughout this \n     process.\n       Question. But when was the final September 4 document? \n     (Interrupted.) Was that presented to the president?\n       Clarke. The document went to the president on September 10, \n     I think.\n       Question. What is your response to the suggestion in the \n     [Aug. 12, 2002] Time [magazine] article that the Bush \n     administration was unwilling to take on board the suggestion \n     made in the Clinton administration because of animus against \n     the--general animus against the foreign policy?\n       Clarke. I think if there was a general animus that clouded \n     their vision, they might not have kept the same guy dealing \n     with terrorism issue. This is the one issue where the \n     National Security Council leadership decided continuity was \n     important and kept the same guy around, the same team in \n     place. That doesn't sound like animus against uh the previous \n     team to me.\n       Jim Angle. You're saying that the Bush administration did \n     not stop anything that the Clinton administration was doing \n     while it was making these decisions, and by the end of the \n     summer had increased money for covert action five-fold. Is \n     that correct?\n       Clarke. All of that's correct.\n       Angle. OK.\n       Question. Are you saying now that there was not only a plan \n     per se, presented by the transition team, but that it was \n     nothing proactive that they had suggested?\n       Clarke. Well, what I'm saying is, there are two things \n     presented. One, what the existing strategy had been. And two, \n     a series of issues--like aiding the Northern Alliance, \n     changing Pakistan policy, changing Uzbek policy--that they \n     had been unable to come to um, any new conclusions, um, from \n     '98 on.\n       Question. Was all of that from '98 on or was some of it----\n       Clarke. All of those issues were on the table from '98 on.\n       Angle. When in '98 were those presented?\n       Clarke. In October of '98.\n       Question. In response to the Embassy bombing?\n       Clarke. Right, which was in September.\n       Question. Were all of those issues part of alleged plan \n     that was late December and the Clinton team decided not to \n     pursue because it was too close to----\n       Clarke. There was never a plan, Andrea. What there was was \n     these two things: One, a description of the existing \n     strategy, which included a description of the threat. And \n     two, those things which had been looked at over the course of \n     two years, and which were still on the table.\n       Question. So there was nothing that developed, no documents \n     or new plan of any sort?\n       Clarke. There was no new plan.\n       Question. No new strategy--I mean, I don't want to get into \n     a semantics----\n       Clarke. Plan, strategy--there was no, nothing new.\n       Question. 'Til late December, developing----\n       Clarke. What happened at the end of December was that the \n     Clinton administration NSC principles committee met and once \n     again looked at the strategy, and once again looked at the \n     issues that they had brought, decided in the past to add to \n     the strategy. But they did not at that point make any \n     recommendations.\n       Question. Had those issues evolved at all from October of \n     '98 'til December of 2000?\n       Clarke. Had they evolved? Um, not appreciably.\n       Angle. What was the problem? Why was it so difficult for \n     the Clinton administration to make decisions on those issues?\n       Clarke. Because they were tough issues. You know, take, for \n     example, aiding the Northern Alliance. Um, people in the \n     Northern Alliance had a, sort of bad track record. There were \n     questions about the government, there were questions about \n     drug-running, there was questions about whether or not in \n     fact they would use the additional aid to go after Al Qaeda \n     or not. Uh, and how would you stage a major new push in \n     Uzbekistan or somebody else or Pakistan to cooperate?\n       One of the big problems was that Pakistan at the time was \n     aiding the other side, was aiding the Taliban. And so, this \n     would put, if we started aiding the Northern Alliance against \n     the Taliban, this would have put us directly in opposition to \n     the Pakistani government. These are not easy decisions.\n       Angle. And none of that really changed until we were \n     attacked and then it was----\n       Clarke. No, that's not true. In the spring, the Bush \n     administration changed--began to change Pakistani policy, um, \n     by a dialogue that said we would be willing to lift \n     sanctions. So we began to offer carrots, which\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n     made it possible for the Pakistanis, I think, to begin to \n     realize that they could go down another path, which was to \n     join us and to break away from the Taliban. So that's really \n     how it started.\n       Question. Had the Clinton administration in any of its work \n     on this issue, in any of the findings or anything else, \n     prepared for a call for the use of ground forces, special \n     operations forces in any way? What did the Bush \n     administration do with that if they had?\n       Clarke. There was never a plan in the Clinton \n     administration to use ground forces. The military was asked \n     at a couple of points in the Clinton administration to think \n     about it. Um, and they always came back and said it was not a \n     good idea. There was never a plan to do that.\n       (Break in briefing details as reporters and Clarke go back \n     and forth on how to source quotes from this backgrounder.)\n       Angle. So, just to finish up if we could then, so what \n     you're saying is that there was no--one, there was no plan; \n     two, there was no delay; and that actually the first changes \n     since October of '98 were made in the spring months just \n     after the administration came into office?\n       Clarke. You got it. That's right.\n       Question. It was not put into an action plan until \n     September 4, signed off by the principals?\n       Clarke. That's right.\n       Question. I want to add though, that NSPD--the actual work \n     on it began in early April.\n       Clarke. There was a lot of in the first three NSPDs that \n     were being worked in parallel.\n       Angle. Now the five-fold increase for the money in covert \n     operations against Al Qaeda--did that actually go into effect \n     when it was decided or was that a decision that happened in \n     the next budget year or something?\n       Clarke. Well, it was gonna go into effect in October, which \n     was the next budget year, so it was a month away.\n       Question. That actually got into the intelligence budget?\n       Clarke. Yes it did.\n       Question. Just to clarify, did that come up in April or \n     later?\n       Clarke. No, it came up in April and it was approved in \n     principle and then went through the summer. And you know, the \n     other thing to bear in mind is the shift from the rollback \n     strategy to the elimination strategy. When President Bush \n     told us in March to stop swatting at flies and just solve \n     this problem, then that was the strategic direction that \n     changed the NSPD from one of rollback to one of elimination.\n       Question. Well can you clarify something? I've been told \n     that he gave that direction at the end of May. Is that not \n     correct?\n       Clarke. No, it was March.\n       Question. The elimination of Al Qaeda, get back to ground \n     troops--now we haven't completely done that even with a \n     substantial number of ground troops in Afghanistan. Was \n     there, was the Bush administration contemplating without the \n     provocation of September 11th moving troops into Afghanistan \n     prior to that to go after Al Qaeda?\n       Clarke. I can not try to speculate on that point. I don't \n     know what we would have done.\n       Question. In you judgment, is it possible to eliminate Al \n     Qaeda without putting troops on the ground?\n       Clarke. Uh, yeah, I think it was. If we'd had Pakistani, \n     Uzbek and Northern Alliance assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3210-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3210-S3211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I wish to share with my \ncolleagues the winners of the 2003-2004 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/\nFarm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth Essay Contest.\n  In 1985, I joined with the Indiana Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay \ncontest for 8th grade students in my home state. The purpose of this \ncontest was to encourage young Hoosiers to recognize and appreciate the \nimportance of Indiana agriculture in their lives and subsequently, \ncraft an essay responding to the assigned theme. I, along with my \nfriends at the Indiana Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau Insurance Companies, \nam pleased with the annual response to this contest and the quality of \nthe essays received over the years.\n  I congratulate Elizabeth A. Mercer, of Boone County, and Eric Webb, \nof Johnson County, as winners of this year's contest, and I ask that \nthe complete text of their respective essays for the Record. Likewise, \nI ask that the names of all of the district and county winners of the \n2003-2004 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/Farm Bureau Insurance \nCompanies Youth Essay Contest.\n  The material follows:\n\n                Grocery Shopping Starts on Hoosier Farms\n\n                 (By Elizabeth A. Mercer--Boone County)\n\n       Indiana farms have a part in many food items around the \n     world. Without farmers our country, even our world, would be \n     starving. In the past, I knew that farmers were a big part of \n     the ``Food Chain.'' Being a daughter of a farmer, I have \n     learned that farmers begin the ``Food Chain.''\n       Starting my journey through the grocery store, I realize \n     Hoosier farms are in all parts of the store. In the produce \n     section, Hoosier farms raise celery, carrots, broccoli, \n     cabbage, green beans, lettuce, peas, squash, cucumbers, \n     zucchini, sweet corn, apples, potatoes, watermelons, \n     cantaloupe, strawberries, tomatoes, and pumpkins. Produce \n     grown by Indiana farmers is a crop, which adds value and \n     income to their farming operation.\n       Another section of the grocery store is the meat section. \n     Meats produced in Indiana are beef, pork, chicken, turkey, \n     elk, buffalo, sheep, fish, and duck. Indiana is the number \n     one state in the USA for duck production.\n       In the baking aisle corn syrup, corn meal, and corn oil are \n     produced from corn of Indiana farmers. Half of Indiana's corn \n     is raised for animal feed. A large portion of the remainder \n     is used to produce high fructose corn syrup. Corn syrup is \n     used in soft drinks, fruit juices, sport drinks, and canned \n     fruits.\n       Indiana soybeans are processed into soybean oil. Soybean \n     oil is used in many baked goods such as breads, cakes, snack \n     cakes, chips, and cookies.\n       Wheat grown in Indiana is soft red winter wheat. Contrary \n     to popular belief, bread is not made from Indiana wheat. \n     Indiana wheat is used to produce pastas.\n       From now on, when I walk through the grocery store I will \n     know Hoosier farms have made a difference in the food supply \n     for our country and our world. I am proud to say, ``My dad is \n     a Hoosier farmer.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Grocery Shopping Starts on Hoosier Farms\n\n                     (By Eric Webb--Johnson County)\n\n       Mom was planning the usual week's meals, which meant the \n     dreaded trip to the grocery. I went with mom and we started \n     down the aisles. As we were putting the items in the cart, I \n     noticed that several of the items were from Indiana farms. \n     This surprised me a lot. I thought all of the items that may \n     family got were imported.\n       You could almost group these items by meal. For breakfast, \n     you could have Walker eggs from the Johnson County area. You \n     can add some Emege ham for an omelette. For lunch, you can \n     enjoy Perdue chicken with homegrown tomatoes on two slices of \n     Wonder bread. You can then wash it down with some Maplehurst \n     milk. For dinner, you can have steak, corn, fresh green beans \n     and wonderful seedless watermelons or cantaloupe. Let us not \n     forget the late night snack of Orville Redenbacher popcorn \n     while watching a movie. These items represent some of Johnson \n     County's, as well as other Indiana county's products.\n       Other Indiana farm products that can be found in local \n     groceries include Roseacre Farm eggs, the world's largest \n     producer, and Adrian Orchard apples. With Halloween and \n     Thanksgiving approaching, do not forget about Waterman's \n     Market pumpkins and hot apple cider, Brown County apple \n     butter and special fresh turkey from Jasper's Sager Turkey \n     farm.\n       In conclusion, I have only skimmed the surface of the \n     products available from Indiana farmers. Indiana has more to \n     offer than corn and soybeans. The next time you are shopping, \n     look around and see how easy it is to buy Indiana products \n     and enjoy an old fashion Hoosier meal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     2003-04 District Essay Winners\n\n       District 1: Zachariah Surfus (Starke Co.) and Amy Ver Wey \n     (Lake Co.).\n       District 2: Daniel Peppler (Allen Co.) and Lindsay Shutt \n     (Allen Co.).\n       District 3: Sean Smith (Cass Co.) and Autumn Cooper (Newton \n     Co.).\n       District 4: Patrick Ritchie (Wells Co.) and Cindy \n     Muhlenkamp (Jay Co.).\n       District 5: Keith Trusty (Morgan Co.) and Elizabeth Mercer \n     (Boone Co.)* (State Winner).\n       District 6: Kyle Jacobs (Hancock Co.) and Aprill Schelle \n     (Henry Co.).\n       District 7: Bradley Otero (Martin Co.) and Audrey Maddox \n     (Lawrence Co.).\n       District 8: Eric Webb (Johnson Co.)* (State Winner) and \n     Vanessa Small (Bartholomew Co.).\n       District 9: Braxton Williams (Posey Co.) and Jamie Frank \n     (Spencer Co.).\n       District 10: Ethan Wilson (Jackson Co.) and Samantha \n     LaMaster (Scott Co.).\n\n                     2003-2004 County Essay Winners\n\n       Allen: Daniel Peppler and Lindsay Shutt.\n       Bartholomew: Steven Day and Vanessa Small.\n       Benton: Scott Williams.\n       Boone: Bailey Keith and Elizabeth Mercer.\n       Cass: Sean Smith and Kimberly Champ.\n       Clay: Brandon Blackburn and Kayla Baumgartner.\n       Clinton: Eric Myers.\n       Dearborn: Joe Bischoff and Amber Shumate.\n       Decatur: Cody Sanders.\n       DeKalb: Stephen Boviall and Shannon O'Rear.\n       Dubois: Jake Whitsitt and Kelsey Vonderheide.\n       Fayette: Matt Sterling and Jerica Moore.\n       Franklin: Tyler Ripperger and Michelle Willhelm.\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\n       Floyd: Amanda Hawkins.\n       Hamilton: Blake Koness and Alexander Robinson.\n       Hancock: Kyle Jacobs.\n       Hendricks: Chelseii Reynolds.\n       Henry: Justin Stevens and Aprill Schelle.\n       Jackson: Ethan Wilson and Kimmi Miller.\n       Jasper: Travis Brandenburg and Kayla Culp.\n       Jay: Dillon Carpenter and Cindy Muhlenkamp.\n       Jennings: John Paul Hyden and Hannah Biehle.\n       Johnson: Eric Webb and Katelyn Bird.\n       LaGrange: Sarah Miller.\n       Lake: Adam Becerra and Amy VerWey.\n       Lawrence: Audrey Maddox.\n       Madison: Kyle Carter and Nika McCloud.\n       Marion: Grant Feldhake and Alexandra Cooper.\n       Martin: Bradley Otero and Alysia Potts.\n       Miami: Devin Zimmerman and Dreana Sparks.\n       Monroe: Brian Morrison and Kristen Bornhorst.\n       Morgan: Keith Trusty.\n       Newton: Trace Myers and Autumn Cooper.\n       Pike: Trent Barrett and Katie Hill.\n       Porter: Jennifer Evan.\n       Posey: Braxton Williams and Kayla Brenton.\n       Pulaski: Weston Bonczek and Linsey Foerg.\n       Rush: Scott Moore and Patty Walke.\n       St. Joseph: Chris Wheeler and Ellen Schoenle.\n       Scott: Connor Caudill and Samantha LeMaster.\n       Shelby: Derek Turner and Emily Burgett.\n       Spencer: Joey Tempel and Jamie Frank.\n       Starke: Zachariah Surfus and Simona Crisam.\n       Switzerland: Courtney Cole.\n       Tipton: Craig Upstill and Natalie White.\n       Vermillion: Austin Boling and Amber Yoder.\n       Vigo: Thomas Kinnebrew and Karen Groth.\n       Wabash: Joshua Dillon and Cami Givens.\n       Warrick: Samuel Schnur and Erika Katterjohn.\n       Washington: Brooke Agan.\n       Wayne: Chris Kolger and Carrie Burkhardt.\n       Wells: Patrick Ritchie and Lauren Schumm.\n       White: Luke Evans and Abby Tetzlaff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3211-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3211-S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                 MURRAY AMENDMENT ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks this \nafternoon by thanking my friend and colleague, the Senator from \nWashington, for her leadership in this very important area. Because of \nher work, and the work of a man whose leadership we all miss dearly, \nSenator Paul Wellstone, victims of domestic violence have access to \nprograms designed to protect them from what many would agree is the \nworst type of violence there is. Currently, the Federal Government \nprovides a little under $500 million in domestic violence prevention \nand treatment programs. The amendment offered by Senator Murray \nproposes to take our commitment to put an end to domestic abuse to the \nnext level by filling in the gaps left by current law and programs.\n  As you well know, the goal of the underlying bill offered by my \nfriend and colleague, Senator DeWine, is a simple, but important one, \nto prevent murder. What it says is that the murder of woman and her \nunborn, viable child is morally wrong and should be illegal. There is \nno disagreement on that point. The majority of yesterday's debate has \nbeen how best to draft a Federal law narrowly tailored to accomplish \nthat goal. What this amendment attempts to remind us is that there are \ntwo ways to prevent the murder of a woman who is pregnant. One, you can \nput in place laws that recognize the loss of life of the mother and the \nviable fetus and impose the stiffest of penalties on those found guilty \nof committing such a murder. But equally important, you can put in \nplace protections and programs that prevent this type of murder before \nit takes place.\n  The sponsors and supporters of this underlying bill claim that their \nobjective is to protect the life of a woman and her unborn child, but \ntheir actions indicate otherwise. A few Members have come to the floor \nto raise legitimate concerns about some of the provisions of this bill, \nbut for the most part, the arguments offered by my Republican \ncolleagues are nothing more than excuses. I would like to take a moment \nto address a few of these so-called reasons to not support this \namendment and offer a rebuttal.\n  The first reason given by groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and the National Right to Life, for their opposition to this \namendment is that the underlying bill is ``clearly an inappropriate \nvehicle for this amendment as the issues are completely unrelated.'' If \nI understand this position correctly, it appears that the opponents of \nthe amendment believe that domestic violence is unrelated to murder of \npregnant women. This position is misguided at best. Let me tell you \nwhat the facts are:\n  In the United States, a woman is more likely to be assaulted, \ninjured, raped, or killed by an intimate partner than any other type of \nassailant.\n  Every day, 4 women are murdered by boyfriends or husbands.\n  This year alone, 240,000 pregnant women were physically abused by \ntheir intimate partners.\n  Sixty percent of all battered women are beaten while they are \npregnant.\n  Women are most likely to be killed while attempting to leave their \nabuser. In fact, women who attempt to escape are at a 75 percent higher \nrisk of being murdered than their peers. The No. 1 reason women leave \nabusers is to protect their children, born and unborn.\n  Homicide is the leading cause of death for pregnant women and \nevidence suggests that a significant portion of all female homicide \nvictims are killed by their intimate partners\n  Let me read for you a quote from an ABC News article dated April 25, \n2003:\n\n       ``Most pregnant women are killed by people they know, like \n     husbands or boyfriends,'' said Pat Brown, a criminal profiler \n     and CEO of the Sexual Homicide Exchange . . . ``Sometimes it \n     depends on how far along the woman is in the pregnancy . . . \n     If it's a serial killer, they normally go after women who may \n     be three months pregnant and are not showing very much . . . \n     With husbands and boyfriends, the women tend to be eight \n     months pregnant . . . they can see the woman and the unborn \n     child as something in the way, keeps them from living the \n     lifestyle they want.''\n\n  In fact, one of the stories told by my colleague from Kansas was of \nTracy Marciniak, whose unborn child was murdered by his abusive father \na week before he was due to be born. The Senator from Kansas was right, \nit would be unfair for anyone to say that there was no murder victim in \nthat case. But it is equally unfair for him and others on the other \nside of the aisle to claim that there was not a victim of domestic \nviolence in that case.\n  Another argument that has been made is that this amendment cannot be \npassed because if it did it would kill this bill. That is simply not \ntrue. With the Murray amendment attached, there is nothing to prevent \nthe House of Representatives from taking up and passing the amended \nversion as soon as tomorrow. If they did, the bill could be signed by \nthe President sometime next week and could become law within a week. \nThe reason that is ``not possible'' is not a matter of Senate procedure \nor rules. It is not possible because the House Republicans' mode of \nleadership is ``our way or the highway.'' It is not possible because \nthey refuse to fund programs that help stop a murder before it happens. \nIt is not possible because they are more interested in making a \npolitical point than making a difference.\n  Finally, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed \nthat they cannot support this because it calls for additional \nresources, and being in a deficit, we cannot afford to bring additional \nresources to bear on this issue. Senator Murray's amendment calls for \nan additional $400 million over 5 years to help fill in the gaps left \nby current domestic violence programs. With less than $100 million a \nyear, we can make a difference in the lives of the 4 million who have \nbeen or will be abused by an intimate partner this year alone, save the \nfact that domestic violence results in a net loss of $18.4 billion a \nyear for business owners and taxpayers.\n  Here is what the truth is. When something is a priority for this \nadministration, we have the resources, and when it is not, we are \nbroke. The recently passed budget included $27 billion in tax cuts for \npeople whose income is over $1 million a year. How is it we can find \nmoney for this and then claim the deficit as an excuse for opposing an \namendment that uses less than one-tenth of 1 percent of that funding to \nsave lives? President Bush claims that the purpose of this bill is to \nprotect women, but at the same time his budget cuts funding for \nviolence against women programs by $10 million, rape prevention funding \nby $29 million, and freezes funding for the domestic violence hot line \nand domestic\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\nabuse shelters. I think that is out of line with what the American \npeople thinks, and it is certainly out of line with what I think.\n  As I said earlier, if my colleagues have legitimate reasons to oppose \nthis amendment, we are happy to listen. In fact, we are willing to do \nwhat is necessary to get past any partisan difference and to move this \nissue forward. Unfortunately, our colleagues are not. I think you have \nto ask yourselves, then, what is this debate really all about?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3212-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3212-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3212-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 3717.

A bill to protect the public's ability to fish for sport, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Freedom \nto Fish Act. This legislation, cosponsored by Senator Breaux, addresses \nan unsettling situation arising over access to our Nation's public \ncoastal resources. There is a growing movement to limit the use and \nenjoyment of America's coastal and ocean waters. This restriction of \npublic access is occurring under the guise of the establishment of \nmarine protected areas. The bill I am introducing today aims to correct \na system that would unfairly penalize our Nation's marine recreational \nanglers. I support the goal of healthy marine fisheries, but I disagree \nstrongly with any method that unnecessarily limits our citizens' access \nto public waters.\n  I believe that my record clearly indicates my dedication to defending \nand improving the health of our oceans and coasts. Recreational anglers \nare among America's most proactive conservationists and their \ncontributions need to be recognized.\n  The Act would establish guidelines and safeguards by which the \npublic's right to use and enjoy these resources are preserved in all \nbut the most serious cases. It provides assurances that the public who \nenjoy recreational fishing will have a place at the table when \ndecisions are made regarding their use of the resource. Secondly, the \nFreedom to Fish Act will ensure that measurable scientific criteria is \nused to determine the cause and impact of damage to fishery resources.\n  Restricting public access to our coastal waters should not be our \nfirst course of action, but rather our last resort. Open access to \nfishing is the single most important element of recreational fishing. \nWe must defend public access against those that would try to restrict \nit under the cloak of marine resource protection.\n  I am proud to offer this legislation to bring attention to this \nimportant issue and I urge my colleagues to support the Freedom to Fish \nAct. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This bill may be cited as the ``Freedom to Fish Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Recreational fishing is traditionally the most popular \n     outdoor sport with more than 50,000,000 participants of all \n     ages, in all regions of the country.\n       (2) Recreational anglers makes a substantial contribution \n     to local, State, and national economies and infuse \n     $116,000,000,000 annually into the national economy.\n       (3) In the United States, more than 1,200,000 jobs are \n     related to recreational fishing, a number that is \n     approximately 1 percent of the entire civilian workforce in \n     the\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\n     United States. In communities that rely on seasonal tourism, \n     the expenditures of recreational anglers result in \n     substantial benefits to the local economies and small \n     businesses in those communities.\n       (4) Recreational anglers have long demonstrated a \n     conservation ethic. In addition to payment of Federal excise \n     taxes on fishing equipment, motorboats and fuel, as well as \n     license fees, recreational anglers contribute more than \n     $500,000,000 annually to State fisheries conservation \n     management programs and projects.\n       (5) It is a long standing policy of the Federal Government \n     to allow public access to public lands and waters for \n     recreational purposes in a manner that is consistent with \n     principals of sound conservation. This policy is reflected in \n     the National Forest Management Act of 1976, the Wilderness \n     Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and the National Parks \n     and Recreation Act of 1978.\n       (6) In most instances, recreational fishery resources can \n     be maintained without restricting public access to fishing \n     areas through a variety of management measures including take \n     limits, minimum size requirements, catch and release \n     requirements, gear adaptations, and closed seasons.\n       (7) A clear policy is required to demonstrate to \n     recreational anglers that recreational fishing can be managed \n     without unnecessarily prohibiting such fishing.\n       (8) A comprehensive policy on the implementation, use, and \n     monitoring of marine protected areas is required to maintain \n     the optimum balance between recreational fishing and \n     sustaining recreational fishery resources.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to promote sound \n     conservation of fishery resources by ensuring that--\n       (1) Federal regulations promote access to fishing areas by \n     recreational anglers to the maximum extent practicable;\n       (2) recreational anglers are actively involved in the \n     formulation of any regulatory procedure that contemplates \n     imposing restrictions on access to a fishing area; and\n       (3) limitations on access to fishing areas by recreational \n     anglers are not imposed unless such limitations are \n     scientifically necessary to provide for the conservation of a \n     fishery resource.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na small business health tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide relief to small businesses struggling with the high cost of \nhealth care.\n  Rising health care costs are a serious problem for most Americans. \nThe average premium offered by an employer rose last year by 13.9 \npercent, 4 times faster than wages. This was the third straight year of \ndouble-digit increases.\n  The cost of health care for small businesses is even higher. Health \ncare costs for businesses with 25 to 50 employees rose by 14.3 percent. \nFor firms with 10 to 24 employees, premiums rose by 15.2 percent, and \nfor firms with 3 to 9 workers, they increased by 16.6 percent. In many \ncases, the increases faced by individual small businesses is \nsignificantly larger. I've heard from businesses in my State about \npremium increases as high as 40 percent in one year.\n  For many small business owners, increases of this size force them to \nmake tough decisions regarding whether to continue offering coverage, \nwhether to scale back coverage, and whether they can improve wages and \nmake other improvements to their business. At a time when the number of \nuninsured Americans is growing, our economy is struggling, jobs are \nscarce, and financial uncertainty affects many too many Americans, the \ncost of health care is a tremendous problem. Skyrocketing health care \ncosts could pose the single greatest obstacle to entrepreneurship and \ngrowth in our economy today.\n  And many small businesses don't offer coverage at all, not because \nthey don't want to, but because they simply cannot afford it. Both \nnationally and in South Dakota, only about 55 percent of businesses \nwith 3 to 9 employees offer coverage to their employees, as compared to \nalmost all large businesses--those with over 50 employees.\n  Why don't small businesses offer coverage? The number one reason they \ncite is cost. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that about \n72 percent of small businesses cite the high cost of insurance premiums \nas a major reason they don't offer coverage. And a study of South \nDakota business owners found that 79 percent said they would be more \nlikely to offer coverage if the costs weren't so high.\n  Clearly small business owners are desperate for relief. The stories I \nhear from South Dakota business owners underscore the need.\n  Last summer, Kathleen Perkins, the owner of Great Plains Coffee \nRoasting Company in Sioux Falls, wrote to me about the cost of health \ninsurance. In her letter, she wrote, ``I recently lost two great \nemployees because as a small business, I cannot afford to offer \ncomprehensive health care to my full time employees.''\n  Earlier this year, I heard from the owner of South Dakota Magazine, \nin Yankton. He shared with me the notification from his insurer \ninforming him that premiums would rise 27 percent. The owner expressed \nhis frustration that he faces these increases, even after experiencing \npast double-digit increases and benefit reductions.\n  Yet another small business owner in Mitchell wrote to me about yearly \nrate increases of 10 to 30 percent. She used to pay 100 percent of her \nemployees' cost, but she has had to shift more of the cost onto her \nemployees. And still\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\nshe struggles. She said, ``I'm not sure how many more increases we can \ntolerate before we will discontinue this company benefit.''\n  Small employers need relief. That's why the bill I'm introducing \ntoday would provide up to a 50-percent tax credit to help small \nemployers pay for insurance for their employees. The legislation would \nprovide a 50-percent credit for businesses with 25 or fewer employees, \na 40-percent credit for businesses with between 26 and 35 employees, \nand a 30-percent credit for businesses with between 36 and 50 \nemployees.\n  We must take additional steps to address the high cost of health \ncare, the administrative waste in the system, and the growing number of \nuninsured. This tax credit is a first, important step in that process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2245\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, we had a very busy week. The Senate \ncontinued consideration of S. 1637, the FSC/ETI bill earlier in the \nweek. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ninsisted on offering nongermane amendments to this very important \nmanufacturing bill, this JOBS bill. In an effort to move the bill \nforward, we did file cloture with respect to the bill earlier in the \nweek. Despite the importance and critical nature of this legislation to \nour economy, addressing those sanctions imposed by the European Union \non us that are in effect now, we were unable to invoke cloture to \nfinish this bill.\n  We turned yesterday to the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004. In \nan overwhelming vote of 61 to 38, the Senate passed S. 1637, the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act of 2004. I thank all my colleagues for their \nhandling of the bill. Senator DeWine did a superb job managing the \nbill, supported by Senator Lindsey Graham. Again, they did a tremendous \njob ushering this bill through.\n  This legislation does so much to help protect women and their unborn \nchildren by establishing, for the first time at the Federal level, a \nseparate crime for the injury or death of a fetus resulting from an \nattack on the mother. The concept is very simple. If someone attacks a \nwoman who is pregnant, there are two victims and not one. Senator \nDeWine was able to hold off any amendments which would have changed the \nunderlying legislation. That was important to do. We accomplished that \nand the bill will be sent shortly to the President for his signature.\n  This week we also passed welfare reform extension. It was S. 2231. It \nis a 3-month extension of welfare reform programs.\n  We will begin consideration of H.R. 4, the welfare reform \nreauthorization bill, on Monday. I hope we can consider important and \nrelevant amendments to this bill. I know Members on both sides of the \naisle do have amendments to improve the bill. We look forward to \naddressing those that are germane, that are important to the bill. \nHowever, once again, I urge Members to allow us to stay focused on the \nmeasure before us and not to slow down the process with political \nposturing or, what now we have begun to see a lot of, so-called message \namendments on the floor of the Senate unrelated to the bill itself.\n  I do respect all Members' rights to amend the bills, but with that we \nalso have a responsibility, and the responsibility is to legislate.\n  Last night I had the privilege of obtaining unanimous consent by \nwhich we passed the Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act, H.R. \n3926. The bill promotes organ donation, promotes organ procurement, \nrecovery, preservation, and transportation, all of which is critically \nvital if we are to address the fact we have 83,000 people right now as \nI speak waiting for an organ transplant, yet we have too few organs. \nThe supply is too small, it is too few, because we are not capturing \nall the potential organs. This addresses that disconnect and that \ndisparity.\n  We also passed the Oceans and Human Health Act this week, S. 1218, \nreported by Chairman McCain and the Commerce Committee. This particular \nbill provides for the coordination and support of Federal interagency \nocean science programs, including research on the role of oceans in \nhuman health.\n  We passed H.R. 2584, the international fisheries reauthorization \nunder Chairman McCain.\n  We also addressed treaties. We ratified two treaties this week, the \nprotocol amending the tax convention with Sri Lanka under Chairman \nLugar, the income tax convention with Sri Lanka with Chairman Lugar, \nand moments ago we passed the Child Nutrition Act extension, introduced \ntoday by Chairman Cochran and the ranking member.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/26/senate-section/article/S3217-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2236, H.R. 3717, H.R. 339\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
