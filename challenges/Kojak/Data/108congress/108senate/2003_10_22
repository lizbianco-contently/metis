Mr. President, I wish to take 2 or 3 minutes to make a \ncomment on another issue.\n  Earlier this month, the Fatima Zehran Center for Women's Rights \nopened in Hillah in the Babil Province in Iraq. This center is the \nfirst of its kind to be established since the liberation of Iraq. It is \nalso one of the many such planned across the country in Iraq. It \noversees classes and workshops on women's issues and even broader \nissues in nutrition, in health, democracy, empowerment and leadership, \nliteracy, computer and Internet skills, and entrepreneurship in local \nmarkets.\n  As we all know, the last 35 years in Iraq have been a period of \ninjustice for and oppression of Iraqi women. They were deprived of \ntheir civil and political rights.\n  This is just another example of tremendous progress being made in \nIraq. New programs are being developed and implemented throughout the \ncountry to raise the educational standard of Iraqi women. A few \nemployment opportunities are occurring throughout the country. The \nBaghdad City Council has begun a major project to establish women's \ninstitutes throughout the city.\n  It is clear that the time has come for Iraqi women to occupy their \nnatural position in society and in leading their nation. Now they have \nthe opportunity to play an active role in the decisionmaking processes \nof the political and economic development of a free Iraq. I am \ndelighted that such progress is being made, and I look forward to the \nfull participation of Iraqi women who have been oppressed for so long--\nfor almost three decades now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S12986-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

PRYOR, JR.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I rise today to voice my support for the nominee who is before this \nbody. There was debate on this nomination last night by many Members on \nour side of the aisle who are concerned about the treatment of this \nqualified individual for the circuit court, Attorney General Bill Pryor \nof Alabama.\n  I wish to make three points with respect to Attorney General Pryor.\n  No. 1, his qualifications.\n  As we heard last night and have heard repeatedly both in the \nJudiciary Committee and here, there is no question as to the man's \nqualification, his skills, his experience, his record of \naccomplishment, his educational background. They are all exemplary, \nextraordinary. This man, without question, is qualified for this \nposition. I daresay that most, even those who oppose him, have not \nquestioned his innate qualifications for the job.\n  We set aside the issue of qualifications and take it as a given that \nhe is surely qualified for this position.\n  The question that has been raised is whether General Pryor would \nfollow the law. That is a question that Members on both sides of the \naisle ask of judicial nominees from both parties: Will you follow the \nlaw? Will you exercise your own judgment and be creative on the bench?\n  I daresay if you look at the history--certainly recent history--of \nthe courts, many who have come through this Chamber who said they would \nfollow the law have not done so. I argue that the vast preponderance of \nthose have been nominees of Democratic Presidents who have taken an \nactivist approach on the bench, as well as, unfortunately, some \nRepublican nominees who have taken an activist approach on the bench, \nan activist approach in the direction that would be contrary to where I \nwould like to see the judiciary go. We have not seen that evidence as \nmuch by nominees taking a more conservative approach as opposed to the \nliberal court approach we have seen in the courts over the years.\n  Nevertheless, it is a legitimate question for Members on the other \nside of the aisle to ask if a conservative would adopt their own \nagenda--probably given the experience of so many liberals adopting \ntheir agenda, and they want to make sure, while they are comfortable \nwith that, they would be uncomfortable with conservatives doing the \nsame thing.\n  In the case of Attorney General Pryor, we have someone who has shown \nat least on two high profile occasions, most recently just a few months \nago, that he would strictly adhere to the law even when he disagrees \nwith the rulings of the court.\n  In the most famous case of the Ten Commandments in the courthouse in \nAlabama, Supreme Court Justice Moore wanted a display of the Ten \nCommandments in the middle of the courthouse, and Attorney General \nPryor complied with the removal order even though it is fairly clear he \nhad no problem with this display. Nevertheless, he showed his integrity \nand followed the law.\n  In previous cases, in an abortion-related partial-birth abortion \ndecision--we just had a vote on the issue--he followed the law. The \nAlabama courts, the Supreme Court, issued a ruling and he followed that \nruling. This is a man who has integrity and has a record of following \nthe law.\n  What is the third issue? The third issue has to do with ``deeply held \nbeliefs.'' This was a question asked by several members on the \nDemocratic side at the hearing about his deeply held beliefs. Attorney \nGeneral Pryor happens to be Catholic. His deeply held religious beliefs \ndictate to him a position on issues which happen to be antithetical to \nsome on the Democratic side on the Judiciary Committee. I frankly took \noffense to the question\n\n[[Page S12987]]\n\nbeing asked about his deeply held religious beliefs as somehow a \ndisqualifier; somehow if you hold beliefs deeply you are no longer \neligible to hold a position of public trust in the judiciary.\n  I argue this country was founded on religious pluralism; that is, \npeople with shallowly held religious beliefs, deeply held religious \nbeliefs, no religious beliefs, all are eligible and welcome to serve in \nthis country in positions of importance, whether it is in the \njudiciary, whether in the legislature, or in the Executive Office.\n  We are finding a litmus test that should be very disturbing to people \nof faith, to people of no faith. It has no place in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from the great State of \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Republican leader and Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Bennett as well for their courtesy this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S12987-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CLOTURE VOTE ON CLASS ACTION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what we are being asked to do on this \nclass action bill is a travesty. We are not only being asked to throw \nthe baby out with the bathwater; we are being asked to throw out the \nbathtub and buy a new one that no sensible parents would even want to \nput the baby in.\n  We all know what is going on here. Corporate giants and giant \ninsurance companies do not want to be held accountable in class action \ncases, and they want to make it as hard as possible for injured \ncitizens to obtain relief. They are powerful special interests. They \nknow that the heavier the burden they impose on the courts, on \nconsumers, and on those with legitimate civil rights and environmental \nclaims, the less likely they are to be held accountable.\n  All of us agree that class action procedures are far from \nsatisfactory, especially in large nationwide cases, and reasonable \nreforms are long overdue.\n  If we vote for cloture today we are giving a blank check to those who \nwould like class actions to disappear entirely, so that injured \ncitizens do not have to be paid at all. If we vote against cloture, we \nwill give new leverage and needed time to those who are serious about \nreforming class actions and just as serious about protecting citizens' \nrights.\n  Today we are presented, virtually on a take it or leave it basis, \nwith what can only be called a radical shift in Federal law, a bill \nthat calls itself the Class Action Reform Act. If we want truth in \nlabeling, we should call it the Class Action Destruction and Federal \nCourt Disruption Act.\n  In its present form, this bill is a shoddy patchwork of different \nideas and different approaches grafted together with no concern for its \noverall impact, as long as it shields defendants. Key provisions have \nnever been the subject of any hearings or any careful analysis by \nimpartial experts in the field.\n  Yet the bill makes massive changes in the basic rules of the road on \njurisdiction of the courts.\n  It suddenly abandons 200 years of evolutionary change in Federal \njurisdiction and substitutes a totally new road that no one has \ntraveled and no one can map. It does so in the interest of purported \nproblems that, if they exist at all, are not emergencies and certainly \nare not so urgent that we need to move ahead so blindly.\n  If we enact this bill, we will have confusion and conflict in the \nNation's courts for years, as they wrestle to untangle the mess which \nthis law produces. Its most visible initial impact will be to add an \nentire new layer of legal jousting, litigation burden and higher costs \nto already complex cases.\n  If the hopes of its sponsors are realized at all, the law will force \na very large number of complex and important cases off the dockets of \ntens of thousands of State judges and onto the dockets of less than \n2,000 Federal judges, who already face massive backlogs.\n  We can also expect that the law as now proposed will do serious harm \nto the ability of citizens in civil rights cases to obtain the relief \nthey are entitled to under State law.\n  There are no legitimate complaints about class actions on civil \nrights. Yet this bill would severely and adversely affect such cases.\n  The bill will make the most pressing and legitimate class action \ncases more burdensome and more expensive. It will reduce the ability of \ncourts to improve the efficiency of justice by dealing with large \nnumbers of small but similar cases in groups, instead of one at a time.\n  To the extent that plaintiffs need additional safeguards for the \nclass plaintiffs in class actions, this legislation promises a ``Bill \nof Rights,'' but it does not produce what it promises. It does not \nseriously address the problem of worthless and collusive settlements, \nwhich produce substantial benefits for attorneys and defendants, but \nlittle or nothing for injured plaintiffs.\n  The basic purpose of court actions in general, and class actions in \nparticular, is to enable injured people to get relief--sometimes \nmonetary relief and sometimes other relief such as injunctions against \ndiscrimination or restoration of employment.\n  If citizens know that reliable relief is possible at reasonable \nexpense and within a reasonable time, they will initiate the court \nactions that our judicial system allows them to bring.\n  That kind of relief tells those who might discriminate: don't \ndiscriminate. It tells those who might bring hazardous products to \nmarkets: don't hurt consumers. It tells those who might harm the \nenvironment: even if no individual person is harmed enough to be able \nto sue, you will be brought to justice, so stop polluting.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States has told us not to pass this \nbill. The National Association of State Chief Justices has told us not \nto pass this bill. Dozens of organizations with no interest to protect \nexcept the right of people to obtain a remedy when they are wronged, \nhave pleaded with us not to pass this bill.\n  A vote for cloture is a vote to deprive our constituents of an \nimportant and realistic remedy for the vindication of their rights. \nWhen we deprive the people of remedies, we deprive them of their \nrights.\n  That is not what they sent us here to do. That is not what the \nfounders created the Senate to do. We offend our people and we offend \nour history if we fail them today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from the great State of \nUtah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S12987-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12987-S12988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

There are several themes of this drumbeat that \nI would like to address this morning.\n  The first theme we hear over and over and over again is the theme of \nfaulty intelligence. How could the President have been so stupid as to \nhave acted on faulty intelligence? Occasionally, the enthusiasm for \nthis theme gets carried away to levels that are inappropriate, as we \nhave the accusation that the President was not just misled by faulty \nintelligence, he deliberately lied. We hear this again and again, \nparticularly in the media: The President is a liar; he deliberately \nmisled the country.\n  I would like to address that theme for a moment and then another \ntheme we hear over and over which is that the President has made a \nterrible mistake when he has endorsed the concept of preemptive war. We \nhave these two themes: No. 1, the President is either stupid or a liar \nbecause he mishandled the intelligence; and No. 2, he has embraced a \nhistorically repugnant doctrine, the doctrine of preemptive war.\n  On the issue of intelligence, let us understand something about \nintelligence. It is never hard and fast. It is always an estimate. It \nis also a guess. It is also the best view of the people who are making \nintelligence decisions and assessments. And it is often wrong.\n\n  Let me give you an example of a President who acted on intelligence \nthat turned out to be wrong. No, let me back away from that, not \nnecessarily a President who acted, a commander who acted on \nintelligence that turned out to be wrong that had significant \ninternational effect.\n  I was traveling in China with the then-senior Senator from Texas, \nPhil Gramm, and we met with the Prime\n\n[[Page S12988]]\n\nMinister of China, not long after the Americans, under the command of \nGEN Wesley Clark, had bombed the Chinese Embassy in Serbia. The Chinese \nwere understandably very concerned about that.\n  We said: It was a mistake. It was an error. And the Chinese \nAmbassador, with whom we were talking at the time, said: You have the \nbest intelligence in the world. You must have known that was the \nChinese Embassy. That was not a hidden fact. That was not a secret. You \nhave the most accurate military in the world. You did that \ndeliberately.\n  Then he pointed out to us that was not just the Chinese Embassy; that \nwas, in fact, the headquarters of the Chinese intelligence operation \nthroughout Central Europe. So we bombed an embassy and we took out \ntheir intelligence capability. They said: You did that deliberately. We \nsaid: No; it was a mistake.\n  I remember Senator Shelby saying: The proof of the fact that it is a \nmistake is that nobody would have been stupid enough to do that \ndeliberately. Then the Chinese Ambassador said: If it was a mistake, \nwhy hasn't somebody been fired? And for that, we had no particular \nanswer.\n  Checking into it, we found the reason that happened is because GEN \nWesley Clark, the commander of NATO, was demanding targets: I need more \ntargets. I'm running out of targets. And under the pressure of those \ndemands from that commanding general, the CIA came up with targets, and \nthey came up with an old target with bad information, under the \npressure from a commander who was anxious to keep bombing even though \nhe had run out of legitimate targets. In that pressure, a tragic \nmistake was made, and America's relationship with China was seriously \ndamaged in that situation.\n  So intelligence is not always perfect. But in the postmortem of 9/11, \nwe have seen how people want to have it both ways. They look at the \nintelligence that was available pre-9/11, and they say: How can you \nhave missed this clue? You should have taken action, Bush \nadministration, on the basis of this clue.\n  Then, when we have information with respect to Iraq that turns out \nnot to be exactly accurate, we are told: How could you have been so \nmisled? How could you have interpreted this way?\n  One CIA official said: If we had not acted on the basis of the \ninformation that we had prior to the war in Iraq, if we had not warned \nthe President in the way we did, we would have been held in violation \nof our duty, particularly if something had happened.\n  Then the naysayers, who are saying, ``How could you be misled by this \nintelligence,'' would be saying, ``How could you have missed this \nclue?'' They attempt to put the President and this administration in a \nno-win situation. No matter what the President does, he is attacked by \nthe people on the other side of the aisle.\n\n  Now, finally, this issue of preemptive war. I will not take the time \nto go into a full discussion, but I say, particularly to those Senators \nwho pride themselves on their sense of history, let us look back in \nhistory and ask ourselves, what would have happened if Neville \nChamberlain, Prime Minister of Great Britain, had adopted the attitude \nof preemptive war when he went to Munich? What would have happened if \nhe had sat down with Adolph Hitler and done what Winston Churchill was \nurging him to do, which is the same doctrine that George W. Bush had \nput forward, and said to Hitler: If you attack Czechoslovakia, there \nwill be war. If you move ahead, there will be war?\n  Neville Chamberlain and some of the people around him said: Hitler \ndoes not represent an imminent threat. Hitler is not talking about \nbombing London now. If we give him Czechoslovakia, he will feel nice \ntowards us. We need to worry about international opinion. We need to \nsee to it that everybody gets together in the international community. \nAnd Czechoslovakia does not affect us.\n  Chamberlain said: Those are people far away from us with whom we have \nnothing to do, a speech that could have been made on the floor of this \nSenate as people talk about Iraq: They are far away from us, people \nwith whom we have nothing to do. And the threat is not imminent.\n  Churchill was long-headed enough to know that if Hitler got control \nof Czechoslovakia, he would get control of the finest machine shops in \nEurope, he would add to his military machine, and he would be prepared \nto wage world war. If Hitler were denied Czechoslovakia, we now know in \nhistory, his own generals would have deposed him for being too risky.\n  But Neville Chamberlain said: No. We can't wage any kind of \npreemptive war. We have to wait until he attacks us before we can \njustify it. And 6 million Jews went to the concentration camps and into \nthe ovens, and countless millions were killed in the Second World War \nbecause we did not take preemptive action when we could have. I say \n``we''--the Western World did not.\n  Chamberlain was hailed as a hero when he came home, and the motion to \nsupport the action that he had taken went through the House of Commons \nby huge margins. When Winston Churchill stood up and said: We have \nsuffered defeat of the first magnitude, he got only a handful of votes. \nBut history has not been kind to Mr. Chamberlain. History has validated \nthe position that Winston Churchill took, a position which George W. \nBush is applying to modern conditions.\n  Those who value history should read all of history before they stand \non the Senate floor and attack the President of the United States for a \ndoctrine that they say is repugnant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Alaska is recognized under a previous order of the body. There was \na previous agreement that was entered into that grants her this slot of \ntime.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S12988-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12988-S12990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY FROM ALASKA: JOBS FOR AMERICA\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about a \ntopic of great importance to our Nation; that is, the subject of jobs.\n  I know this subject is on the minds of my colleagues, and certainly \non the minds of my constituents back home in Alaska, but really \nAmericans throughout the country.\n  Since 2000, the American economy has been in a slump. In 2000, we \nwere headed toward a recession. The stock market declined and the \ntechnology bubble burst. Then came September 11.\n  When terrorists struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, our \neconomy suffered. And as we, as a country, mourned the loss of 3,000 \ninnocent Americans, we again watched that stock market tumble and, \nreally, the economy grind to a halt.\n  This administration has been working very hard not only to protect \nAmerican people from terrorism but to revive, to reinvigorate our \neconomy.\n  The approach that has been taken to cut Federal taxes, as we have \ndone in Congress, the move the Federal Reserve Board has taken in \ncutting interest rates, those were the right things to do. But we can \ndo so much more. We can and we must take positive steps to create good \npaying jobs for Americans.\n  On the floor recently many of my colleagues have been talking about \nthe loss of jobs we have sustained over the last few years. The truth \nis, we have lost a lot of jobs. But I do not want to talk this morning \nabout those jobs that we have lost. I want to look forward. I want to \ntalk about the many jobs we can and should create for Americans who are \nout of work.\n  Currently, we have a House-Senate conference committee crafting a \ncomprehensive Energy bill. In late July, in a show of great \nbipartisanship, the Senate passed an Energy bill to conference. There \nwere 83 of my colleagues who supported me in this measure. Fourteen \nSenators voted against the bill.\n  Attempts have been made by both Republicans and Democrats to enact a \nnational energy policy to reduce our country's dependence on fossil \nfuels, much of which comes from foreign countries, and to improve the \nexisting energy infrastructure in the U.S.\n  Most people would agree we need a national energy policy to address \nour concerns, but there is widespread division as to how we go about \nit. These divisions can be partisan, they can be ideological, or they \ncan be regional. I encourage the conferees working on\n\n[[Page S12989]]\n\nthe Energy bill to put these differences aside and reach an agreement \nthat meets the energy needs of Americans. Of course, as we know, that \nis easier said than done. Developing a national energy policy is, to \nsay the very least, difficult. It means many things to different \npeople. Therein lies the problem with passage of a national energy \npolicy.\n  My colleagues in the House represent diverse opposing interests. We \nall have diverse interests. We come to it from a different perspective, \nas we approach a national energy policy. So while it may be easy to get \nMembers interested in talking about a national energy policy, when it \nactually comes to putting the pen to paper, it is much more difficult \nto garner support.\n  As part of a national energy policy, I have been advocating opening \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, as well \nas enacting a fiscal package to build a natural gas pipeline from \nAlaska to the lower 48. My constituents are eager to offer our State's \nnatural resources to the Nation to meet our shared energy needs.\n  I will continue to fight, as I have been, to get these provisions in \nan Energy bill. I do not apologize or make any excuses for what I have \nto do for my State. It is my job. But developing Alaska's energy \nresources not only benefits Alaskans but it benefits Americans.\n  I will explain how developing Alaska's resources will benefit all \nAmericans. Before I do so, I will discuss what a comprehensive energy \npolicy must contain, in my opinion. Some of my colleagues think the \nonly thing I want in an Energy bill is ANWR and a natural gas pipeline. \nFrom my perspective, an energy policy that does not utilize the vast \ndomestic energy reserves in Alaska is not comprehensive. We must \nprovide for increased oil and gas production in order to meet the \ncountry's demand for energy. In my mind that is very clear. But there \nis more to an energy policy than that. The policy must address our \nrenewable energy reserves.\n\n  At the same time we encourage domestic production of energy, we must \npromote energy efficiency and energy conservation. We cannot have a \ncomprehensive policy by doing just one or the other. We have to have \nboth.\n  I am not going to talk this morning about energy dependence, \ntechnically recoverable barrels of oil, known cubic feet of gas, or the \nminimal impact that energy development in Alaska would have on the \nenvironment. My colleagues have heard those arguments time and time \nagain. This morning I want to talk about jobs. I want to talk about how \nwe can create good paying jobs for all Americans. I don't want a single \nman or woman in America who is willing to work and looking for work to \nbe locked out of finding a job. Americans can't enjoy the American \ndream without a job. It is as simple as that.\n  We have passed legislation to stimulate the economy. We have passed \nlegislation to cut taxes. But our work is not done until Americans have \nwork.\n  In my State, traditionally we have had the highest unemployment among \nthe States. According to the September 2003 seasonally adjusted \nunemployment rates, Alaska's unemployment rate overall is 7.8 percent. \nIn many parts of my State, it is in the double digits, something that \nis hard for many of my colleagues to imagine. In our neighboring State \nof Washington, the unemployment rate is 7.6 percent. When Americans \ncan't find work, our job in Congress is not done. We have to get to \nwork to get people to work.\n  I don't know how much more clear I can be on this point. I want the \nmen and women of this country who are searching for a job to be able to \nfind them--good paying jobs, jobs with benefits such as retirement and \nhealth care, and jobs that can sustain a family.\n  How do we create these jobs? It is through the Energy bill. We ought \nto call this legislation the national jobs bill because that is what \nthe Energy bill can be. If we do it right, this Energy bill can be the \njobs bill.\n  I have said before that developing the energy resources in Alaska \nwill create jobs. No one can deny that. If we open ANWR, if we build a \nnatural gas pipeline, we create jobs. They are good paying jobs for \nAlaskans.\n  I have heard the reasons from Democrats and Republicans in both the \nHouse and the Senate of why we should not open ANWR or why we cannot \nproduce a fiscal package that would ensure construction of a natural \ngas pipeline. But I have to ask: Are they saying we can't create jobs \nor we should not create jobs? Are they saying we should not create good \npaying jobs for Americans? I don't think there is a Member of this body \nor the other body who would state that they oppose job creation.\n  So I say to my colleagues: Let's do the right thing. Let's protect \nour energy security, our economic security.\n  Let's create good paying jobs for Americans.\n  I direct my colleagues' attention to a report recently completed by \nthe National Defense Council Foundation. This report is current. It is \nscheduled to go to print on October 30. The NDCF is a nonprofit think \ntank that studies defense and foreign affairs issues facing the United \nStates. The experts at NDCF specialize in the study of low-intensity \nconflict, the drug war, and energy concerns. It is not affiliated with \nDOD or any part of the Federal Government. This report is entitled \n``Eliminating America's Achilles Heel, Our Addiction to Foreign Oil and \nHow To Overcome It.''\n  This report estimates the direct and indirect jobs that would be \ncreated by the development of the oil in ANWR and Alaska's natural gas \nreserves.\n  The NDCF estimates that opening ANWR would create 1,074,640 jobs \nthroughout America. It is important to repeat that number: 1,074,640 \njobs throughout America. That is opening ANWR. The NDCF also looked at \nhow many jobs would be created by the construction of an Alaska natural \ngas pipeline.\n  They estimate that it would create 1,135,778 direct and indirect jobs \nthroughout the Nation. Again, 1,135,778 direct and indirect jobs would \nbe created through the construction of an Alaskan natural gas pipeline.\n  So if we do both, that is 2.2 million jobs--good paying jobs--\nthroughout the country. The estimate, according to the NDCF, is \n2,210,418. If you were to ask anybody, certainly in this body, if you \ncould pass a bill to create 2.2 million jobs, would you do it? Of \ncourse you would.\n  The Energy bill is not just an answer to our energy problem; it is an \nanswer to our economic problems. It is a jobs bill.\n  I need to talk numbers a little bit more because I am sure you are \nthinking, well, of course, Senator Murkowski is advocating this because \nit means good jobs for her constituents in the State of Alaska. That is \nabsolutely true; there are going to be good jobs in my State of Alaska. \nIn Alaska, according to the NDCF, Alaska resource development would \ngenerate 202,464 direct jobs and 131,917 indirect jobs. That is about \n330,000 out of 2.2 million jobs.\n  So where are the rest of these jobs? They are spread literally \nthroughout the country, all throughout the lower 48 States, and Hawaii \nand the District of Columbia. So Alaska is not the only State that \nbenefits. There will be 315,435 direct and indirect jobs generated in \nCalifornia.\n  Let's look at what we might have in South Carolina for the Presiding \nOfficer's edification. If both ANWR and the gas line were opened, there \nwould be 12,115 direct and indirect jobs in the State of South \nCarolina. New York would see 93,356 jobs. Washington State would see \n139,089 jobs.\n  Now, I am sure somebody is going to ask me--or perhaps target this \nstudy in an attempt to poke holes in the methodology--but the \ninteresting news here is that many of the people who approve of the \nmethodology for this study represent some of the largest environmental \ngroups in the country. So this means that the environmental groups have \nsigned off on the methodology used for this study that shows that more \nthan 2.2 million new jobs would be created from ANWR and the natural \ngas pipeline.\n  I conclude that by adding that through the opening of Alaska's \nnatural resources, we not only provide the energy that this country \nneeds but again we provide jobs throughout the country--good paying \njobs. I ask my colleagues, as we move forward with the Energy bill, to \nkeep this in mind for the good of the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n[[Page S12990]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself as much of our time as I require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S12990-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12990-S12992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE USA PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. October 26 will mark the second anniversary of the USA \nPATRIOT Act. I wish to speak today about the continuing and growing \ncontroversy surrounding that law, which was passed just 6 weeks after \nthe September 11 terrorist attack.\n  I was the only Senator to vote against the PATRIOT Act. As I said \nduring the debate in the fall of 2001, the act contained many \nprovisions that were necessary and appropriate to help protect our \nNation against terrorism. I still believe that. But I also argue that \nthe PATRIOT Act went too far; that it threatened our citizens' \nconstitutional rights and liberties. That is why I could not support it \nand why I insisted on offering amendments to the bill on the floor.\n  Today, 2 years later, I still believe that as well. An increasing \nnumber of Americans have agreed and have expressed their concerns that \ncertain provisions of the PATRIOT Act threaten the rights and liberties \nguaranteed by our Constitution for over 200 years. The chorus of voices \nof doubt has grown so loud that the Bush administration has responded \nbut not, I am sorry to say, by addressing these concerns in a \nconstructive and open way. Rather, the administration has initiated \nwhat seems to be a public relations campaign in recent weeks to simply \ndefend the PATRIOT Act in its entirety.\n  The Attorney General has gone on the road and on the Internet to \nextol the virtues of the law. Speaking before hand-picked audiences of \nlaw enforcement personnel, he has ridiculed and dismissed those who \nhave raised concerns about the law. A few weeks ago he denounced ``the \ncharges of the hysterics'' as ``castles in the air, built on \nmisrepresentation, supported by unfounded fear, held aloft by \nhysteria.''\n  I think these words are unfortunate, and in its zeal to defend the \nact the administration appears unwilling to even acknowledge the \nlegitimate concerns of many Americans; and it objects to commonsense \nproposals to protect privacy and civil liberties that would not in any \nway undermine the fight against terrorism--proposals such as my bill, \nthe Library, Bookseller, and Personal Records Privacy Act, and Senator \nCraig's bill, the SAFE Act, which I also strongly support, which would \nprotect the constitutional rights of innocent citizens, while still \nallowing the FBI to do its job to protect our Nation from another \nterrorist attack.\n  As Members of Congress, we have taken a solemn oath to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. The President and the executive \nbranch officials, of course, take this same oath. The burden is on the \nadministration, which sought the powers included in the PATRIOT Act and \nwhich now seeks even more powers, to show that the current law and \nproposed new laws are consistent with the Constitution.\n  Let me take a moment to remind my colleagues how a commitment to \nindividual rights became part of the founding principles of our Nation \nand enshrined as the Bill of Rights.\n  In 1787, in the halls of the State House of Pennsylvania in \nPhiladelphia, GEN George Washington, who led our Nation to victory \nduring the Revolution, convened the Constitutional Convention. A number \nof great political figures were delegates to that convention. Joining \nWashington were other distinguished Americans such as James Madison, \nBenjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and George Mason. Mason \nparticipated in the Convention, but he was concerned that the \ndeliberations would result in a Constitution creating a central \ngovernment with too much power over the States and individuals.\n\n  Mason, a patriotic American, who loved his newly found freedom from \nBritish rule, had reservations when he made the trip to Philadelphia. \nPrior to the Convention, he had written a bill of rights for the State \nConstitution of Virginia. He urged delegates to the Convention to \ninclude a bill of rights also in the national Constitution.\n  But a majority of delegates initially disagreed with Mason. When the \ndraft of the Constitution was released, it failed to contain a bill of \nrights or any other explicit protection for the rights of individuals. \nMason was bitterly disappointed.\n  Mason was concerned that, without any explicit protection for \nindividual liberties, the Constitution would open the doors to tyranny \nby a central government. Why? Because our experience with British rule, \nin which the colonial power was able to infringe on individual rights, \nwas still very much on his mind. So after the Constitutional Convention \nadjourned, Mason continued to push for a bill of rights.\n  During the next 2 years, as the Constitution made its way to the \nStates for consideration and ratification, the American people came to \nagree with Mason, and he prevailed.\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote to Madison that a bill of rights was ``what \nthe people are entitled to against every government on earth.''\n  Another statesman, Richard Henry Lee, who was one of the signers of \nthe Declaration of Independence, said provisions were needed to protect \n``those essential rights of mankind without which liberty cannot \nexist.''\n  Madison, who was initially opposed to including a bill of rights, was \npersuaded. An explicit protection for the rights of people or a bill of \nrights was needed in our Nation's governing document.\n  So, Mr. President, on September 25, 1789--almost exactly 214 years \nago--the First Congress of the United States proposed 12 amendments to \nthe Constitution. Ten of these amendments were ratified 2 years later \nby the legislatures of at least three-fourths of the States. The \nremaining two amendments relating to compensation for Members of \nCongress and the number of constituents per Representative were not \nratified at that time.\n  The first 10 amendments to the Constitution, of course, are what \nAmericans now know as the Bill of Rights. The first amendment \nguarantees freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of \nassociation.\n  The second amendment guarantees the right to bear arms.\n  The fourth amendment protects against unreasonable search and \nseizures.\n  The fifth amendment ensures that no person shall be deprived of life, \nliberty, or property without due process of law.\n  The sixth amendment guarantees a right to counsel and a right to \ntrial by jury to those charged with crimes.\n  During the debate on our Constitution, our Nation was at a critical \njuncture: Do we follow a path toward a highly centralized government \nwith the potential for tyranny or do we follow a path toward a \ngovernment with checks and balances, respect for States in a Federal \nsystem, and protections of individual rights and liberties?\n  The decisions made in the first days of the Republic have stood the \ntest of time. They, of course, created the greatest democracy on Earth \nand a governmental structure that is most protective of individual \nfreedom and liberty in history.\n  Today we stand at another critical crossroads. As our Nation faces \nnew terrorist threats, we must respond to those threats without \ncompromising the civil liberties that are the bedrock of our country. \nWe must balance the legitimate needs of law enforcement against the \nprivacy and freedom of all Americans, and that is not an easy task.\n  One thing I know, the solution is not simply to grant the Federal \nGovernment more and more power to conduct surveillance, eavesdrop, and \ncollect information on law-abiding Americans.\n  The debate about the PATRIOT Act echoes the debate over two centuries \nago in the halls of the statehouse in Philadelphia. Today, as then, we \nmust take from our experience as a nation. We must remember the \ncritical role the Constitution and, in particular, the Bill of Rights, \nhas had in guiding our country through national crises, war, and armed \nconflicts at home and abroad, including the War of 1812, the Civil War, \nthe two World Wars, and the cold war.\n  The Constitution has survived and flourished throughout our history, \nand respect for individual freedom and privacy has steadily advanced.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \nattacks, there was, understandably, a great desire to give the \nadministration the tools it said it needed to fight terrorism and \nprevent another terrorist\n\n[[Page S12991]]\n\nattack. But with time to study and reflect after enactment of the \nPATRIOT Act 2 years ago, many Americans have now paused and come to see \na very real potential for abuse of power and infringement of privacy \nand civil liberties unleashed by this law.\n  There is strong and growing bipartisan support for changes to the act \nto protect our rights and liberties. I am confident that this right-\nleft and moderate coalition of support will continue to grow and \neventually occupy the center as more and more Americans learn what the \nlaw means.\n\n  The coalition includes Americans for Tax Reform, the American \nConservative Union, and the Free Congress Foundation, as well as the \nACLU and the Open Society Policy Center.\n  At the State and local level, 3 States and over 180 cities and \ncounties have enacted provisions and resolutions expressing concern \nwith the PATRIOT Act. These States and communities represent over 25 \nmillion residents, and these localities are not just left-leaning \ncollege towns, such as Madison and Berkeley, but also right-leaning, \nlibertarian regions of the country such as Flagstaff, AZ, Boise, ID, \nand the State of Alaska.\n  Here in Congress several legislative proposals have now been \nintroduced proposing changes to the PATRIOT Act to protect privacy and \ncivil liberties. During its consideration of the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations legislation, the House adopted an amendment by \nRepresentative Otter to restrict the FBI's use of the ``sneak and \npeak'' power granted by the PATRIOT Act. The Otter amendment received \noverwhelming support, including 113 votes from Republican Members of \nthe House.\n  In the Senate, Senator Murkowski of Alaska and Senator Wyden of \nOregon have introduced a bill, S. 1552, proposing to modify a number of \nthe provisions of the PATRIOT Act. As I mentioned earlier, I have \nintroduced the Library, Bookseller, and Personal Records Privacy Act, \nS. 1507, and now there is the SAFE Act, S. 1709, which I also mentioned \nearlier. I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Craig, Durbin, \nCrapo, Sununu, Wyden, and Bingaman in supporting this bill.\n  The SAFE Act does not repeal the PATRIOT Act. It simply proposes \nreasonable modifications to four particularly troubling PATRIOT Act \nprovisions. These modifications will help to protect civil liberties \nand privacy by strengthening the role of judges in approving certain \nkinds of search and surveillance authority expanded by the PATRIOT Act.\n  Specifically, the SAFE Act would strengthen the role of the courts in \napproving delayed notice searches, requests for access to library, \nmedical, and other records containing sensitive personal information, \nand roving wiretaps in FISA cases.\n  These are the issues I first raised in the fall of 2001 as the main \nreasons why I believe the PATRIOT Act was flawed and threatened \nfundamental constitutional rights and protections. For me and those few \nof my colleagues who supported my business records and roving wiretap \namendments to the PATRIOT Act, it sure was a lonely feeling in October \n2001. I must say, I did not imagine at that time that reasonable minds \nwould begin to prevail so soon. Now 2 years later, we have a strong \nbipartisan effort to change these provisions, and I am pleased to see \nthat. I look forward to working with Senator Craig and my other \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to get the bill passed.\n  I am still very troubled by the administration's response to \nlegislative efforts, such as those I just mentioned, and to the \npublic's outcry to repeal or modify the PATRIOT Act. The administration \nhas launched an effort to defend the PATRIOT Act, but its defense only \ntells the American people half the story at best. Its PR campaign \neagerly describes the new powers the PATRIOT Act gives to law \nenforcement, but it doesn't say anything about what the law potentially \ntakes away from the American people: our liberty and our privacy.\n\n  Perhaps most disturbing, the administration's campaign fails to \nseriously address section 215, which I have long seen as the act's most \ntroubling provision. Both my bill and the Craig bill contain the same \nproposal to modify this provision. Section 215 allows the FBI access to \nthe private details of the lives of law-abiding Americans--which books \nwe have checked out from the library, what our medical records reveal, \nand what charges we have made on our credit cards. Americans reasonably \nexpect the details of their private lives, from what they read to what \ndrugs they have been prescribed, to remain just that--private. The \nPATRIOT Act undermines that expectation.\n  Under section 215, all the FBI has to do is assert that the records \nare ``sought for'' an international terrorism or foreign intelligence \ninvestigation. As long as the FBI makes such an assertion--and it is \njust an assertion--the secret foreign intelligence court is required to \nissue an order allowing access to those records. The courts cannot \nreview the merits of the subpoena request.\n  Both my bill and the Craig bill would simply require the FBI to set \nforth specific facts showing that the records sought relate to a \nsuspected terrorist or spy. Thus, the Government could not ask, say, \nAmazon.com or e-Bay to turn over the records of law-abiding customers. \nIt could, however, obtain records of those customers who are actually \nsuspected terrorists. My bill would allow the FBI to follow up on \nlegitimate leads by also respecting the privacy and civil liberties of \nlaw-abiding Americans.\n  The administration has recently asserted that the criticism of \nsection 215 is baseless because this section has not yet been used \nsince it was enacted. The administration says that librarians concerned \nabout access to Americans' reading records are hysterics and have been \nduped by civil rights advocates and Members of Congress.\n  I am disappointed that the administration would use such rhetoric. No \none has been duped, and the people concerned about their privacy are \nnot in hysterics. They are simply worried, as I am, about the \nGovernment possessing a power that has the potential to intrude on \ntheir civil liberties, particularly since the statute itself prohibits \na library, bookseller, or anyone else who has been served a subpoena \nfrom making that information public.\n  What I said before the PATRIOT Act was passed, and continue to \nmaintain now, is that section 215 presents the potential for abuse.\n  I will say it again, because I cannot emphasize this enough, section \n215 presents the potential for abuse. Regardless of whether the \nprovision has not yet been used, that potential still exists, and the \npublic has a reason to be concerned. No amount of ridicule or spin can \nchange that.\n\n  The recent disclosure that section 215 has never been used does not \naddress the concern that it could be used in a way that would violate \nthe privacy of innocent Americans. But it does raise another question: \nIf the section has never been used in the 2 years since the bill was \npassed, the 2 years immediately following the September 11 attacks, \nwhen concern over terrorism has been at its peak, including numerous \nperiods of orange alert status, then whey is this provision even on the \nbooks? Or at the least, what possible objection could there be to \nmodifying it so that the potential for abuse is eliminated?\n  Both my bill and the Craig bill would protect the rights of law-\nabiding citizens by limiting the FBI's access only to information that \npertains to suspected terrorists or spies. Our legislation recognizes \nthe legitimate uses of section 215 and would not interfere with the use \nof the provision to investigate and prevent terrorism.\n  I urge the administration to open an honest dialogue with Congress \nand the American people to address the PATRIOT Act's specific problems \ninstead of continuing to try to sell it. We do not need a government \nthat forces its authority on the people and rejects and ridicules \nlegitimate, heartfelt, and principled criticism of its actions and its \nlaws. That is what our Founding Fathers strived to ensure would never \nhappen again. The Federal Government should be responsive and \naccountable to the people. But most importantly, the Federal Government \nshould respect and uphold the Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has not only failed to engage in an \nhonest dialogue about the PATRIOT Act, but it now proposes that \nCongress grant to it even more power. The American people have \nexpressed very legitimate and sincerely-held concerns\n\n[[Page S12992]]\n\nabout the PATRIOT Act. The administration should answer those concerns \nhonestly and forthrightly before seeking more power.\n  The administration has announced its support for three legislative \nproposals to expand executive branch power and diminish the role of \njudges, an essential part of our Nation's system of checks and \nbalances. One proposal grants the Attorney General significant power to \ncompel people to testify or the production of documents, all without \nprior court approval. A second proposal broadens the presumption of \npretrial detention to cases that may not even involve terrorism. \nFinally, the third proposal expands the Federal death penalty.\n\n  Criticism of the PATRIOT Act appears to have had the effect of \ninfluencing the administration's strategy to secure this new power, but \nnot the substance of its effort. Rather than proposing a single bill \nwith various provisions to expand the PATRIOT Act, the administration \ninstead appears to have given its blessing to many little ``PATRIOT \nIIs.''\n  The administration is apparently reluctant to allow these proposals \nto be linked to the PATRIOT Act. In fact, the Justice Department has \neven tried to suggest that they are unrelated. No one is fooled, \nhowever, least of all the American people. The fact is that these \nproposals did appear in the draft ``Patriot II'' leaked earlier this \nyear and entitled the Domestic Security Enhancement Act.\n  ``Patriot II,'' whether contained in one bill or a series of bills, \nis the wrong response at the wrong time. An increasing number of \nAmericans want to know exactly how this administration is using the \npowers it already has and want the PATRIOT Act to be amended to protect \nprivacy and civil liberties.\n  The burden is on the administration to show Congress and the American \npeople why current law is inadequate, why it needs even more power, and \nhow the powers it already has and the new powers it seeks are \nconsistent with the Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n  That would be the patriotic thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the issue of \nMedicare and prescription drugs and where we are as we have been \nworking to develop a prescription drug benefit for seniors and put in \nplace plans that would lower prices on prescription drugs for everyone: \nBusinesses, individuals, workers, families.\n  We are at a crossroads. We have been working many hours in a \nbipartisan way in this body, trying to come to a positive conclusion on \nthe question of Medicare and prescription drugs. There are wide \ndifferences in philosophy and approach, particularly with our \ncolleagues on the Republican side of the aisle in the House of \nRepresentatives. I am deeply concerned about the direction that the \nconference committee appears to be going as it relates to the \nfundamental issue of whether we will continue to have Medicare as we \nknow it in the future.\n  We all know that Medicare was put into place in 1965 because at least \nhalf of our seniors could not find or could not afford prescription \ndrug coverage and health care in the private sector. They could not \nfind or afford health care in the private sector. So this Congress and \nthe President at that time came together and did something I think is \none of the most significant actions of modern age for the people of the \ncountry, and that is to create health care for seniors, for those over \nage 65, and for the disabled of this country, a guarantee that we would \nmake a commitment together and fund a system for older Americans and \nthe disabled to have access to health care in this country. It has made \nall the difference in terms of quality of life for our citizens.\n  We now are at a juncture where we have seen a proposal passed as part \nof the House package that would essentially do away with Medicare as we \nknow it. Instead of it being a defined benefit, meaning it does not \nmatter where a person goes, whether they are going to New Jersey, Iowa, \nor Michigan, or what part of Michigan they live in, whether they live \nin the Upper Peninsula, Detroit, Benton Harbor, or Lansing, they could \ncount on Medicare. They know what it will cost. Their provider knows \nwhat they will be paid for the service. It is a system that is \nuniversal, and it works.\n\n  What we are hearing now is that there is a great desire, \nunfortunately, among, again, predominately our colleagues in the House, \nin the majority, who are saying that system should be radically \nchanged. Instead of having Medicare, which is dependable, affordable, \nreliable--we know what it is; seniors can choose their own doctors; \nproviders know what the payment will be--they want to change it to what \nis called premium support.\n  Now, what does that mean? Essentially, it is like a voucher. They \nwant Medicare to essentially say a person has X amount of dollars for \ntheir health care, and if it costs more than that, they pay that. If, \nin fact, they want to take that and go to an HMO or PPO, that is what \nwould be encouraged. People would be pushed more and more into an HMO \nor a PPO in order to save dollars, but for most of our citizens that \nwould not be available.\n  The House basically wants to say that Medicare, as we know it, will \nno longer be available, and it will be privatized. Folks will be given \na lump sum of dollars, and then they are on their own. If they are \nsicker, if they need more help, they would not be covered for that \nadditional health care they need. There would only be a set amount of \ndollars or essentially the equivalent of a voucher. This completely \nundermines what we have put in place for Medicare. The idea that we \nwould say to our seniors, You have health care; you can rely on it; you \ncan count on it; you don't have to worry about it, that would all be \ntaken away with this proposal to undermine Medicare and to essentially \nturn it back to the private sector.\n\n  This is something I find absolutely unacceptable and I will do \nwhatever I can to stop it, and I know on our side of the aisle there is \noverwhelming opposition to this notion of doing anything that would \nundermine and weaken Medicare for our seniors.\n  We know, according to a study that was just done, this proposal could \nincrease the costs for the majority of our seniors who are in \ntraditional Medicare by as much as 25 percent or more. I should mention \nthe majority of seniors, when given the choice between a private plan--\nin this case Medicare+Choice--or staying in traditional Medicare, they \nhave overwhelmingly chosen to stay in traditional Medicare. In fact, 89 \npercent of our seniors already voted. If we just want to look at who is \ncovered and who we are trying to help for the future, we should look at \nwhat they are saying.\n  Mr. President, 89 percent of our seniors have chosen to stay in \ntraditional Medicare. Only 11 percent have chosen to go into the \nprivate sector. Yet we are seeing an overwhelming push to force people \nto go into the private sector through a scheme that would privatize \nMedicare, even though it will cost them more money, even though it is \nnot dependable.\n\n[[Page S12993]]\n\n  We now know, according to the Medicare actuary in Health and Human \nServices, that in fact there could be sharp differences in cost among \nindividual people or individual regions, depending on the private \nsector plans and how this would work. The study that was done by the \nMedicare actuary studied the proposals calling for private plans to \ncompete against one another and against Medicare's traditional \nGovernment-run program. It shows that those in Medicare fee-for-\nservice--traditional Medicare--in States such as North Carolina or \nOregon would pay as little as $58 a month, well below the projected \nnational average of $107. So they would pay $58 instead of $107. But in \nhigh-cost States such as New York or Florida--my good friend from New \nJersey is here, I would guess New Jersey would fall in that category as \nwell--they would be paying more like $175 a month for the same benefit. \nSo on one side of the country you would have people paying $58, on the \nother side you would have people paying $175, for the same coverage, \nfor the same kind of care. That is not fair. That is certainly not what \nwe have now.\n  They went on to indicate that we would even see parts of States where \nthere would be one payment, one cost, versus other parts of the State. \nSo if you live in Marquette, MI, or Ironwood, MI, in the Upper \nPeninsula, you could pay a very different price for your health care \nthan if you lived in Detroit or Lansing or Grand Rapids. That is not \nfair. It does not make sense. Why in the world would we go back to that \nkind of system?\n  It is for these reasons I urge my colleagues not to agree to any plan \nthat changes Medicare as we know it, that privatizes Medicare, that \ntakes away what overwhelmingly seniors have told us they want. They \nwant prescription drug coverage--yes. But don't take away their \nMedicare. That is not a good tradeoff. We need to strengthen Medicare, \nprovide a real benefit for prescription drugs, and do it right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, more than 83 days have passed since the \nCentral Intelligence Agency filed a report and inquiry to the FBI in \nJuly regarding a leak by senior administration officials of an \nundercover CIA agent. This investigation was originally stymied by \nfoot-dragging and delay and has continued to be stymied by foot-\ndragging and delay.\n  It took at least 53 days for the Justice Department to officially \nlaunch an investigation. It took 4 days after that for Justice to \nofficially notify the White House about the investigation and tell them \nto preserve any and all materials related to it.\n  More recently, the investigation has been stymied by kind of a \n``don't ask, don't tell'' approach by the President and by the \nappearance of a conflict of interest by the Attorney General. Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft, a good friend of the Bush administration and its \nsenior advisers, a very partisan Republican for most of his life, is \nstill overseeing the investigation. In fact, one of his top aides said \nyesterday that Ashcroft has been regularly briefed on key details in \nthe investigation, including the identities of those being questioned \nby the FBI.\n  Talk about a chilling effect. President Bush has joked and made light \nabout it.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of Senators an article by \nKnight Ridder, published in the newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal \nSentinel on Sunday. The headline was ``CIA Leak May Have Caused More \nDamage. Work of Others Using Front Company Name May Be at Risk.'' This \nrevealed why this leak is no laughing matter; it is a deadly serious \nmatter of national security. This is what the article said:\n\n       Training agents . . . costs millions of dollars and \n     requires the time-consuming establishment of elaborate \n     fictions, called ``legends,'' including in this case the \n     creation of a CIA front company that helped lend plausibility \n     to her trips overseas. . . . Compounding the damage, the \n     front company, Brewster-Jennings & Associates . . . \n     apparently was also used by other CIA officers whose works \n     could now be at risk, according to Vince Cannistraro, former \n     CIA chief of counterterrorism operations and analysis. . . . \n     Now, [Valerie] Plame's career as a covert operations officer \n     in the CIA's Directorate of Operations is over. Those she \n     dealt with--on business or not--may be in danger . . . and \n     Plame's exposure may make it harder for American spies to \n     persuade foreigners to share important secrets with them, \n     U.S. intelligence officials said.\n\n  Other former CIA officials agree--including Larry Johnson, a former \nclassmate of Plame's and former CIA and State Department official. He \npredicted that when the internal damage assessment is finished:\n\n       . . . at the end of the day, the [harm] will be huge and \n     some people potentially may have lost their lives.\n\n  Another former CIA officer, Jim Marcinkowski said:\n\n       This is not just another leak. This is a unprecedented \n     exposing of an agent's identity.\n\n  So, again, this is no laughing matter. The President should not treat \nit as such.\n  Here are some quotes from some in his own administration. Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft said:\n\n       Leaks of classified information do substantial damage to \n     the security interests of the nation.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld earlier this year, March--February of \nthis year:\n\n       I think leaks are disgraceful, they are unprofessional, \n     they are dangerous. They put people's lives at risk.\n\n  Ari Fleischer, White House spokesman, in June:\n\n       The President does have very deep concerns about anything \n     that would be inappropriately leaked that could in any way \n     endanger America's ability to gather intelligence \n     information.\n\n  From his own administration, people say how bad it is to have these \nkinds of leaks to endanger national security.\n  Let me give a quick recap of the timeline. It started with the \nPresident's deception in his State of the Union Address in January. In \nhis remarks, Mr. Bush stated Iraq tried to buy uranium from Niger. A \nfew months later, in July, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's op-ed \nappears in the New York Times, questioning the President's assertion.\n  Then in order to discredit Wilson and ``seek revenge'' on Wilson, \nsenior administration officials leaked to the press the identity of \nWilson's wife and the fact she was a CIA operative, thereby \nundercutting our national security and clearly violating Federal law.\n  This happened in early July. Let's see what happened since.\n  On July 24, Senator Schumer calls on the FBI Director to open a \ncriminal investigation into the leak of a CIA operative based on that \ncolumn.\n  In late July, the FBI notified Senator Schumer that they had done an \ninquiry into the CIA.\n  Then it appears nothing happened for 2 months.\n  On September 23, the Attorney General says he and CIA Director Tenet \nsent a memo to the FBI requesting an investigation.\n  On September 26, the Department of Justice officially launches its \ninvestigation.\n  Interestingly, it took 4 days after that ``official'' launch for the \nJustice Department to call White House Counsel Gonzales and notify him \nof the official investigation. Gonzalez then asked for an extra day \nbefore the Justice Department gave the White House the official notice, \nwhich means all documents and records must be preserved.\n  A recent letter was sent to the President from Senators Daschle, \nSchumer, Levin, and Biden which also expresses concern about this break \nfrom regular procedure.\n  They wrote:\n\n       Every former prosecutor with whom we have spoken has said \n     that the first step in such an investigation would be to \n     ensure all potentially relevant evidence is preserved, yet \n     the Justice Department waited four days before making a \n     formal request for documents.\n\n  Interestingly, the letter goes on:\n\n       When the Justice Department finally asked the White House \n     to order employees to preserve documents, White House Counsel \n     Alberto Gonzales asked for permission to delay transmitting \n     the order to preserve evidence until morning. The request for \n     a delay was granted. Again, every former prosecutor with whom \n     we have spoken has said that such a delay is a significant \n     departure from standard practice.\n\n  That is what has been happening--departure from standard practice.\n  I am also troubled that the White House Counsel's Office is serving \nas\n\n[[Page S12994]]\n\n``gatekeeper'' for all the documents the Justice Department has \nrequested from the White House. Mr. Gonzales' office said he would not \nrule out seeking to withhold documents under a claim of executive \nprivilege or national security.\n  What kind of a zoo is this outfit?\n  Mr. Gonzales says he can withhold these documents from this \ninvestigation on the basis of national security.\n  Wait a minute. It is our national security that has been breached by \nthis leak. Now we are going to have an invocation of protecting \nnational security to protect who leaked it, I guess.\n  I believe this matter could have been resolved very quickly. \nPresident Bush could have called his senior staff members into the Oval \nOffice and asked them one by one if they were involved. He could have \nthem sign a document stating they were not involved in this leak. He \ncould have each of them sign a release to any reporter to release \nanything they have ever said to a reporter thereby exempting the \nreporters.\n  There has been coverup after coverup after coverup on this CIA leak, \nand it is not going to go away. People of America will demand that we \nget to the bottom of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Class Action \nFairness Act of 2003. Today we are going to have a cloture vote to \ndetermine whether or not we move forward with this bill. I hope we \nobtain the 60 votes to move forward.\n  To a great extent, the bulk of the tort reform--that is needed in \nthis country needs to be handled at the State level. States have their \nown ideas about what kind of tort reform ought to take place. I hope \nthat is where tort reform--that each State decides it needs in and of \nitself--does take place. However, as the tort system now stands, there \nare about a handful of State court jurisdictions in the United States \nwhere a tremendously disproportionate number of class action lawsuits \nare filed. That is just not right. People have referred to these \njurisdictions as ``magnet courts'' because they draw in class action \nsuits with their soft juries and pro-plaintiff judges.\n  Under the Class Action Fairness Act, businesses can break loose from \nthese magnet State courts and get a fair trial in Federal court.\n  Over the last 2 days of debate on class action reform, my colleagues \nhave been dispelling a lot of myths about the Class Action Fairness Act \nthat have been spread around by the opponents of the bill. I would like \nto take some time to address one of these myths about which I feel very \nstrongly; that is, that some critics of the Class Action Fairness Act \nhave argued that the bill is an affront to federalism because it would \nmove more cases involving State law claims to Federal court.\n  But when it comes to federalism, this bill is actually the solution \nand not the problem. Right now, magnet State courts are trampling over \nthe laws of other States in their zeal to certify nationwide class \nactions and help enrich, frankly, the plaintiffs' trial bar. The Class \nAction Fairness Act actually promotes federalism concerns by helping \nensure that magnet State court judges stop dictating national policies \nfrom their local courthouse steps. It will allow those cases that are \ntruly justified class action lawsuits filed by trial lawyers who are \nfiling them with the right intention to move forward and to obtain \njustice for their clients.\n\n  This is why, when it comes to federalism, critics of this bill have \nit backwards.\n  First, the bill does not change State substantive law. If an \ninterstate class action based on violations of State law is removed to \nFederal court, the Federal court will simply apply the State law to \nresolve the case, just as the Federal courts do today in all \n``diversity'' cases in the Federal court system. Critics attempting to \nargue that the bill is an affront to federalism are doing nothing more \nthan attacking the fundamental concept of diversity jurisdiction, a \nconcept enshrined in article II of the Constitution.\n  Second, the cases that would be affected by the legislation are truly \ninterstate in nature. They have a real Federal implication. When the \nFramers of the Constitution created the Federal courts, they thought \nthat large interstate cases should be heard in Federal court. \nInterstate class actions often involve thousands of plaintiffs \nnationwide and multiple defendants from many States. They require the \napplication of the laws of several States and seek hundreds of millions \nor even billions of dollars. It is hard to imagine a better case for \ndiversity jurisdiction.\n  Third, this legislation has a narrow scope. Smaller cases that are \ntruly local and cases involving State government defendants will all \nremain in State court.\n  Fourth, the bill will stop magnet State courts from trampling on \nfederalism principles by trying to dictate the substantive laws of \nother States in nationwide class actions. Too often magnet State courts \ntake it upon themselves to decide important commercial issues for the \nentire country regardless of whether other States have reached \ndifferent conclusions on the same issue. By allowing these cases to be \nheard in Federal court where the judges have been much more sensitive \nto differences in State laws and the need to balance various States' \ninterests in a controversy, the Class Action Fairness Act will put an \nend to this troubling practice.\n  Is this a perfect bill? It certainly isn't. It is not perfect but it \ndoes deal with a very complex issue. That is why it is difficult to \nreach out and obtain a perfect bill.\n  However, by allowing this to move forward, the amendments that have \nnow been filed, and other amendments that are being contemplated--and I \nhave a couple of amendments myself that I may file to try to improve \nthis bill--at the end of the day we need to make sure that lawyers \nrepresenting individuals who have been damaged and are part of a class \nhave the opportunity to seek justice; they have the opportunity to seek \na fair result in their particular claim, whatever that claim may have \narisen from.\n  By the same token, the business community should have the opportunity \nalso to expect fairness and to expect that at the end of the day their \nparticular defense to the cause that has been filed will be justly \ndealt with.\n  In sum, we have a bill with bipartisan support. Despite the \nmisinformation being spread around, actually this bill will promote the \nproper assignment of class action cases between State court and Federal \ncourt dockets as was originally intended by the Framers.\n  There is one other issue that has been raised that needs to be \naddressed. That is the issue relative to the potential this bill has to \nclog the Federal judicial system. That may be the case in some \njurisdictions. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, if we see that\n\n[[Page S12995]]\n\ndoes happen, it is our obligation as legislators to remove that backlog \nand to make sure we have enough judges in place to handle any volume of \ncases that may be filed in respective jurisdictions. We have always \ndone that. We will continue to do that.\n  I ask my colleagues to review this bill very carefully and to allow \nus to move forward today by voting in favor of the cloture motion, \nwhich will allow us to get the bill on the floor and have the debate, \ntalk about the issues of fairness, and talk about the issues necessary \nto ensure that plaintiffs do get justice in cases where justice is \ndeserved; but, by the same token, that there is some stability on the \npart of the business community where unjust cases are being filed \nagainst them.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of the cloture motion. Let's \nmove forward, have the debate. I will be one who agrees with a lot that \nis in the act and will probably have some questions about the act. I \nlook forward to the debate and look forward to moving forward and to \ncoming out with a good, fair, and just class action reform bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the primary topic I will talk about today \nis the markup tomorrow with regard to chemical plant security. The \nEnvironmental and Public Works Committee will take up legislation \ndealing with one of the most serious security threats to our Nation. \nAccording to statistics by EPA, there are 123 facilities in 24 States \nwhere a chemical release could expose more than a million people to a \ntoxic chemical, and nearly 3,000 facilities spread across 49 States \nwhere 10,000 people could be exposed.\n  This is a serious issue that can create real health and safety \nhazards to our community, particularly in a time when we know we are \nunder potential terrorist attack at home.\n  This is an issue that has been identified by the Department of \nHomeland Security and by almost every security expert as one of the \nmost serious exposures we have in our infrastructure. When we go from \ncode yellow to code orange, chemical plants are identified as part of \nthe infrastructure that needs to be hardened in those events.\n  It seems to me we need to be addressing this matter. I am pleased \nChairman Inhofe, EPW, and others are taking up this challenge to \naddress this issue. I have been pushing on this for the last 2 years, \nactually got a vote in EPW on a bill that had 100-percent support of \neveryone in the committee a year and a half ago. Until the lobbyists \nwent to work, we thought we had a real response that would work on a \nbipartisan basis. We have adjusted that bill, made changes, offered \neconomic incentives to the industry to move forward. We have a \nroadblock to dealing with one of the most important risks we have in \nour infrastructure.\n  I commend Senator Inhofe and other members of the committee for \naddressing the issue. Unfortunately, I do not think the bill meets the \nneeds of what we are trying to accomplish. Constructively, the \ncommittee has moved to require chemical plants to develop security \nplans and submit them to the Department of Homeland Security. The \nadministration had not asked them to submit the plans. Unfortunately, \nDHS will not have to review them according to the bill, as I understand \nit. They would not have to evaluate them. They would not have to \napprove them. They would not have to do anything to assure the public \nis protected. That is a problem. The Department could simply let the \nplans sit on a back shelf and let dust accumulate.\n  Furthermore, it would tighten all 15,000 chemical plants without any \nkind of prioritization in the country, which is also a big mistake. We \nneed to make sure these plans are actually reviewed, that there is real \naccountability. That is my major concern with the mark that will be \ncoming through tomorrow.\n  There are other problems also. It is not strong enough on one of the \nfundamental issues with regard to my original bill, inherently safer \ntechnologies. There are alternative approaches. We cannot build fences \nhigh enough and put enough guards to make sure that every possible \nterrorist attack or criminal attack on a chemical plant could actually \nbe accomplished. We need to make sure if there is a successful attack, \nthat it has minimal exposure. We ought to do everything we can to have \ninherently safer technologies within economic feasibility. That is \npractical.\n\n  While there is a step forward in recognizing this is immediate, and \nthere is necessary evaluation that is being asked for from chemical \nproducers, I don't think we are going far enough in requiring the use \nof inherently safer approaches if they are economically feasible and \npractical. That should be a requirement of the law. This is one of the \nmajor issues I have.\n  Finally, there is a gaping loophole in this legislation as I \nunderstand it, and I hope others will challenge it tomorrow in the \ncommittee mark. I certainly will if it gets to the floor; that is, if \nthe chemical industry or any particular private sector approach has a \nsubstantially equivalent standard as opposed to what DHS puts out as a \nstandard, that will be acceptable to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They have already embraced a private standard that they have \nsuggested is very good. It does not include inherently safer \ntechnologies. It does not require accountability in that other standard \nbeing established by the chemical industry.\n  As a consequence, we are actually moving back to a completely \nvoluntary approach. I don't get it. I don't understand it. I don't \nthink it is the direction we should be taking. It is a loophole that \nerases all the good things that have been included in the mark if you \ngo to a substantially equivalent standard.\n  There are serious shortfalls in the mark, at least as I understand \nthem. I hope they will be debated seriously in the committee tomorrow. \nI want folks to know this is not an issue that will die down. We have \neight of these plants in New Jersey. They are located right smack dab \nin the middle of some of the highest concentrations of population in \nour country. We have had accidents over the years in my community that \nhave taken lives in the community and evacuated the surrounding \ncitizens. This is a vulnerability that everyone acknowledges is real, \nit is present, and it needs to be addressed. That is why I feel so \nstrongly about it.\n\n  This should be a bipartisan issue. I am glad Senator Chafee has been \nworking to push the issue in committee this year. But we need to move \nit.\n  By the way, just finally, there is something I have a problem with \nalso in the bill in the sense that if somebody turns loose one of the \nplans that is filed by an individual plant, that will be subject to \ncriminal penalties. But if a chemical producer does not comply with the \nstandards they set down in the plan, that is a civil liability. It \nsounds right to me there would be criminal penalties for people who \nleak information into the public that could be dangerous and used \nagainst the public. But it strikes me as unequal treatment; it sort of \ndoes not jibe with regard to parity that those people who are actually \nnot complying with the law are going to be treated on a civil basis.\n  Where is the parity? It seems to me we are listening to industry more \nthan we are listening to the needs of the American people. If September \n11 taught us anything, it is that America can no longer avoid thinking \nabout the unthinkable. We have to face up to the Nation's most serious \nvulnerabilities. We have to focus on them. And we have to confront them \nhead on.\n\n  That is why I have long advocated the adoption of legislation to \ncreate meaningful and enforceable security standards for chemical \nfacilities. Under my proposal, the Federal Government would identify \n``high priority'' chemical facilities--those that potentially put a \nlarger number of people at risk. It then would require those facilities \nto assess their vulnerabilities and implement plans to improve \nsecurity. These plans would have to be submitted for review. And \nchanges could be required if deficiencies are identified.\n\n[[Page S12996]]\n\n  In the last Congress, my legislation was approved on a unanimous vote \nby the Environment and Public Works Committee. But after the committee \nacted, the bill was killed after some in industry lobbied against it.\n  This year, the committee apparently is planning to take up a \ndifferent bill. And let me say, first, that I commend the chairman, \nSenator Inhofe, and the other members of the committee for addressing \nthis matter. Unfortunately, while I no longer serve on the committee \nand have not been privy to all of its discussions, it appears that the \nbill currently under discussion has at least one glaring weakness.\n  The committee is considering requiring chemical plants to develop \nsecurity plans and submit them to the Department of Homeland Security. \nBut--and here is the problem--the bill doesn't require the Department \nto do anything with them. DHS wouldn't have to review them. It wouldn't \nhave to evaluate them. It wouldn't have to approve them. It wouldn't \nhave to audit them. It wouldn't have to do a thing to ensure the public \nis protected. Instead, the Department could simply let these plans sit \non a back room shelf, collecting dust.\n  Some might ask: Would the Bush administration really do that? Would \nit really just let security plans sit on the shelf, and not even review \nthem? Well, for those who think that is unrealistic, consider this: The \nadministration's own plan didn't require companies to submit their \nsecurity plans to the Government at all. And that would certainly be \nthe preference of many of their friends in industry. So, yes, there is \nevery reason to be concerned that, unless forced to do so, the \nadministration will take a hands-off approach and simply ignore these \nsecurity plans. And the end result would be a lax security system with \nno real teeth.\n  Beyond the failure of the bill to require review of security plans, \nthe legislation under development in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has other problems, as well. First, it fails to require \nindustry to adopt alternative technologies--such as the use of safer \nchemicals--if those alternative approaches are cost effective. I think \nthat is a mistake. After all, no matter how many security personnel are \nhired, and no matter how high a security fence, no security scheme is \nimpenetrable. And we need to prepare for the possibility that \nterrorists will be successful in attacking a chemical plant and \nreleasing toxic materials. That is why it is important for facilities \nto implement inherently safer technologies, where practicable, to \nreduce the resulting death and destruction in the event of an attack.\n  Thanks largely to the involvement of Senator Chafee, the Inhofe mark \nhas made real progress in this area. As I understand it, the chairman \nhas agreed to require detailed consideration of safer technologies. And \nI think that's a step forward. In my view, though, it still falls \nshort. Given the number of lives that are at stake, I think companies \nshould be required to implement safer technologies if they are cost \neffective.\n  Unfortunately, the requirement that facility owners consider safer \ntechnologies could be undermined because of a huge loophole in the bill \nthat may allow industry to sidestep many Federal security requirements. \nUnder this provision, DHS's security standards could be waived for any \nfacility that participates in an industry program that is, \n``substantially equivalent.''\n  At first, that may sound like a reasonable approach. But the term \n``substantially equivalent'' is so broad that it could well allow the \nBush administration to simply rubberstamp an existing chemical industry \nprogram that is grossly inadequate. For example, the chemical \nindustry's program has no requirement that industry evaluate safer \ntechnologies in any detail. Yet it seems very possible that the Bush \nadministration would exploit the bill's loophole to rubberstamp this \nindustry program, and exempt participating plants even from the bill's \nlimited requirement for consideration of safer alternative approaches.\n  The last point I want to make about the bill apparently being \ndiscussed relates to enforcement. Under the legislation, as I \nunderstand it, if a Government employee wrongly discloses a chemical \nplant's security plan, that employee would be subject to criminal \npenalties. That sounds right. Yet, if the owner of a chemical plant \nknowingly violated Federal security standards, the only remedies \nprescribed in the legislation are civil. That sounds wrong.\n  That disparate treatment of Government employees and chemical \nindustry officials doesn't seem fair. Nor does it seem appropriate, \ngiven the nature of the threats are now confronting. After all, \ncriminal penalties are available for violations of certain anti-\npollution laws. Surely violations of a new chemical plant security \nlaw--a law designed to save lives--should be punished with an equal \ndegree of severity.\n  Before I conclude, let me step back for a moment and again remind my \ncolleagues that should terrorists attack one of 123 chemical facilities \naround the country, at least a million American lives could be at risk. \nThese are real people--mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers--all \ninnocent Americans who have no choice but to rely on their Government \nleaders to protect them.\n  We, in Congress, have an obligation to do everything we can to \nprotect these Americans, and to prevent what really could be a tragedy \nof catastrophic proportions. We should not be satisfied with a largely \ntoothless plan that leaves industry free to design security plans to \ntheir own choosing, with no requirement that those plans even be \nreviewed. That is just unacceptable.\n  I hope my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nwill reconsider this approach. And, if not, I intend to pursue this \nmatter aggressively if, and when, the bill ever reaches the Senator \nfloor.\n  We need to address chemical plant security. But we need to do so in \nan enforceable way that will really make Americans safer. The lives of \nmany thousands of Americans may well hang in the balance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S12996-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12996-S12997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Lastly, Mr. President, I want to say something about the \nbill that we are going to be debating in the next hour or so, class \naction fairness.\n  I am not a lawyer, so I am not as sharp on all of the terminology and \nall the other issues, but it is very clear to me that we are taking the \nsmall ``d'' democratic processes out of access to our courts with the \nlegislation that is underlying the motion to proceed.\n  I think it is absolutely essential that we maintain the checks and \nbalances in our present Federal constitutional system. That does not \nmean there are not abuses, and it does not mean we should not move to \ncorrect some of the things with regard to venue shopping, with regard \nto coupon procedures, which, by the way, are not even dealt with in \nthis bill.\n  I think this is a radical move. I am very much in favor of Senator \nBreaux's proposal, a modified approach, that will deal with some of the \nflaws. His bill would preserve state class actions while sending truly \nnational class actions to Federal court. At the same time, it addresses \nthe problem of abusive coupon settlements, which is something that the \nbill before us does not touch.\n\n  But instead, at a time when we are fighting a war in Iraq, when we \nare fighting a war on terrorism worldwide, and we are facing historic \nbudget deficits and job losses, we are debating a radical bill that \nwould legislate away the legal rights of American families. This \nlegislation would dramatically alter the constitutional distribution of \njudicial power. It would: remove most State law class actions into \nFederal court; clog the Federal courts with State law cases and make it \nmore difficult to have Federal civil rights cases heard; deter people \nfrom bringing class actions; and impose barriers and burdenson \nsettlement of class actions.\n  I am not a lawyer, but I can appreciate that class actions are \ncritical tools for ordinary citizens who want to hold wrongdoers \naccountable. For many people who can't afford lawyers, class actions \nare the only way to vindicate their rights. For consumers victimized by \nnegligence, fraud and reckless misconduct, it is their opportunity to \nexercise their democratic rights.\n  Simply put, class actions promote efficiency and level the playing \nfield,\n\n[[Page S12997]]\n\ngiving persons who are injured in the same manner by the same \ndefendants the ability to hold the wrongdoers accountable. This sort of \ncollective action gives ordinary citizens the ability to level the \nplaying field with powerful defendants. For example, by allowing groups \nof citizens to band together and demand a safe and healthy environment, \nclass actions often result in courts requiring companies to stop \npoisoning our neighborhoods and our water. Without the class action \ntool, it would often be impossible for ordinary citizens to take on \npowerful defendants when they damage the environment and cause illness.\n  Class actions are also essential to the enforcement of our Nation's \ncivil rights law. They are, in fact, often the only means by which \nindividuals can challenge and obtain relief from systemic \ndiscrimination. Class actions have on important occasions served as a \nprimary vehicle for civil rights litigation seeking broad equitable \nrelief.\n  In far too many cases, justice delayed is justice denied. No one \nrecognizes this better than the manufacturers and the polluters, who \nwould prefer these cases to be in the Federal court system, where there \nis a tremendous judicial backlog.\n  Overloading these courts will inevitably delay the resolution of all \ncases in Federal courts. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, headed by Chief Justice Rehnquist--not someone with whom I \noften agree, I might add--has told Congress that the Federal courts are \nnot equipped to handle all these cases. That is why he opposes this \nbill.\n  The delays caused by clogged courts would be particularly damaging in \ncases where civil rights plaintiffs are seeking immediate injunctive \nrelief to prohibit discriminatory practices--such as racial profiling \nor predatory lending.\n  In addition to the above concerns, I was very distressed to learn \nthat the manager's amendment slips mass torts back into this bill, \ngreatly expanding the scope of the bill. This change makes the bill \neven more extreme, and, by federalizing individual tort suits, will \nflood the Federal courts with cases involving questions of State tort \nlaw.\n  By sending a majority of mass tort actions--cases involving products \nliability and environmental damages--to Federal courts, the bill would \ncompletely jam the already overburdened Federal courts and delay \njustice to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people injured by defective \ndrugs and medical devices, like the Dalkon Shield, and environmental \ncontamination.\n  Class actions are an important tool for ordinary citizens to level \nthe playing field and vindicate their rights. They promote safety, \nprotect our health and environment, and are essential to enforcement of \nour civil rights laws.\n  The legislation before us would impose new and substantial \nlimitations on access to the courts for victims of discrimination, mass \ntorts, consumer fraud, and other misconduct. This is not a balanced, \nfair approach. I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Mr. President, I rise to speak for just a few minutes \nabout the need for the so-called Healthy Forests initiative that was \ndiscussed earlier this week.\n  Earlier this week, there was a unanimous consent request made to \nproceed to H.R. 1904, the so-called Healthy Forests initiative. The \nunanimous consent request sought to limit debate on the bill to a \nspecified list of amendments to be offered by particular Senators.\n  Included in that list were two amendments that were purported to be \noffered or suggested to be offered by me. I have never spoken to \nanybody about my intent with regard to offering amendments. And I \ncertainly have not agreed to any particular amendments that I wanted to \noffer. Therefore, I have real concerns with that unanimous consent \nrequest because the proposed unanimous consent request would have \nlimited me to offering certain amendments that I had not previously \nheard about. Obviously, I would have objected had not other Senators \ndone so.\n  This is an important issue that the Senate needs to try to address \nthis year. I do not favor delaying that consideration. There is always \na threat that we have seen in the West, particularly in recent years, \nof unnatural, intense, catastrophic wildfire. That is a threat to many \nof our communities, to millions of acres of public land and forests in \nthe West.\n  It was alleged early this week by some who were supporting moving \nahead with that unanimous consent request that those who did not favor \nthe unanimous consent request did not favor active management of the \nnational forests. I want to be clear in my statement this morning that \nI certainly do not fall in that category.\n  I do not think we should just let nature take its course. I do think \nwe should pursue active management. What I want to be sure of is that \nthe bill we finally enact provides meaningful new authority to our land \nmanagers; that it is focused on the communities that are most \nthreatened by wildfire; and that it does not unduly restrict the \npublic's right to participate and have oversight in the management of \nthese lands.\n  I am aware that a deal of some sort has been developed by certain of \nthe Senators who are concerned on the issue. I was not involved in that \nset of negotiations that led to that deal. The provisions, as I \nunderstand them, that have come out of that are complicated, complex.\n  I have a number of questions about the ramifications of some of those \nprovisions, especially the ones dealing with administrative appeals, \njudicial review, and such issues.\n  I think there should be a hearing. That would be the right way to \nproceed. We have new legislative language. The right way to proceed \nwould be to have a hearing where we can get testimony on these \nprovisions and better understand them. I have asked for such a hearing. \nI hope that will occur.\n  I believe having a clearer understanding of what the amendment means \nand encouraging constructive suggestions would be a preferable course \nfor us to pursue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \nan additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, to conclude my statement, I do think \nthere are serious questions regarding this new language. It differs \nsubstantially from the bill that was reported by the Agriculture \nCommittee. Some of the major issues raised by the amendment include a \nlack of any new funding to reduce hazardous fuels; failure to eliminate \nthe harmful agency policy of borrowing from proactive forest \nrestoration accounts to pay for firefighting; the curtailment of public \nparticipation in the management and oversight of public lands, \nincluding the establishment of a new so-called predecisional review \nprocess, which I do not, frankly, understand; and also, of course, as I \nmentioned before, limitations on judicial review.\n\n  It also appears to create some new standards for injunctions that \nmight be issued by the Federal court, both preliminary and permanent \ninjunctions. There is no protection that I can see for national \nmonuments and roadless areas and other environmentally sensitive areas \nin the bill.\n  I am not aware how some of these issues have been adequately \naddressed in the proposed amendment. For that reason I think we need to \nhave an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  I hope the Senate can consider this forest health legislation this \nyear. As do many Senators, especially those from Western States who \nhave suffered in recent years from catastrophic wildfire, I very much \nwant to see us resolve these issues as best we can. But we should do so \nunder conditions that allow for amendments and allow for full debate. \nAnd that is my purpose at this stage.\n  So I hope we can proceed and do so in a way that all of us get to \nparticipate in the process.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n\n[[Page S12998]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the class \naction bill that will be before the Senate later this morning.\n  A few years ago during the debate on lawsuits against tobacco \ncompanies, gun manufacturers, and lead paint companies, the satirical \npublication, the Onion, wrote a spoof piece entitled ``Hershey's \nOrdered to Pay Obese Americans $135 billion.'' This was a tongue-in-\ncheek article which everyone found quite amusing at that time.\n  It began:\n\n       In one of the largest product-liability rulings in U.S. \n     history, the Hershey Foods Corporation was ordered by a \n     Pennsylvania jury to pay $135 billion in restitution to \n     900,000 obese Americans who for years consumed the company's \n     fattening snack foods.\n\n  The spoof went on:\n\n       ``Let this verdict send a clear message to `Big Chocolate,' \n     '' said Pennsylvania['s] Attorney General . . . addressing \n     reporters following the historic ruling. ``If you knowingly \n     sell products that cause obesity, you will pay.''\n\n  The article continued:\n\n       The five-state class action suit accused Hershey's of \n     ``knowingly and willfully marketing rich, fatty candy bars \n     containing chocolate and other ingredients of negligible \n     nutritional value.'' The company was also charged with \n     publishing nutritional information only under pressure from \n     the government, marketing products to children, and \n     artificially ``spiking'' their products with such substances \n     as peanuts, crisped rice, and caramel to increase consumer \n     appeal.\n\n  The article went on to discuss the use of class action litigation to \nforce chocolate manufacturers to adopt policies preferred by the \nplaintiffs.\n  It concluded by saying:\n\n       Whatever the outcome of Hershey's appeal, the chocolate \n     industry has been irrevocably changed as a result of [the] \n     verdict.\n\n  When I read this piece in the Onion a few years ago, I thought it was \nquite creative. I thought it illustrated the disturbing misuse of class \nactions, using class actions to circumvent legislative decisions with \nrespect to setting policy. I was not the only one who thought so. \nFormer Secretary of Labor under President Clinton, Robert Reich, wrote \nthat:\n\n       The era of big government may be over, but the era of \n     regulation through litigation has just begun.\n\n  It turns out that the Onion was not merely creative, it was, in fact, \nprescient. A few months ago, I read another article, this one a real \nnews story, not a spoof, entitled ``Ailing Man Sues Fast Food Firms.'' \nThe article began:\n\n       Want a class action lawsuit with that burger?\n\n  It reports that a lawyer ``has filed suit against the four big fast-\nfood corporations, saying their fatty foods are responsible for his \nclient's obesity and health-related problems.''\n  The lawyer filed his lawsuit in State court in the Bronx, ``alleging \nthat McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and [Louisville-based] KFC \nCorporation are irresponsible and deceptive in the posting of their \nnutritional information, that they need to offer other options on their \nmenus, and that they created a de facto addiction in their consumers, \nparticularly the poor and children.''\n  The lawyer said:\n\n       You don't need nicotine or an illegal drug to create an \n     addiction, you're creating a craving.\n\n  The lead plaintiff, a 56-year-old maintenance supervisor, said he \n``traced it all back to high fat, grease and salt, all back to \nMcDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King.'' He said:\n\n       There was no fast food I didn't eat, and I ate it more \n     often than not because I was single, it was quick, and I'm \n     not a very good cook. It was a necessity, and I think it was \n     killing me, my doctor said it was killing me, and I don't \n     want to die.\n\n  The attorney ``aimed to make his case into a class action lawsuit,'' \nwith the ultimate goal ``to force the fast-food industry `to offer a \nlarger variety to the consumers, including non-meat vegetarian, less \ngrams of fat, and a reduction' '' in meal size.\n  Mr. President, by the way, damages in the case were unspecified. \nGiven the horror stories we have heard of plaintiffs getting the short \nend of the stick in class action cases, the plaintiffs better hope that \nclass action reform gets enacted before their case is resolved, lest \ntheir lawyer bank all the cash while they are stuck with a coupon as a \nresult of a ``drive-by''--or should I say ``drive-through''--\nsettlement. The coupon could probably buy a large french fry. That \nwould be about all it would purchase.\n  A disturbing thing about lawsuits against ``big fast food'' is that \nthey promote a culture of victimhood and jettison the principle of \npersonal responsibility. I have, in fact, introduced the Commonsense \nConsumption Act to try to restore sanity to our legal system with \nrespect to these types of cases against the fast food industry.\n  But an equally disturbing aspect that this high profile case \nillustrates is the use of class action lawsuits to circumvent \nlegislative decisions and subvert the democratic process. No branch of \nGovernment should mandate that Burger King and McDonald's carry veggie \nburgers for portly patrons. But even if that is something Government \nshould do, it should not be the judicial branch that does it, \nparticularly a State court setting national culinary policy.\n  Let me give another example with which people might not be as \nfamiliar. A national class action lawsuit certified in an Illinois \ncounty court has resulted in a determination that car insurance \ncompanies violated their contracts by refusing to provide original \nmanufactured parts to policyholders who were involved in accidents. \nThis determination resulted in a $1.8 billion verdict against State \nFarm.\n  This case is noteworthy because the county court which certified the \nclass action let the case stand, even though several State insurance \ncommissioners testified that a ruling in favor of the nationwide case \nwould actually contravene the laws of other States. These laws either \nallowed, or in fact required, the use of generic car parts as a way to \nkeep costs down for consumers.\n  As the New York Times reported, the result of this State class action \nwas to ``overturn insurance regulations or State laws in New York, \nMassachusetts, and Hawaii, among other places,'' and ``to make what \namounts to a national rule on insurance.''\n  The concerns with this case were not due to the interests of ``big \ninsurance.'' Ralph Nader's group, Public Citizen, the attorneys general \nof New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, and the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners all filed briefs opposing the \nIllinois State court's determination because this county court's new \nnational rule on insurance would be bad for consumers--though I suspect \nthe trial lawyers in that case have made out quite handsomely.\n\n  It is not only appropriate, but necessary, to use class actions to \nefficiently provide remedies to large numbers of plaintiffs. But it is \ninappropriate to use them to circumvent the decisions that belong to \nother branches of Government and to other States. Maybe Ralph Nader, \nNew York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and other States are wrong and \nthe county judge in Illinois is right, and we should require that \noriginal manufacturer parts be used in auto repairs. But that is a \ndecision for the people of the several States to make, not unelected \njudges.\n  Mr. President, class action reform will ensure that truly national \ncases are decided in a national forum, and I hope we can enact this \nimportant reform. The Democrat leadership has said their caucus \nrecognizes the need for reform. I think the fact that they are \nfilibustering the motion to proceed questions that notion.\n  But we will soon have a chance to see if our friends on the other \nside of the aisle are sincere about trying to solve the problem of \nclass action litigation. If they are serious, then they should support \ncloture on the motion to proceed and give us a chance to go forward \nwith this important legislation. If we get on the bill, then they can \ntry to improve the flaws they see in it, or maybe even substitute an \nentirely new proposal, which I understand one of the Democratic \nSenators advocates. But if\n\n[[Page S12999]]\n\nwe cannot even get on the bill, we cannot attempt to solve whatever \nproblems they think might be in the bill.\n  I am hopeful that we won't have the situation we had a few months \nago, where folks on the other side claimed to want to do something \nabout the problems with our medical liability system, but then, to a \nman, filibustered the motion to proceed on medical liability reform. We \nwill soon see if our friends on the other side of the aisle are \nsincerely interested in moving forward on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S12999-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 11:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1751, with the time until 12:30 p.m. \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 1751, a bill \n     to amend the procedures that apply to consideration of \n     interstate class actions to assure fairer outcomes for class \n     members and defendants, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 5 \nadditional minutes of morning business just consumed by the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader be charged against the \nRepublican time for debate on the motion to proceed to S. 1751.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to ask that the \nChair recognize the distinguished Senator from Nevada for comments that \nhe may care to make on the motion to proceed and on the upcoming vote \nat 12:30 on cloture regarding that issue. I want to perhaps tee it up a \nlittle bit and talk about why I think this motion to proceed is so \nimportant. I am only going to do so for a few minutes, and I will talk \nsome more after the Senator from Nevada has had a chance to speak, and \nperhaps someone on the other side who wishes to speak.\n  I worry that our system of litigation has simply become too expensive \nand too time-consuming to serve the needs of consumers and the public. \nThose of us who have represented people in court, whether they be a \nplaintiff or a defendant in a lawsuit, know that sometimes after the \nlawsuit is over, even though lawsuits invariably have winners and \nlosers, sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between the two \nbecause the process, as I say, costs so much and takes so much time.\n  Unfortunately, because of that, a lot of people with valid claims, \nwho have been dealt an injustice and should have access to our courts \nor some means to vindicate those claims, are simply frozen out. That is \nsomething we need to work on not just on this bill, on this day, but \ngoing forward. I hope we will.\n  This bill, I believe, is very important because, indeed, I think the \npurpose of a class action lawsuit is a good one. It does, as originally \nintended, serve the purpose of providing individuals with relatively \nsmall claims an opportunity to get access to the court to get justice, \neven though it may not be economically sustainable because, of course, \nthey have to hire a lawyer, pay court costs, and all the like.\n  The purpose, I believe, is laudable, but as in a lot of areas, \nexperience and scholarship by the Nation's leading thinkers and just \nplain common sense tell us that, with the circumstances that confront \nus today when it comes to class action lawsuits, the system is not just \nbroken but that it is falling completely apart.\n  Mr. President, I reserve any remaining comments that I may have and, \naccording to the time that has been split between the parties on this \nissue, recognize the Senator from Nevada for comments he may care to \nmake at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I do not want to \ninterfere with my friend from Nevada, but I understood we were going \nback and forth; is that correct?\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is certainly fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no agreement to that effect.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Has there been time reserved under the order for the \nSenator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time reserved.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I may inquire of my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Ensign was here when I started, and then Senator Leahy \ncame in after I started, so I apologize. May I inquire approximately \nhow long the Senator from Vermont wishes to speak?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is reserved under the order \nfor the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will not use the 30 minutes. I am going to use \napproximately 5 minutes of my 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I certainly ask that the Senator from Vermont be \nrecognized for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I do take my time under \nthe order.\n  As I stated before, I do oppose this bill, a bill that has not had \nhearings, has not had a vote in the committee, but when you review it, \nyou realize--let me be parochial for a moment--this legislation would \ndeprive Vermonters of the right to band together to protect themselves \nagainst violations of State civil rights, consumer, health, and \nenvironmental protection laws in their own State courts.\n  That is unacceptable to this Vermonter. The same could be said of all \nthe other 49 States, and it ought to be unacceptable to the Senators \nfrom each of the other 49 States.\n  In fact, the country might ask what it says about our priorities that \nwe are even having this debate. Of the many pressing issues already on \nthe Senate's plate awaiting action and awaiting time on the floor, all \nthe appropriations bills that we are required by law to pass by \nSeptember 30 and have yet to even be taken up for a vote or debate \nshould be among our highest priorities. If we are going to tell how the \nlaws should be made and how the courts should be run, we ought to at \nleast demonstrate to the American people that we, in the Senate, can \nfollow the law and do our appropriations bills at the time we are \nsupposed to.\n  Instead, we set aside those issues that by law we are required to do, \nthose issues that are the priorities of the American people, to take up \nanother priority. We ask: Whose priority is this bill? The bill is a \ntop priority to special interests that include big polluters and big \nviolators of the American people's consumer rights and civil rights \npast, present, and future.\n  Class actions are one remaining tool available to the average \nAmerican in seeking justice, and some special interests want nothing \nmore than to weaken the public's hand in class action proceedings.\n  While the Senate is spending several days debating this bill, think \nof those appropriations bills that by law we should have brought up \nweeks ago and what is in those bills: not special interests but \nAmerican interests, such as funding for the Department of Justice to \nprovide bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers, the same law \nenforcement officers who protect all of us, or how about the money to \nput more cops on the streets and to implement the prevention programs \nof the Violence Against Women Act? Those are not special interests; \nthey are American interests.\n  Despite the fact the fiscal year began 3 weeks ago, we are dallying \nwith this special interest legislation that benefits large corporate \ninterests at the expense of individuals harmed by these corporations.\n  At its core, this bill deprives citizens of the right to sue on State \nlaw claims in their own State courts if the principal defendant is a \ncitizen of another State, even if that defendant has a substantial \npresence in the plaintiffs' home State, and even if the harm done was \nin the plaintiffs' home State.\n  Less than a week ago, with no hearings before our committee, mass \ntort actions were included in the bill along with true class actions, \ndespite the fact\n\n[[Page S13000]]\n\nthat when we actually did vote on it in the Judiciary Committee, both \nRepublicans and Democrats voted to take that out. This simply amplifies \nthe harm done to citizens' rights, and to the possibility of \nvindicating those rights in their own State courts.\n\n  It also shows how special interest legislation comes on the floor. \nHere is legislation bypassing the committee, legislation that is dumped \non the floor and provisions added to it that had been voted down by a \nmajority of the committee of jurisdiction, a majority requiring both \nRepublicans and Democrats to vote for it.\n  Special interests groups are distorting the state of class action \nlitigation by relying on a few anecdotes in an ends-oriented attempt to \nimpede plaintiffs bringing class action cases. There are problems in \nclass action litigation. There are ways of taking care of that. But \nsimply shoving most suits into Federal court with new one-sided rules \nwill not correct the real problems faced by plaintiffs and defendants.\n  After all, our State-based tort system remains one of the greatest \nand most powerful vehicles for justice anywhere in the world. I think \nof when the Soviet Union broke up, as I said before on the floor, and \nmembers of the new governing body came to the United States to study \nhow we do things. I recall a group coming to my office and saying: We \nhave heard that people in the United States in your States can sue the \nGovernment, sue the State.\n  I said: That's right.\n  They said: We have heard further that they actually could win, and \nthe State could lose.\n  I said: It happens all the time.\n  They said: You mean, you don't fire the judges; you don't start over \nagain?\n  I said: Absolutely not; this is our system. We set it up that way so \npeople can go to their State courts and sue.\n  If this is passed, I would hate to have to explain to those people \nfrom the former Soviet Union that we have taken such a step backward.\n  One reason that our State-based tort systems are so great is that \nthere is an availability of class action litigation that lets ordinary \npeople band together to take on powerful corporations or even their own \nGovernment. Defrauded investors, deceived consumers, victims of \ndefective products, and environmental torts, and thousands of other \nordinary people have been able to rely on class action lawsuits in our \nState court systems to seek and receive justice.\n  If they cannot, that is what the cheaters count on. We are only \ncheating you $5 or $6 or $10 or $15. Why would you sue for that? But if \nthere are millions being cheated, then you have a chance to do \nsomething. Class actions allow the little guys to band together. \nWhether it is to force manufacturers to recall and correct dangerous \nproducts, as we saw with the Bridgestone/Firestone tire recall, or to \nclean up after devastating environmental harms, as we saw with Monsanto \nin Alabama, or to vindicate the basic civil rights they are entitled to \nas citizens of our great country, they are using class actions, and \nthey should continue to do so.\n  The so-called Class Action Fairness Act is something that appeared on \nthe Senate desk with no hearings. It almost looks as if it has been \ndrafted in the legal section of one of the major polluters of this \ncountry. It would leave injured parties who have valid claims with no \neffective way to seek relief.\n  Class action suits have helped win justice and exposed wrongdoing by \ncorporate and Government wrongdoers. They have given average Americans \nat least a chance for justice. We should not take that away.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, first I inquire as to the remaining time \non the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the majority, there are 21\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that of that time, the last 10 \nminutes before the vote be reserved for the Senator from Iowa, the \nsponsor of the bill, or his designee; that following this UC request we \ngo to the Senator from Nevada for 5 minutes; thereafter, that the \nSenator from Delaware be recognized for 5 minutes for any comments he \nmay make; and then that the remainder of the time be reserved for me or \nmy designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nyielding.\n  We just heard that what class action lawsuits are really about is the \nlittle guys in our system. That may have been the way it was intended, \nbut unfortunately trial lawyers have abused this system where now--I am \nfrom the State of Nevada where we have these megabucks jackpots--what \nthis system has become is the megabucks jackpots for the trial lawyers. \nIt is not about the little guys anymore.\n  I have several examples I will cite to show exactly how out of \ncontrol this system is. Between 1997 and the year 2000, American \ncorporations reported a 300-percent increase in Federal class actions, \nand a 1,000-percent increase in State class actions filed against them. \nClass action lawsuits were conceived as an expeditious way for people \nwith the same grievances to join in a common suit and seek justice in \ninstances where it would be difficult to do so individually. \nUnfortunately, what has evolved now is a means for a select set of \ntrial attorneys to abuse the class action litigation system and to seek \nabsurd financial rewards. Whether or not these lawsuits are successful, \nthe cost of these lawsuits hurts the very people the lawyers claim to \nprotect, the consumer.\n  Oftentimes, the so-called clients of these class action attorneys end \nup with token awards in the form of coupons or rebates, while the \nattorneys pocket millions of dollars.\n  Just a few examples: In 1997, lawyers got nearly $2 million in fees \nand settlement with Cheerios over a food additive where there was no \nevidence any consumer had been injured. There was nearly $2,000 an hour \ncharged for this case for personal injury lawyers. Consumers received a \ncoupon for a free box of Cheerios. That is really protecting the \nconsumer.\n\n  Southwestern Bell customers were told they would benefit from a class \naction lawsuit. Instead, they ended up with three optional phone \nservices for 3 months or a $15 credit if they already subscribed to \nthose services. The trial lawyers received $4.5 million in fees.\n  In a class action lawsuit against Chase Manhattan Bank--and this one \nis really good--a State court awarded the plaintiffs a multimillion-\ndollar judgment. The trial lawyers walked away with over $4 million in \nattorney's fees. Each plaintiff was awarded, get this, a settlement \ncheck of 33 cents. Since the plaintiffs had to claim their check by \nmail at the then-cost of a 34-cent stamp, the class action ``win'' for \nthe consumer was a net loss of one penny.\n  It is obvious there is a need to reform our class action system. We \nneed to take it where we have the best jurists in the Federal system.\n  A couple of years ago, one of the best trial attorneys in Las Vegas \ncame to me. He actually makes his living doing these things. He said: \nIf you want to reform the system, take it out of the State courts where \nyou can just select the cheapest State that there is to sue, and take \nit where you have the most talented jurists in the Federal system. That \nway the legitimate lawsuits will go forward. Those cases where the \nconsumer really does need protection will go forward, but we will get \nrid of a lot of the frivolous, outrageous lawsuits that are happening \nat the State court level.\n  So I urge that this Senate would proceed to the debate. If there are \namendments, let us have the amendments, but let us at least proceed to \nthe debate on reforming our broken class action system.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me the time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. This is \nan important vote. I think in some ways this may be the most important \nvote we have cast in the 2\\1/2\\ years I have been here. I want to speak \nto Democrats first and then to Republicans. I suggest to my colleagues, \nmy Democrat friends, why it is important for us to vote for the motion \nto proceed to take\n\n[[Page S13001]]\n\nup this bill and to improve this legislation before we end up voting \nfor it and sending it to conference.\n  First, I say to my Democrat colleagues, the status quo is not \nacceptable. We cannot feel good about the system of justice which \nexists today. There are many who disparage the trial bar, but I will \nsay a kind word toward the efforts of many members of the trial bar. \nThey do important work. They make sure when the little people are \ndamaged or hurt that there is a way for them to have their grievances \naddressed, and when people are harmed to be compensated. That is \nimportant. It is important we preserve that right.\n  The system that has evolved over the last 200 years with the class \nactions, and what I think everyone regards as venue shopping too often \nbetween different State courts and the Federal courts, is a system that \nis just out of balance today. We can do better than this. It is \nimportant that we do better than this.\n  I want to go back and talk about the evolution of the legislation. \nWhen this bill was first introduced and talked about in the 105th \nCongress, there were a lot of people who thought that class action \nreform ought to be tort reform; that we ought to put caps on attorney's \nfees, caps on pain and suffering, caps on punitive damages, dismember \njoint and several liability. That is what a lot of people thought we \nought to do 6, 7, 8 years ago. This legislation does not look like that \nat all. This is a modest, measured approach to fixing what I believe is \na real problem.\n  I am not going to get into the weeds and talk about one aspect of the \nbill or the other. Some concerns have been raised about it. Some are \nlegitimate, some are not. I say to my colleagues, particularly \nDemocrats, the bill is not perfect. This bill can be improved. If it is \nnot perfect, make it better. We can make this bill better. In the end, \nin order for us to have the opportunity to make this bill better, we \nhave to move to the bill. We have to vote affirmatively for the motion \nto proceed. If we do that, we will have the opportunity for me to offer \namendments, as well as other colleagues to whom I have talked on our \nside. A number of our colleagues have very good ideas for amendments. \nAnd I invite not only Democrats to support them but our Republican \nfriends as well.\n  Republican leadership has indicated in a number of these instances \nthey will support the amendments that are being prepared to be offered.\n  Back to my Democrats, as the minority we have three bites out of this \napple to protect our position as the minority. One, we can filibuster \nand not vote for the motion to proceed. That is one protection. The \nsecond protection comes when we reach cloture on the bill and the \ndecision comes do we actually vote on the bill, do we go to cloture. \nThat is a second bite out of the apple. The third bite out of the apple \nis if there is a conference report between the House and the Senate, \nand the conference report comes back, and the Republicans have not \nacted in good faith, the majority has not acted in good faith, we have \na third bite out of the apple. I believe we have those protections down \nthe road and especially the second, on the motion to proceed.\n  I say straight out to our Republican friends, if we approve the \nmotion to proceed today, we actually get to the bill today, and have \nthe opportunity in the next days and week to offer amendments, if my \nRepublican friends do not act in good faith--and I believe they will--\nbut if they do not act in good faith, not only will I oppose cloture on \nthe bill, I will help lead a fight against cloture.\n  I want us to be able to offer our amendments. I want to see a lot of \nthose amendments adopted. If that happens, we can improve this bill \nfurther and then go to conference further down the line.\n  The last thing I want to say, in my view, there is more at stake than \nthe motion to proceed, and I have suggested this to Majority Leader \nFrist. What is at stake is whether we are going to be able to work \ntogether on a difficult and contentious issue; whether or not in this \ninstance we are going to be able to maybe take what could be a very \ngood experience, very positive experience of walking together across \nparty lines on a tough issue, and maybe apply that on other difficult \nissues we face.\n\n  So there is a responsibility on both sides: for us as Democrats to \noffer reasonable amendments, to join in good faith in the debate, but \nalso for our Republican colleagues to support those good amendments and \nact in good faith on their own. If they and we act in good faith, we \ncould end up with good policy, which is what makes good politics. That \nis the potential. It is important we all realize that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to pick up where the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware left off because I could not agree \nmore. This is an issue that should not divide us politically or even \nphilosophically. This is an opportunity for us to find common ground \nand work together. That is what many of us have sought to do from the \nvery beginning, what we have tried to do with our colleagues on the \nother side and with others, because we believe there is ample \nopportunity to find common ground if we only seek it.\n  I don't know the number of times I have offered to sit down, along \nwith many of our colleagues, with Senators on the other side in an \neffort to find the common ground we are looking for. For whatever \nreason, none of those offers have been accepted. So we find ourselves \nin a very difficult situation this morning. If I had the same \nconfidence the Senator from Delaware had that we could offer amendments \nand they would truly be considered and perhaps some of them adopted, I \nwould have no hesitation to support the motion to proceed. \nUnfortunately, on too many occasions now, especially involving tort, \nthat has been an elusive goal, to say the least. We have not had the \nopportunity to have amendments offered in good faith. They have been \nrejected, one after the other, on a party line vote. As a result, we \nare left with no recourse but to simply say: Look, let's find a way to \nresolve this matter. Let's negotiate a bipartisan solution and let's \nresolve this issue.\n  I would even use the current circumstances as an illustration of what \nit is I am talking about. The Judiciary Committee passed a bill that \nenjoyed bipartisan support, signed by several of our colleagues on this \nside. They sent it to the floor. We fully expected the debate would be \nabout that committee bill.\n  But that is not what the issue is this morning. The issue is whether \nwe should support a motion to proceed to a bill that was ``rule XIVed'' \nonto the calendar in spite of what the Judiciary Committee did; I would \nsay in direct conflict with what the Judiciary Committee did.\n  This bill is not just a class action bill. This bill is also a mass \ntort bill. The committee voiced its opinion on mass tort. They \nobjected. On a unanimous vote, mass tort was excluded from the class \naction bill.\n  Lo and behold, it is right back in the legislation today. So we will \nbe voting on the motion to proceed not only to class action but to mass \ntort, and mass tort for many of us is a woman's issue. It is the Dalkon \nshield, it is silicon breast implants, it is fen/phen. It is a lot of \nissues that would not have been addressed had this legislation been in \nlaw when those cases were taken up. It is that simple. Mass tort is \nsomething most of our colleagues did not bargain for, but it is in this \nbill.\n  The second issue has to do with the right of removal. Defendants now \nhave an opportunity to remove a case from State court within a 30-day \nsnapshot. They do that. Everyone understands that is their opportunity \nto move to a different venue. Under this legislation, they strip that \nlegislation. At any time during the consideration of a case they can \nremove themselves from that particular court's jurisdiction. That is \nunprecedented. You talk about forum shopping. I can't think of a better \ninvitation to forum shopping than the right of removal at any time up \nto the time the verdict is about to be announced. That is in this \nlegislation.\n  This is bad legislating. It is bad legislating because it overrides \nthe rules of the committee, because it overrides the voice, the \nopinion, the position of the committee on some of these key questions. \nFrankly, it overrides the consensus that I know we can establish \ntogether.\n  I have said as late as yesterday to the majority leader, I want to \nsit down with you. I want to negotiate some way\n\n[[Page S13002]]\n\nto resolve these issues. Do we recognize there is abuse? Absolutely. \nBut this legislation is killing a housefly with a shotgun. There is a \nlot of collateral damage that is going to be done if it passes.\n  I am very hopeful we all recognize the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana has offered a viable alternative that recognizes there are \ntimes when class actions ought to be held in State court, but there are \ntimes when class actions ought to be held at the Federal court level. \nWe can recognize that there are those times when there is a Federal \njurisdictional question.\n  Whether it is his language or something like it, we can work with our \ncolleagues on the other side. But the only way that is going to happen \nis if we sit down and do this together. That is what I am offering. \nThat is why I opposed the motion to proceed, because that has not \nhappened yet. I am hopeful it will.\n  Whether or not we can succeed in establishing that important priority \nwith this vote remains to be seen. I am hoping my colleagues will join \nme.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. How much time remains for the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to revise the previous unanimous \nconsent agreement to provide for 7 minutes for Senator Grassley or his \ndesignee, 3 minutes for Senator Kohl, the Senator from Wisconsin, and I \nreserve the remaining time for myself, such as remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Class Action \nFairness bill. What those of us who are supportive of this bill are \ntrying to do is simply get it to the floor where it can be debated, \namended, and even filibustered, so I do not understand the objections \nof those who want to prevent the bill from even reaching the floor. \nThose who do not support the final bill as it would emerge can vote \nagainst it and can even filibuster it, which would require 60 votes at \nthat time.\n  My fear is those people who do not even want the bill to reach the \nfloor in fact do not want--and I will bet we will not have--any class \naction reform. I believe many of those on the other side on this issue \nwant to put this whole question of class action reform to bed and not \naddress it at all. I would be willing to bet any of them we will not \nhave any class action reform if in fact this bill we are proposing is \nprevented from even reaching the floor at this time.\n  The bill that is being voted upon at 12:30 is a bill that has gone \nthrough the committee process in the most fair and democratic of ways. \nIt has been years in the making. It has been amended at the committee \nlevel by Democrats as well as Republicans, and finally voted out of the \ncommittee on a bipartisan basis. This is the way bills are supposed to \nreach the floor for debate and amendment and final approval or \ndisapproval. I cannot understand legitimate motivations of those who \nare in opposition, as they have expressed themselves, except as it may \nbe their motivations are to kill class action reform entirely in this \nsession of the Congress and for as long as we can look ahead and \nforesee.\n  I urge my colleagues who want to see class action reform to allow \nthis bill to reach the floor where it can be, as I said, fully debated \nand fully amended. I point out to them once again if in fact there is \nthat kind of opposition to the bill that would finally emerge for final \nvote, they can require 60 votes. So all of their concerns as they have \nbeen expressed in this debate can still be addressed in that final \nvote, which could be, in fact, a filibuster vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed. I hope \nvery much that we will have a chance to debate class action reform.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes under the time \nremaining.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues, I am for reforming the so-called class \naction litigation system we have in place. I think a strong majority of \nthe Members of the Senate also favor a reform piece of legislation \npassing this body and ultimately being signed into law. But this is a \ntwo-way street, as everything we have to do in this body has to be. A \n51-to-49 Senate means that neither side has the ability to do whatever \nthey want without negotiating with the other half of the Senate. Either \nside has the potential to stop anything. That is what happens so many \ntimes in this body during this period of time we are in now where both \nsides can say, we are not going to do it this way, or, do it my way or \ndon't do it at all. The clear result of that is nothing gets done. The \nend result is that both sides can blame the other side for failure in \ngetting anything accomplished.\n  For those who truly want to get something done and worry less about \nwho gets the credit, it is obvious that the way to do it is to sit down \nand negotiate and try to reach an agreement. I am absolutely convinced \nthat an agreement that addresses the real problems dealing with class \naction could be reached in short order and allow us to get as many as \n70 to 75 votes for a real class action reform bill. But that has not \nhappened. It has not happened because my colleagues on the Republican \nside have generally said, we have what we want and we want to pass the \nbill that we wrote, even though they wrote much of it after it had \nalready left the committee, as the distinguished Democratic leader \ntalked about just a moment ago.\n  I have introduced a bill--S. 1769--which I think addresses all of the \nconcerns people have raised about any potential abuses dealing with \nclass action litigation. The idea would be for us to sit down with our \ncolleagues and negotiate between their version and the version I have \nintroduced to see if we can reach common ground and pass this in less \nthan an hour with a substantial three-fourths of the Senate probably \nvoting for it.\n  Many people have said the problem is forum shopping; many plaintiffs \ntry to find the best forum they can possibly find and litigate in that \nforum for the best judgment they can get. My legislation says, no, we \nare going to follow principally the same rules the committee set out. \nIf a third or fewer of the plaintiffs are from one single State, it \nbelongs not in State court but in Federal court. That is the same \nsituation that the committee has reported out. We are in agreement. If \nbetween one-third of the plaintiffs are from one State and two-thirds \nare from one State--if between one-third and two-thirds have been \ninjured in Louisiana and filed suit--then Federal court decides whether \nit belongs in Federal court or State court.\n  That is principally the same finding that the committee bill has. We \nare in principle agreement in that regard. The Federal court makes the \ndecision. For those who want it in Federal court, a Federal judge \nlooking at all of the particulars of the litigation will decide whether \nit belongs in his or her court on the Federal level or whether the \nState has a greater interest in trying it on the State level. There is \nno disagreement.\n  But one area of disagreement I would like to point out is the \nsituation of what happens if over two-thirds of the plaintiffs happen \nto be from one State, such as Louisiana. It is a big difference in what \nwe do here. If two-thirds or more of the plaintiffs suffer injuries in \nmy State, or any particular State, by the alleged defendant who is \ndoing business in that State, who sells products in that State, and who \nmust follow the law of that State passed by the State legislature, my \nproposal says that belongs in State court.\n  In the committee bill as drafted, they say even if every single \nperson has been injured or has allegedly been injured in my State of \nLouisiana by a defendant allegedly in violation of the laws of \nLouisiana, passed by the State Legislature of Louisiana, if the \ndefendant who caused the injury--even though they do business in my \nState and sell their products in my State, even if they have multiple \nstores in my State and are doing business and taking money out of my \nState for the things they sell, and if the defendant happens to have \ncitizenship of Delaware, where many corporations are incorporated, or \nany other State, that doesn't belong in State court anymore; we are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S13003]]\n\nput that in Federal court, which is already overburdened. The Federal \njudiciary says they don't want that jurisdiction.\n  Justice Rehnquist says he is opposed to it for that reason, among \nothers.\n  This legislation says: No, we are going to put it in Federal court, \neven if everybody who is hurt and who is residing in the State, and the \ninjuries were caused in violation of State law passed by the State \nlegislature, because the defendant happens to have citizenship and is \nincorporated in another State, we will send it to Federal court.\n\n  People much more articulate than I have talked about this. One of the \ndistinguished writers who has looked at this, Professor Arthur Miller \nfrom Harvard Law School, said the following:\n\n       S. 274 goes too far in broadening Federal diversity \n     jurisdiction. S. 274 would place in Federal courts most class \n     actions if the defendant is a citizen of a State that is \n     different from any member of the plaintiff class. I can find \n     no justification for denying State courts the right to hear \n     cases primarily involving its own citizens who claim they \n     have been harmed by a violation of their State's laws.\n\n  That is what the committee bill does. That is a principal reason \ntheir great expansion of Federal jurisdiction is so wrong.\n  I had a case in Louisiana. There are many crawfish farmers in \nLouisiana, probably the only State that has crawfish farmers--and maybe \na few in the State of Texas. But they allege injuries because some \nchemical manufacturer had sold them pesticides and killed all of the \ncrawfish in Louisiana. Every single plaintiff was from Louisiana. The \ninjuries occurred in Louisiana. They sold the product in Louisiana. \nThey were doing business in Louisiana selling the products. The State \nlaw of Louisiana said what they did was illegal and wrong and the \nplaintiffs deserved some compensation for the injuries they received. \nBut no; under the committee bill, just because the defendant chemical \nmanufacturer happens to be out of State the Federal court is going to \nbe brought in to interpret State law that has been interpreted by the \nState supreme court and passed by the State legislature applying it to \nevery State resident of my State.\n  That is not a legitimate way of handling cases that are uniquely a \nState concern, covered by State law and affecting only State injured \nplaintiffs in these cases. That is not what we want to do.\n  Our legislation also says that one of the abuses is these coupon \nsellers. We solved that problem in the past. Attorneys were filing on \nthe number of coupons that may have been issued in settling a case for \na defective product. You could go to the store and buy the product for \na discount. The lawyers were being paid on the total number of coupons \nissued--not the ones actually redeemed. The attorney fees would be \nbased only on those who exercised the right of buying the product with \nthe use of their coupon.\n  As many people said, this is forum shopping, which the distinguished \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, talked about. They don't want forum \nshopping for plaintiffs, but they don't mind giving it to the defendant \nbecause the defendant, under this legislation, could ask that the case \nbe removed out of State court at any time. Before the jury gets the \ncase, if they think it may not go well, they will file a motion to move \nit to another court.\n  That is not right. How many times do they have a bite at the apple? \nThings aren't going very well anymore; we had better try another court. \nLet's go to the Federal court because we may lose in State court. If \nforum shopping is bad for plaintiffs--which we correct--it is no more \njustifiable for defendants to be able to do it, which is what this \ncommittee bill does.\n  I am only saying we need to say no to bringing this bill up until we \nhave had a chance to talk about these issues in a serious form.\n  If I offer my amendment and the bill is brought up, they will move to \ntable it, and, bingo, it is all over with, and we all go home. That is \nnot the way to legislate on something as important as this. We need to \nnegotiate. We need to talk about it.\n\n  What we are trying to say is, don't bring this bill up now. Vote \nagainst the motion to invoke cloture and let us see if we cannot sit \ndown and talk about the differences that are not that great but hugely \nimportant--not that many but very important--between the two versions \nof the bill. I think we can put them together and get 75 votes, call it \na day and everyone can be proud of the product we have produced.\n  I reserve the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. How much time is on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I commend the Senator from Louisiana for his constructive \nefforts to get involved in class action reform. He has made a good \ncontribution to the debate by offering some additional ideas for those \nthat were considered in the Judiciary Committee when we voted this \nClass Action Fairness Act out of the committee.\n  It makes no sense to me to say vote against bringing the bill up in \norder to fix class action abuse. If people are serious about class \naction reform, then they would want us to bring up the bill. They would \nvote in favor of cloture and we would simply have a debate, as we do on \nall legislation on the merits of the bill, as voted out of committee or \nat least brought up for consideration here with whatever amendments may \nbe offered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has some constructive amendments, no \ndoubt, and he has shown himself to be a master at bridging the gaps in \nthis body and achieving consensus. He is to be commended for it. We \nneed more people willing to look at the merits of legislation and vote \non those merits. That is all we are asking.\n  I point out that, while there are a lot of different newspapers in \nthe country, one that watches what happens in Washington, in \nparticular, is the Washington Post which has observed that:\n\n     . . . ``clients'' in class action lawsuits get token payments \n     while the lawyers get enormous fees. This is not justice. It \n     is an extortion racket that only Congress can fix.\n\n  Very strong words. Not mine but those of the editorial board of the \nWashington Post.\n  Others who should be in a position to know a lot about this subject--\nfor example, the Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by \nthe Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court--have acknowledged problems \nwith the class action system. While they are not in the business of \nlobbying for specific language, certainly we want to pay attention to \nsome of the suggestions they may have about ways we can correct some of \nthose problems. That is what this is all about.\n\n  This is some of the language I was referring to, obviously, speaking \nof the Judicial Conference:\n\n     . . . thanked Congress for ``working to resolve the serious \n     problems generated by overlapping and competing class \n     actions.''\n\n  Ultimately, I think we are all interested in the same thing; that is, \nthat people who are hurt due to the wrongful conduct of others have a \nmeans to redress those injuries and make sure the wrongful actor pays. \nBut we are not in the business of making sure that a few benefit at the \nexpense of many. That is what happens now with an abusive class action \nsystem which enriches entrepreneurial class lawyers who find a so-\ncalled class representative and are then able to manufacture a huge \nlawsuit where they reap millions of dollars in fees and the consumer \ngets a coupon.\n  There is an old country and western song ``she gets the gold mine and \nhe gets the shaft.'' In this instance, it is the lawyers who get the \ngold mine and consumers get the shaft in modern class action \nlitigation. We ought to be about fixing that. We cannot fix it until \nthis matter comes up on the motion to proceed and at least 60 Senators \nvote on the motion to proceed.\n  I hope my colleagues will heed the eloquent words of the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Carper, and Senator Kohl, my colleague on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and vote to bring the matter up.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself the time I consume.\n  I echo the remarks of the distinguished Democratic leader which \nindicate another reason why we should not be voting for cloture on this \nbill; that is, the changes that were made to the bill after it got out \nof committee. I refer to it as being the ``committee\n\n[[Page S13004]]\n\nbill,'' but the bill before the Senate is not the committee bill. A \nfunny thing happened on the way to the forum: the committee bill was \nchanged. You report one thing out of committee, you expect that will be \nthe thing that comes to the floor--maybe some technical changes, a \nperiod here, a paragraph there--but they changed the substance of the \nbill from the time it left the committee.\n  If we were dealing with a committee bill, you could make a legitimate \nargument that you should proceed to the bill that the committee \nreported. But what they are asking us to do is proceed to a bill that \nthe committee did not report. In fact, it is substantially different \nfrom the committee bill. That is not normal procedure.\n  That is why the Democratic leader has suggested what we ought to do \nis say: Time out. Put together the heads of the people interested in \nthis and see if we cannot produce a package where we could get three-\nfourths of all the Senators voting for it. It has substantial changes \nmade by the committee managers. They certainly have a legal right to do \nit, but from the terms of policy and how we legislate, if you have a \nclear vote in the committee to do one thing and then come out and do \nsomething entirely different on a key part of the bill, that is a \nsubstantial change that did not come through the committee process.\n  What I am saying is we ought to be talking together, both sides \ntalking together, in order to get a substantial vote to enact this \nlegislation.\n  I support class action reform. I think our bill, S. 1769, has, in \nfact, clearly addressed the issues of forum shopping and the coupon \nsettlements. We clearly spelled out when cases would be in State court \nand when cases would be in Federal court. We do not reach out and say \nthat even if every single injured party was from one State and was \ninjured in violation of the State laws passed by the State legislature \nand previously interpreted by the State supreme court, that just \nbecause a defendant happens to be incorporated in the State of \nDelaware, for instance, that somehow yanks that case out of State court \nwhich is best suited for interpreting State law and brought into \nFederal court which the Federal Judiciary Conference already says they \ndo not want because they have more business than they can handle, \nresulting in further delays. That is not what this bill should be all \nabout.\n  Therefore, I suggest we say no to the cloture vote and that we sit \ndown and work out the minor differences but important differences \nbetween S. 1769 and the bill in the Senate which has never come through \nthe committee process. That is unfortunate. That is the main reason we \nshould say no to cloture at this time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of the motion to proceed to S. 1751, the Class Action Fairness \nAct of 2003. This bill is a fair and balanced solution to the growing \nproblem of class action abuses, and it has solid bipartisan support. \nThe process that was used to get to the floor was open and fair. The \nbill deserves to be debated, and my colleagues should support cloture \non the motion to proceed so that we can get on the bill and consider \namendments.\n  This modest bill will preserve class action lawsuits as an important \ntool that brings representation to the unrepresented. But it will also \ngo a long way toward ending class action lawsuit abuses where the \nplaintiffs receive coupons of little or no value, while their lawyers \nreceive millions. It makes you wonder who benefits from these class \nactions: the consumers or their lawyers? Given the trial lawyers' \nopposition to this bill, I think we know the answer to that question.\n  Both forum-shopping plaintiffs' lawyers and corporate defense lawyers \nare abusing the system. Lawyers are choosing plaintiff-friendly county \ncourts to hear national class action cases, and defendants are shopping \naround for the best settlement deal regardless of whether it is the \nright thing to do. The lawyers file competing class actions, and enter \ninto collusive settlements.\n  Some class action lawyers manipulate pleadings to avoid the removal \nof cases to the Federal courts, even if it hurts their clients. Some \neven name an innocent local defendant just to beat Federal \njurisdiction. In the end, it is the consumer that is the big loser. \nThis just isn't right.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2003 tries to fix the more egregious \nabuses. The bill includes a number of provisions to help protect class \nmembers. It requires that notice of proposed settlements in all class \nactions, as well as all class notices, must be in clear, easily \nunderstood English. It requires that State attorneys general be \nnotified of any proposed class settlement that would affect residents \nof their States so that they can act as watchdogs for fairness.\n\n  The bill includes provisions to help ensure that there are fair \nsettlements. For example, it disallows cash bounty payments to lead \nplaintiffs so lawyers looking for victims can't promise them \nunwarranted payoffs to be their excuses for filing suit. It requires \nthat judges to carefully scrutinize settlements where the plaintiffs \nget only coupons or noncash awards, and the lawyers get money. The bill \nrequires a court to make a written finding that the settlement is fair \nand reasonable for class members.\n  Finally, the bill injects some rationality in terms of where large, \nnationwide class actions can be heard. It allows more class action \nlawsuits to be removed from State court to Federal court, either by a \ndefendant or an unnamed class member. A class action would qualify for \nFederal jurisdiction if the total damages exceed $5,000,000 and parties \nincluded citizens from multiple states. But if a case really belongs in \nState court because it is a local problem or the class members and \ndefendants are in-State, the case won't be decided in Federal court.\n  This is a good bill. It is fair and balanced. We have been working \nwith Senators on both sides of the aisle to try to get it right. There \nis no question that there are serious problems with the current class \naction system and we need to deal with these abuses. So I urge all my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting cloture on the motion to proceed so \nthat we can finally get to the bill and debate this legislation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as a former business person and \ntechnology executive who has direct experience with class action \nlitigation, I agree with the proponents of this bill that class action \ncases that impact Americans in every State ought to be litigated in \nFederal court. American business should be focused on developing \ninnovative technologies, growing and creating jobs, and securing our \neconomic future. American businesses should not be forced to defend \nthemselves simultaneously in the exact same case in as many as seven \ndifferent States at the same time.\n  I believe the current consolidation mechanism in Federal court offers \nboth consumers and businesses a fair and efficient means of having \ntheir claims heard, and I support allowing more cases to be tried in \nFederal courts.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot support the bill before us today. While some \npositive changes have been made to the bill, the bill would close the \nState courthouse doors to almost all class action cases and move those \ncases to Federal court. The bill could overwhelm our Federal court \nsystem and cause delay not just in the cases that are being removed, \nbut in the important class action matters that are already in Federal \ncourt.\n  I come from a State that is ranked as having the third best civil \njustice system in the country, according to the Chamber of Commerce. I \nrecognize the rights of my constituents to have their claims heard in \nour own State courts and according to our own State laws. In 1993, \nhundreds of people in my State became critically ill and several died \nas a result of eating Jack-in-the-Box hamburgers tainted with deadly E-\ncoli bacteria. Five hundred of those victims and family members came \ntogether and filed a class action lawsuit in State court for damages as \na result of the injuries they sustained. The case was settled for $12 \nmillion. This is not frivolous litigation.\n  In fact, not one of the hundreds of businesses I have talked to about \nthis bill has ever suggested that any abusive or frivolous class action \nlitigation had occurred in Washington State. However, even though most \nof the plaintiffs in this class action were from Washington, and the \ncase was about personal injury, a claim traditionally heard by State \ncourts, if this lawsuit\n\n[[Page S13005]]\n\nwere to be filed in the future, this bill would give defendants the \nright to remove the case to Federal court causing additional expense \nand grievances for the victims in this case.\n  I have three concerns about the bill. We need a better balance \nbetween cases being heard in State and Federal court. We need better \nprotections for civil rights cases and a time deadline for moving cases \nto Federal courts.\n  First, we need to have the proper balance between addressing lawsuits \nin State and Federal courts. Currently, virtually all class actions are \ntried in State court. However, by moving virtually all of the lawsuits \nto Federal courts, this bill does not provide that balance. I support \nan approach that provides for keeping some cases in State courts and \nimproving the flexibility to try more cases in Federal courts.\n  I have heard from many of the business leaders in my State who have \nexpressed their concerns about the increasing challenges of defending \nthemselves against the same claims in multiple states. I have heard \ntheir frustrations about seeing the claims dismissed in one State only \nto have them filed in another. I have heard from some of the oldest \nestablished businesses in my State to the newest. From Weyerhaeuser to \nMicrosoft to AT Wireless, Intel, Amazon, the Madrona Group, Expedia, \nand Starbucks.\n  These employers have been forced to defend class action suits that \nare either dismissed or settled in a manner that provides little \nbenefit to the class but great financial benefit to the lawyers. That \nisn't right, and that is why I have asked these companies in my State \nto analyze what the effects would be of removing any case to Federal \ncourt in which less than one third of the plaintiffs were from the \nState where the case was filed. I have committed to each of these \nbusinesses that I will continue to work with them to find a way to move \nmore cases to Federal court while keeping cases that primarily affect a \ngroup of consumers in a State in that State's court.\n  While I believe that finding a better balance between class action \nlawsuits in State and Federal court is critical, I also cannot support \nthis bill in the absence of protections that allow higher portions of \nsettlement awards to be made to those individuals who agree to act as \nlead plaintiffs in class action cases. In addition, I believe that \nthere needs to be a fixed date for defendants to seek to move a class \naction case to Federal court. As the bill is written now, a class \naction case can be proceeded all the way through trial and into jury \ndeliberations--and defendants can still seek to remove it to Federal \ncourt even at this late date. I do not believe this serves the \ninterests of justice. This provision should be fixed.\n  I have communicated my three concerns to supporters of the bill. I am \ndisappointed that these straightforward changes, which are in the \ninterests of both consumers and businesses, were not included in the \nbill. Absent these improvements to the bill, I cannot vote for the \nmeasure before us today.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose the Class Action Fairness Act, \nand I will vote against the motion to proceed. The main reason for my \nopposition is that notwithstanding its title, I do not think this bill \nis fair. I do not think it is fair to citizens who are injured by \ncorporate wrongdoers and are entitled to prompt and fair resolution of \ntheir claims in a court of law. I do not think it is fair to our State \ncourts, which are treated by this bill as if they cannot be trusted to \nissue fair judgments in cases brought before them. I do not think it is \nfair to State legislatures, which are entitled to have the laws that \nthey pass to protect their citizens interpreted and applied by their \nown courts. This bill is not only misnamed, it is bad policy. It should \nbe defeated.\n  First, let me note that S. 1751 is a different bill than was reported \nby the Judiciary Committee. It includes a new and potentially very \nsignificant provision concerning mass torts. A provision on this topic \nwas in the original bill, but was stricken in committee. Now it is \nback, but with some complicated exceptions. The ramifications of this \nprovision are not apparent on first reading, and it certainly would \nhave been preferable for this kind of fine tuning to have been \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Make no mistake, by loosening the requirements for Federal diversity \njurisdiction over class actions, S. 1751 will result in nearly all \nclass actions being removed to Federal court. This is a radical change \nin our Federal system of justice. We have 50 States in this country \nwith their own laws and courts. State courts are an integral part of \nour system of justice. They have worked well for our entire history. It \nis hard to imagine why this Senate, which includes many ardent \ndefenders of federalism and the prerogatives of State courts and State \nlawmakers, would support such a wholesale stripping of jurisdiction \nfrom the States over class actions. In my opinion, the need for such a \nradical step has not been demonstrated.\n  Yes, there are abuses in some class actions suits. Some of the most \ndisturbing have to do with class action settlements that offer only \ndiscount coupons to the members of the class and a big payoff to the \nplaintiffs' lawyers. But those abuses have occurred in Federal as well \nas State class actions. This bill does nothing to address those \nproblems; it just moves them all to Federal court.\n  I note that a substitute amendment being crafted by the senior \nSenator from Louisiana will include a provision to address discount \ncoupons. It is puzzling to me that such a provision is not contained in \nthe underlying bill. Could it be that these coupon settlements, so \noften held up as the poster child for what is wrong with class actions, \nare actually something that the defendants' bar that is promoting this \nbill wants to preserve? We will find out if the Senate does proceed to \nthe bill and an amendment is offered on that issue.\n  Class actions are an extremely important tool in our justice system. \nThey allow plaintiffs with very small claims to band together to seek \nredress. Lawsuits are expensive. Without the opportunity to pursue a \nclass action, an individual plaintiff often simply cannot not afford \nhis or her day in court. But through a class action, justice can be \ndone and compensation can be obtained.\n  There are three possible outcomes of this bill being enacted. Either \nthe State courts will be deluged with individual claims, since class \nactions can no longer be maintained there, or there will be a huge \nincrease in the workload of the Federal courts, resulting in delays and \nlengthy litigation over procedural issues rather than the substance of \nthe claims, or many injured people will never get redress for their \ninjuries. I don't believe any of these three choices are acceptable.\n  Particularly troubling is the increase in the workload of the Federal \ncourts. These courts are already overloaded. The Congress has led the \nway in bringing more and more litigation to the Federal courts, \nparticularly criminal cases. Criminal cases, of course, take precedence \nin the Federal courts because of the Speedy Trial Act. So the net \nresult of removing virtually all class actions to Federal court will be \nto delay those cases.\n  There is an old saying with which I am sure we are all familiar: \njustice delayed is justice denied. I hope my colleagues will think \nabout that aphorism before voting for this bill. Think about the real \nworld of Federal court litigation and the very real possibilities that \nlong procedural delays in overloaded Federal courts will mean that \nlegitimate claims may not ever be heard. At the very least, we should \nprovide in this bill some priority to class certification motions \nbrought in Federal class actions.\n  One little noticed provision of this bill illustrates the \npossibilities for delay that this bill provides, even to defendants who \nare not entitled to have a case removed to Federal court under the \nbill's relaxed diversity jurisdiction standards. Under current law, if \na Federal court decides that a removed case should be remanded to State \ncourt, that decision is not appealable. The only exception is for civil \nrights cases removed under the special authority of 28 U.S.C. Sec.  \n1443. But this bill allows defendants to immediately appeal a decision \nby a Federal district court that a case does not qualify for removal. \nThat means that a plaintiff class that is entitled even under this bill \nto have a case heard by a State court may still have to endure years of \ndelay while the appeal of a procedural ruling is heard. Where is the \nfairness in that?\n\n[[Page S13006]]\n\n  Some in the business community have expressed concern about resolving \nnationwide class actions, like some of the tobacco litigation, in a \nsingle State court. I can understand why that might seem unfair to \nsome. But this bill does not just address that situation. It also \nprevents a group of plaintiffs who are all from the same State from \npursuing a class action in their own State courts if even one defendant \nis from another State. The proponents of this bill have chosen a remedy \nthat goes far beyond the alleged problem. That raises questions about \nwhat the intent behind this bill really is.\n  It is important to remember that this debate is not about resolving \nquestions of Federal law in the Federal courts. Federal question \njurisdiction already exists for that. Any case involving a Federal \nstatute can be removed to Federal court under current law. This bill \ntakes cases that are brought in State court solely under State laws \npassed by State legislatures and throws them into Federal court. This \nbill is about making it more time consuming and more costly for \ncitizens of a State to get the redress that their elected \nrepresentatives have decided they are entitled to if the laws of their \nState are violated.\n  Diversity jurisdiction in cases between citizens of different States \nhas been with us for our entire history. Article III, section 2 of the \nConstitution provides: ``The judicial Power shall extend . . . to \nControversies between Citizens of different States.'' This is the \nconstitutional basis for giving the Federal courts diversity \njurisdiction over cases that involved only questions of State law.\n  The very first Judiciary Act, passed in 1789, gave the Federal courts \njurisdiction over civil suits between citizens of different States \nwhere over $500 was at issue. In 1806, in the case of Strawbridge v. \nCurtiss, the Supreme Court held that this act required complete \ndiversity between the parties--in all other instances, the Court said, \na case based on State law should be heard by the State courts. So this \nbill changes a nearly 200-year-old practice in this country of \npreserving the Federal courts for cases involving Federal law or where \nno defendant is from the State of any plaintiff in a case involving \nonly State law.\n  Why is such a drastic step necessary? Why do we need to prevent State \ncourts from interpreting and applying their own State laws in cases of \nany size or significance? One argument we hear is that the trial \nlawyers are extracting huge and unjustified settlements in State \ncourts, which has become a drag on the economy. We also hear that \nplaintiffs' lawyers are taking the lion's share of judgments or \nsettlements to the detriment of consumers. But a recent empirical study \ncontradicts these arguments. Theodore Eisenberg of Cornell Law School \nand Geoffrey Miller of NYU Law School recently published the first \nempirical study of class action settlements. Their conclusions, which \nare based on data from 1993-2002, may surprise some of the supporters \nof this bill.\n  First, the study found that attorneys' fees in class action \nsettlements are significantly below the standard 33 percent contingency \nfee charged in personal injury cases. The average class action \nattorney's fee is actually 21.9 percent. In addition, the attorneys' \nfees awarded in class action settlements in Federal court are actually \nhigher than in State court settlements. Attorney fees as a percent of \nclass recovery were found to be between 1 and 6 percentage points \nhigher in Federal court class actions than in State court class \nactions.\n  A final finding of the study is that there has been no appreciable \nincrease in either the amount of settlements or the amount of \nattorneys' fees awarded in class actions over the past 10 years. The \nstudy indicates that there is no crisis here. No explosion of huge \njudgments. No huge fleecing of consumers by their lawyers. This bill is \na solution in search of a problem. It is a great piece of legislation \nfor wrongdoers who would like to put off their day of reckoning by \nmoving cases to courts that are less convenient, slower, and more \nexpensive for those who have been wronged. It is a bad bill for \nconsumers, for State legislatures, and for State courts.\n  Mr. President, if the motion to proceed is adopted, I expect there \nwill be many amendments offered. In an area like this the details \nmatter, and if we are going to have class action reform we need a full \nand fair debate on the details with the opportunity to offer \namendments. But the best result is for the Senate not to consider this \nbill at this time. I do not believe this unfair Class Action Fairness \nAct is ready to be considered on the floor, and I will vote no on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Class Action \nFairness Act of 2003. This legislation first was introduced and \nreported by a Judiciary subcommittee 5 years ago, during the 105th \nCongress. It is time to enact this legislation into law.\n  There is no need to recount the parade of horribles that makes the \nneed for this legislation manifest. Suffice to say that even the \nliberal Washington Post has noted that ``national class actions can be \nfiled just about anywhere and are disproportionately brought in a \nhandful of State courts whose judges get elected with lawyers' money.'' \nAnd as one study has noted, ``[v]irtually every sector of the United \nStates economy is on trial in Madison County [Illinois], Palm Beach \nCounty [Florida], and Jefferson County [Texas].''\n  The problem has grown much worse in recent years. Over the course of \nthe 1990s, class-action filings increased by over 1,300 percent. What \nthis suggests is that class-action litigation has become unhinged from \nactual events. These lawsuits are not being filed because businesses \nare injuring consumers 13 times more frequently than they did at the \nbeginning of the last decade. Rather, these numbers reflect a breakdown \nin the litigation system itself. That system no longer bars frivolous \nsuits that are brought purely for attorneys' own gain.\n  I would like to address several points about this year's bill. First, \nthere has been much argument from the opponents of this bill that its \nsponsors are doing something sneaky by employing rule XIV to bring a \nmodified bill to the floor. The bill that we currently are considering \nincludes a restored, modified version of the original bill's provision \ngoverning mass actions--which provision had been stripped out of the \nbill by a last-minute amendment in the Judiciary Committee. Bill \nopponents seem to suggest that whatever damage was done by that \namendment they secured fair and square, and that bill supporters have \nno business undoing the damage on the Senate floor.\n  It is true that the committee amendment stripping the mass-action \nprovision damaged the bill. The State of Mississippi, among others, \nentertains actions that are class actions in all but name--these suits \ntechnically are not class actions, but they function as their \nequivalent. And as any lawyer who has observed patterns of class-action \nlitigation can tell you, a reform bill that did not apply in \nMississippi would hardly be much of a reform at all.\n  If anything is improper about the way that the mass-action provision \nhas been handled, it is the way that the original provision was \nstripped from the bill in the Judiciary Committee. I know, because I \nwas there when it happened and saw it all. The stripping amendment was \nnot circulated to Judiciary members in advance of the Committee's \nexecutive session--in contravention of the Committee's own self-imposed \nrules governing additional amendments to the bill. Most of us had not \neven had an opportunity to read the amendment. Chairman Hatch already \nhad shown great indulgence toward bill opponents by allowing an \nadditional day's markup of the bill, when he could have insisted on a \nfinal vote earlier. An additional amendment nevertheless was allowed, \nand was adopted once it was clear that it had the support of \nswing voters on the Committee--as well as the support of all Members \nwho are hostile to the bill. The rest of us who support the underlying \nbill were forced to accept the amendment, without an opportunity to \neven learn what it would do.\n\n  By contrast to the way that the original amendment was handled, \neveryone has been afforded ample notice of the modified mass-action \nprovision included in the current bill. This modified provision was \nnegotiated among the bipartisan group of supporters of the original \nbill--including those whose support led to the adoption of\n\n[[Page S13007]]\n\nthe original amendment. When a compromise finally was reached, it was \nannounced during an executive session of the Judiciary Committee and \nreported in the newspapers. And if that was not adequate notice, \nChairman Hatch provided a detailed description of the modified \nprovision in the committee report for this bill, which was published \nlast July. Yet to hear bill opponents tell the story, you would think \nthat the modified proposal had been hidden from all members until this \nbill was introduced. This is simply absurd--a stealth amendment is not \none that is announced months beforehand in a committee report.\n  I would also note today--speaking about the bill more generally--that \nit is hardly a radical reform. As two Democratic cosponsors of the bill \nrecently emphasized in a letter to all Senators, the current bill \n``does not contain any tort reform whatsoever. There are no caps on \ndamages or attorney's fees, no limits on joint and several liability, \nand no new pleading requirements.'' These Senators also point out that \nas a result of a Democratic amendment added to the bill in the \nJudiciary Committee, ``federal jurisdiction does not extend to cases in \nwhich the claims involved less than $5 million or in which two-thirds \nor more of the plaintiffs are from the same state as the defendant.''\n  This last provision substantially dilutes the bill. The plaintiffs' \nlawyers who routinely file these class actions are among the wiliest \nmembers of the profession--I expect that they will have little \ndifficulty structuring their plaintiff class such that more than two-\nthirds of plaintiffs are from the state in which the principal \ndefendants are located and the action is filed. If this loophole is \nexploited to the extent that I fear that it will be, the principal \neffect of today's bill will be not to remove cases to federal court, \nbut rather to keep them in the courts of the state where the defendants \nand most plaintiffs are located. Of course, such a reform would not be \nwithout its advantages. At the very least, those states that tolerate \npredatory class actions in their courts would be forced to bear the \nconsequences of such litigation, because the suits would be directed at \nlocal businesses. This change might yet alleviate the collective-action \nproblems and indulgence of regional prejudice that underlie much of the \ncurrent class-action crisis.\n  Finally, in closing I would remark on the strange new federalism that \nthis bill appears to have evoked in some of its opponents. In a \nstatement of additional views in the committee report for this bill, \nall seven Judiciary Committee members who voted against the bill have \ndenounced it as a violation of the high principle of States' rights. \nThey describe the bill as raising ``serious constitutional issues'' by \n``undermin[ing] James Madison's vision of a Federal government `limited \nto certain enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the \nrepublic.' '' These opponents even invoke the U.S. Supreme Court's \ndecision in United States v. Morrison (2000), which struck down as \nbeyond Congress's power a Federal law regulating violent crime that is \nunrelated to commercial activity. As bill opponents remind us, Morrison \nrequires Congress to respect the distinction between what is truly \nnational and what is truly local.\n  What may strike the casual observer as unusual is that the very \nmembers who invoke Morrison against this bill recently have denounced \nthat very decision--and any judicial nominee suspected of harboring \nviews in line with the Supreme Court majority in that case--in the \ncourse of the judicial-confirmation process. On this very day, the \nJudiciary Committee will hold a hearing for one of the President's \nnominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. I \nwould not be surprised to learn that the same Judiciary Committee \nmembers denouncing this bill on the Senate floor today will then \nproceed down the Capitol elevators, take the shuttle to the large \nJudiciary hearing room, and denounce the President's nominee as a \nsecret supporter of United States v. Morrison.\n  To conclude, I would simply note that it is beyond argument that the \ninterstate commerce clause and Article III's authorization for \ndiversity jurisdiction were included in the Constitution in order to \nempower Congress to protect both interstate commerce and out-of-State \ndefendants from local prejudice. Nothing could be a more appropriate \napplication of these congressional powers than the legislation that we \nare considering today. Yet to listen to this bill's opponents, one \nmight come away with the impression that the interstate commerce clause \nwas designed to allow Congress to regulate all violent crime, and any \nother subject that touches Congress's fancy and that happens to poll \nwell--any subject, that is, except for interstate commerce. The \nopponents of this bill can play at either John Paul Stevens or John \nCalhoun. They cannot play at both--or at the very least, they ought not \ndo so on the same day.\n  I look forward to Congress's enactment of the important legislation \nbefore us today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana has made an \neloquent plea for class action reform. Unless we have cloture, there \nwill be no class action reform anytime in the near future. We know the \nSenate has a very busy calendar of conference committees working on an \nEnergy bill, on Medicare, prescription drug reform, and many other \nissues. The time is ripe, and I suggest to my colleagues the time for \nreform is now.\n  Finally, this is not a matter of lawyer bashing. This is about jobs. \nThis is about added cost to consumers. When frivolous litigation is \nfiled which, in essence, once a class action is certified becomes legal \nblackmail because class action lawsuits are rarely, if ever, tried with \na jury because the risks are so enormous, it literally becomes a ``bet \nthe ranch'' or I should say ``bet the company'' lawsuit. So what \nhappens is they are almost always settled but under unequal terms and \nreally amount to, in too many instances, legal coercion. But what \nhappens is, when that money is paid, that cost is not necessarily \nabsorbed by that company, that job creator, but is passed on to \nconsumers; and consumers pay and, ultimately, job loss occurs.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who believe we need to \naddress this tremendous problem, we need to address job loss, we need \nto address consumer cost, we need to address this abuse, to vote for \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am clearly disappointed we have been \ndenied the opportunity to proceed to this very important legislation, a \nbill we very much want to discuss, to debate, and to appropriately \namend. It is important to the American people. Thus, I believe we just \nwitnessed a missed opportunity to address a critically and vitally \nimportant issue.\n  With that, for my colleagues, let me say we are making some progress \non other issues in terms of how the afternoon will be spent. We are in \ndiscussion with regard to the antispam legislation, and I believe we \nwill be able to proceed with that early this afternoon.\n  Again, let me state my disappointment. We are very committed to \naddressing this particular issue for the American people, and we will \nbe trying, once again, to pull together and do what the American people \ndeserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the message in this vote is that now is \nthe time for us to sit down and negotiate. I have said on several \noccasions, as late as this morning, that we are prepared to work with \nthe majority. I will certainly work with the majority leader to bring \nto the floor a bill that will enjoy much broader support than 59 votes. \nWe can do that. We recognize the need for reform, but we also recognize \nwe have to do it right. I would like to start this afternoon. I will do \nit tomorrow. I will do it whenever the majority is prepared to do it, \nbut we are prepared to do it, and I look forward to further discussions \non this issue in the days ahead.\n  After that, I hope we can move to other issues that divide us. I \nthink there is an opportunity on asbestos as well, but it takes real \nnegotiation. I am prepared to enter into those negotiations anytime the \nmajority is prepared to do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, you just heard a willingness to work \ntogether. There were 59 Members who spoke just a few moments ago who \nsaid, Let's proceed and do it right now on the floor of the Senate. We \nwere one vote short. I accept that. I think we do need to proceed \ndirectly to address this issue, and we will work in good faith to do \njust that.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I think we are very close on the antispam \nlegislation that we talked about yesterday and today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13008-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I want to express my disappointment about \nthe outcome of the last vote. I voted not to invoke cloture. I did so \nwith great reluctance. A number of Members called me over the last \nseveral days about the class action reform bill that was before us. I \nappreciate very much the comments of both the majority leader and the \nminority leader, my good friend from Delaware, Tom Carper, Herb Kohl, \nand others who have worked very hard on this legislation. I have great \nrespect for what they have tried to do.\n  I hope the majority leader will take up the offer of the Democratic \nleader and so we come together and work out what the provisions of this \nbill ought to be, at least the main provisions of it, and move forward. \nI am deeply committed to class action reform, but I do not want to move \nforward under a process where I am being told merely that I have a \nright to bring up amendments. I have that right anyway.\n  It seems to me if we are going to try to put a bill like this \ntogether, it takes meaningful cooperation, it takes sitting down. It is \nhard work. We have done it in the past. As the author of the securities \nlitigation reform bill, the uniform standards legislation, terrorism \ninsurance, the Y2K bill--all matters that brought together the trial \nbar and the business community trying to sort it out--I know that this \ncan be done. It took a lot of work and a lot of hours to do it in the \npast. I strongly recommend on class action reform, that we make the \nsame sort of effort.\n  It is not that difficult to get a good bill, but it does take work. \nAgain, it takes meaningful cooperation. We need to have that if we are \ngoing to succeed.\n  I am terribly disappointed, but I must say to those who argued for \ncloture that there is a way of achieving the right results and the \nprocess we just went through this is not the way to go, in my view.\n  I can say, without invoking the names of my colleagues, there are a \nnumber of us who voted no on cloture who believe as strongly as I do \nabout the need for reform and who would like to see a bill passed. So \nthe majority leader and his staff, the staff of the Judiciary Committee \nand other interested parties--and there are not that many--if they can \nput something together, we can move forward. We could have another \ncloture vote, if we need to have one, although I doubt we will need \none, with a more cooperative process there would be no need for one. I \nbelieve we can and should go forward.\n\n  The challenge is whether or not they want to do that. If they just \nwant to have a 59-to-39 vote and move on to another issue, then that \nmay indicate to some of us what the real intentions were here. If they \nare interested in getting this bill done, then there is a way to do it.\n  There are those of us who are willing to roll up our sleeves and get \nit done. In fact, many of the same people have been involved for months \nnow in the asbestos legislation. I have an uneasy feeling we are \nheading in the same direction with that bill. It takes hard work. \nMembers from both sides have to sit down, bring people together, and \nput in the hours it takes to finish the job.\n\n[[Page S13009]]\n\n  If we allow this to sort of wander along without dealing with the \nintricacies and the complicated questions involved, then one can almost \npredict with certainty what is going to happen at the end of the day. \nSo the offer is there. I make it to my friends and colleagues on this \nside of the aisle and the other. I am prepared to be a part of those \nefforts, if they find it fruitful and worthwhile, or to sit on the \nsidelines and watch it happen and be supportive of whatever they are \nable to produce.\n  Let's move forward and get this done. The American people deserve \nbetter. We are not working together as often as we should on critical \nquestions. If we do not do it, then we do a great disservice to the \nAmerican public.\n  So I hope the leaders would take up the offers that have been made, \nsit down and see if we cannot pull this bill together. For those who \nare interested, we ought to be prepared to start that process today--\nthis afternoon--if people are so willing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask for 2 minutes of personal \nprivilege to add a few remarks to the Record. I, too, remain firmly \ncommitted to class action reform and have stated so publicly many times \nand will continue to state publicly that intention.\n  There are two or three reasons I could not vote to move to debate on \nthis bill because there were not clear indications given that certain \nlanguage in this underlying bill would be removed.\n  I understand the legislative process. I am clear about the \nlegislative process, but I am also clear about the way that \narrangements can be made in this Chamber, arrangements with this White \nHouse and the House so that we can come out with a bill that is fair to \nthe American public, that helps us to increase jobs, to remove the \nforum shopping, and to eliminate the abuses that are in this system, \nwithout undermining people's rights to get their day in court.\n  So as one of the votes that obviously could have made a difference in \nthe outcome today, I most certainly remain open. The language, however, \nregarding mass torts must be removed. The coupon settlement language \nmust be addressed. The jurisdictional question somewhere between the \nFeinstein and Breaux language would be acceptable, and the bounty \nprovisions, which are very important to civil rights legislation, must \nbe addressed.\n  These are four issues that I am going to be discussing, and if the \nside that is for reform is really interested in real reform and not \njust a political issue, these discussions can be had with this Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will speak briefly about this issue \nas well. I think as we bring this up, it is important, if we can, to \nmove this forward and get it resolved. One of the things we need to be \nconstantly focusing on is what can we do to grow jobs and create jobs.\n  We have been pressing forward. The Federal Reserve has been pressing \nforward, keeping interest rates low. We have been pressing forward in \ncutting taxes to try to stimulate. The early medicine seems to be \nworking. We are starting to get some economic growth. We are starting \nto get some job creation taking place.\n  Another clear area of importance and need is this area of litigation \nreform. This is sapping a great deal of strength out of the economy and \nsapping strength from job creation. This is one of the areas we need to \nreform. I think there are ways that we can do this and still protect \nthe rights of the individual, rights of those who are harmed in the \nsystem, but we are going to have to start to address this problem if we \nare going to be serious about job creation in the country and serious \nabout what all we can do as a legislative body in creating an \natmosphere and situation in the United States that can be the most \ngrowth oriented, and in a way that still protects all the rights of \nindividuals in this country.\n  Those are the efforts that are taking place. That is what we are \ntrying to do with this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13009-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13009-S13010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NOBEL PEACE PRIZE TO SHIRIN EBADI OF IRAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to draw the attention of my \ncolleagues to a topic that is of significant importance in the world.\n  On October 10, the Nobel Peace Prize, the peace prize that was \ngranted to the Dalai Lama in the past, to Martin Luther King, Jr., and \nto Nelson Mandela, was granted to Shirin Ebadi, not a household name. \nThis lady is a prominent human rights activist in Iran. She was awarded \nthe 2003 Nobel Peace Prize.\n  I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to her because Iran is \none of those countries that is a state sponsor of terrorism. They are \nas a country on the very low end of recognition of human rights. The \nruling clerics do not let participation in the society take place.\n  She has been fighting for the rights of students and activists to \npeacefully meet and speak out. She has done it from inside Iran. For \nthat, she has paid for it in jail time and in harassment. She should \nnow receive a reward from us in recognition.\n  Naturally, the regime in Tehran did not kindly meet upon her \nrecognition as a Nobel Peace Prize winner. The regime actually went on \nto say there are other Nobel Prizes that are more important, like \nliterature. I looked at that and I thought how would one deny their own \ncountryman the peace prize, the highest of these? They are saying there \nis something else that is higher. But it is because she has been going \nat this regime that is illegitimate and does not recognize the people.\n  I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Ms. Ebadi and to the \nIranian people for their continued struggle for freedom, for democracy, \nand for human rights, against the clerics who have stripped them of \nevery ounce of human dignity.\n  The Economist described Ms. Ebadi as this: Assertive, severe, and \nfrighteningly well versed in Islamic and Western law, characteristics \nthat challenge the status quo of Iran and the religious ruling clique.\n  Since being barred from serving as a judge, Ms. Ebadi has fought for \nthe rights of homeless children under the repressive regime which \ntreats the children like common criminals. In addition, she has spent \nthe last 4 years investigating the attacks on student protestors by \nIranian security forces during the massive July 9, 1999, protest. Ezzat \nEbrahim-Nejad was one of those protesters killed during the 1999 \nprotest. Ms. Ebadi represented his family in tracking down the thugs \nwho attacked the students and their paymasters within the Ayatollah's \nregime. Her devotion to this case and many others landed her a 15-month \njail sentence.\n\n  This year Ms. Ebadi established a nonprofit organization, a legal \ndefense center for the families of Iranian dissidents and activists. \nThis is challenging work that all Iranians can celebrate, and I am \nconfident she will use the prestige that comes with the award of the \nNobel Peace Prize to continue the struggle in Iran.\n  There are dissidents in Iran who I think deserve highlighting, who \nare being held without reason. Hassan Zarezadeh, a 25-year-old student, \nis one. He is being held because of participation in a July 9, 1999, \nprotest. He has been in prison since July 6, 2003, in preparation of \nthe anniversary recognition of that protest. There are reports he is \nenduring torture during his detention.\n  Dr. Farzad Hamidi disappeared on June 18, 2003, in Tehran, barely 1 \nyear after being released from jail. His whereabouts is unknown, but \nfriends and family believe his disappearance is connected to his role \nin the student protest.\n  Shirin Ebadi's struggles continue for these and many other \nindividuals and activists inside Iran, and dissidents--and all they \nwant to do is be able to peacefully meet and to be able to communicate \ntheir message to people within Iran. All they are getting for that is \njail, harassment, and, unfortunately, death.\n  Systematic change is needed to take place. A number of people are \ncalling for that inside Iran. The student protesters and others are \ncalling for an internationally monitored referendum on the Government \nin Iran. That is, indeed, what should take place.\n  I wanted to draw Shirin Ebadi's name and her recognition and her \naward to\n\n[[Page S13010]]\n\nthe notice of my colleagues. This is an important step in the \nrecognition and movement toward human rights in Iran. We need to \ncelebrate it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13010-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to echo some comments made by my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, on the issue of class action \nreform.\n  I believe that we need to do a class action reform bill. Some of us \nwho voted against cloture this afternoon believe that there have been \nabuses in the area of class action litigation, and that reform is \nneeded.\n  But class action reform has to be sensible and thoughtful, and it \nneeds to be resolved through negotiation. I am hopeful that this will \nbe accomplished. The minority leader indicated he is willing to \nnegotiate. The majority leader indicated he is willing to negotiate on \nthese issues. It is my hope that these negotiations will be fruitful.\n  There is no question that there have been instances of abusive forum \nshopping. There are cases being filed in state court in places like \nMadison County, Illinois, where there are thousands of plaintiffs, but \nonly a handful are from that area. It's pretty clear to me that cases \nlike that, when brought on behalf of nationwide classes, should be \nheard in federal court.\n  I have a long list of such cases here, which on their face involve \nabuses of the class action mechanism. I think I shall not go through \nthem all today. Suffice it to say that forum shopping is a problem, and \nwe need reforms in this area.\n  I also believe that there is a problem with coupon settlements. It \nmakes no sense to have settlements where plaintiffs get meaningless \ncoupons that are never redeemed. That, too, in my judgment, can and \nshould be changed.\n  I have decided to cosponsor the class action reform proposal \ndescribed by Senator John Breaux, because I think it takes care of the \nproblems of forum shopping and also coupon settlements. I think it is \nsuperior to the bill that was the subject of today's cloture vote, \nbecause it will more effectively address the issues of coupon \nsettlements and forum shopping.\n  With respect to coupon settlements, the Breaux bill is much tougher \nthan the Grassley-Hatch bill, which was the subject of today's cloture \nvote. The Grassley-Hatch bill simply says that the courts should review \ncoupon settlements for fairness. By contrast, the proposal that is \noffered by Senator Breaux, that I am cosponsoring, actually ties legal \nfees to the rates at which coupons are actually redeemed. So in a case \nwhere plaintiffs get meaningless coupons, the lawyers get paid \naccordingly. That is a much preferable provision, in my judgment, in \nreforming the class action area.\n  With respect to forum shopping, let me again point out that the \nproposal offered by my colleague, Senator Breaux, is preferable. It \nsays if fewer than one-third of the plaintiffs are in a State, then it \ngoes to Federal court. If more than two-thirds are in a State, it goes \nto State court. If it is in between the two, the Federal court shall \nmake a judgment of where it is most appropriate.\n  The bill that was proposed to be brought to the floor today would \nhave a very different mechanism. It would say that you could not bring \na case in state court unless the defendant was a citizen of that state. \nSo, for example, if 1,000 citizens of my State of North Dakota were \ncheated by a company in Houston, TX, they could not form a class and \nfile an action in North Dakota under North Dakota law. They simply \ncould not do that under the bill brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  That is not fair. That doesn't make any sense.\n  Now, I understand that forum shopping is a problem and we ought to \ndeal with it. But there is a right way and a wrong way to deal with it. \nI think the Breaux approach is the right way. It is a thoughtful, \nbalanced approach. It allows us to stop class action abuses, while at \nthe same time preserving the rights of people to be able to access \ntheir own State courts in legitimate cases.\n  Again, I think it makes no sense to say to North Dakotans, it does \nnot matter if there are two thousand of you who have been injured by an \nout-of-state company, you cannot access North Dakota State Courts and \nyou cannot have the protection of North Dakota state law. Yet that is \nprecisely what the bill that was the subject of today's vote would \nhave said.\n\n  The proposal offered by my colleague, Senator Breaux, strikes the \nright balance. It is the right approach. Cases that involve a lot of \nplaintiffs from around the country would go to federal court. But \ncitizens of a particular state would still be able to band together if \nthey were injured by an out-of-state defendant, and bring a lawsuit in \ntheir own state court.\n  I say to the majority leader, if you are interested in class action \nreform, then let's work out a solution to the very real problem of \nclass action abuses--but let's do it without depriving the people of \nany one state of the right to access their state's court, in legitimate \ncases. I think we can strike that proper balance, and I hope we can do \nit soon. That is the reason I voted against the motion to proceed.\n  What we should avoid is a process in which the majority simply says: \nHere's where the wagon is heading. If you like it, jump on. If you \ndon't like it, tough luck. Don't give us any advice along the way.\n  I am a conferee on the Energy bill, but I have not been invited to a \nconference. No Democrat in the Senate has been included in a conference \non the Energy bill. In fact, we have been specifically excluded and \nprevented from being a part of the conference. If that is the way \nlegislation will be handled in the Congress, it will pervert the \nlegislative process. In the case of the Energy Conference, nearly one-\nhalf of the Senate, 49 Members of a body of 100 persons, are being \ngiven no voice at the conference. We are told that the majority will \nmake all the decisions.\n  We are told by the majority: Just let us bring the Energy bill to the \nfloor and we will be fair. Just take our word for it.\n  Well, I hope and trust that we will follow a different path on the \nissue of class action reform. The Breaux proposal is a good one. I \nsuggest we begin now seriously negotiating a balanced, responsible \nsolution, that takes care of the problem of class action abuses.\n  Let me also say parenthetically that there is another issue, in \naddition to class action reform, that requires meaningful negotiations. \nThat is the issue of asbestos litigation. That, too, is a real problem \nand we ought to deal with it. It, too, in my judgment, will require \nnegotiation. All sides are going to have to want to do this and be \nwilling to negotiate aggressively. You have a series of stakeholders \ninvolved and those stakeholders, in my judgment, need to get together, \nbecause the system is broken. We have people who are sick and dying who \nare not getting help. And we have a huge cloud of uncertainty hanging \nover the business community.\n  A solution is going to require, in my judgment, that all the \nstakeholders be part of the negotiation. Yes, labor is a very \nsignificant part of that. So, too, is the business community and \nothers.\n  I know this is a complex issue, but I hope in the concluding days of \nthis first session of the Congress we will see a breakthrough in \nnegotiations, and solve this asbestos issue in a way that works for \neveryone.\n  I think they have been close on a number of occasions. My hope is it \nfinally is completed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13010-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13010-S13011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE 9/11 COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the 9/11 Commission. \nThat is the commission which has been put together by Federal law and \nasked to look into what happened on 9/11 and get all of the information \nfrom everybody to find out what happened leading up to the attack on \nthis country. What did we know? What did the CIA know? What did the FBI \nknow? What did the FAA do during the attack? What happened? Only by \nknowing what happened can we prevent it from happening again. Were \nthere dots that should have been connected but weren't? Did we have \ninformation that could have perhaps prevented that attack had certain \npeople known of it or had been told of it? Are there deficiencies in \nsome of these agencies? Did people drop the ball?\n  I do not know. But we put together a panel headed by former Governor\n\n[[Page S13011]]\n\nKeane of New Jersey. It is a distinguished panel. One of our former \ncolleagues, Senator Cleland, is on that panel. It is called the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  I want to read a couple of statements. This statement was made \nOctober 10:\n\n       In connection with the commission's second interim report \n     issued on September 23, 2003, we discuss the commission's \n     ongoing effort to get prompt access to some key executive \n     branch and White House documents that the commission needs to \n     complete its work on time. Although we can report substantial \n     progress, the commission is continuing to press for necessary \n     access to some key items.\n\n  I don't understand why there would be problems in getting information \nfrom the CIA, or the FBI, or the White House, or the FAA. What on Earth \nis happening?\n  This is the Federal inquiry into what happened on 9/11 and how we can \nprevent it from ever happening again. I would think every Federal \nagency would cooperate fully and immediately. But that, regrettably, \nhas not been the case. October 15, a statement by the 9/11 Commission:\n\n       Over the past two weeks, as a result of field interviews \n     conducted by our staff, the commission learned of serious \n     deficiencies in one agency's production of critical \n     documents.\n\n  The agency in question happens to be the FAA. Now they indicate they \nare issuing subpoenas. In fact, they say this disturbing development at \none agency has led the commission to reexamine its general policy of \nrelying on document requests rather than subpoenas. They have voted to \nissue a subpoena to the FAA for documents which have already been \nrequested.\n  I don't understand. We have a 9/11 Commission to investigate the \ntragedy that occurred as a result of the terrorist attack on this \ncountry. That commission has to issue subpoenas to Federal agencies to \nget cooperation. I would think every single Federal agency, starting \nwith the White House, would open its records immediately to this \ncommission so we can understand what happened.\n  I am not accusing anybody of anything, nor is the 9/11 Commission. We \nwant to understand what happened. How did it happen? What clues might \nwe have had? What kind of failing existed with respect to our \nintelligence that prevented us from knowing and, therefore, preventing \nthese terrorist attacks? When I read this, I shake my head and think it \nis unbelievable that a commission created by this Congress, called the \n9/11 Commission, to get to the bottom of what happened on 9/11, has to \nissue subpoenas to anybody, or has to send out progress reports to say, \nWell, we have made progress now in our efforts to gain access to key \nWhite House documents. The White House has agreed to brief all \ncommissioners on another set of highly sensitive documents. We will \nseek prompt resolution of the remaining issues regarding access of \nthese documents.\n  Why is there a problem? Why would not every agency in every part of \nthis Government provide this information at will and upon the request \nof the 9/11 Commission?\n  I hope we don't see these kinds of reports again. I hope the next \nreport from this commission would tell us the President has requested \nevery single agency to turn over every single document requested by the \n9/11 Commission immediately. Let this commission do its work and finish \nits work, make a report to the Congress and to the American people \nabout what happened on 9/11, about what information existed leading up \nto 9/11, and how we can learn from that to protect this country against \nfuture terrorist attacks.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we have just concluded what for many of us \nwas a tough vote. I simply want to express my thanks to the 58 other \nDemocrats and Republicans who joined me--59 in all--in voting for the \nmotion to proceed and to take up for debate and amendment legislation \nthat would reform the way we handle class action lawsuits in this \ncountry.\n  I am disappointed with the vote, that we fell one vote short, but I \nam encouraged by some of the conversation that took place immediately \nfollowing the vote by the leaders of both sides and a number of my \ncolleagues, including Senator Dodd and Senator Landrieu.\n  I sense there is a genuine willingness on the part of Democrats and \nRepublicans and that one Independent not to give up on this issue. It \nis one that we need to address and we can address satisfactorily. My \nown belief is it is one we can address this year.\n  I have talked to any number of Senators on our side of the aisle who \nare prepared to offer what I think are constructive perfecting \namendments that would make a good bill much better.\n  I hope what we will do in the days ahead is to reach across the \naisle--Republicans to Democrats and Democrats to Republicans--to find a \ncommon ground that I think will exist with respect to many of these \namendments and to then move forward together and, hopefully, to get to \nthe end of the day when we can vote on a bill and not have to worry \nabout the kind of partisan divide that in some cases characterized this \nvote and, frankly, characterizes too many votes we cast here.\n  I was approached by one of my colleagues following the vote who asked \nif we lost the war. I said: No, no, maybe today the battle was lost but \nnot the war. There is a realization that the way we handle class action \nlitigation in this country is broken. It can be fixed.\n  As we like to say in Delaware, ``If it isn't perfect, make it \nbetter.'' This bill that came out of committee is not perfect. It can \nbe made better. That is what we are going to do.\n  I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There is a right of free speech on the Internet.\n       [(2) The Internet has increasingly become a critical mode \n     of global communication and now presents unprecedented \n     opportunities for the development and growth of global \n     commerce and an integrated worldwide economy.\n       [(3) In order for global commerce on the Internet to reach \n     its full potential, individuals and entities using the \n     Internet and other online services should be prevented from \n     engaging in activities that prevent other users and Internet \n     service providers from having a reasonably predictable, \n     efficient, and economical online experience.\n       [(4) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail can be a \n     mechanism through which businesses advertise and attract \n     customers in the online environment.\n       [(5) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept \n     such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, \n     or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding \n     such mail, or for both.\n       [(6) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail may impose \n     significant monetary costs on providers of Internet access \n     services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit \n     institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a \n     finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and \n     institutions can handle without further investment in \n     infrastructure.\n       [(7) Some unsolicited commercial electronic mail contains \n     material that many recipients may consider vulgar or \n     pornographic in nature.\n       [(8) While some senders of unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail messages provide simple and reliable ways for \n     recipients to reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail from such senders in \n     the future, other senders provide no such ``opt-out'' \n     mechanism, or refuse to honor the requests of recipients not \n     to receive electronic mail from such senders in the future, \n     or both.\n       [(9) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail purposefully disguise the source \n     of such mail so as to prevent recipients from responding to \n     such mail quickly and easily.\n       [(10) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail purposefully include misleading \n     information in the message's subject lines in order to induce \n     the recipients to view the messages.\n       [(11) In legislating against certain abuses on the \n     Internet, Congress should be very careful to avoid infringing \n     in any way upon constitutionally protected rights, including \n     the rights of assembly, free speech, and privacy.\n       [(b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the \n     basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress \n     determines that--\n       [(1) there is a substantial government interest in \n     regulation of unsolicited commercial electronic mail;\n       [(2) senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of \n     such mail; and\n       [(3) recipients of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     have a right to decline to receive additional unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from the same source.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Controlling the Assault of \n     Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003'', or the \n     ``CAN-SPAM Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Electronic mail has become an extremely important and \n     popular means of communication, relied on by millions of \n     Americans on a daily basis for personal and commercial \n     purposes. Its low cost and global reach make it extremely \n     convenient and efficient, and offer unique opportunities for \n     the development and growth of frictionless commerce.\n       (2) The convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are \n     threatened by the extremely rapid growth in the volume of \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail. Unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail is currently estimated to account \n     for over 45 percent of all electronic mail traffic, up from \n     an estimated 7 percent in 2001, and the volume continues to \n     rise. Most of these unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     messages are fraudulent or deceptive in one or more respects.\n       (3) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept \n     such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, \n     or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding \n     such mail, or for both.\n       (4) The receipt of a large number of unsolicited messages \n     also decreases the convenience of electronic mail and creates \n     a risk that wanted electronic mail messages, both commercial \n     and noncommercial, will be lost, overlooked, or discarded \n     amidst the larger volume of unwanted messages, thus reducing \n     the reliability and usefulness of electronic mail to the \n     recipient.\n       (5) Some unsolicited commercial electronic mail contains \n     material that many recipients may consider vulgar or \n     pornographic in nature.\n       (6) The growth in unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     imposes significant monetary costs on providers of Internet \n     access services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit \n     institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a \n     finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and \n     institutions can handle without further investment in \n     infrastructure.\n       (7) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     purposefully disguise the source of such mail.\n       (8) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     purposefully include misleading information in the message's \n     subject lines in order to induce the recipients to view the \n     messages.\n       (9) While some senders of unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail messages provide simple and reliable ways for recipients \n     to reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from such senders in the future, \n     other senders provide no such ``opt-out'' mechanism, or \n     refuse to honor the requests of recipients not to receive \n     electronic mail from such senders in the future, or both.\n       (10) Many senders of bulk unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail use computer programs to gather large numbers of \n     electronic mail addresses on an automated basis from Internet \n     websites or online services where users must post their \n     addresses in order to make full use of the website or \n     service.\n       (11) Many States have enacted legislation intended to \n     regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail, \n     but these statutes impose different standards and \n     requirements. As a result, they do not appear to have been \n     successful in addressing the problems associated with \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail, in part because, \n     since an electronic mail address does not specify a \n     geographic location, it can be extremely difficult for law-\n     abiding businesses to know with which of these disparate \n     statutes they are required to comply.\n       (12) The problems associated with the rapid growth and \n     abuse of unsolicited commercial electronic mail cannot be \n     solved by Federal legislation alone. The development and \n     adoption of technological approaches and the pursuit of \n     cooperative efforts with other countries will be necessary as \n     well.\n       (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the \n     basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress \n     determines that--\n       (1) there is a substantial government interest in \n     regulation of unsolicited commercial electronic mail on a \n     nationwide basis;\n       (2) senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of \n     such mail; and\n       (3) recipients of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     have a right to decline to receive additional unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from the same source.\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (ii) the recipient was, at the time of such transaction or \n     thereafter in the first electronic mail message received from \n     the sender after the effective date of this Act, provided a \n     clear and conspicuous notice of an opportunity not to receive \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail messages from the \n     sender and has not exercised such opportunity.\n       (B) Mere visitation.--A visit by a recipient to a publicly \n     available website shall not be treated as a transaction for \n     purposes of subparagraph (A)(i) if the recipient did not \n     knowingly submit the recipient's electronic mail address to \n     the operator of the website.\n       (C) Separate lines of business or divisions.--If a sender \n     operates through separate lines of business or divisions and \n     holds itself out to the recipient, both at the time of the \n     transaction described in subparagraph (A)(i) and at the time \n     the notice under subparagraph (A)(ii) was provided to the \n     recipient, as that particular line of business or division \n     rather than as the entity of which such line of business or \n     division is a part, then the line of business or the division \n     shall be treated as the sender for purposes of this \n     paragraph.\n       (10) Initiate.--The term ``initiate'', when used with \n     respect to a commercial electronic mail message, means to \n     originate or transmit such message or to procure the \n     origination or transmission of such message, but shall not \n     include actions that constitute routine conveyance of such \n     message.

The Federal \n     Trade Commission or appropriate Federal regulator shall have \n     the right--\n       (A) to intervene in the action;\n       (B) upon so intervening, to be heard on all matters arising \n     therein;\n       (C) to remove the action to the appropriate United States \n     district court; and\n       (D) to file petitions for appeal.\n       (5) Construction.--For purposes of bringing any civil \n     action under paragraph (1), nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to prevent an attorney general of a State from \n     exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general by \n     the laws of that State to--\n       (A) conduct investigations;\n       (B) administer oaths or affirmations; or\n       (C) compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     documentary and other evidence.\n       (6) Venue; service of process.--\n       (A) Venue.--Any action brought under paragraph (1) may be \n     brought in the district court of the United States that meets \n     applicable requirements relating to venue under section 1391 \n     of title 28, United States Code.\n       (B) Service of process.--In an action brought under \n     paragraph (1), process may be served in any district in which \n     the defendant--\n       (i) is an inhabitant; or\n       (ii) maintains a physical place of business.\n       (7) Limitation on state action while federal action is \n     pending.--If the Commission or other appropriate Federal \n     agency under subsection (b) has instituted a civil action or \n     an administrative action for violation of this Act, no \n     State attorney general may bring an action under this \n     subsection during the pendency of that action against any \n     defendant named in the complaint of the Commission or the \n     other agency for any violation of this Act alleged in the \n     complaint.\n       (f) Action by Provider of Internet Access Service.--\n       (1) Action authorized.--A provider of Internet access \n     service adversely affected by a violation of section 5 may \n     bring a civil action in any district court of the United \n     States with jurisdiction over the defendant, or in any other \n     court of competent jurisdiction, to--\n       (A) enjoin further violation by the defendant; or\n       (B) recover damages in an amount equal to the greater of--\n       (i) actual monetary loss incurred by the provider of \n     Internet access service as a result of such violation; or\n       (ii) the amount determined under paragraph (2).\n       (2) Statutory damages.--\n       (A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the \n     amount determined under this paragraph is the amount \n     calculated by multiplying the number of violations (with each \n     separately addressed unlawful message that is transmitted or \n     attempted to be transmitted over the facilities of the \n     provider of Internet access service, or that is transmitted \n     or attempted to be transmitted to an electronic mail address \n     obtained from the provider of Internet access service in \n     violation of section 5(b)(1)(A)(i), treated as a separate \n     violation) by--\n       (i) up to $100, in the case of a violation of section \n     5(a)(1); or\n       (ii) $25, in the case of any other violation of section 5.\n       (B) Limitation.--For any violation of section 5 (other than \n     section 5(a)(1)), the amount determined under subparagraph \n     (A) may not exceed $1,000,000.\n       (C) Aggravated damages.--The court may increase a damage \n     award to an amount equal to not more than three times the \n     amount otherwise available under this paragraph if--\n       (i) the court determines that the defendant committed the \n     violation willfully and knowingly; or\n       (ii) the defendant's unlawful activity included one or more \n     of the aggravated violations set forth in section 5(b).\n       (3) Attorney fees.--In any action brought pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), the court may, in its discretion, require an \n     undertaking for the payment of the costs of such action, and \n     assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' \n     fees, against any party.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) Federal Law.--\n       (1) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to impair the \n     enforcement of section 223 or 231 of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 223 or 231, respectively), chapter 71 \n     (relating to obscenity) or 110 (relating to sexual \n     exploitation of children) of title 18, United States Code, or \n     any other Federal criminal statute.\n       (2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect in any \n     way the Commission's authority to bring enforcement actions \n     under FTC Act for materially false or deceptive \n     representations or unfair practices in commercial electronic \n     mail messages.\n       (b) State Law.--\n       (1) In general.--This Act supersedes any statute, \n     regulation, or rule of a State or political subdivision of a \n     State that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to \n     send commercial messages, except for any such statute, \n     regulation, or rule that prohibits falsity or deception in \n     any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or \n     information attached thereto.\n       (2) State law not specific to electronic mail.--This Act \n     shall not be construed to preempt the applicability of State \n     laws that are not specific to electronic mail, including \n     State trespass, contract, or tort law, and State laws \n     relating to acts of fraud or computer crime.\n       (c) No Effect on Policies of Providers of Internet Access \n     Service.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to have any \n     effect on the lawfulness or unlawfulness, under any other \n     provision of law, of the adoption, implementation, or \n     enforcement by a provider of Internet access service of a \n     policy of declining to transmit, route, relay, handle, or \n     store certain types of electronic mail messages.\n\n     SEC. 9. RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING DO-NOT-EMAIL REGISTRY.\n\n       Not later than 6 months after the Federal Trade Commission \n     has completed implementation of its national telemarketing \n     Do-Not-Call list, the Commission shall transmit to the \n     Congress recommendations for a workable plan and timetable \n     for creating a nationwide marketing Do-Not-Email list modeled \n     on the Do-Not-Call list, or an explanation of any practical, \n     technical, security, or privacy-related issues that cause the \n     Commission to recommend against creating such a list.\n\n     SEC. 10. STUDY OF EFFECTS OF UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL \n                   ELECTRONIC MAIL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 24 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the\n\n[[Page S13019]]\n\n     Commission, in consultation with the Department of Justice \n     and other appropriate agencies, shall submit a report to the \n     Congress that provides a detailed analysis of the \n     effectiveness and enforcement of the provisions of this Act \n     and the need (if any) for the Congress to modify such \n     provisions.\n       (b) Required Analysis.--The Commission shall include in the \n     report required by subsection (a)--\n       (1) an analysis of the extent to which technological and \n     marketplace developments, including changes in the nature of \n     the devices through which consumers access their electronic \n     mail messages, may affect the practicality and effectiveness \n     of the provisions of this Act;\n       (2) analysis and recommendations concerning how to address \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail that originates in or \n     is transmitted through or to facilities or computers in other \n     nations, including initiatives or policy positions that the \n     Federal government could pursue through international \n     negotiations, fora, organizations, or institutions; and\n       (3) analysis and recommendations concerning options for \n     protecting consumers, including children, from the receipt \n     and viewing of unsolicited commercial electronic mail that is \n     obscene or pornographic.\n\n     SEC. 11 SEPARABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to \n     any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of \n     this Act and the application of such provision to other \n     persons or circumstances shall not be affected.\n\n     SEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this Act shall take effect 120 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this bill was introduced in April by \nSenators Burns and Wyden, and the substitute version was approved by \nthe Senate Commerce Committee on June 19.\n  Also, we have had intensive negotiations with the Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Schumer, who is now on the floor, concerning a ``do not \nspam'' aspect of this legislation.\n  First of all, I wish to thank, of course, Senator Hollings, the \nranking member of the committee, for all of his effort, but I \nparticularly acknowledge my two colleagues who are on the floor, \nSenators Burns and Wyden. Around here, we have a tendency to take \ncredit for a lot of things that may not necessarily be true, although I \nam not sure that is true in my case, but the fact is, Senator Burns and \nSenator Wyden have worked for, I believe, 3 years on this issue. It is \ncomplex. It is difficult. It has a lot to do with technology. The \nissues are very technical in nature in some respects. They have \nresponded to what I think is a major concern of every young American \nand every American who uses a computer, and that is this issue of \nunwanted spam.\n  I again tell my colleagues that without the efforts Senator Burns and \nSenator Wyden have made on this bill, we would not be here today, and I \nam very grateful for their participation.\n  I believe the ranking member, Senator Hollings, wishes to make an \nopening comment, and then I would like to be recognized after Senator \nHollings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I thank our distinguished chairman, \nSenator McCain, for getting this bill to the floor. Actually, we \nstarted 4 years ago under the leadership of Senator Wyden. In the last \nCongress, we had a bill reported from the committee but we could not \nget it up. We have learned lessons now from the Do Not Call effort, \nwhere we had to forgo committee and floor procedures to finally get it \nup. In this sense, I thank Senator McCain for getting this bill to the \nfloor for its consideration, as well as Senator Wyden and Senator Burns \nfor their leadership, and particularly my colleague from New York, \nSenator Schumer. He has a very important amendment. He has been driving \nforward for the expedition of this particular procedure, where the \nFederal Trade Commission is given some 6 months, although I think it \ncan be done in a much shorter period.\n  We will be riding herd on the Federal Trade Commission to see if we \ncan congeal that time, get that list ready, and report it to the \ncommittee so we can act. Other than that, if there is a need for a Do \nNot Call list, there certainly is a need for a Do Not Spam list.\n  I again thank Senator Burns, Senator Dayton, and Senator Schumer for \ntheir particular amendment and efforts on this case, and particularly \nmy colleague, Senator Wyden, for his leadership over the past 4 years. \nIt is under his drive that we have gotten it here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will mention Senator Schumer's \namendment which we have agreed to, which as soon as opening statements \nare completed we will propose, and I believe it will be without \nobjection. It does do several things. I will mention it now because \nSenator Schumer has worked so hard on this amendment.\n  This amendment says that not later than 6 months after the date of \nenactment of the act, the Commission will transmit to the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and to the House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Energy and Commerce a report that sets \nforth a plan and timetable for establishing a nationwide market Do Not \nE-mail Registry. It includes an explanation of any practical, \ntechnical, security, privacy, enforceability, or other concerns the \nCommission has regarding such a registry and includes an explanation of \nhow the registry would be applied with respect to children with e-mail \naccounts.\n  Finally, it says the Commission may establish and implement the plan, \nbut not earlier than 9 months after the date of enactment of this act.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Schumer, that I will do everything in my \npower to make sure that this is enacted and this plan, not earlier than \n9 months, should be implemented. I hope that is satisfactory.\n  Again, I thank Senator Schumer. If we can implement a Do Not Spam \nprovision which is clearly modeled after the Do Not Call list, I think \nit will have enormous benefit to all Americans.\n  I will make a few comments about the bill and then yield to my \ncolleagues and to Senator Schumer for their remarks.\n  If passed into law by Congress and signed by the President, the CAN-\nSPAM Act would be the first Federal law to regulate senders of \ncommercial e-mail.\n  The bill would prohibit senders of commercial e-mail from falsifying \nor disguising the following: their identity; the return address or \nrouting information of an e-mail; and the subject matters of their \nmessages. Violations of these provisions would result in both criminal \nand civil penalties.\n  The bill would also require senders of commercial e-mail to give \ntheir recipients an opportunity to opt out of receiving future messages \nand to honor those requests. Except for e-mail that is transactional in \nnature, such as purchase receipts or airlines ticket confirmations, \nevery commercial e-mail sent over the Internet to American consumers \nwould be required to provide this valid, working opt-out or unsubscribe \nmechanism. These rules represent current industry best practices \nregarding commercial e-mail messages.\n  For unsolicited commercial e-mail, however, the bill would require \nmore disclosures from the sender of the message, such as providing \nrecipients with instructions on how to operate the opt-out mechanism, a \nvalid physical address of the sender, and a clear notice in the body of \nthe message that it is an advertisement or solicitation.\n  In an amendment I offered in committee, this bill would also prohibit \nbusinesses from knowingly promoting or permitting the promotion of \ntheir business through e-mail transmitted with false or misleading \nidentity or routing information. Those that benefit the most from \nsending fraudulent spam, the companies advertised in those messages, \nshould be held accountable, and they will.\n  As my colleagues, Senators Burns and Wyden, will explain in more \ndetail, the bill would also target many of the insidious mechanisms \nused by today's spammers, including e-mail harvesting, dictionary \nattacks, and the hijacking of consumer e-mail accounts in order to send \nspam.\n  In addition to setting strict rules of the road for senders of \ncommercial e-mail, the CAN-SPAM Act would provide tough criminal and \ncivil penalties for offenders, and a multilayered approach to \nenforcement. This bill provides for enforcement actions by the FTC, \nState attorneys general, Internet service providers, and if Senator\n\n[[Page S13020]]\n\nHatch's proposed criminal amendment is passed which I assume it will, \nthe Department of Justice.\n  I strongly support this bill and I urge my colleagues to join me, \nSenators Burns, Wyden, Hollings, Hatch, and others, in passing this \nbill as a first step toward giving consumers back some control of their \ne-mail in-boxes.\n  I would like to make a few general observations about this issue that \nI have come to learn over the years that the Commerce Committee has \nexamined it.\n  According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project, approximately \n140 million Americans, nearly half of all U.S. citizens and 63 percent \nof full-time or part-time workers regularly use e-mail. E-mail \nmessaging has fundamentally changed the way we communicate with family, \nfriends, coworkers and business partners; the way consumers communicate \nwith businesses that provide goods and services; and the way that \nbusinesses may legitimately market products to consumers. The growing \naffliction of spam, however, may threaten all of this.\n  We must keep in mind the tremendous promise that the Internet and \nmore specifically e-mail, holds for consumers and businesses alike. We \nmust recognize that the word ``spam'' means different things to \ndifferent people.\n  The Federal Trade Commission defines spam generally as ``unsolicited \ncommercial e-mail.'' and some Americans do not want any of it. Other \nconsumers like to receive unsolicited offers by e-mail; to these \nconsumers, spam means only the unwanted fraudulent or pornographic e-\nmail that also floods their inbox.\n\n  Many American businesses view e-mail over the Internet as a new \nmedium through which to market or communicate more efficiently with \nconsumers. To them, this type of communication is not spam, but \ncommercial speech protected by the first amendment. The Direct \nMarketing Association reports that 37 percent of consumers it surveyed \nhave bought something as a result of receiving unsolicited e-mail from \nmarketers.\n  Internet service provider are the businesses caught in the middle, \nforced every day to draw distinctions between what they perceive as \nlegitimate e-mail and what is spam. In this environment, the risk of \nISPs blocking legitimate mail that consumers depend on, such as \npurchase receipts or healthcare communications, is as much a concern as \nthe prospect of failing to block as much spam as possible in the face \nof consumer demand. Often, the filters used by ISPs fail to meet their \nsubscribers' expectations on both accounts, failing to block the spam \nand sometimes blocking legitimate e-mail from coming through, leaving \nconsumers, legitimate businesses and the ISPs themselves frustrated.\n  I think Senator Burns and Senator Wyden remember, as well as I do, a \nprofessional spammer who came and testified before our committee. I \nmentioned in passing that it took him approximately 4 hours to break \nthrough a filter that had recently been in place, and he immediately \nbegan his work again of spamming millions of people every day. He was a \nman who was proud of his work, by the way. He was a very interesting \nwitness and, I might say in an otherwise dull hearing, a very \nentertaining one.\n  We must be mindful that in our quest to stop spam, we may impose e-\nmail restrictions that go too far and actually prohibit or effectively \nprevent e-mail that customers want to receive and that legitimate \nbusinesses depend on to service their customers.\n  I believe this bill strikes the proper balance, thanks to the efforts \nof Senator Wyden, Senator Burns, Senator Schumer, and others, by \ncarefully targeting the spam that consumers reject while preserving the \nfundamental benefits of e-mail to all Americans.\n  Regardless of whether we call all solicited commercial e-mail spam, \none fact is clear: Spam is rapidly on the rise. Its sheer volume is \nsignificantly affecting how consumers and businesses use e-mail. Less \nthan 2 years ago, spam made up only 8 percent of all e-mail. In a \nhearing before the Commerce Committee in May, my colleagues and I \nlearned that spam accounted for more than 45 percent of all global e-\nmail traffic and, worse, it would probably exceed the 50 percent mark \nby year's end.\n  In the committee's hearing, America Online--our Nation's largest \nInternet service provider with roughly 30 million subscribers--\ntestified that it blocks 80 percent of all its inbound e-mail--nearly \n2.4 billion out of 3 billion messages it receives each day. Not \nsurprisingly, this number of blocked messages was nearly 2.5 times \nlarger than the 1 billion messages AOL blocked per day only 2 months \nprior to that hearing, and nearly 5 times larger than the 500 million \nmessages it blocked per day in December 2002.\n\n  It's not just AOL. Our Nation's second and third largest e-mail \nproviders, Microsoft and Earthlink, have also reported a tremendous \nsurge in spam. Microsoft, the provider of MSN mail and the free Hotmail \nservice, reported in May that both services combined block up to 2.4 \nbillion spam messages each day. Earthlink, the third largest ISP in the \nUnited States, also reported a 500 percent increase in its inbound spam \nover the past 18 months.\n  I realize that these numbers may not mean as much to those who do not \nfollow e-commerce closely, so let me put it in perspective to what \nnearly all Americans are familiar with--junk mail. The USA Today \nrecently reported that more than 2 trillion spam messages are expected \nto be sent over the Internet this year, or 100 times the amount of \ndirect mail advertising pieces delivered by U.S. mail last year.\n  Managing this influx adds real monetary costs to consumers and \nbusinesses.\n  A 2001 European Union study found that spam cost Internet subscribers \nwouldwide $9.4 billion each year, and USA Today reported in April that \nresearch organizations estimate fighting spam adds an average of $2 per \nmonth to an individual's Internet bill.\n  Costs to businesses are also on the rise. Ferris Research currently \nestimates that costs to U.S. businesses from spam in lost productivity, \nnetwork system upgrades, unrecoverable data, and increased personnel \ncosts, combined will top $10 billion in 2003. Of that total, Ferris \nestimates that employee productivity losses from sifting through and \ndeleting spam account for nearly 40 percent of that--or $4 billion \nalone.\n  There are other costs to our society besides monetary costs. All of \nus are deeply concerned about the risks to our children who use e-mail \nand may be victimized by the nearly 20 percent of spam that contains \npornographic material, including graphic sexual images.\n  Parents encourage their children to use the Internet to play and do \nschoolwork, and to use e-mail to reach distant relatives. Yet, parents \ntoday spend more and more of their time worrying that their children \nmay open up an e-mail, disguised to look like it's from a friend or \nloved one, only to find pornography.\n  This greatly concerns me as a parent, as a legislator and as an \nAmerican citizen. First and foremost, parents should not have to think \ntwice before encouraging their children to use the computer at home.\n  In addition to pornography, the FTC also tells us that two-thirds of \nall spam contains deceptive information, much of it peddling get-rich-\nquick schemes, dubious financial or healthcare offers, and questionable \nproducts and services.\n  Spam is a serious and rapidly growing problem that the Senate must \nact on, but we must also be mindful of the complexity of the problem we \nface. While I agree with my colleagues in the Senate who believe that \npassing legislation is a necessary step, I also believe that \nlegislation alone will not solve the problem of spam.\n  Spammers today disregard our laws and are winning the technological \narms race with Internet service providers who try to block the spam \nthey send. The New York Times recently reported just one example of how \nunscrupulous spammers were using technology to stay one step ahead of \nthe law--in this instance, by highjacking a local Virginia school's \ncomputers to send out untraceable spam.\n  I repeat: A local Virginia schools computers. The same day, in the \nCommerce Committee's hearing, Mr. Ronald Scelson--who is popularly \nknown by his moniker ``The Cajun Spammer''--testified that it took him \nonly 12 hours to ``crack'' the latest technology filter supplied by the \ncompany of another witness at the table. Not only did he hack into \ntheir filter and figure out how to defeat it, the\n\n[[Page S13021]]\n\nCajun Spammer had distributed the keys to unlocking the filter to all \nof his fellow spammers so that they too could send spam past the \nfilters to the ISP's subscribers.\n  Keeping up with resourceful spammers' latest technology is not the \nonly challenge. Jurisdictional barriers also complicate enforcement, \nand as we heard in our hearing, nearly 90 percent of all spam is \nuntraceable and may be passing through mail servers outside of the \nUnited States.\n  I mention these things only to emphasize the complexity of this \nproblem and to remind my colleagues that the odds of us defeating spam \nby legislation alone are extremely low. The fact that there may be no \nsilver bullet to the problem of spam, however, does not mean that we \nshould stand idly by and do nothing at all about it.\n  The CAN-SPAM Act is a good first step, and one we should take today.\n  It is clear this Congress must act, but we should make no mistake--\nunless we can effectively enforce the laws we write, those laws will \nhave little meaning or deterrent effect on any would-be purveyor of \nspam.\n  At the Commerce Committee's executive session where we considered \nthis bill, I introduced an amendment that would empower the FTC to take \naction against businesses that financially benefit from the sending of \nspam with deliberately falisifed sender information. This amendment \npassed unanimously and I would like to take a moment here to briefly \ncomment on it because it goes to the heart of this enforcement matter.\n  In two hearings before the Commerce Committee this past spring, the \nchairman and Commissioners of the FTC testified to the Commission's \ntremendous difficulty in tracking and finding spammers who send out \nspam with fraudulent and often untraceable transmission information.\n  The chairman advised us, however, that their investigations are \nusually most effective when ``following the money'' to track down \nspammers. By this, they mean following the Web link or phone number in \nthe spam message that consumers follow with their money to purchase the \nproduct or service promoted in the spam. From there, the FTC attempts \nto prove a connection between the business and a spammer who sent it \nout on their behalf. In essence, they spend significant time and effort \nattempting to follow the money trail all the way back to the spammer--\nif they can find them.\n  As an alternative to the inefficient and often slow moving process, \nthe amendment I proposed which is now section 6 of the bill was \ndesigned to help the FTC enforce the law against those businesses at \nthe front end of the money trail that are promoted in the spam \nconsumers receive. They need to go further, and here is why.\n  Many unremarkable businesses employ sophisticated spammers to send e-\nmail to consumers in large volumes with deliberately falsified identity \nand routing information in order to get past the ISP's spam filters. \nThese businesses often escape liability because enforcement efforts are \ntoo often focused on catching the spammer rather than the unscrupulous \nbusinesses that hire them in the first place.\n  Section 6, however, would make it easier for the FTC to enforce the \nlaw against businesses knowingly complicit in the use of spam to \npromote their businesses with deliberately falsified routing \ninformation. I urge my colleagues to support this principle of holding \nbusinesses that benefit from spam messages accountable for the acts of \nthose they knowingly hire to fraudulently send spam to consumers on \ntheir behalf.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of \nletters I have received in support of this provision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                                    June 18, 2003.\n     Subject: McCain FTC Enforcement Amendment to Burns-Wyden Spam \n         bill.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator:\n       Consumers Union urges you to support the McCain Amendment \n     to the Burns-Wyden CAN-SPAM bill. This amendment is an \n     important improvement on the underlying bill. The amendment \n     would provide additional FTC enforcement authority to help \n     consumers curb spam. With this amendment, the bill would hold \n     businesses that use spam to advertise their products and \n     services accountable for actions by spammers who falsify \n     information regarding the origins of the e-mail in order to \n     evade spam filters.\n       However, we still have significant reservations about the \n     Burns-Wyden bill, because we believe that consumers will not \n     see a significant reduction in spam without a guarantee that \n     spam is disallowed unless the consumer opts to receive such \n     materials (an ``opt-in''), as well as an appropriate legal \n     remedy for consumers who have been harmed by spammers that \n     circumvent the anti-spam safeguards established in this \n     legislation (a private right of action).\n       Consumers Union hopes the Committee will address these \n     substantial consumer concerns before bringing this \n     legislation to the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Chris Murray,\n     Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Business Software Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: On behalf of the member companies of \n     the Business Software Alliance, I write in support of your \n     efforts to amend and report favorably S. 877 to address the \n     ability of the FTC to pursue those who use third parties to \n     send unsolicited commercial email, spam, on their behalf. As \n     the Committee is aware, spam continues to grow at an \n     exponential rate, clogging inboxes, diverting network \n     resources, damaging reputations and brands of responsible \n     companies, and discouraging the use of email as a \n     communications tool.\n        Those who deliberately engage third parties to send spam \n     with false or misleading transmission information should be \n     held as accountable as those who click on the send button. By \n     taking away the financial incentive to send spam, the \n     potential interest of a responsible company to utilize such a \n     deceptive form of marketing to reach customers now or in the \n     future would evaporate.\n        As you finalize the language of your amendment and proceed \n     to consideration on the Senate floor prior to markup, we look \n     forward to working with you and your staff on ways to further \n     pursue spammers. BSA believes that a combination of \n     legislation, technology, and enforcement is the right \n     approach. A copy of our principles regarding spam is attached \n     for your review.\n       Please contact me or Joe Keeley in BSA's office at (202) \n     872-5500 should you have any questions about the BSA position \n     on spam.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert Holleyman,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator McCain: We would like to thank you for \n     scheduling this markup of S. 877, the Burns-Wyden CANSPAM \n     Act. Senators Burns and Wyden have been true leaders in the \n     effort to address the spam problem working with industry and \n     public interest groups to refine their legislation over the \n     last two sessions.\n       CDT is conducting a consultative study on the most \n     effective ways to prevent spam while still protecting privacy \n     and free expression. At this time, we have not endorsed any \n     specific bill. We look forward to continue working with you \n     and Senators Burns and Wyden on this important issue as the \n     legislative process unfolds.\n       In this context, we have reviewed your amendment to extend \n     FTC enforcement authority to businesses knowingly promoted \n     through electronic mail with false or misleading \n     transmission. We believe that this amendment will help the \n     FTC take action against wrongdoers. CDT supports its \n     inclusion in this bill and into the larger discussion on \n     preventing unsolicited commercial email. We hope that this \n     provision--in concert with effective baseline federal \n     legislation, new anti-spam technologies and industry \n     efforts--will help to begin to turn the rising tide of \n     unwanted email.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Ari Schwartz,\n\n                                               Associate Director,\n     Center for Democracy and Technology.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 18, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing on behalf of the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation, \n     representing more than three million businesses of every \n     size, sector and region, regarding S. 877, the CAN SPAM Act.\n       Spam has become more than a nuisance--it has become so \n     overwhelming that all aspects of the business community, from \n     ISPs who have to invest millions of dollars in bandwidth, to \n     retailers who have seen their opt-in emails deleted along \n     with the spam and pornography, and everyone in between, would \n     like to see this problem eradicated. We believe that stopping \n     spam is going to take a multi-pronged effort, including \n     technology, increased FTC enforcement, and enhanced ability \n     of ISPs to go after the bad actors.\n       Therefore, I would like to commend Senators Burns and Wyden \n     for their relentless pursuit of legislation to fill in a key \n     piece of the puzzle regarding this issue. The CAN\n\n[[Page S13022]]\n\n     SPAM Act has been improved significantly, although it still \n     requires some modifications, mostly related to liability \n     issues that could potentially subject even legitimate \n     companies who communicate with their customers through opt-in \n     communications to potential frivolous, but expensive, \n     liability.\n       I would also like to specifically commend Chairman McCain, \n     and to offer our strong support for his amendment. There are \n     two principal issues that the Committee's educational hearing \n     on spam helped to clarify: the extent to which businesses, \n     whose products are promoted by the deluge of spam, are in \n     realty responsible for the amount of spam that permeates the \n     Internet; and the difficulty of finding actual ``spammers.'' \n     The Chairman's amendment addresses both of these concerns, \n     and does so in a way that specifically targets those \n     underlying problems. In particular, the amendment empowers \n     the FTC, who has the expertise to find and stop the promoted \n     businesses, to go after those who actually benefit from \n     increased volume of spam--the ``companies'' that hire \n     spammers to sell their products and attract consumers to \n     their web sites.\n       Therefore, the Chamber urges the Committee to approve this \n     important component of the fight against spam, including the \n     McCain amendment, and we look forward to working with the \n     Committee to further improve the legislation as it moves to \n     the floor.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       Yahoo!,\n\n                                                    June 18, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \n         Committee, Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: Yahoo! supports your amendment to S. \n     877, the CAN Spam Act of 2003, to hold the owners of websites \n     who knowingly employ spammers using fraudulent means to \n     deliver their advertisements.\n       The hearing on spam held by your committee revealed \n     significant changes in the marketplace. The volume of spam \n     has grown in exponential terms, and it is extremely difficult \n     to track down spammers who use fraud to conceal themselves. \n     Your amendment takes a new approach to finding these \n     spammers--getting at their revenue source. When a website \n     owner know the person advertising its website is using fraud \n     to get its message out, it must be held responsible. The FTC \n     will be empowered to pursue those who allow such techniques \n     to be used. This has the potential to put fraudulent spammers \n     out of business, as their customers refuse to work with them. \n     This, in turn, has potential to dramatically affect the \n     volume of spam crossing the networks of email service \n     providers. We are encouraged by this creative approach to get \n     at spammers from a new direction.\n       We also commend you for being absolutely true to your word \n     to bring before your committee legislation to address the \n     problem of spam early in this session. We look forward to \n     working with you and other members of the committee to bring \n     anti-spam legislation to the floor of the Senate before the \n     August recess.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John Scheibel,\n                                    Vice President, Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the House will adopt a similar provision \nin any House spam bill. I have received support for the provision from \nevery sector involved in the spam debate--consumers' groups, e-mail \nproviders, marketers, advertisers, online and offline retailers, \ntechnology companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in responding to the demands of \nmillions of American consumers in doing all that we can to try to stop \nspam. I urge them to support passage of the CAN-SPAM Act.\n  My comments were a little lengthy, and I apologize. This is a very \nserious and important and complex issue, as I stated at the beginning \nof my remarks. That is why my two colleagues have spent 4 years working \non this issue. I think they would be the first to agree that this may \nnot stop spam.\n  There are some very smart people out there who will do everything \nthey can for avoidance, including this issue I mention of organizations \noutside the United States. For us to do nothing would be a great \ndisservice to millions of Americans, including the young ones, the \nmajority of whom in America are regular users of computers.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Wyden and Senator Burns. For the \nbenefit of my colleagues, we have three or four amendments. Maybe one \nor two might require a vote. I hope we can dispose of this legislation \nin a fairly short period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I thank Senator McCain, the chairman of \nthe full Committee on Commerce, for his diligence and insight on this, \nand the ranking member, Senator Hollings. He laid out the facts. I will \nnot rehash everything he said because his numbers are right.\n  Also I thank my good friend from Oregon, Senator Wyden. We have \nworked on this bill for 4 years. It is not an easy piece of legislation \nto put together.\n  The simplest piece of legislation we ever put together, I say to \nSenator Wyden, was the E 9-1-1 which is probably the best public safety \npiece of legislation we have ever passed. It sounded like a no-brainer, \nand it only took 2 years, so this must have been really complicated. I \nthank you for your efforts. It was a pleasure working with you.\n  Also, two Senators not on the floor who have not been mentioned are \nSenator Hatch and Senator Leahy. We appreciate their cooperation \nincorporating a significantly expanded criminal package in this law.\n  The extent of bipartisan cooperation on this issue is no surprise, of \ncourse, given the deluge of spam to the consumers and what they face in \ntheir inbox each day. The cost of business, the cost to individuals, is \nescalating and wide ranging.\n  The chairman asked a valid question: Does this piece of legislation \nprotect us from spam? It can have an effect on people thinking twice \nbefore they send it. That is the answer. I have contended all along, as \nmy colleagues on the Commerce Committee have contended, that industry \nis going to have to come along and get together, talk about the \ntechnologies it takes to keep out unwanted mail or some organization or \ntechnology that ferrets out the bad people but allows some in the \nindustry to be able to send some messages of what would be considered \nspam today.\n\n  This especially affects people in rural areas. In Montana we have \npeople using the Internet who have to incur long-distance charges to \ntheir ISPs. Servers all over the country have difficulty in blocking \nspam. They are saying the systems are jammed up. The CAN-SPAM bill \nempowers consumers and grants additional enforcement authority to the \nFederal Trade Commission to take action against spammers and allows \nState attorneys general to take action if they see fit.\n  The bill also provides additional tools to end this online \nharassment, allowing users to remove themselves from mass email lists \nand imposing steep fines up to $3 million on spammers. In cases where \noutright deception is involved, penalties will be unlimited. That is a \nbig point.\n  The chairman also brings up another point: unwanted and pornographic \nmail. In my State of Montana, something else is emerging regarding \nprotection of our children: sexual predators. This has to do with how \nthey work in our homes with our children. There are a couple of \namendments we will deal with as they come up.\n  I have a constituent in Montana. If you do not think it does not cost \ncompanies money, Jeff Smith, who built a cutting-edge fiber hotel in \nMissoula, MT, says unwanted spam costs his business about $300,000 a \nyear. His company is worth $2.5 million, so his costs are real.\n  Not only do we pass legislation, but I will participate in an I-SAFE \nconference in Billings on Friday at Castle Rock School on how to deal \nwith this unwanted and pornographic mail that comes into our homes on \nthe Internet.\n  I thank my chairman, Senator McCain, for his patience. I have worn \nhim out a couple of times. He yells back, though, pretty well.\n  I thank my friend from Oregon, too, who has worked very hard on this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, kingpin spammers who send out emails by \nthe millions are threatening to drown the Internet in a sea of trash. \nThe American people want it stopped. Every single day the Senate \ndelays, these big-time spammers, the ones who are trying to take \nadvantage of the open and low-cost nature of the Internet, gives them \nanother opportunity to crank up their operations to even more dizzying \nlevels of volumes.\n  Every Member of the Senate is hearing from citizens. This is a \nconsumer abuse that is visited on millions of people every day. It is \nnow time to put in\n\n[[Page S13023]]\n\nplace strong enforcement tools to protect the public.\n  Many are asking, what is the role of Federal legislation? My \ncolleagues have talked a bit about there not being a silver bullet. The \nkey is to pass this bill and come down on the violators with hobnail \nboots. It is fair to say a lot of the big-time abusers are not exactly \nquaking today about the prospect of Senate action. They are not \ntechnological simpletons. They are very savvy and they figure any law \nthat is passed by the Senate they can get out in front of.\n  What is going to be important is for those who are charged with \nenforcement--the Federal Trade Commission, the criminal authorities, we \ngive a role to the State attorneys general, the Internet service \nproviders--when this bill is signed into law, to bring a handful of \nactions very quickly to establish that for the first time there is a \nreal deterrent, there will be real consequences when those big-time \nspammers try to exploit our citizens. When the bill takes effect, for \nthe first time those violators are going to risk criminal prosecution, \nFederal Trade Commission enforcement, and million-dollar lawsuits by \nthe State attorneys general and Internet service providers.\n  The reason that is the case is because big-time spammers have to \nviolate this bill in order for their sleazy business to work. If they \ndo not hide their identities, their messages end up getting filtered \nout by the Internet service providers. If they do not use misleading \nsubject lines, people are going to click the messages straight into the \ntrash, unread. It is costly to deal with thousands of demands for \nconsumers to be removed from the lists. The day this bipartisan \nlegislation becomes law, for the first time big-time spamming will \nbecome an outlaw business.\n  It is worth noting when Senator Burns and I started this effort \nnearly 4 years ago, we had the strong support of Senator McCain. \nSenator Hollings has been tremendous to me. I got involved in this \nshortly after joining the Commerce Committee. A lot of people asked, \nwhy in the world would Conrad Burns and I be spending our time on \nsomething like this. They essentially intimated this was not the kind \nof issue important enough for the Senate. They said, Senators deal with \nkey matters. They deal with war and peace and entitlement programs. Why \nin the world would the Senate get involved with something like spam. It \nwas only 6 to 8 percent when we started in 2000. Why is the Senate \nspending its time on that kind of concern? Suffice it to say, nobody is \nsaying any longer spam is just a minor annoyance. Nobody is saying the \ndelete key is now going to be a sufficient solution to the problem.\n\n  This is now something that threatens this medium. Spam, in the view \nof experts, and in my view, stunts the growth of e-commerce. And if it \ncontinues at the rate of growth we have seen in the last few years, I \nthink it will engulf the entire medium.\n  So something the American people use every day, something that is \nconsidered a vibrant, exciting tool, that has empowered millions of \npeople to learn, to be part of cultural activities, to start small \nbusinesses--if nothing is done, if somehow this legislation goes by the \nboard or the Senate and House cannot agree, I think what we are seeing \nin the days ahead is a genuine threat to the entire medium.\n  So with respect to the specifics of the bill, I think there are a \nnumber of key provisions. One I have stressed is the question of \nmisleading identities because I think that goes right to the heart of \nhow you set in place a strong enforcement regime.\n  But I also emphasize the role of the States here this afternoon. At \nthis point, over half the States have enacted State-level spam \nlegislation. It is pretty easy to see why the States have acted. They \nare frustrated that the Congress has not moved.\n  But I believe a State-by-State approach cannot work in this area. The \nnumerous State laws to date certainly have not put in place a \ncoordinated effort against spam. Neither the Internet nor the big-time \nspammers is sitting around saying: Let's tip our hat to State \njurisdictions. And certainly an e-mail address, unlike a phone number, \ndoes not reveal the State in which the holder of the address is \nlocated. So compliance with a patchwork of inconsistent State laws is \nvirtually impossible, and spammers do not even go through the motions \nof trying.\n  What is needed is a uniform, nationwide spam standard to put the \nspammers on notice and to empower the consumers to have an enforcement \nregime consistent with their reasonable expectations.\n  Having emphasized the importance of a nationwide, uniform standard in \nthis area, the legislation does preserve an important role for the \nStates.\n  First, the State laws that address deception in spam--deception in \nspam--would be preserved. Second, general consumer protection fraud and \ncomputer abuse laws would remain enforceable as well. And third, the \nbill authorizes States' attorneys general to use the Federal statute to \nprosecute spammers.\n  The bottom line is, our States, which have done so much important and \ninnovative work in the area of consumer protection, are going to remain \nactive and important partners in the battle against spam.\n  Shortly, we will be talking about the Do Not E-mail Registry. I \ncommend Senators Schumer and Dayton. Both of them have introduced \nlegislation in this area. They deserve a great deal of credit with \nrespect to their patience on this legislation. And we know it is a \nchallenge. The telephone Do Not Call list is certainly facing a lot of \nbattles.\n  But I think this is an important idea. I think it is an idea that \nmakes a genuine contribution. It certainly is one that the American \nconsumer wants. We are going to work with the sponsors, Senator Schumer \nand Senator Dayton, and others who have been so interested in this to \naddress the various questions that have been brought up with respect to \nfeasibility.\n\n  I also commend Senator Nelson of Florida. These big-time spammers--\nthere are only a few hundred of them. I think Senator McCain and I were \nstruck, as we listened to the debate, at the fact that we are talking \nabout a few hundred big-time violators. They seem to have gravitated to \na couple States, particularly Florida and Texas.\n  Senator Nelson has been very interested in ensuring that there are \ntough enforcement provisions in this legislation. I share his view that \nwe ought to use all of the enforcement tools, including measures such \nas the RICO statute, against these particularly reprehensible \nviolators. I commend Senator Nelson for this effort as well.\n  Finally, as we put together a coordinated game plan against the \nspammers, I would also like to emphasize that we expect our trading \npartners, and the many countries that look to do business with the \nUnited States, to play a more activist role in this area. As sure as \nnight follows day, some of these kingpin spammers are going to just \nmove offshore and set up shop.\n  So as we look to the future, I have stressed enforcement. I think we \nneed to see aggressive enforcement action the day this bill is signed \ninto law. Then we have to push our trading partners around the world to \nwork with us to ensure that, as part of a coordinated strategy, we are \npreventing the big-time violators from simply closing down in the \nUnited States and moving offshore.\n  I have tried to specialize in technology issues in my time in the \nSenate. My State cares greatly about this issue. I have been fortunate \nto have a chairman in Senator McCain who has always encouraged these \nefforts, to deal with Internet taxes, digital signatures, Y2K \nliability--and the list goes on and on. And Senator Hollings, who is \nnot in the Chamber, has been extraordinarily supportive of my \ninvolvement in these issues.\n  But I think it is fair to say that this spam question--of all the \ntechnology issues we have tackled in the last few years in the Commerce \nCommittee, I cannot think of another one that has inflamed consumers \nmore, has been emphasized more to me at townhall meetings.\n  I can tell the Senate, at the time when we were all concerned about \nthe well-being of our troops and the conflict in Iraq, folks would also \nsay, in addition to standing up for our troops: Make sure you do \nsomething about spam as well. I think it is indicative of how much \nconcern there is in the country with respect to these kingpin spammers \nwho really do put at risk--I do not say this lightly--an entire medium \nthat has made such a difference and been so important for millions of \nAmericans.\n\n[[Page S13024]]\n\n  We are going to deal expeditiously with the amendments. A number of \ncolleagues have already asked of the managers what we thought the \ntimetable of this bill would be. My guess is, we can deal with this \nlegislation certainly within the next couple of hours, at most.\n  We urge Senators who have an interest in this matter to come to the \nfloor. This is an opportunity for the Senate to stand up for the \nconsumer.\n  We are not going to overpromise. We are not going to say that the day \nthis bill is signed, spam will magically vanish into the vapor. But \nthis legislation, coupled with an enforcement strategy that has the \nFederal Trade Commission, criminal authorities, pushing spam as it \nrelates to these big-time violators up the priority list of the tasks \nthat they face--that kind of strategy can make a difference.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I believe the Senator from Oregon has a \ntechnical amendment and maybe would like to propose that at this time. \nIt is my understanding that the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, is \non his way over to propose his Do Not Spam amendment.\n  It is also my understanding that Senator Hatch, Senator Santorum, and \nSenator Corzine are the ones who have amendments. I would urge them to \ncome forward when it is convenient so we can dispense with those \namendments in a timely fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1891\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself and Mr. \n     Burns, proposes an amendment numbered 1891.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the provision prohibiting false or misleading \n           transmission information, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 37, lines 12, after the comma, insert ``whether or \n     not not displayed,''.\n       On page 44, line 20, strike ``false or misleading.'' and \n     insert ``materially false or materially misleading.''.\n       On page 45, line 2, strike ``misleading; and'' and insert \n     ``materially misleading;''.\n       On page 45, line 5, strike ``false or misleading.'' and \n     insert ``materially false or materially misleading; and''.\n       On page 45, between 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       ``(C) if header information attached to a message fails to \n     identify a protected computer used to initiate the message \n     because the person initiating the message knowingly uses \n     another protected computer to relay or retransmit the message \n     for purposes of disguising its origin, then such header \n     information shall be considered materially misleading.''.\n       On page 49, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       (6) Materiality defined.--For purposes of paragraph (1), an \n     inaccuracy or omission in header information is material if \n     it would materially impede the ability of a party seeking to \n     allege a violation of this Act to locate the person who \n     initiated the message or to investigate the alleged \n     violation.\n       On page 50, beginning in line 24, strike ``establish'' and \n     insert ``register for''.\n       On page 51, after line 22, insert the following:\n       ``(d) Supplementary Rulemaking Authority.--The Commission \n     may be rule--\n       ``(1) modify the 10-business-day period under subsection \n     (a)(4)(A) or subsection (a)(4)(B), or both, if the Commission \n     determines that a different period would be more reasonable \n     after taking into account--\n       ``(A) the purposes of subsection (a);\n       ``(B) the interests of recipients of commercial electronic \n     mail; and\n       ``(C) the burdens imposed on senders of lawful commercial \n     electronic mail; and\n       ``(2) specify additional activities or practices to which \n     subsection (b) applies if the Commission determines that \n     those activities or practices are contributing substantially \n     to the proliferation of commercial electronic mail messages \n     that are unlawful under subsection (a).''.\n       On page 58, beginning in line 16, strike ``jurisdiction or \n     in any other court of competent''.\n       On page 62, beginning in line 14, strike ``defendant, or in \n     any other court of competent jurisdiction, to--'' and insert \n     ``defendant--''.\n       On page 65, beginning in line 7, strike ``for any such \n     statute, regulation, or rule that'' and insert ``to the \n     extent that any such statute, regulation, or rule''.\n       On page 65, line 16, strike ``State laws'' and insert \n     ``other State laws to the extent that those laws relate''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Burns. It is technical in nature. I know of no \nopposition.\n  It clarifies that header information that is technically false, but \nin such a minor way as to be nonmaterial, will not be actionable under \nthe legislation.\n  It clarifies that spammers who knowingly route messages through what \nare called open relays in order to erase the message's originating \ninformation--which is a technique used by these big-time spammers--will \nbe treated as having used false or misleading header information.\n  It permits the Federal Trade Commission to modify the bill's deadline \nfor how quickly ``opt-out requests'' must be processed. Currently, the \nbill says that 10 business days after receiving a consumer's opt-out \nrequest, any further e-mails from the sender become punishable.\n  The amendment permits the Federal Trade Commission to modify that \ntime period if it finds that a different period would be appropriate. \nIt permits the Federal Trade Commission, if it identifies new and \nparticularly nefarious techniques used by spammers, to add those \ntechniques to the list of what are called aggravated violations so that \nspammers who use those techniques would be subject to higher penalties.\n  Finally, this amendment, which has the support of Chairman McCain and \nSenator Hollings, would clarify that any lawsuits for violations of \nFederal spam rules should be brought in Federal court. It is \nnoncontroversial in nature. I urge its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we support the amendment. It is helpful \nto the legislation. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1891.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1892\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Graham of South Carolina, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1892.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the Commission to implement a nationwide ``Do \n                         Not E-mail'' registry)\n\n       On page 66, strike lines 1 through 11 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 9. DO-NOT-E-MAIL REGISTRY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall transmit to the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and \n     the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce \n     a report that--\n       (1) sets forth a plan and timetable for establishing a \n     nationwide marketing Do-Not-E-mail registry;\n       (2) includes an explanation of any practical, technical, \n     security, privacy, enforceability, or other concerns that the \n     Commission has regarding such a registry; and\n       (3) includes an explanation of how the registry would be \n     applied with respect to children with e-mail accounts.\n       (b) Authorization To Implement.--The Commission may \n     establish and implement the plan, but not earlier than 9 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Graham of South Carolina, Senator McCain, and Senator \nHollings. I thank my good friend, Senator Lindsey Graham, who worked \nlong and hard on this issue with me. Senator Graham and I have been \nworking on quite a few pieces of legislation together. He is a good \nlegislator and a fighter for the things in which he believes. We do not \nagree on everything, to say the least, but it is a pleasure to work \nwith him.\n\n[[Page S13025]]\n\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Burns and Senator Wyden, both of whom \nhave worked long and hard on this legislation for many years. They both \nwere willing to work with me and accommodate some changes which I hope \nmake the legislation better. I believe they do. But the foundation of \nthis bill is their hard work. This is a good day for both of them \nbecause they have spent a long time and they deserve a great deal of \naccolades for their hard work on this important legislation which, \nhopefully, will pass today.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Hollings, ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee, who offers this amendment along with myself, \nSenator Graham, and Senator McCain. We are all going to miss Fritz \nHollings. He is one of the true gems of the Senate. He is a forthright \nman and a direct man. He is a smart man. He is a principled man. I, for \none, know that my amendment might not have happened, certainly wouldn't \nbe in the form it is now, without his intervention. I thank him for \nthat.\n  Finally, Senator McCain and I have worked on a whole number of things \ntogether. It is a pleasure to work with him. Again, he is a man of his \nword. He is able to bring different people together to produce good \nlegislation. He cares about the average person. He never lets any of \nthe special interests get in his way. We wouldn't be here today without \nthe Senator's leadership. I thank him very much.\n  Let me begin by saying how important this whole bill is to the \ncontinued vitality of e-mail and the Internet itself. Unsolicited e-\nmail has grown at astronomical rates over the past months. It is safe \nto say we are now under siege. Armies of online marketers have overrun \ne-mail inboxes across the country with advertisements for herbal \nremedies, get-rich-quick schemes, and, unfortunately, pornography. What \nwas a simple annoyance last year has become a major concern this year \nand could cripple one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century \nnext year if nothing is done.\n  Way back in 1999, the average e-mail user received just 40 pieces of \nunsolicited commercial e-mail, spam, each year. This year the number is \nexpected to pass 2,500. I know that I am lucky if I don't get 40 pieces \nof spam every day. As a result, a revolution against spam is brewing as \nthe epidemic against junk e-mail exacts an ever-increasing toll on \nfamilies, businesses, and the economy.\n  Let me illustrate this point with a story. My wife and I have two \nwonderful daughters, one of whom is about to complete her first year at \ncollege; the other, a 14-year-old, is an absolute whiz on the Internet. \nShe loves sending and receiving e-mails. As parents, we do our best to \nmake sure she has good values and that the Internet is a positive \nexperience for her, a device to help her with her school work or learn \nabout events taking place around the world, and maybe even a way to \norder the latest In Sync CD, although I think she likes other groups \nbetter.\n  You can imagine my anger and dismay when I saw my daughter on e-mail. \nI would say: Great, she is not watching television. And then you can \nimagine my dismay when I discovered that not only was she a victim of \nspam like myself, but like all e-mail users, much of the junk mail she \nwas receiving advertised pornographic Web sites. Some of the things \nthat crossed her e-mail were things I would not want to see, let alone \nmy 14-year-old daughter. I was and remain virtually powerless to \nprevent such garbage from reaching my daughter's inbox.\n  Recent surveys unambiguously show that the public shares my concern \nabout spam infested with pornography and how it impacts their children. \nThe bottom line is, if parents can control what their kids watch on TV, \nthey should be able to control what their children are exposed to on \nthe Internet. We have parental advisory notices on music, as well as \nratings for TV shows and movies to ensure that parents are able to keep \ntheir children from being exposed to what they consider inappropriate. \nSo it makes you scratch your head about why there is no safeguard in \nplace to enable parents to protect their kids from vulgar e-mail. The \ne-mailing public has been at the mercy of spammers for long enough. \nThey want to take back the Internet.\n  A recent survey conducted by UnSpam, one of the ardent foes of spam \nand backer of my legislation, and InSightExpress, a research group, \nbacks that view. Here is a quick rundown of some of the highlights of \nthe survey:\n  Almost 9 in 10 parents say they are seriously concerned about their \nchildren receiving inappropriate e-mail versus 5 percent who don't \ncare. Ninety-six percent of parents want the ability to block \npornography from their children's inboxes. A paltry 2 percent don't \nwant that right. Ninety-five percent think children should be given \nextra protection under any anti-spam law, 3 percent undecided. And 93 \npercent think spammers should face enhanced penalties for sending \ninappropriate messages to children.\n\n  Our amendment is a solution that will give parents--the only \nsolution--the ability to protect their children from offensive and \nobscene e-mail spam by registering their children's e-mail address. \nParents across the country are increasingly worried about this problem, \nand we should do the right thing by giving them a registry. Parents and \nchildren are not the only ones who will benefit from a no e-mail \nregistry. Business owners and ISPs across the Nation can identify with \nthe frustration many of us feel in the battle against spam. With \nsurveys showing that nearly 50 percent of e-mail traffic qualifies as \nspam, businesses spend millions of dollars each year on research-\nfiltering software and new servers to deal with the ever expanding \nvolume of junk e-mail being sent through the pipes.\n  According to Ferris Research, spam costs businesses in the United \nStates $10 billion each year in lost productivity, consumption of \ninformation technology resources, and help desk time.\n  That is $10 billion that should be spent on growing American \nbusinesses and jobs instead of fighting spam.\n  The Do Not E-mail Registry created by the FTC would allow businesses \nto cut costs and improve productivity in the workplace by giving them \nthe ability to register their entire domain names. Very important to \nbusinesses.\n  Some have expressed concern about creating a list of e-mail addresses \nthat spammers could exploit. The FTC has already said it is \ntechnologically possible to create and secure the list. This is no \nlonger a worry and one of the breakthroughs we made in the last few \nmonths that are allowing this legislation to come to the Senate floor.\n  In fact, we know that the database of addresses can be protected by \nmilitary-caliber encryption so that its valuable contents will not fall \ninto the wrong hands.\n  I want to take a few minutes to talk about the underlying bill and \nother amendments, and then I will get into mine.\n  First, I commend Senators Burns and Wyden for their long efforts on \nthis bill. The bill will, for the first time, set minimum standards for \nall commercial e-mail. It will require all commercial mail to include \nvalid return e-mail addresses and physical addresses of the sender. It \nmust provide accurate header and router information. And most messages \nwill be required to have an opt-out system.\n  It does not stop there. In addition to these provisions, it will take \naim at the mass collection of e-mail addresses and the rampant fraud \nwhich, according to a report released by the FTC, is present in 66 \npercent of junk e-mail.\n  I am hopeful that we can add important criminal provisions to these \ncivil measures. I know both my colleagues, including Senators McCain \nand Hollings, want to do that. I worked in the Judiciary Committee with \nSenators Hatch and Leahy on a bill that makes it clear that fraud and \ndeception in e-mail will not be tolerated. And those who do not heed \nthe warnings in this bill will face stiff punishment. These criminal \nprovisions will outlaw some of the spammers' favorite tricks.\n  About our legislation as well, let me just say it is really important \nthat we put in the registry, which, in my judgment, is the best way to \nget at spam. No system is foolproof and, as Mr. Morris of the FTC has \nsaid, no bill will solve all of the problems. But the registry is the \nmost complete, comprehensive way to do it, combined with the criminal \npenalties that we are adding in the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer amendment.\n  The minute somebody spams someone on the Do Not Call list, there will \nbe an immediate cause of action and criminal prosecution.\n\n[[Page S13026]]\n\n  The good news is that since we know that a large amount of spam comes \nfrom a small amount of people, we can get after these few people. This \nlegislation, as you know, gives the FTC 6 months to come back with a \ncomprehensive proposal. We then get 3 months here to examine it to see \nif we want to change it, and then the FTC may implement it. I have \nreceived--and they have both verbalized this on the Senate floor--\nassurances from Senators McCain and Hollings that if the FTC should \ndecide they don't want to implement it, or come up with something that \nis unworkable, they will use their clout with the FTC to straighten \nthings out and get this done. Otherwise, we in the Congress can \nrespond.\n  I believe this amendment will allow, without any further action by \nCongress, as long as the House passes it and it stays in the bill--and \nI thank Senator McCain for assuring me that he will not even sign a \nconference report that doesn't have this amendment in it, and I know \nall of my colleagues are for this legislation. But once it passes the \nHouse and is signed into law, we set the road for a no-call registry. \nIt is all downhill after that.\n\n  Within a year, it is my belief we will have that registry and, just \nas the no-call registry was a great success, I believe the no-spam \nregistry will be a great success. It will take a little longer, it will \nbe a little more difficult, but the same basic popularity and support \nthat the American people have given the no-call registry, they will \ngive, for sure, to the no-spam registry, and the combination of a good \nproposal that the FTC will have to send to us in 6 months and vigilant \nenforcement, plus the no-spam registry, plus the underlying base of the \nbill, will put a crimp, a real dent in spam.\n  Are we ever going to eliminate all spam? For sure not. But is this \nlegislation, along with the amendment I am adding, going to be the \ntoughest, best approach, and greatly curtail spam? Indeed. It is my \nbelief that when we enter these portals a year from now, spam will have \ngreatly decreased.\n  One of the great inventions of the 20th century, which is now sick \nand ailing, will be healthy and going full steam ahead. The bottom line \nis that this is a very fine day for those who use computers and e-mail \nand for American technology in general. It shows that we can all work \ntogether and get something done--get something done that the American \npeople want.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying \nlegislation. Let's finally do something about one of the greatest \ntechnological problems that we face right now in this country, the \nproliferation of spam.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we adopt \nthe amendment and add it to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1892) was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1891, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the previously agreed-to Burns-Wyden technical amendment, No. \n1891, be modified with the change I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1891), as modified is as follows:\n       On page 67, line 20, strike ``act'' and insert ``act, other \n     than section 9,''.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this is also a very modest technical \namendment. This amendment simply ensures that the Do Not E-mail \nRegistry proposed would be considered on the timetable that all of the \nparties who have worked on this had intended. It is very \nnoncontroversial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise to commend the \nSenators who have brought this legislation forward and say how gracious \nthey have been to me in working to address the seriousness of this \nissue of spam. Later on, when Senator Leahy comes to the floor, I will \nhave a colloquy with him about some of the provisions that are going to \nbe submitted in the Hatch-Leahy-Nelson amendment.\n  In the meantime, I wanted to commend the Senator from Oregon for his \nleadership. I commend Senator Conrad Burns from Montana for his \nleadership. I commend the Senators for how they saw the problem. They \nsaw it years ago, and they have been so persistent. Senator Wyden and \nSenator Burns kept after it. It is an idea whose time has come simply \nby virtue of the fact that people can hardly even use their e-mail now \nit is so cluttered up with unwanted messages.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I will be very short.\n  Without turning this into a bouquet-tossing contest, let me thank my \nfriend from Florida. Of course, many of the worst violators are people \nI call kingpin spammers who are located in his home State. The Senator \nfrom Florida brought it to the attention of Senator Burns and I that to \nhave an effective enforcement strategy, we had to have in place tools \nthat would deal with the kind of shady operators who are present in his \nhome State.\n  The Senator from Florida has hammered on that message. I think by the \ntime we are done this afternoon and have Senator Leahy on the floor as \nwell, Senator Nelson's contribution will be especially helpful, not \njust in Florida but in terms of dealing with these kingpin spammers, \nthe people who send out millions of e-mail now without consequences.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding, and I thank him for keeping this \nissue on the radar.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I thank Senator Hatch and \nSenator Leahy for working with me in their capacity as leaders of the \nJudiciary Committee in attaching some strong penalties on the most \negregious kinds of spam.\n  Spam is clearly a nuisance, and it impedes the course of commerce. \nWhen you can't even use your computer because it is so cluttered up, \nthat is one thing, but when spam is used for illicit purposes, such as \nchild pornography, then that is another thing. That needs to be dealt \nwith swiftly and severely.\n  By Senator Wyden and Senator Burns working with Senator Hatch and \nSenator Leahy, we have, as part of their amendment--and I think it is \nworth reading. This is a part of the amendment they will offer:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that spam has become the method \n     of choice for those who distribute pornography and perpetrate \n     fraudulent schemes and also offers fertile ground for \n     deceptive trade practices;\n       And it is the sense of Congress that the Department of \n     Justice should use all existing law enforcement tools to \n     investigate and prosecute those who send bulk commercial e-\n     mail to facilitate the commission of Federal crimes, \n     including the tools contained in--\n\n  And it lists several chapters of the United States Code, one relating \nto fraud and false statements; another relating to obscenity; another \nrelating to the sexual exploitation of children; and another relating \nto racketeering.\n  By the adoption of this amendment, we will strengthen the penalties \nand also give a directive to the United States Sentencing Commission, \nwhich is the normal course of action, that they shall consider \nsentencing enhancements for those convicted of other offenses, \nincluding offenses involving fraud, identity theft, obscenity, child \npornography, and sexual exploitation of children, if those offenses \ninvolve the sending of large quantities of unsolicited e-mail.\n\n  Why is this so egregious? We know what a nuisance it is. One day, I \nwent in my Tampa office to check the e-mail. We had a list of single-\nspaced e-mail over the last evening filling up--single space, one sheet \nof paper, all unsolicited. That was bad enough. But to a Senate office, \ntwo of them were pornographic. If that is happening to my Tampa Senate \noffice, we can imagine\n\n[[Page S13027]]\n\nwhat is happening to the e-mail receipt of every consumer in America on \ntheir computer. It has to stop. This is an attempt to stop it.\n  Under the old laws, when we tried to protect against activities such \nas child pornography or taking advantage of senior citizens by some \nextortion or deceptive scheme to bilk them out of money, before we had \ne-mail, the criminal would send out 100, 150 letters to the \nunsuspecting victims on whom they were preying on child pornography or \non fleecing senior citizens of their assets. That was 100, 150 letters. \nNow with the punch of a button, they can send out 150 million. So we \nsee the insidious ability of a criminal mind to prey upon millions of \npeople by the use of this very new and fantastic tool that we ought to \nbe using for good, not for ill, and that is e-mail.\n  This Senator is very happy that this legislation is being considered, \nand we are now going to attach some tough penalties to it for these \negregious types of activities.\n  I also commend the Senator from Arizona, the chairman of our \ncommittee, and the Senator from South Carolina, the ranking member of \nour committee, for being so vigilant in bringing this legislation to \nthe floor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we would like to, obviously, finish the \nbill as expeditiously as possible and yet offer all Members the \nopportunity to propose amendments. As I understand it right now, we \nhave pending amendments by Senators Corzine, Santorum, and Hatch.\n  As Members know, there is a briefing at 4 p.m. by the Secretary of \nDefense for all Members in room 407. Shortly before 4, I would like to \npropose a unanimous consent agreement to lock in all amendments with no \ntime agreements agreed to. I ask my colleagues who may have additional \namendments to let us know between now and shortly before the hour of 4, \nwhich is over a half an hour.\n  I will also say we are asking Senators Hatch, Santorum, and Corzine \nto come over to offer their amendments so we can dispose of those \namendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1892\n\n  Mr. McCain. Madam President, I wish to make a few comments about \nSenator Schumer's amendment regarding the Do Not Spam list. As Senator \nSchumer pointed out, it authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to \ndevelop a Do Not Spam list similar to the Do Not Call list which has \nbeen widely supported by Americans across the country.\n  The Senator from New York and I remember when apparently perhaps, in \nthe view of some, a misguided member of the judiciary stayed the Do Not \nCall list and the reaction that followed was certainly extraordinary. \nIf we are able technologically to develop a Do Not Spam list, I think \nit would be of great assistance to many Americans. So I think the \nSenator from New York has a remarkable idea here.\n  As a first step, the FTC, which has testified they have some \ntechnological reservations about creating such a list, although I am \nsure the FTC would not object to it in principle, but they have some \nreservations, Senator Schumer has modified his amendment so that the \nFTC would be required to submit a report to the Congress within 6 \nmonths. It contains a plan for implementing the Do Not Spam list. The \nFTC would be authorized to implement the list 3 months later, and I \nwould certainly urge them to do so.\n\n  As everyone is aware by now, there has been a tremendous amount of \ndiscussion about this issue. I believe it is a good one and one that \nprovides the FTC with the authority to establish such a registry if \nthey believe it is the proper mechanism to stop the onslaught of spam \nto consumers.\n  I think we have given them the flexibility to come back and show us \nif there are serious problems. If there are serious problems, we would \nbe glad to look at them and help resolve those problems through any \nkind of legislative or other assistance we can provide.\n  The Schumer amendment also absolutely emphasizes this is an idea that \nhas worked in the Do Not Call area and is a concept that should be \npursued to the fullest extent of our capabilities. So I thank the \nSenator. I also thank Senator Nelson, a valued member of the committee, \nfor his involvement in this issue.\n  Again, I hope Senators who have amendments will come to the floor and \nlet us know about them.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I once again thank my colleague from Arizona for helping \nus with this list and his commitment in terms of keeping this in the \nconference and then making sure the FTC moves forward with this in \nevery technological way possible. I very much appreciate it. As I \nmentioned before, the Senator is a true gentleman, a man of his word. \nWe would not be here today without his good work.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think the Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield, but first, to add to my remarks, I \nbelieve Senator Enzi may have an amendment as well.\n  I thank my friend from New York for his comments and I yield to the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I say to the Senator from New York, I appreciate his \npatience on this. I think he knows from the outset my concern was not \nwith the nature of this, because clearly empowering consumers to make \nthese kinds of choices is essential. What is important is to try to \nfigure out how to do this right.\n  The Senator from New York knows people change their e-mail addresses \nconstantly. In that sense, this is different than a telephone. We all \nunderstand that if a bad spammer, for example, one of these kingpin \noperators, was to hack into this, what a gold mine for an evil person \nwho wanted to exploit our citizens. The Senator from New York has been \nacutely aware of it and that is why he has worked with me, Senator \nBurns, and all of those on the Commerce Committee. I commend him for \nhis patience.\n  This is an important contribution. We have a lot of work to do, \nbecause we have seen with the Do Not Call list what the challenge is. I \npersonally believe in the telecommunications area we ought to \nestablish, as kind of a bedrock principle, that there is a First \nAmendment right to communicate, but there also is a right of the \nconsumer to say, I have had it. In effect, that is what the Senator \nfrom New York is allowing us to do in the spam area, and to do it in a \nresponsible way.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for giving me this time. With a \nlittle luck, we will be able to dispose of the additional spam \namendments and send this bill on its way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I again urge my colleagues, particularly \nSenators Santorum, Hatch, Corzine, and Enzi, to come to the floor to \ngive us their amendments so we can move expeditiously.\n  I also intend to propose a unanimous consent agreement in about 15 \nminutes that there be no further amendments in order at that time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1893\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), for himself, Mr. Leahy, \n     Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Schumer proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1893.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To revise the criminal penalty provisions of the bill as \n                   reported, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 43, beginning with line 11, strike through the \n     matter appearing between lines 10 and 11 on page 44 and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4.

Madam President, I rise today with Senator Leahy, Senator \nNelson of Florida, and Senator Schumer to offer an amendment to the CAN \nSPAM Act of 2003. This amendment strengthens the act's criminal \nprovisions by incorporating key provisions of the Criminal Spam Act of \n2003, which I worked closely with Senators Leahy, Grassley, Schumer, \nNelson of Florida and others to draft earlier this year and which was \nfavorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee. To send an effective \nand adequate message of deterrence to the most egregious spammers, \nstiff criminal penalties must be an element of any comprehensive anti-\nspam legislative package.\n  Over the course of the past several Congresses we have become more \nand more aware of the problems associated with unsolicited commercial \ne-mail, or spam. Rarely a minute passes that American consumers and \ntheir children are not bombarded with e-mail messages that promote \npornographic web sites, illegally pirated software, bogus charities, \npyramid schemes and other ``get rich quick'' or ``make money fast'' \nscams.\n  The rapid increase in the volume of spam has imposed enormous costs \non our economy--potentially $10 billion in 2003 alone--as well as \nunprecedented risks on our children and other vulnerable components of \nour society. Spam has become the tool of choice for those who \ndistribute pornography and indulge in fraud schemes. We all know of \nchildren who have opened unsolicited e-mail messages with benign \nsubject lines only to be exposed to sexually explicit images. We have \nheard of seniors using their hard earned savings to buy fraudulent \nhealth care products advertised on-line or of being duped into sharing \nsensitive personal information to later find themselves victims of \nidentity and credit card theft.\n  We cannot afford to stand idle and continue to allow sophisticated \nspammers to use abusive tactics to send millions of e-mail messages \nquickly, at an extremely low cost, with no repercussions. The sheer \nvolume of spam, which is growing at an exponential rate, is \noverwhelming entire network systems, as well as consumers' in-boxes. By \nyear end, it is estimated that 50 percent of all e-mail traffic will be \nspam. It is no exaggeration to say that spam is threatening the future \nviability of all e-commerce. The time has come to curb the growth of \nspam on all fronts--through aggressive civil and criminal enforcement \nactions, as well as innovative technological solutions.\n  The criminal provisions that make up this amendment are intended to \ntarget those who use fraudulent and deceptive means to send unwanted e-\nmail messages. A recent study conducted by the Federal Trade Commission \ndemonstrates that this is no small number. According to the FTC, 66 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S13029]]\n\nspam contains some kind of false, fraudulent, or misleading \ninformation, and one-third of all spam contains a fraudulent return e-\nmail address that is included in the routing information, or header, of \nthe e-mail message. By concealing their identities, spammers succeed in \nevading Internet filters, luring consumers into opening messages, and \npreventing consumers, ISPs and investigators from tracking them down to \nstop their unwelcomed messages.\n\n  This amendment significantly strengthens the criminal penalties \ncontained in the CAN SPAM Act by striking its misdemeanor false header \noffense and replacing it with five new felony offenses. The amendment \nmakes it a crime to hack into a computer, or to use a computer system \nthat the owner has made available for other purposes, as a conduit for \nbulk commercial e-mail. It prohibits sending bulk commercial e-mail \nthat conceals the true source, destination, routing or authentication \ninformation of the e-mail, or is generated from multiple e-mail \naccounts or domain names that falsify the identity of the actual \nregistrant. It also prohibits sending bulk commercial e-mail that is \ngenerated from multiple e-mail accounts or domain names that falsify \nthe identity of the actual registrant, or from Internet Protocol, IP, \naddresses that have been hijacked from their true assignees.\n  The amendment includes stiff penalties intended to deter the most \nabusive spammers. Recidivists and those who send spam to commit another \nfelony face a sentence of up to 5 years' imprisonment. Those who hack \ninto another's computer system to send spam, those who send large \nnumbers of spam, and spam kingpins who direct others in their spam \noperations, face up to 3 years' imprisonment. Other illegal spammers \nface up to a year in prison. The amendment provides additional \ndeterrence with criminal forfeiture provisions and the potential for \nsentencing enhancements for those who generate e-mail addresses through \nharvesting and dictionary attacks.\n  I commend Senators Burns, Wyden, McCain, and Hollings for their hard \nwork over the course of the past several Congresses on the CAN SPAM \nAct. They have worked diligently to enhance the privacy of consumers \nwithout unnecessarily burdening legitimate electronic commerce. The \nbalance is a difficult one to strike. I compliment these fine Senators \nfor being able to strike that balance and get it done.\n  I believe enactment of the CAN SPAM Act is an important first step \ntoward curbing predatory and abusive commercial e-mail, but it is \ncertainly not the end. We all recognize that there is no single \nsolution to the spam problem. While we must critically and continually \nmonitor the effectiveness of any legislative solution we enact, we must \npursue other avenues as well. Technological fixes, education and \ninternational enforcement are integral components to any effective \nsolution. To this end, we will need the assistance of private industry \nand our international partners.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in both Houses as we \nattempt to confront the spam problem on all fronts. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment which will strengthen the \ncomprehensive legislative package that is before us today.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, will the Senator from Utah yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I commend the Senator from Utah for his efforts in this \narea. The contribution the Senator from Utah makes is not just useful \nbut it is absolutely critical. We can write bills to fight spam until \nwe run out of paper, but unless we have the kind of enforcement the \nSenator from Utah envisions, we are not going to get the job right.\n  I am particularly interested in working with the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee in making sure we have some \nvigorous oversight after this bill is enacted into law. If after this \nbill is passed we have the prosecutors, the Federal Trade Commission, \nand others bring some tough enforcement actions, that will be a \ntremendously valuable deterrent.\n  I would like to work with the distinguished chairman of the committee \nto have some vigorous oversight hearings after this bill has gone into \neffect. That is what it is going to take to make sure we have the teeth \nin this legislation to make a difference. I thank my colleague.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for those kind remarks and thank him \nand Senator McCain for their leadership in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Grassley as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment, No. 1893. Senator Grassley has worked with me and \nSenator Leahy every step of the way and deserves a lot of credit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy for their work to \nimprove the criminal provisions and strengthen the Burns-Wyden CAN-SPAM \nAct. The active participation of Senator Hatch and his committee on \nthis issue has been extremely valuable.\n  I join my friend from Oregon in urging Senator Hatch to have \noversight on how this law is enforced and that it is properly done. We \nface challenges in enforcement of this act, particularly in light of \nthe changes in technology that will inevitably occur which will make \nthis legislation even harder to enforce than it is today. I thank \nSenator Hatch, and I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I encourage the adoption of this amendment. I \nam one of the cosponsors along with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy. \nLet me state for the Record the essence of part of a colloquy between \nmyself and Senator Leahy.\n  We have all been stunned by how pervasive spam has become in e-mail \ntraffic. We have experienced the way the clogged inboxes, the unwanted \nsolicitations, and the unwelcome pornographic material make a session \non the computer less productive and less enjoyable.\n  I detailed earlier in my remarks the innumerable pornographic \nmessages that come into my Senate office computer in my offices back in \nFlorida. It is one of the top complaints I receive from my \nconstituents. I am very pleased to be working with the Senators from \nUtah and Vermont to impose tough penalties on those who impose this \ngarbage on others.\n  I am always concerned with the type of spam that goes beyond the mere \nnuisance variety. It is becoming clear with each passing month that \nmany criminal enterprises have adopted spam as their method of choice \nfor perpetrating criminal schemes. Spammers are now frequently \nperpetrating fraud to cheat people out of their savings, stealing \npeople's identities, or trafficking in child pornography. What spam \nallows them to do is to conduct these criminal activities on a much \nbroader scale at dramatically reduced costs. They can literally reach \nmillions of people at the push of a button.\n  I have given the example in the old days that someone would use the \nmail to send out 100 or 150 letters. They would have nefarious schemes \nsuch as bilking senior citizens out of money or perpetrating child \npornography. Now they do not send out 150 letters to do it. They punch \na button and they are sending out 150 million e-mail messages \nperpetrating their schemes of fleecing senior citizens or perpetrating \nchild pornography.\n\n  The colloquy I propose with Senator Leahy at his convenience would be \nto reinforce a ban--which is why I had originally introduced S. 1052--\nin the Deceptive Unsolicited Bulk Electronic Mail Act. I introduced \nthat with Senator Pryor. That is why I have sought, with the help of \nthe Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Utah, to include \nprovisions in this legislation that make it clear our intent to treat \nthe use of spam to commit large-scale criminal activity as the \norganized crime that it is.\n  We do it in two ways. First, by working with the United States \nSentencing Commission in the amendment being offered by the Senators \ntoward enhanced sentences for those who use spam or other unsolicited \nbulk e-mail to commit fraud, identity theft, obscenity, child \npornography, or the sexual exploitation of children.\n  Second, we make the seriousness of our intentions clear in this \namendment by urging prosecutors to use all the tools at their disposal, \nincluding RICO, to bring down the criminal enterprises that are \nfacilitated by the use of spam.\n  Specifically, we are talking about the RICO statute which not only \ncomes\n\n[[Page S13030]]\n\nwith some of the stiffest penalties in the Criminal Code but it allows \nfor the seizure of assets of criminal organizations, it allows the \nprosecutors to go after the criminal enterprise, and it allows for \ncivil suits brought by injured parties. It is tough enforcement like \nthis that will help bring the worst of the spammers to their knees.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask consent that the following \namendments be the only first-degree amendments in order to the bill and \nthat they be subject to second-degrees which would be relevant to the \nfirst degree to which they are offered: Corzine amendment, Santorum \namendment, Enzi amendment, Landrieu amendment, and Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Harkin's name to \nthat list and then I support the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arizona so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do modify my request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Where is the Hatch-Leahy amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Pending and about to be adopted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is not precluded by the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). It would not be precluded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for his work on this \namendment, along with Senator Hatch, who lends and contributes a great \ndeal of teeth to this bill. I know they have worked very hard.\n  As I mentioned to Senator Hatch, as did the Senator from Oregon, we \nknow that the Senator and his committee will be involved in the \noversight of the enforcement of this legislation. We thank you for his \nvaluable contribution.\n  I urge the sponsors of those amendments, Senators Corzine, Santorum, \nEnzi, Landrieu, Boxer, and Harkin, to please come to the floor in \ncourtesy to their colleagues so we can take up and dispose of these \namendments. Please show some courtesy to your colleagues. If you have \namendments pending, please come. We are ready for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Senator from Arizona asked to make \nhis unanimous consent request, I was in the process of answering the \nquestion of the Senator from Florida, who has spoken to me many times \nabout his interest in these areas.\n  I appreciate what he has done to strengthen this legislation.\n  We keep the authority to set sentences where it belongs, with the \nSentencing Commission, while remaining deferential, to the discretion \nof prosecutors.\n  The provisions from the Senator from Florida make it unmistakably \nclear that Congress expects this legislation to be used not just to \npunish spammers but also to dismantle criminal operations that are \ncarried out with spam and other unsolicited bulk e-mail.\n  I also would note that the Senator from Florida has spoken about spam \nevolving from being just a nuisance. He is absolutely right. Serious \ncrimes are being committed using this medium, which reaches a large \nnumber of people. Senior citizens are more and more often targeted to \nbeing bilked out of millions of dollars, and with very little effort on \nthe part of the spammers.\n  Mr. President, I will engage in a colloquy with Senator Nelson \nbecause I think it is important for the purposes of the Record. With \nall the work the Senator from Florida has done, I want the Record to be \nvery clear.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, would the Senator from Vermont \nbe willing to engage me in a colloquy?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have been stunned, as have so \nmany of my colleagues, by how pervasive spam has become in email \ntraffic. We have all experienced the way clogged in-boxes, unwanted \nsolicitations, and unwelcome pornographic material make a session on \nthe computer less productive and less enjoyable. It is one of the top \ncomplaints that I receive from my constituents, and I am very pleased \nto be working with the Senators from Vermont and Utah to impose tough \npenalties on those who impose this garbage on others.\n  But I am also concerned with a type of spam that goes beyond the mere \nnuisance variety. It is becoming clearer with each passing month that \nmany criminal enterprises have adopted spam as their method of choice \nfor perpetrating their criminal schemes. Spammers are now frequently \nperpetrating fraud to cheat people out of their savings, stealing \npeople's identities, or trafficking in child pornography. What spam \nallows them to do is to conduct these criminal activities on a much \nbroader scale at dramatically reduced costs--they can literally reach \nmillions of people at the push of a button.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Florida is correct. Nowadays, we see that \nspam has moved far beyond being just a nuisance to people trying to use \nemail on their personal computers. Serious crimes are being committed \nusing this medium, which can reach large numbers of people in a matter \nof seconds. For example, if a person or organization seeks to commit \nfraud to bilk senior citizens out of their money, with spam they can \nreach millions of potential victims at very low, even negligible costs. \nWith such low costs, and such wide reach, even a small rate of success \ncan make for a very profitable criminal enterprise.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from Vermont has provided an \nexcellent example of the problem that we are trying to address. And \nthat is why I have sought, with the help of the Senator from Vermont \nand the Senator from Utah, to include provisions in this legislation \nthat make clear our intent to treat the use of spam to commit large-\nscale criminal activity as the organized crime that it is.\n  We do this in two ways: First, by working with the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission toward enhanced sentences for those who use spam or other \nunsolicited bulk email to commit fraud, identity theft, obscenity, \nchild pornography, or the sexual exploitation of children.\n  Second, we make the seriousness of our intentions clear by urging \nprosecutors to use all tools at their disposal to bring down the \ncriminal enterprises that are facilitated by the use of spam. Among \nother things, we are talking about the RICO statute, which not only \ncomes with some of the stiffest penalties in the criminal code, but \nalso allows for the seizure of the assets of criminal organizations, \nand for civil suits brought by injured parties. It is tough enforcement \nlike this that will help bring the worst of the spammers to their \nknees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Florida has made me aware of his interest \nin these provisions on several occasions, and I appreciate his \ncontributions to this effort. They strengthen the legislation in \nimportant ways. While keeping the authority to set sentences where it \nbelongs--with the Sentencing Commission--and while remaining \ndeferential to the discretion of prosecutors, these provisions makes \nunmistakably clear that Congress expects this legislation to be used \nnot just to punish spammers, but also to dismantle the criminal \nenterprises that are carried out with spam and other unsolicited bulk \ne-mail.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \noutstanding leadership on this issue, and for his cooperation in \nincluding my amendments in the legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is increasingly obvious that unwanted \ncommercial e-mail is more than just a nuisance. Businesses and \nindividuals sometimes have to wade through hours of spam. It makes it \nimpossible for them to do their work. It slows down whole enterprises.\n  In my home State of Vermont, one legislator logged on to his server \nand found that two-thirds of the e-mails in his inbox were spam. Our \nlegislator is a citizen or legislature. He does not have staff or \nanything else. This was after the legislator had installed spam-\nblocking software. His computer stopped about 80 percent of it. But \neven\n\n[[Page S13031]]\n\nafter he blocked 80 percent, two-thirds of the e-mail he had was spam.\n  The e-mail users are having the online equivalent of the experience \nof the woman in the classic Monty Python skit. She wanted to order a \nSpam-free breakfast at a restaurant. Try as she might, she cannot get \nthe waitress to bring her the meal she wants. Every dish in the \nrestaurant comes with Spam; it is just a matter of how much. There is \neggs, bacon, and Spam; eggs, bacon, sausage, and Spam; Spam, bacon, \nsausage, and Spam; Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon, and Spam; Spam, \nsausage, Spam, Spam, Spam, bacon, Spam, tomato, and Spam, and so on. \nFinally, the customer said: I don't like Spam. I don't want Spam. I \nhate Spam.\n  Now, I repeat that with apologies to John Cleese and everybody else \nin the Monty Python skit.\n  Mr. President, anybody who goes on e-mail, including every member of \nmy family down to my 5-year-old grandchild, knows how annoying spam can \nbe.\n  A Harris poll taken last year found that 80 percent of the \nrespondents viewed spam as ``very annoying'' and 74 percent wanted to \nmake it illegal.\n  Some 30 States now have anti-spam laws but it is difficult to enforce \nthem.\n  There are actually billions of unwanted e-mails that are blocked by \nISPs every day. Hundreds of millions of spam e-mails get through just \nthe same.\n  Now, we have to be very careful when we regulate in cyberspace. We \nmust not forget that spam, like more traditional forms of commercial \nspeech, is protected by the first amendment. We cannot allow spam to \nresult in the ``virtual death'' of the Internet, as one Vermont \nnewspaper put it.\n  So what Senator Hatch and I have offered and is being accepted--the \nHatch-Leahy-Nelson-Schumer amendment--would, first, prohibit hacking \ninto another person's computer system and sending bulk spam from or \nthrough that system.\n  Second, it would prohibit using a computer system that the owner \nmakes available for other purposes as a conduit for bulk spam, with the \nintent to deceive the recipient as to where the spam came from.\n  The third prohibition targets another way that outlaw spammers evade \nISP filters: falsifying the ``header information'' that accompanies \nevery e-mail and sending bulk spam containing that fake header \ninformation. The amendment prohibits forging information regarding the \norigin of the e-mail message.\n  Fourth, the Hatch-Leahy-Nelson-Schumer amendment prohibits \nregistering for multiple e-mail accounts or Internet domain names and \nsending bulk mail from those accounts or domains.\n  Fifth, and finally, our amendment addresses a major hacker spammer \ntechnique for hiding identity that is a common and pernicious \nalternative to domain name registration--that is, hijacking unused \nexpanses of Internet address space and using them to launch junk mail.\n  Now, penalties under the amendment are tough, but they are measured. \nRecidivists and those who send spam in furtherance of another felon may \nbe imprisoned for up to 5 years. The sound of a jail cell closing for 5 \nyears should focus their attention.\n  Large-volume spammers, those who hack into another person's computer \nsystem to send bulk spam, and spam ``kingpins'' who use others to \noperate their spamming operations may be imprisoned for up to 3 years, \nand so on.\n  Then, of course, we direct the Sentencing Commission to look at other \nareas.\n  So, Mr. President, I see my colleagues on the floor, Senator Burns \nand Senator Wyden, who have done yeoman work on this legislation. I \ncompliment all those who worked together. I certainly compliment the \ntwo of them, as well as Senator Hatch, Senator Nelson, and Senator \nSchumer. I think we are putting together something that is worth \npassing.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Sure.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just before he leaves the floor, I thank \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont for all his help. I have already \ntold Senator Hatch how incredibly important the enforcement provision \nis. You can write bills forever, but without the enforcement to which \nthe Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Utah are committed, those \nbills are not going to get the job done.\n  Suffice it to say, when there were a lot of people in public life who \nthought their computers were somehow a TV screen, the Senator from \nVermont was already leading the Senate and those who work in the public \npolicy arena to understand the implications of the medium.\n  There is nobody in public life whose counsel I value more on \ntelecommunications and Internet policy than the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont. I appreciate his giving me this opportunity to work with \nhim on the enforcement provisions. It will be the lifeblood of making \nthis bill work.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Oregon for his \nfar too generous words. I have enjoyed working with him. He has carried \nover from his service in the other body. He has a strong interest in \nthis. Just as important as his strong interest is the fact he has \nextraordinary expertise in this area. That is very helpful.\n  If you would allow me one quick personal story. This sort of humbles \nyou. I like to think I am very knowledgeable on this. My 5-year-old \ngrandson climbed in my lap and asked me to log on to a particular \ninteractive site for children. It is something he could do himself, but \nwe don't let him log on himself because of the problems with some sites \nthat appear to be for children, and are anything but.\n  So I log on for him, and he climbs up on my lap, takes the mouse out \nof my hand and says: I better take over now because it gets very \ncomplicated.\n  In some ways we are protecting those 5-year-olds because they are the \nnext generation using this technology. I thank my friend from Oregon \nand good friend from Montana for the enormous amount of work they have \ndone here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I might add, Senator Leahy and I serve as \ncochairs on the Internet caucus. We understand the ramifications of \nthis new medium that has come upon us, its importance, and all it has \nto offer. Of course, getting rid of spam is one of those things that if \nwe don't do it, then I am afraid it will be the one that chokes this \nvery new way of communicating and brings us not only information but \nnew services.\n  I appreciate the work of the Senator from Vermont and thank him for \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been watching. Everybody is pretty \nmuch congratulating everybody else. Let me add my congratulations. This \nis an important issue. There are some serious people who have done \nserious work on this matter.\n  I don't know where the word spam came from. I suspect someone has \ndescribed that today. It is a luncheon meat in northern Minnesota in \nour region of the country. But spam is a term used to describe those \nunsolicited messages that are sent into your computer. It has become \nmuch more than just a nuisance. It was not too long ago, perhaps even a \nyear or two, these unsolicited notices you receive through e-mail and \nother devices were a nuisance. Now it is a very serious problem. Log on \nto your computer and see what happens. You have intruders in that \ncomputer, and they are flagging for you gambling sites and dating sites \nand pornography, virtually everything. Go to your e-mail and find out \nhow many unsolicited e-mails you have had. You have more friends than \nyou thought you had. Dozens and dozens of people and groups are writing \nto you. Most of them, of course, are pornographic, and they are \nunsolicited kinds of messages you wouldn't want to explore, nor would \nyou want your family to explore.\n  If this afternoon someone drove up in front of your house with a \ntruck and knocked on the front door and said: I have some actors in the \nback of this truck of mine, and we want to come into your home because \nwe know you have a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old child, we would like \nto put on a show for you, it is going to be a pornographic sex show, \nyou would go to the phone and call the police. The police would come \nand arrest them, and they would be prosecuted. Yet there are people who \ncome into our homes and put on these pornographic sex shows through the \ncomputer--yes, to\n\n[[Page S13032]]\n\nunsuspecting children. Yes, it happens all the time. We know it. That \nis why we are trying to determine what can we do to stop it.\n  There is a right of free speech, but no stranger has a right to \nentertain 10-year-old kids in your home or our home with pornography. \nNo stranger has that right. That does not exist as a right of free \nspeech.\n  The question is, what kind of legislation can we craft that addresses \nthis in a serious way. There is so much spam on the Internet. I am \ndescribing pornography, but there are so many commercial and other \ndevices with unsolicited messages that it almost completely overwhelms \nthe use of e-mail. It clogs the arteries of commerce for which the \nInternet and e-mail have been very valuable.\n  In the last couple of years, we have a circumstance where 46 percent \nof all e-mail traffic in the month of April this year was spam. It was \nonly 18 percent in April of 2002, more than double in just a year. It \ndoes clog the arteries of commerce. It exposes children to things that \nare harmful and inappropriate. The question is, what can we do about \nit.\n  This legislation is an attempt to try to address it. We will best \ncongratulate ourselves if and after the legislation is passed, in \nforce, and we determine it works. If and when that is the case, then we \nall should say congratulations for having done something useful. We \nhave, of course, tried this before. The Supreme Court struck down \nlegislation that came from the Commerce Committee dealing with this \nissue. I think this is a better way to approach it. It is more \nserious, more thoughtful, and more likely to be able to meet the test \nof being constitutional.\n\n  We in the Commerce Committee have worked on other issues similar to \nthis, not so much dealing with spam but especially protecting children.\n  Senator Ensign and I coauthored legislation dealing with a new domain \nname. We are creating a new domain in this country called dot U.S., \njust like there is a domain dot U.K. We will have a new one called dot \nU.S. We decided by legislation we would attach to that domain a \ncondition that they must also create a domain within dot U.S. called \ndot kids dot U.S. That will be a domain in which parents know that when \ntheir children are in dot kids dot U.S., any site in dot kids dot U.S., \nthey are going to be seeing things that are only appropriate for \nchildren. That is going to be a big help to parents.\n  If you restrict the child to dot kids dot U.S. and you know that \nchild is not going to be exposed to things children should not be \nexposed to, that is legislation that is going to be very helpful.\n  Let me also say this piece of legislation dealing with spam is \nsimilarly helpful. We have a circumstance where what shows up on the \ncomputers of virtually every American is not only unsolicited messages \nbut messages that come from anonymous sources all over the world, \nmessages that contain things you don't have any interest in, that are \ngrotesque, unwanted, and pornographic. You can't determine where they \ncome from.\n  This legislation, along with the amendments being offered, moves \nexactly in the right direction to prohibit false and misleading \ntransmission of information. It prohibits the knowing use of deceptive \nsubject headings, requires a return address or comparable reply message \nso you can figure out who sent it, requires the UCE be self-identified \nas an advertisement or a solicitation. All of these things are very \nimportant. At the end of time, when we have passed this legislation, it \nis in force, and we determine it is workable, then we will know we have \ndone something very significant.\n  Let me make one additional point. I think computers and the Internet \nare quite remarkable. It is difficult to find words to describe how \nwonderful it can be. To be in a town like my hometown of nearly 300 \npeople and have access through the Internet to the biggest library in \nthe world, have access on the Internet to the great museums of the \nworld. I grew up in a small town, with a high school senior class of \nnine. We had a library the size of a coat closet. With the Internet, \nthat school now has a library the size of the largest library in the \nworld, the largest repository of human knowledge existing anywhere on \nEarth--the Library of Congress. Yes, that exists in my hometown by \nvirtue of the Internet.\n\n  The Internet is remarkable, wonderful, and breathtaking. It opens \nvistas of new opportunities for all Americans. We are dealing with the \nother side of the Internet because there are two sides to this issue. \nThe other side contains some very serious issues and problems. We can \ncontinue to ignore them at our peril, at the peril of our children, and \nat the peril of business and commerce, which relies on the Internet as \nan artery of commerce. We can ignore them or we can address them, as my \ncolleagues, Senators Wyden and Burns, chose to do with their leadership \nin the Commerce Committee. I thank them and I also thank the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, and Senator Hollings.\n  We have a great committee, one on which I am proud to serve. We do a \nlot of work and address a lot of issues. This is but one, but it is a \nvery important one and it is a timely piece of legislation to bring to \nthe floor. It appears that, based on the unanimous consent request, \nthis will now move and, with some amendments being offered, I think we \nwill get to final passage. I expect to have a very strong vote by the \nentire Senate because it is a good piece of legislation. The time to do \nthis is now and this is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota for his \nkind words. I tell all Senators, both here and watching, that the Boxer \namendment has been withdrawn. That gets us down to where we could get \nthis bill passed tonight.\n  I believe the pending business is the Hatch-Leahy amendment No. 1893. \nI call for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1893) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we are very close to being able to pass \nthis bill tonight. This is an extraordinarily important consumer \nmeasure, a measure that literally touches the lives of millions of \npeople every single day. At this point, we have only three amendments \nleft. The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, has an amendment; the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, is to offer an amendment with Senator \nSantorum; and then Senator Landrieu has an amendment.\n  I am very hopeful we will be able to finish this bill fairly shortly. \nI urge those Senators who have their amendments in order to come to the \nfloor at this point. This is legislation that has been worked on for \nmore than 4 years. During that time, this problem has grown \nexponentially. A number of Senators have spoken about it, and the \nSenate ought to move ahead.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nin morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      The Internet Tax Freedom Act\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in our political speeches, Senators, \nespecially we Republicans, have a lot to say in defense of the Tenth \nAmendment, that all powers not expressly given to the central \ngovernment are reserved to the States. We are big talkers about local \ncontrol, about State responsibilities, and about State rights.\n  Somehow, when we get to Washington and away from home, a lot of that \ngoes up in smoke. We start thinking of grand ideas and sending State \nand local governments the bill to pay for our grand ideas. Special \neducation for children with disabilities, but we say to the State and \nlocal governments, you pay the bill. New construction to stop storm \nwater runoff, but we\n\n[[Page S13033]]\n\nsay to the cities, you pay the bill. Higher standards for roads, we say \nto the States, you pay the bill. New standards for highly qualified \nteachers, you pay the bill. We call these unfunded mandates.\n  What I want to talk about today is the worst kind of unfunded \nmandate. Not only do we have grand ideas and are telling State and \nlocal governments that they have to pay for them, we now want to tell \nthem how to pay for them. The latest such example is to tell State and \nlocal governments that a tax on Internet access or telephones is \nsomehow a worse tax, a bad tax they should not be allowed to pursue, \nthan a tax on medicine, food, or an income tax.\n  I supported a moratorium for 7 years on State and local access to the \nInternet so the Internet could get up and get going, but now it is up \nand going. It ought to be absolutely on its own with other commercial \nactivity. Yet our friends in the House of Representatives and some in \nthe Senate would not only extend the moratorium on State and local \ntaxes on Internet access, they would broaden it.\n  This is none of the Congress's business. It is a State and local \nresponsibility to decide how to pay the bill to fund State parks, local \nschools, roads, prisons, colleges, and universities. That is what \nGovernors do. That is what legislators do. That is what mayors do. That \nis what county commissioners and city council men and women do.\n  The inevitable result of such unfunded mandates from Washington, DC, \ntelling States what taxes they can and cannot use, is to transfer more \ngovernment to Washington, DC, because here we can print money to pay \nfor it. It sounds awfully good to say we are banning a tax, but what we \nare actually doing is favoring one tax over another tax with the \ndecision made in Washington, DC.\n  For example, if Tennessee's ability to have a broad-based sales tax \nis limited, then the chances that Tennessee will have an income tax are \nhigher, or a higher tax on medicine or food, or higher college tuition \nfor families to pay. The same goes for Florida, Texas, Washington \nState, or any other State.\n  Some say this interference in State prerogatives and local \nprerogatives is justified by the interstate commerce clause of the \nConstitution, and that the Internet is too important to carry its fair \nshare of the taxes. I ask: Is access to the Internet more important \nthan food? If not, then why not limit the State sales tax on food, \nmedicine, electricity, natural gas, water, corporations generally, car \ntags, telephones, cable TV? They are all in interstate commerce. Let us \nlimit the tax on all of them from Washington, DC.\n  Unless we want to get rid of State and local governments and transfer \nall responsibilities for local schools, colleges, prisons, State parks, \nand roads to Washington, DC, and claim all wisdom resides here, then we \nhave no business telling State and local governments how they pay the \nbill for legitimate services.\n  We should read the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution and get back \nto our basic job of funding war, welfare, Social Security, Medicare, \nand debt. And leave decisions about what services to provide and what \ntaxes to impose to State and local governments and to State and locally \nelected officials.\n\n  Under the rules of the Senate, because this bill imposes costs on \nStates without paying for them, it is an unfunded mandate and subject \nto a point of order to pass this bill that would extend the moratorium \non State and local ability to tax access to the Internet.\n  In its cost estimate of September 9, 2003, the Congressional Budget \nOffice determined that S. 150, as reported by the Commerce Committee, \nwould impose direct costs on State and local governments of lost \nrevenues of $80 million to $120 million per year beginning in 2007. \nBecause the estimate exceeds the threshold of $64 million for 2007, \nthis is an intergovernmental mandate, subject to a point of order. \nAccording to the Multi-state Tax Commission, the bill has the potential \nto exempt telephone and cable companies from a broad array of State and \nlocal taxes that could amount to an unfunded mandate on State and local \ngovernments of up to $9 billion a year. Every Senator who votes to \noverturn the point of order to this bill would be voting for an \nunfunded mandate, which most of us have promised not to do. Let the \nmoratorium on access to the Internet die a well-deserved and natural \ndeath when it expires on November 1 and let us remember the Republican \nCongress 10 years ago promised to end unfunded mandates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that certain information from the \nCongressional Budget Act describing unfunded mandates and the point of \norder that is possible to be raised in opposition to such mandates be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate]\n\n               S. 150--INTERNET TAX NONDISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n\n As ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n                    Transportation on July 31, 2003.\n\n                                Summary\n\n       S. 150 would permanently extend a moratorium on certain \n     state and local taxation of online services and electronic \n     commerce, and after October 1, 2006, would eliminate an \n     exception to that prohibition for certain states. Under \n     current law, the moratorium is set to expire on November 1, \n     2003. CBO estimates that enacting S. 150 would have no impact \n     on the federal budget, but beginning in 2007, it would impose \n     significant annual costs on some state and local governments.\n       By extending and expanding the moratorium on certain types \n     of state and local taxes, S. 150 would impose an \n     intergovernmental mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the mandate would cause \n     state and local governments to lose revenue beginning in \n     October 2006; those losses would exceed the threshold \n     established in UMRA ($64 million in 2007, adjusted annually \n     for inflation) by 2007. While there is some uncertainty about \n     the number of states affected, CBO estimates that the direct \n     costs to states and local governments would probably total \n     between $80 million and $120 million annually, beginning in \n     2007. The bill contains no new private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA.\n\n                Estimated Cost to the Federal Government\n\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 150 would have no impact on \n     the federal budget.\n\n            Intergovernmental Mandates Contained in the Bill\n\n       The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) currently prohibits \n     state and local governments from imposing taxes on Internet \n     access until November 1, 2003. The ITFA, enacted as Public \n     Law 105-277 on October 21, 1998, also contains an exception \n     to this moratorium, sometimes referred to as the \n     ``grandfather clause,'' which allows certain state and local \n     governments to tax Internet access if such tax was generally \n     imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998.\n       S. 150 would make the moratorium permanent and, after \n     October 1, 2006, would eliminate the grandfather clause. The \n     bill also would state that the term ``Internet access'' or \n     ``Internet access services'' as defined in ITFA would not \n     include telecommunications services except to the extent that \n     such services are used to provide Internet access (known as \n     ``aggregating'' or ``bundling'' of services). These \n     extensions and expansions of the moratorium constitute \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA because they \n     would prohibit states from collecting taxes that they \n     otherwise could collect.\n\n   Estimated Direct Costs of Mandates to State and Local Governments\n\n       CBO estimates that repealing the grandfather clause would \n     result in revenue losses for as many as 10 states for several \n     local governments totaling between $80 million and $120 \n     million annually, beginning in 2007. We also estimate that \n     the change in the definition of Internet access could affect \n     tax revenues for many states and local governments, but we \n     cannot estimate the magnitude or the timing of any such \n     additional impacts at this time.\n       UMRA includes in its definition of the direct costs of a \n     mandate the amounts that state and local governments would be \n     prohibited from raising in revenues to comply with the \n     mandate. The direct costs of eliminating the grandfather \n     clause would be the tax revenues that state and local \n     governments are currently collecting but would be precluded \n     from collecting under S. 150. States also could lose revenues \n     that they currently collect on certain services, if those \n     services are redefined as Internet access under the bill.\n       Over the next five years there will likely be changes in \n     the technology and the market for Internet access. Such \n     changes are likely to affect, at minimum, the price for \n     access to the Internet as well as the demand for and the \n     methods of such access. How these technological and market \n     changes will ultimately affect state and local tax revenues \n     is unclear, but for the purposes of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that over the next five years, these effects will \n     largely offset each other, keeping revenues from taxes on \n     Internet access within the current range.\n\n[[Page S13034]]\n\n                         the grandfather clause\n\n       The primary budget impact of this bill would be the revenue \n     losses--starting in October 2006--resulting from eliminating \n     the grandfather clause that currently allows some state and \n     local governments to collect taxes on Internet access. While \n     there is some uncertainty about the number of jurisdictions \n     currently collecting such taxes--and the precise amount of \n     those collections--CBO believes that as many as 10 states \n     (Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South \n     Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin) and several \n     local jurisdictions in Colorado, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, \n     Washington, and Wisconsin are currently collecting such taxes \n     and that these taxes total between $80 million and $120 \n     million annually. The estimate is based on information from \n     the states involved, from industry sources, and from the \n     Department of Commerce. In arriving at this estimate, CBO \n     took into account the fact that some companies are \n     challenging the applicability of the tax to the service they \n     provide and thus may not be collecting or remitting the taxes \n     even though the states feel they are obligated to do so. So \n     potential liabilities are not included in the estimate.\n       It is possible that if the moratorium were allowed to \n     expire as scheduled under current law, some state and local \n     governments would enact new taxes or decide to apply existing \n     taxes to Internet access during the next five years. It is \n     also possible that some governments would repeal existing \n     taxes or preclude their application to these services. \n     Because such changes are difficult to predict, for the \n     purposes of estimating the direct costs of the mandate, CBO \n     considered only the revenues from taxes that are currently in \n     place and actually being collected.\n\n\n                     definition of internet access\n\n       Depending on how the language altering the definition of \n     what telecommunications services are taxable is interpreted, \n     that language also could result in substantial revenue losses \n     for states and local governments. It is possible that states \n     could lose revenue if services that are currently taxes are \n     redefined as Internet ``access'' under the definition in S. \n     150. Revenues could also be lost if Internet access providers \n     choose to bundle products and call the product Internet \n     access. Such changes would reduce state and local revenues \n     from telecommunications taxes and possibly revenues from \n     content currently subject to sales and use taxes. However, \n     CBO cannot estimate the magnitude of these losses.\n\n                 Estimated Impact on the Private Sector\n\n       This bill would impose no new private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA.\n\n                         Previous CBO Estimate\n\n       On July 21, 2003, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. \n     49, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, as ordered \n     reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on July 16, \n     2003. Unlike H.R. 49, which would eliminate the grandfather \n     clause upon passage, S. 150 would allow the grandfather \n     clause to remain in effect until October 2006.

\n     and\n       * * *\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before the Senator from Tennessee leaves the floor, I say \nto him I have my hands full today with spam so I am not going to get \ninto the substance of the Internet Tax Freedom Act that, as my friend \nknows, I have been a sponsor of in the Senate with Congressman Cox in \nthe other body. I am always anxious to work with my colleague from \nTennessee.\n  Essentially, the arguments being made today against the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act are identical to the ones that were made 5 years ago. If we \nwere to look at the transcript 5 years ago before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, we were told the States and localities would be stripped of \nthe revenue they needed. We were pretty much told western civilization \nwas going to end at that time.\n  Ever since then, as we have gone through 5 years of experience, we \nhave not seen that to be the case. States and localities have not been \nstripped of the revenue they need. Internet sales are still perhaps \nonly 2 percent of the economy. No jurisdiction has shown that they have \nbeen hurt by their inability to discriminate against the Internet, and \nthat is all this law stands for is technological neutrality, treating \nthe online world like the offline world is treated.\n  As I said to my good friend, I have my hands full today with spam so \nwe will debate the Internet Tax Freedom Act another day. I am anxious \nto work with my colleague. I would only point out the reauthorization \nof the Internet Tax Freedom Act passed the Commerce Committee \nunanimously. It is the first time since we have been at this that it \nhas been passed unanimously. I think it is going to be an important \ndebate I will certainly be anxious to talk with my colleague about at \nthat time.\n  Again, we are hoping those with the amendments that have been made in \norder to the spam bill will come to the floor. We could finish this \nlegislation in perhaps half an hour, pass a very important proconsumer \nmeasure by pretty close to a unanimous vote in the Senate. Senator \nBurns and I are certainly hoping that will be the case and hope in \nparticular that Senator Corzine, Senator Enzi, and Senator Santorum \nwill come to the floor and we could be done very quickly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1894\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senators Santorum and Enzi, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Enzi and Mr. \n     Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 1894.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require warning labels on sexually explicit commercial e-\n                                 mail)\n\n       On page 51, after line 22, insert the following:\n       (d) Requirement To Place Warning Labels on Commercial \n     Electronic Mail Containing Sexually Oriented Material.--\n       (1) In general.--No person may initiate in or affecting \n     interstate commerce the transmission, to a protected \n     computer, of any unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     message that includes sexually oriented material and--\n       (A) fail to include in subject heading for the electronic \n     mail message the marks or notices prescribed by the \n     Commission under this subsection; or\n       (B) fail to provide that the matter in the message that is \n     initially viewable to the recipient, when the message is \n     opened by any recipient and absent any further actions by the \n     recipient, includes only--\n       (i) to the extent required or authorized pursuant to \n     paragraph (2), any such marks or notices;\n       (ii) the information required to be included in the message \n     pursuant to subsection (a)(5); and\n       (iii) instructions on how to access, or a mechanism to \n     access, the sexually oriented material.\n       (2) Prescription of marks and notices.--Not later than 120 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Commission in consultation with the Attorney General shall \n     prescribe clearly identifiable marks or notices to be \n     included in or associated with unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail that contains sexually oriented material, in \n     order to inform the recipient of that fact and to facilitate \n     filtering of such electronic mail. The Commission shall \n     publish in the Federal Register and provide notice to the \n     public of the marks or notices prescribed under this \n     paragraph.\n       (3) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``sexually \n     oriented material'' means any material that depicts sexually \n     explicit conduct (as that term is defined in section 2256 of \n     title 18, United States Code), unless the depiction \n     constitutes a small and insignificant part of the whole, the \n     remainder of which is not primarily devoted to sexual \n     matters.\n       (4) Penalty.--A violation of paragraph (1) is punishable as \n     if it were a violation of section 1037(a) of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, today I introduce an amendment to the CAN-\nSPAM Act. As some of my colleagues have already expressed, unsolicited \ncommercial e-mail, also known as\n\n[[Page S13036]]\n\nspam, aggravates many computer users. Not only can it be a nuisance, \nbut its cost may be passed on to consumers in the form of wasted time, \nenergy and money spent to handle and filter out unwanted spam e-mails. \nAlso, e-mail service providers incur substantial costs when they are \nforced to upgrade their equipment to process the millions of spam e-\nmails that they receive every day. Spam e-mail is a time and money \nvacuum. I support the CAN-SPAM Act because it empowers us to stop these \nunwanted and unwelcome e-mails.\n  A recent study conducted by the Federal Trade Commission found that \n66 percent of spam contains false or misleading claims. Another 18 \npercent contains pornographic or adult content. My amendment mandates \nstronger restrictions that would prevent the increasing amount of spam \ne-mail containing explicit content from reaching unintended recipients. \nThere is clearly a need to address this in the CAN-SPAM Act because it \nis potentially the most offensive type of spam on the Internet today. \nThere are sorely misguided individuals--spamers--whose sole mission is \nto e-mail as many people as possible, regardless of age, indecent \nmaterial. Internet users, especially minors, should not be \ninvoluntarily exposed to explicit content by simply checking their e-\nmail inbox. My amendment would protect these people in two ways:\n  First, it would place a notice, approved by the FTC, in the subject \nheader of spam e-mail that contains explicit content. Usually, a \nsubject header is a title line noting the content of the message that \nhas arrived in your inbox. However, in a virtual world already \nsaturated with millions of pieces of spam e-mail, spammers often title \ne-mails with catchy phrases and whatever they think will get the most \npeople to open the message and read their advertisements. Now spam e-\nmail with explicit and offensive material is often camouflaged by an \ninviting and completely misleading subject heading. This is a common \nway that many e-mail users end up being involuntarily exposed to \noffensive sexual content. Adding a notice in the subject heading would \nimmediately alert the computer user that the message contained within \nhas explicit and possibly offensive content and should not be viewed by \nminors. This notice would alert the e-mail recipient and allow him or \nher to organize and filter their mail for any unwanted material.\n  Second, my amendment would require that all spam e-mail with explicit \ncontent add an opening page to all copies of their e-mail being sent to \nunknown recipients. This opening page would not contain any explicit \nimages or text, but instead have a link that would link users to that \ncontent if they wished. This valuable provision would protect minors \nand other e-mail users by requiring that the recipient purposefully act \nand ``click'' in order to get to the explicit images or text. Adding \nthis firewall allows users to opt out of spam e-mail lists and delete \noffensive e-mails from their inbox without ever being exposed to their \ncontent.\n  As a Senator from the rural State of Wyoming, I fully appreciate the \nvalue that the Internet holds for electronic communication and business \nacross long distances. This amendment would allow both communication \nand business to continue and prosper. However, it also takes an \nimportant step in protecting Internet and e-mails users, especially \nminors, from receiving sexually explicit, offensive and unwanted \ncontent in their e-mails. Most people check their inboxes without an \nidea of what might have landed there or who might have sent it. This \namendment makes that process more transparent and gives control back to \nthe Internet user who doesn't want to be exposed to indecent, offensive \nor explicit content.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment by Senators Santorum and \nEnzi requires warning labels on sexually explicit commercial e-mail to \nregulate interstate commerce by imposing limitations and penalties on \nthe transmission of unsolicited commercial electronic mail via the \nInternet.\n  Basically, this amendment says no person may initiate or affect \ninterstate commerce the transmission, to a protected computer, of any \nunsolicited commercial electronic mail message that includes sexually \noriented material and fail to include in the subject heading for the \nelectronic mail message the marks or notices prescribed by the \nCommission, or fail to provide that the matter in the message that is \ninitially viewable to the recipient, when the message is opened by any \nrecipient, and absent any further actions by the recipient, includes \nonly to the extent required or authorized pursuant to any such marks or \nnotices; the information required to be included in the message is \nclear.\n  This amendment also prescribes that not later than 120 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this act, the Commission, the Federal Trade \nCommission, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall prescribe \nclearly identifiable marks or notices to be included in or associated \nwith unsolicited commercial electronic mail that contains sexually \noriented material, in order to inform the recipient of this message, of \nthe material, of that fact to facilitate filtering of such electronic \nmail.\n  As all of us have discussed in consideration of this bill, one of the \ngreat concerns all of us have is pornographic material that is \ntransmitted in the form of spam. According to several experts, 20 \npercent of unsolicited spam is pornography. This is an effort on the \npart of Senators Enzi and Santorum to try to at least begin addressing \nthis issue. It is a valuable and important contribution in the form of \ntrying to identify it and to bring it under control. It would make it a \ncrime to send unsolicited e-mail that contains sexually oriented \nmaterial unless they labeled it as prescribed by the FTC. The criminal \npenalties for this section would be the same as those contained in the \nHatch-Leahy amendment.\n  I strongly support the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nof the distinguished chairman of the committee. Every Member \nunderstands that pornography being transmitted through spam is a \nscourge. There is no question about it. What we have done, because we \nhave just seen this, is we have asked the minority on the Judiciary \nCommittee, under the leadership of Senator Leahy, to take a look at \nthis. We are very hopeful that we will be able to approve this language \nin just a few minutes. Again, we are hoping that this bill will be \npassed, certainly within 20, 25 minutes, and we will have a comment \nfrom the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee very shortly.\n  I share Chairman McCain's view that this is an extremely important \nissue. When you think about spam, the first thing parents all over this \ncountry think about is the flood that is being targeted at families \nfrom coast to coast. I am hopeful we will get this approved in a matter \nof minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, we \nhave a Landrieu amendment which the Senator from Louisiana has been \nkind enough to withdraw, but we need to discuss what we need to do in \nthe form of sending a letter to the Federal Trade Commission \ninstructing them to take certain actions which I will discuss in a \nminute; a Corzine amendment which has two parts to it, which both sides \nhave agreed to; and then I don't believe there will be any further \namendments, although that is not completely clear. We could expect a \nvote on final passage relatively soon.\n  Senator Landrieu was going to offer an amendment that would have \nrequired the Consumer Product Safety Commission to undertake a \nrulemaking to have manufacturers create a database for consumers to be \nnotified of certain product recalls. I have committed to Senator \nLandrieu to work with the CPSC to solicit these views on her \nlegislation and ask how best to accomplish her worthy goals of better \ninforming consumers about product recalls.\n  Senator Landrieu has hit on a very important issue. Unless you happen \nto see it by accident mentioned on television, the recalls are very \nseldom\n\n[[Page S13037]]\n\nknown by at least a majority of those who would be affected by it. I \ncommit to Senator Landrieu to see how we can best accomplish that. I \nappreciate her forbearance at this time in withdrawing the amendment. I \nhope we can satisfy her concerns by asking for rapid action on the part \nof the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, on behalf of the minority, Senator \nHollings believes that Senator Landrieu is raising a very important \nissue for consumers and kids. We do want to work closely with her and \nmove ahead on her initiative. It is an important one for families.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as we are nearing the end, I am waiting \nfor the Corzine amendment that we will discuss and adopt. Then I \nbelieve we will be able to move to final passage. I am not positive, \nbut I think we will be able to. I would like to again express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, and Senator Wyden. \nFour years is a long time to work on a single issue. When these two \nSenators began work on this issue, spam was minuscule as compared to \nwhat it is today. I must admit, I didn't pay much attention to it then, \nnor did the members of the Commerce Committee, nor the oversight \nagencies. Both Senators had the foresight to see the incredible \nproportions that this spamming would reach and the effect that it would \nhave not only on our ability to use e-commerce and e-communications but \nalso on our ability to improve productivity.\n  The costs involved in the spamming issue are pretty incredible when \nyou count it all up according to certain experts.\n  So I thank our staffs who have worked on this for so long. Without \nthe leadership of the Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, and that of \nSenator Wyden, we would not have been able to move this, after several \nhearings in the Commerce Committee, to the floor of the Senate. I have \nsome confidence that our friends on the other side of the Capitol will \nact with some dispatch since they are as wary as we are of the gravity \nof this problem. As soon as we get the Corzine amendment, we will move \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I associate myself with the words of the \nchairman of the committee. Four years ago we started on this, and it \nhas blossomed. I think it was pretty obvious to a lot of us what the \nimpact of the Internet would be on our everyday communications and the \ntechnologies and services and information it provides. But also \nstarting then was this unwanted mail that would show up in your \nmailbox. It didn't mean much at first, but it was obvious to a lot of \nus, who have been working on this legislation for 4 years, that this \nwas something that was going to be picked up by a lot of people--the \ngood, the bad, and the ugly, so to speak.\n  So we went to work on it then and we have been working on it ever \nsince. We thought we had a chance last year to pass it. I would say we \nhad not really done all of our homework, and we didn't get it passed.\n  I appreciate the leadership of both the chairman and ranking member \nof the Commerce Committee and also my good friend from Oregon. We have \nworked hard on this legislation.\n  I really believe, with the debate going on in the House now, that the \ntime has come. I don't go to a townhall meeting or meet a friend who \ndoesn't say: Take care of that spam. I tell my friends also that this \nwill not do it totally. The industry is going to have to come together \nusing new technologies in order to get it done, and I think the \nindustry will now because they know we are serious about criminal \ncharges, fines, the result of violations of this law.\n  So I think we send a very strong message to those people who would \nuse the Internet to do what is not acceptable to the American public.\n  I thank my friends and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I think we are about ready to actually \nmove to final passage. We have the Corzine amendment and another one \ncoming from the Senator from Iowa. I think we are very close to being \nable to move ahead.\n  I wish to express my thanks to the leadership of the committee and my \npartner for over 4 years, Senator Burns, on this legislation.\n  The bottom line here is that when this bill becomes law, big-time \nspamming, in effect, becomes an outlaw business. For the first time, \nthe kingpin spammers are going to be at risk of Federal prosecution, \nFederal Trade Commission enforcement, million-dollar lawsuits by State \nattorneys general and Internet service providers. The reason that is \nthe case is that big-time spammers would have to violate this bill in \norder for their sleazy operations to continue. If they don't hide their \nidentity, their messages will get filtered out. If they don't use \nmisleading subject lines, people are going to go click and these \ngarbage messages will go straight into the trash unread.\n  It seems to me there is a chance now, recognizing that we still need \ninternational cooperation and tough enforcement, to make a very \nsignificant step forward for consumers all across the country.\n  I will conclude by way of saying that, again, I think enforcement is \ngoing to be the key to making this legislation work. When this bill is \nsigned into law, I have been saying that the enforcers--the Justice \nDepartment, State attorneys general, Internet service providers, and \nothers--have to be prepared to come down on those 200 or 300 big-time \nspammers with hobnail boots. A lot of them are not exactly quaking \ntonight at the prospect of Senate action. They are not convinced that \nthe Senate is really going to insist on strong oversight. We saw today, \nbecause of what was said by Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, that they \nare committed to strong enforcement and vigorous oversight.\n  I believe as a result of the attention the Senate has given to this \nissue, when this bill is signed into law, we are going to see very \nquickly a handful of very tough, significant enforcement actions with \nreal penalties and the prospect of spammers going to jail and paying \nmillion-dollar fines. That is the kind of deterrence we need.\n  The text of this law is very important, but it is only as good a law \nas we see backed up by enforcement. We have a commitment today from \nChairman Hatch and Senator Leahy to follow up and ensure that that kind \nof enforcement takes place. With that, I think we take a very \nsignificant step forward in terms of protecting the rights of consumers \nwho right now find a blizzard of spam every single time they turn on \ntheir computer.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we lay \naside the pending amendment so Senator Harkin may be recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1895\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 1895.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(To provide competitive grants for training court reporters and closed \n    captioners to meet requirements for realtime writers under the \n        Telecommunications Act of 1996, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Training for Realtime \n     Writers Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As directed by Congress in section 723 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page S13038]]\n\n     613), as added by section 305 of the Telecommunications Act \n     of 1996 (Public Law 104-104; 110 Stat. 126), the Federal \n     Communications Commission adopted rules requiring closed \n     captioning of most television programming, which gradually \n     require new video programming to be fully captioned beginning \n     in 2006.\n       (2) More than 28,000,000 Americans, or 8 percent of the \n     population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing, and many \n     require captioning services to participate in mainstream \n     activities.\n       (3) More than 24,000 children are born in the United States \n     each year with some form of hearing loss.\n       (4) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and a study done by the National Council on Aging--\n       (A) 25 percent of Americans over 65 years old are hearing \n     impaired;\n       (B) 33 percent of Americans over 70 years old are hearing \n     impaired; and\n       (C) 41 percent of Americans over 75 years old are hearing \n     impaired.\n       (5) The National Council on Aging study also found that \n     depression in older adults may be directly related to hearing \n     loss and disconnection with the spoken word.\n       (6) Empirical research demonstrates that captions improve \n     the performance of individuals learning to read English and, \n     according to numerous Federal agency statistics, could \n     benefit--\n       (A) 3,700,000 remedial readers;\n       (B) 12,000,000 young children learning to read;\n       (C) 27,000,000 illiterate adults; and\n       (D) 30,000,000 people for whom English is a second \n     language.\n       (7) Over the past 5 years, student enrollment in programs \n     that train court reporters to become realtime writers has \n     decreased significantly, causing such programs to close on \n     many campuses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act, amounts as follows:\n       (1) $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004, 2005, and \n     2006.\n       (2) Such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2007.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today I am offering an amendment, a bill \nI introduced earlier this year, S. 480, the Training for Realtime \nWriters Act of 2003, on behalf of myself and Senator Grassley. The 1996 \nTelecom Act requires that all television broadcasts were to be \ncaptioned by 2006. This was a much-needed reform that has helped \nmillions of deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans to be able to take full \nadvantage of television programming. As of today, it is estimated that\n\n[[Page S13039]]\n\n3,000 captioners will be needed to fulfill this requirement, and that \nnumber continues to increase as more and more broadband stations come \nonline. Unfortunately, the United States only has 300 captioners. If \nour country expects to have media fully captioned by 2006, something \nmust be done.\n  This is an issue that I feel very strongly about because my late \nbrother Frank was deaf. I know personally that access to culture, news, \nand other media was important to him and to others in achieving a \nbetter quality of life. More than 28 million Americans, or 8 percent of \nthe population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing and many require \ncaptioning services to participate in mainstream activities. In 1990, I \nauthored legislation that required all television sets to be equipped \nwith a computer chip to decode closed captioning. This bill completes \nthe promise of that technology, affording deaf and hard of hearing \nAmericans the same equality and access that captioning provides.\n  Though we do not necessarily think about it, the morning of September \n11 was a perfect example of the need for captioners. Holli Miller of \nAnkeny, IA, was captioning for Fox News. She was supposed to do her \nthree and a half hour shift ending at 8 a.m. but, as we all know, \ndisaster struck. Despite the fact that she had already worked most of \nher shift and had two small children to care for, Holli Miller stayed \nright where she was and for nearly 5 more hours continued to caption. \nWithout even the ability to take bathroom breaks, Holli Miller made \nsure that deaf and hard of hearing people got the same news the rest of \nus got on September 11. I want to personally say thank you to Holli \nMiller and all the many captioners and other people across the country \nthat made sure all Americans were alert and informed on that tragic \nday.\n  But let me emphasize that the deaf and hard of hearing population is \nonly one of a number of groups that will benefit from this legislation. \nThe audience for captioning also includes individuals seeking to \nacquire or improve literacy skills, including approximately 27 million \nfunctionally illiterate adults, 3 to 4 million immigrants learning \nEnglish as a second language, and 18 million children learning to read \nin grades kindergarten through 3. In addition, I see people using \nclosed captioning to stay informed everywhere--from the gym to the \nairport. Captioning helps people educate themselves and helps all of us \nstay informed and entertained when audio isn't the most appropriate \nmedium.\n  Madam President, although we have two years to go until the deadline \ngiven by the 1996 Telecom Act, our Nation is facing a serious shortage \nof captioners. Over the past five years, student enrollment in programs \nthat train court reporters to become realtime writers has decreased \nsignificantly, causing such programs to close on many campuses. Yet, \nthe need for these skills continues to rise. That is why I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for giving me this opportunity to present \nthis vital amendment, and, hopefully, it can be accepted.\n  To reiterate, in 1990 I authored a bill, that became legislation, \nthat required that all television sets that have a size 13-inch screen \nor larger have incorporated into that set a chip that would \nautomatically decode for closed captioning. That went into effect in \n1996, and all television sets now have a chip in them. If you have a \nremote, you can punch it and closed captions will come up.\n  Then in 1996, Congress passed legislation that said that, by the year \n2006, we would have a policy that all television programming would be \nreal-time captioned. Right now if you watch the Senate in debate, you \nwill see real-time captioning coming across the screen. You see that on \nnews programs and sports programs. So it is engaging.\n  But we wanted real-time captioners so that deaf and hard-of-hearing \npeople around the country could watch television in a real-time setting \nand have real-time captioning. So again, we said that by 2006 we wanted \nto have this done. Real-time captioning is a highly trained skill that \npeople have to have, and it is estimated that it is going to take about \n3,000 captioners nationwide to do this.\n  Madam President, right now there are only about 300 captioners \nnationally. We only have 2 years to go before the congressionally \nmandated deadline of meeting this requirement. So, earlier this year, I \nintroduced a bill, S. 480, along with 40 cosponsors on both sides of \nthe aisle, providing for competitive grants. These grants would go to \nauthorize entities, accredited by their State education agencies, that \ncould then use these grants to fund programs to get scholarships for \nrecruitment, training, and job placement to get this pipeline filled as \nsoon as possible with these real-time captioners over the next couple \nof years.\n  That is the amendment I have sent to the desk. As I said, it has \nbroad support. It is basically in the Commerce Committee jurisdiction. \nI know with the press of time, it wasn't acted on this year. I thought \nthis might be an appropriate place to put it. I think it will be widely \nsupported by everybody.\n  I thank the ranking member and others for their positive reception of \nthis amendment on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hatch \nbe added as a cosponsor to the Enzi-Santorum amendment No. 1894, and I \nask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor of S. 877.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think the amendment of the Senator from \nIowa is a worthy cause. We appreciate very much Senator Harkin's \ncontinued commitment to those who are hearing impaired in America. He \nhas been a consistent and longtime advocate of this group of Americans. \nI thank him for his other contributions.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hollings, this is what \nwe think Government ought to be about: going to bat for these people. I \nencourage the Senate to adopt the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1895) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord the cosponsors of the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Cosponsors\n\n       Senators Max Baucus [MT], Jeff Bingaman [NM], Jim Bunning \n     [KY], Saxby Chambliss [GA], Thad Cochran [MS], Michael D. \n     Crapo [ID], Christopher J. Dodd [CT], Russell D. Feingold \n     [WI], Charles E. Grassley [IA], Tim Johnson [SD], John F. \n     Kerry [MA], Mary L. Landrieu [LA], Patrick J. Leahy [VT], \n     Blanche Lincoln [AR], Richard G. Lugar [IN], Bill Nelson \n     [FL], Harry M. Reid [NV], Charles E. Schumer [NY], Gordon \n     Smith [OR], Debbie Stabenow [MI], Evan Bayh [IN], John B. \n     Breaux [LA], Conrad R. Burns [MT], Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     [NY], Larry E. Craig [ID], Michael DeWine [OH], John Edwards \n     [NC], Lindsey O. Graham [SC], James M. Jeffords [VT], Edward \n     M. Kennedy [MA], Herb Kohl [WI], Frank R. Lautenberg [NJ], \n     Joseph I. Lieberman [CT], Trent Lott [MS], Patty Murray [WA], \n     Mark Lunsford Pryor [AR], Rick Santorum [PA], Jeff Sessions \n     [AL], Olympia J. Snowe [ME], Ron Wyden [OR].\n\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Santorum would like to speak about \nthe Santorum-Enzi amendment, and then we will have the Corzine \namendment, which I will propose, and then we will be ready, I believe, \nfor final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1894\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I say to the Senator \nfrom Arizona that I appreciate he and the ranking member accepting this \namendment that Senator Enzi and I have proposed. As a father of six \nlittle children who spend some time--not a lot of time--but some time \non the Internet, just viewing the amount of spam, the pornographic spam \nthat comes into my 10-year-old's site, in\n\n[[Page S13040]]\n\nsome cases, is just absolutely frightening.\n  Senator Enzi and I had been working on separate tracks, and those \ntracks came together today in proposing an amendment which would \nprovide a warning label on those kinds of materials that will be in the \nsubject line of the e-mail so young people, as well as old, do not have \nto subject themselves to this rather disgusting attempt at advertising, \nif you want to call it that. This is an important piece of legislation.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona, if I can get his attention for a \nmoment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very briefly, I think the Senator from \nPennsylvania is trying to address a very important issue. We have asked \nfor the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, under Senator \nLeahy's leadership, to take a look at it. I think we will have that \nanswer quickly.\n  As the Senator knows, some of the definitions in this area can get \nfairly technical. We also understand that pornography, which is \nconveyed through spam across the Internet, is a real public scourge. We \nare interested in getting the Senator's amendment adopted. I am hopeful \nwe will be able to support it.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I say to both the Senator from Oregon \nand the Senator from Arizona, I hear their words of encouragement. I \nencourage them and would like their assurance that this amendment, as \nit is adopted, will be held in conference. This is an important issue \nthat we need to deal with, and I hope they will fight to make sure this \namendment--the House has a similar amendment, but I would argue it is \nnot as strong as this one, and I hope they will fight for the stronger \nlanguage of the Senate amendment in conference.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I assure the Senator from Pennsylvania \nthat we will do everything we can to hold it. I have to tell my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania that probably the greatest single aspect of this \nspamming that is so disturbing to families all over America is the \nissue the Senator from Pennsylvania raises, and that is this graphic \npornography that pops into view when children are trying to do their \nhomework, much less other entertaining aspects of using the computer.\n  I want to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania in every way we can \nto see if we can enact whatever safeguards to prevent this pollution of \nyoung Americans' minds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Arizona. My 10-year-old John \ntakes cyberclasses on the Internet. I am appalled by the filth he has \nto go through every day, whether it is e-mails or pop-ups, in trying to \nget his work done.\n  We have to do something about this. I am as much for free speech and \nfree advertising as anybody else, but it reaches a point where it is \nintruding upon the American family and doing real damage to young \npeople, and we have to take a stand.\n  I appreciate the support of the Senator from Oregon and the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I speak on behalf of Senator Enzi; we appreciate their \nconsideration and adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we await the completion of the Corzine \namendment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe the pending amendment is the Santorum-Enzi \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have discussed this amendment and we \nhave now received clearance from both sides of the aisle and I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1894.\n  The amendment (No. 1894) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am told by the staff that we will commence this vote at \n6:30. I hope by that time we would have the final writing of the \nCorzine amendment, which I could propose at that time and have adopted \nsince it is agreed to by both sides. We are waiting for that. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is the vote going to be at 6:30? Was the Senator asking \nconsent that the final passage be at 6:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the only amendment in \norder that has not been resolved is the Corzine amendment. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It has been resolved. We are just waiting for the \nlanguage to be done. We may have to fire some staff people, I am \nafraid. Senator Wyden was writing them before.\n  Mr. REID. So it is my understanding the vote on this matter would \noccur at 6:30, is that what is being requested?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me put it this way: I ask unanimous consent that \nafter the adoption of the Corzine amendment, the bill be read a third \ntime and a final vote be taken at 6:30, with the understanding that if \nthe Corzine amendment is not adopted that would not happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1896\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. On behalf of Senator Corzine, I have an amendment at the \ndesk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Corzine, for \n     himself, and Mr. Graham of South Carolina, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1896.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the FTC to develop a system for rewarding those who \n   supply information about violations of this Act and a system for \n   requiring ADV labeling on unsolicited commercial electronic mail)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. IMPROVING ENFORCEMENT BY PROVIDING REWARDS FOR \n                   INFORMATION ABOUT VIOLATIONS; LABELING.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Commission shall transmit to the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and \n     the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce--\n       (1) A report within 9 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, that sets forth a system for rewarding those who \n     supply information about violations of this Act, including--\n       (A) procedures for the Commission to grant a reward of not \n     less than 20 percent of the total civil penalty collected for \n     a violation of this Act to the first person that--\n       (i) identifies the person in violation of this Act; and\n       (ii) supplies information that leads to the successful \n     collection of a civil penalty by the Commission; and\n       (B) procedures to minimize the burden of submitting a \n     complaint to the Commission concerning violations of this \n     Act, including procedures to allow the electronic submission \n     of complaints to the Commission; and\n       (2) A report, within 18 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, that sets forth a plan for requiring unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail to be identifiable from its \n     subject line, by means of compliance with Internet \n     Engineering Task Force standards, the use of the characters \n     ``ADV'' in the subject line, or other comparable identifier, \n     or an explanation of any concerns the Commission has that \n     cause the Commission to recommend against the plan.\n       (b) Implementation of Reward Systems.--The Commission may \n     establish and implement the plan under subsection (a)(1), but \n     not earlier than 12 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this amendment is based on legislation I \nintroduced earlier this year, S. 1327, which proposed an innovative way \nto improve anti-spam laws. The amendment would move us toward a system \nthat creates an incentive for individuals to assist the FTC in \nidentifying spammers, by giving them a portion of\n\n[[Page S13041]]\n\nany collections resulting from information provided to the Commission. \nIt also calls for the FTC to set forth a plan for requiring all \nunsolicited commercial e-mail to be identifiable from its subject line \nby means of the use of the characters ``ADV'' or other comparable \nidentifier. If the Commission recommends against such a plan, it will \nhave to provide Congress with a full explanation.\n  The fundamental problem in dealing with spam is enforcement. It is \none thing to propose rules governing e-mails. But it is often hard for \nGovernment officials to track down those who violate those standards. \nSpammers typically use multiple e-mail addresses or disguised routing \ninformation to avoid being identified. As a result, finding spammers \ncan take not just real expertise, but persistence, time, energy and \ncommitment.\n  The concept of requiring the FTC to pay a bounty to those who track \ndown spammers actually isn't my idea. It was originally proposed by one \nof the leading thinkers about the Internet, Professor Lawrence Lessig \nof Stanford Law School, and introduced in the House of Representatives \nby Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. The proposal would invite anyone who uses \nthe Internet to hunt down these law-violating spammers. These would \ninclude people who send fraudulent e-mail, e-mail with inaccurate \nrouting information, and e-mail that fails to include the required opt-\nout. The FTC would then fine the spammer and pay a portion of that fine \nas a reward to the person who provided the information.\n  Creating incentives for private individuals to help track down \nspammers is likely to substantially strengthen the enforcement of anti-\nspam laws. It promises to create an army of computer geeks who seek out \nspammers for their and the public's--benefit. Those who share my belief \nin the efficiency of entrepreneurial capitalism should understand the \npotential value of this free market approach to enforcement.\n  At the request of the managers, I have modified the original proposal \nI introduced earlier this year. This amendment calls for the FTC to \ndevelop a plan to implement a bounty hunting system and issue a report \nto the Congress within 9 months of enactment. The Commission then could \nimplement the plan, but not before 12 months after the date of \nenactment. While this doesn't go quite as far as I proposed originally, \nI think it is an important step forward. And I am pleased that the \nmanagers have committed to me that they will secure inclusion of the \nproposal in any related conference report.\n  I also am pleased that the amendment calls on the FTC to investigate \nanother proposal that I actually believe is very important in the \nreduction of spam, and that also was included in legislation I \nintroduced earlier this year: a requirement that the subject line of \nunsolicited commercial e-mails include a so-called ``ADV'' label. In my \nview, such an approach would give individuals and ISPs considerable \npower to keep spam out of their in boxes, and I am hopeful that we will \nreturn to this proposal before long. In fact, I understand that some \nmembers of the House of Representatives will be pursuing this on a \nrelated bill, and I hope there will be a way to include an enforceable \nlabeling requirement in a conference report on anti-spam legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment by Senator \nCorzine. I thank my colleagues for reaching a compromise at this time. \nI thank those who rapidly wrote this amendment on short notice so we \ncould complete work on this legislation.\n  The amendment has two components. The first part addresses labeling \nof unsolicited commercial e-mail with the term ADV and also addresses \nthe possibility of industry self-regulation. The Federal Trade \nCommission has raised serious concerns with both of these proposals \nwith respect to ADV labeling. The FTC has written to me in opposition \nto labeling:\n\n       First, consumer groups, ISPs, and emailers at the SPAM \n     Forum roundly criticized the mandatory use of an ``ADV'' \n     label. Labeling requirements could harm legitimate marketers, \n     while illegitimate marketers are likely to ignore the \n     requirement. Indeed, although several States require ``ADV'' \n     labels on unsolicited commercial email, in its recent study \n     on False Claims in SPAM, Commission staff found that only 2 \n     percent of email messages analyzed contained such a label.\n\n  In lieu of Senator Corzine's original proposal to make ADV labeling \nan industry self-regulation, the amendment has been modified to require \nthe Federal Trade Commission to report to Congress on whether the ADV \nlabeling and industry self-regulation should be implemented.\n  So I think this is a sensible solution in light of the Federal Trade \nCommission's concerns as I just read from their report to Congress.\n  The second part of the amendment would authorize the Federal Trade \nCommission to adopt a bounty hunter proposal to give people a portion \nof the fines collected from spammers that they hope to catch. As with \nthe Do Not Spam Registry, the FTC would be authorized to act after \nfirst sending a report to Congress.\n  I support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I also support the amendment. This is a \ncompromise. Both of these topics are topics about which we really have \nnot heard a lot. We have not had a chance to discuss them in hearings. \nSenator Corzine has been working constructively with us. I urge the \npassage of it.\n  The bounty issue essentially comes from Professor Lessig at Stanford, \nlooking at innovative ways to create incentives to deal with the \nproblem. It is certainly one the Federal Trade Commission should look \nat. The question about making sure every unsolicited e-mail has ADV has \nbeen contentious among a number of small business groups, ones that \nhave really been burdened by these costs. But I think this is a fair \ncompromise. It gives the Federal Trade Commission ample opportunity to \nstudy this and look at the feasibility of it. I urge our colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  As soon as we agree to the Corzine amendment, I believe Senator \nHarkin has a unanimous consent request he needs to make, and then we \nare ready to go to final passage. I urge my colleagues now to support \nthe Corzine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1896) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, last month, this body overwhelmingly voted \nto stop unwanted phone calls from telemarketers. We put our foot down \nand stopped these uninvited guests from barging into our home, \ninterrupting our family time and invading our privacy. I would like to \nthink that families can enjoy a peaceful dinner now that we have \nallowed the Do-Not-Call list to move forward.\n  Today we address a similar problem--America's e-mail inboxes have \nbeen invaded by unwanted and deceptive e-mail solicitations. Not only \nis this practice annoying and frustrating to our constituents, but the \npractice is costing consumers and businesses valuable time and \nresources.\n  In a report dated January 22, 2003, the Federal Trade Commission \nindicated that at least 40 percent of all e-mail is spam, with more \nthan half considered to contain false and deceptive information. This \nhas been a problem in my State of Arkansas. The FTC recorded 2,048 \nfraud and identity theft complaints from Arkansas consumers who \nreported having lost $1.3 million to these scams.\n  In addition, businesses are losing money as employees spend time \nwading through unsolicited e-mail messages and are forced to \ncontinuously update their servers and software in an attempt to avoid \nspam and prevent worms and viruses that are submitted through spam.\n  One thing I have learned as Senator is that this body does not agree \noften on the root of a problem. But I know for sure that each of us can \nagree that we have better things to do with our time than delete dozens \nof emails about the latest diet craze or money scheme. Even more, I \nknow none of the mothers and fathers in this body want their children \nto receive emails that contain inappropriate sexual material. Neither \ndo the mothers and fathers in Arkansas.\n  Now is the time to crack down on deceptive and unsolicited spam once \nand for all.\n  This bill which I support has two strong elements:\n\n[[Page S13042]]\n\n  First, it would require anyone sending unsolicited bulk e-mail \ndirectly, or through an intermediary, to provide each recipient with a \nvalid ``opt-out'' process for declining any future spam.\n  Second, it would outlaw transmitting high-volume unsolicited e-mail \nsources if they contain false, misleading or deceptive routing \ninformation, or forged e-mail addresses.\n\n  I am pleased that this bill has been made even stronger with the \ninclusion of Senator Bill Nelson's RICO statute amendment. I am proud \nto be named as the provision's original cosponsor.\n  This amendment encourages the prosecution of those people who use \nspam to seek money illegally or who engage in other illegal acts by \nmaking use of the civil Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \nOrganizations Act, commonly known as RICO.\n  RICO makes it illegal to acquire or maintain a business through a \npattern of racketeering activity. This law lets authorities seize the \nassets of such an operation and allows victims grounds for recovery in \ncivil court.\n  By adopting the amendment, this body has given the overall bill \nteeth, which will go along way toward punishing those scam artists who \nprey on the everyday trusting, law-abiding citizens of our land.\n  As Attorney General I fought to curtail mail fraud and I think some \nof the spam being sent to Arkansans online is in that same category. \nThe only difference is that this type of fraud reaches many more \nvictims in a shorter period of time.\n  I look forward to the completion of this bill, and I am pleased that \nwe have again been able to work in a bipartisan matter to carry out the \nwill of the populace.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is increasingly apparent that unwanted \ncommercial e-mail, commonly known as ``spam,'' is more than just a \nnuisance. In the past few years, it has become a serious and growing \nproblem that threatens to undermine the vast potential of the Internet.\n  Businesses and individuals currently wade through tremendous amounts \nof spam in order to access e-mail that is of relevance to them--and \nthis is after ISPs, businesses, and individuals have spent time and \nmoney blocking a large percentage of spam from reaching its intended \nrecipients.\n  In my home State of Vermont, one legislator recently found that two-\nthirds of the 96 e-mails in his inbox were spam. And this occurred \nafter the legislature had installed new spam-blocking software on its \ncomputer system that seemed to be catching 80 percent of the spam. The \nassistant attorney general in Vermont was forced to suggest to computer \nusers the following means to avoid these unsolicited commercial e-\nmails: ``It's very bad to reply, even to say don't send anymore. It \ntells the spammer they have a live address . . . The best thing you can \ndo is just keep deleting them. If it gets really bad, you may have to \nchange your address.'' This experience is echoed nationwide.\n  E-mail users are having the online equivalent of the experience of \nthe woman in the Monty Python skit, who seeks to order a Spam-free \nbreakfast at a restaurant. Try as she might, she cannot get the \nwaitress to bring her the meal she desires. Every dish in the \nrestaurant comes with Spam; it's just a matter of how much. There's \n``egg, bacon and Spam''; ``egg, bacon, sausage and Spam''; ``Spam, \nbacon, sausage and Spam''; ``Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam''; \n``Spam, sausage, Spam, Spam, Spam, bacon, Spam, tomato and Spam''; and \nso on. Exasperated, the woman finally cries out: ``I don't like Spam! . \n. . I don't want ANY Spam!''\n  Individuals and businesses are reacting similarly to electronic spam. \nA Harris poll taken late last year found that 80 percent of respondents \nview spam as ``very annoying,'' and fully 74 percent of respondents \nfavor making mass spamming illegal. Earlier this month, more than 3 out \nof 4 people surveyed by Yahoo! Mail said it was ``less aggravating to \nclean a toilet'' than to sort through spam. Americans are fed up.\n  Some 30 States now have antispam laws, but the globe-hopping nature \nof e-mail makes these laws difficult to enforce. Technology will \nundoubtedly play a key role in fighting spam, but a technological \nsolution to the problem is not likely in the foreseeable future. ISPs \nblock billions of unwanted e-mails each day, but spammers are winning \nthe battle.\n  Millions of unwanted, unsolicited commercial e-mails are received by \nAmerican businesses and individuals each day, despite their own, \nadditional filtering efforts. A recent study by Ferris Research \nestimates that spam costs U.S. firms $8.9 billion annually in lost \nworker productivity, consumption of bandwidth, and the use of technical \nsupport to configure and run spam filters and provide helpdesk support \nfor spam recipients.\n  The costs of spam are significant to individuals as well, including \ntime spent identifying and deleting spam, inadvertently opening spam, \ninstalling and maintaining antispam filters, tracking down legitimate \nmessages mistakenly deleted by spam filters, and paying for the ISP's \nblocking efforts.\n  And there are other prominent and equally important costs of spam. It \nmay introduce viruses, worms, and Trojan horses into personal and \nbusiness computer systems, including those that support our national \ninfrastructure.\n  The public has recently witnessed the potentially staggering effects \nof a virus, not only through the Blaster case I discussed earlier, but \nwith the appearance of the SoBigF virus just 8 days after Blaster began \nchewing its way through the Internet. This variant also infected \nWindows machines via e-mail, then sent out dozens of copies of itself. \nAntivirus experts say one of the main reasons virus writers continue to \nmodify and re-release this particular piece of ``malware'' is that it \ndownloads a Trojan horse to infected computers, which are then used to \nsend spam.\n  Spammers are constantly in need of new machines through which to \nroute their garbage e-mail, and a virus makes a perfect delivery \nmechanism for the engine they use for their mass mailings. Some \nanalysts said the SoBigF virus may have been created with a more \nmalicious intent than most viruses, and may even be linked to spam e-\nmail schemes that could be a source of cash for those involved in the \nscheme.\n  The interconnection between computer viruses and spam is readily \napparent: Both flood the Internet in an attempt to force a message on \npeople who would not otherwise choose to receive it. Criminal laws I \nwrote prohibiting the former have been invoked and enforced from the \ntime they were passed it is the latter dilemma we must now confront \nheadon.\n  Spam is also fertile ground for deceptive trade practices. The FTC \nhas estimated that 96 percent of the spam involving investment and \nbusiness opportunities, and nearly half of the spam advertising health \nservices and products, and travel and leisure, contains false or \nmisleading information.\n  This rampant deception has the potential to undermine Americans' \ntrust of valid information on the Internet. Indeed, it has already \ncaused some Americans to refrain from using the Internet to the extent \nthey otherwise would. For example, some have chosen not to participate \nin public discussion forums, and are hesitant to provide their \naddresses in legitimate business transactions, for fear that their e-\nmail addresses will be harvested for junk e-mail lists. And they are \nright to be concerned. The FTC found spam arriving at its computer \nsystem just 9 minutes after posting an e-mail address in an online chat \nroom.\n  I have often said that Congress must exercise great caution when \nregulating in cyberspace. Any legislative solution to spam must tread \ncarefully to ensure that we do not impede or stifle the free flow of \ninformation on the Internet. The United States is the birthplace of the \nInternet, and the whole world watches whenever we decide to regulate \nit. Whenever we choose to intervene in the Internet with government \naction, we must act carefully, prudently, and knowledgeably, keeping in \nmind the implications of what we do and how we do it. And we must not \nforget that spam, like more traditional forms of commercial speech, is \nprotected by the first amendment.\n  At the same time, we must not allow spam to result in the ``virtual \ndeath'' of the Internet, as one Vermont newspaper put it.\n\n[[Page S13043]]\n\n  The Internet is a valuable asset to our Nation, to our economy, and \nto the lives of Americans, and we should act prudently to secure its \ncontinued viability and vitality.\n  On June 19 of this year, Senator Hatch and I introduced S.1293, the \nCriminal Spam Act, together with several of our colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee. On September 25, the committee unanimously voted \nto report the bill to the floor. Today, Senators Hatch, Nelson, \nSchumer, Grassley and I offered the criminal provisions of S. 1293 as \nan amendment to S. 877, the CAN SPAM Act. The amendment was adopted by \nvoice vote.\n  I thank the lead cosponsors of S. 877 for working with us on this \namendment, and for their support and cosponsorship of the Criminal Spam \nAct. I also thank Senator Bill Nelson for his contribution to the \namendment.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment prohibits five principal techniques that \nspammers use to evade filtering software and hide their trails.\n  First, our amendment prohibits hacking into another person's computer \nsystem and sending bulk spam from or through that system. This \ncriminalizes the common spammer technique of obtaining access to other \npeople's e-mail accounts on an ISP's e-mail network, whether by \npassword theft or by inserting a ``Trojan horse'' program--that is, a \nprogram that unsuspecting users download onto their computers and that \nthen takes control of those computers--to send bulk spam.\n  Second, our amendment prohibits using a computer system that the \nowner makes available for other purposes as a conduit for bulk spam, \nwith the intent of deceiving recipients as to the spam's origins. This \nprohibition criminalizes another common spammer technique--the abuse of \nthird parties' ``open'' servers, such as e-mail servers that have the \ncapability to relay mail, or Web proxy servers that have the ability to \ngenerate ``form'' mail. Spammers commandeer these servers to send bulk \ncommercial e-mail without the server owner's knowledge, either by \n``relaying'' their e-mail through an ``open'' e-mail server, or by \nabusing an ``open'' Web proxy server's capability to generate form e-\nmails as a means to originate spam, thereby exceeding the owner's \nauthorization for use of that e-mail or Web server. In some instances \nthe hijacked servers are even completely shut down as a result of tens \nof thousands of undeliverable messages generated from the spammer's e-\nmail list.\n  The amendment's third prohibition targets another way that outlaw \nspammers evade ISP filters: falsifying the ``header information'' that \naccompanies every e-mail, and sending bulk spam containing that fake \nheader information. More specifically, the amendment prohibits forging \ninformation regarding the origin of the e-mail message, and the route \nthrough which the message attempted to penetrate the ISP filters.\n  Fourth, the Hatch-Leahy amendment prohibits registering for multiple \ne-mail accounts or Internet domain names, and sending bulk e-mail from \nthose accounts or domains. This provision targets deceptive ``account \nchurning,'' a common outlaw spammer technique that works as follows. \nThe spammer registers--usually by means of an automatic computer \nprogram--for large numbers of e-mail accounts or domain names, using \nfalse registration information, then sends bulk spam from one account \nor domain after another. This technique stays ahead of ISP filters by \nhiding the source, size, and scope of the sender's mailings, and \nprevents the e-mail account provider or domain name registrar from \nidentifying the registrant as a spammer and denying his registration \nrequest. Falsifying registration information for domain names also \nviolates a basic contractual requirement for domain name registration \nfalsification.\n  Fifth and finally, our amendment addresses a major hacker spammer \ntechnique for hiding identity that is a common and pernicious \nalternative to domain name registration--hijacking unused expanses of \nInternet address space and using them as launch pads for junk e-mail. \nHijacking Internet Protocol--IP--addresses is not difficult: Spammers \nsimply falsely assert that they have the right to use a block of IP \naddresses, and obtain an Internet connection for those addresses. \nHiding behind those addresses, they can then send vast amounts of spam \nthat is extremely difficult to trace.\n  Penalties for violations of these new criminal prohibitions are tough \nbut measured. Recidivists and those who send spam in furtherance of \nanother felony may be imprisoned for up to 5 years. Large-volume \nspammers, those who hack into another person's computer system to send \nbulk spam, and spam ``kingpins'' who use others to operate their \nspamming operations may be imprisoned for up to 3 years. Other \noffenders may be fined and imprisoned for no more than one year. \nConvicted offenders are also subject to forfeiture of proceeds and \ninstrumentalities of the offense.\n  In addition to these penalties, the Hatch-Leahy amendment directs the \nSentencing Commission to consider providing sentencing enhancements for \nthose convicted of the new criminal provisions who obtained e-mail \naddresses through improper means, such as harvesting, and those who \nknowingly sent spam containing or advertising a falsely registered \nInternet domain name. We have also worked with Senator Nelson on \nlanguage directing the Sentencing Commission to consider enhancements \nfor those who commit other crimes that are facilitated by the sending \nof spam.\n  I should note that the Criminal Spam Act, from which the amendment is \ntaken, enjoys broad support from ISPs, direct marketers, consumer \ngroups, and civil liberties groups alike. It is also supported by the \nadministration: In its September 11, 2003, views letter regarding the \nCAN SPAM Act, the administration advocated the addition to CAN SPAM of \nfelony triggers similar to those proposed in the Criminal Spam Act. The \nadministration further supported our proposal, advanced in the Hatch-\nLeahy amendment, to direct the Sentencing Commission to consider \nsentencing enhancements for convicted spammers that have additionally \nobtained e-mail addresses by harvesting.\n  Again, the purpose of the Hatch-Leahy amendment is to deter the most \npernicious and unscrupulous types of spammers--those who use trickery \nand deception to induce others to relay and view their messages. \nRidding America's inboxes of deceptively delivered spam will \nsignificantly advance our fight against junk e-mail. But it is not a \ncure-all for the spam pandemic.\n  The fundamental problem inherent to spam--its sheer volume--may well \npersist even in the absence of fraudulent routing information and false \nidentities. In a recent survey, 82 percent of respondents considered \nunsolicited bulk e-mail, even from legitimate businesses, to be \nunwelcome spam. Given this public opinion, and in light of the fact \nthat spam is, in essence, cost-shifted advertising, we need to take a \nmore comprehensive approach to our fight against spam.\n  While I am generally supportive of the CAN SPAM Act, and will vote in \nfavor of passage, it does raise some concerns. The bill takes an ``opt \nout'' approach to spam--that is, it requires all commercial e-mail to \ninclude an ``opt out'' mechanism, by which e-mail recipients may opt \nout of receiving further unwanted spam. My concern is that this \napproach permits spammers to send at least one piece of spam to each e-\nmail address in their database, while placing the burden on e-mail \nrecipients to respond. People who receive dozens, even hundreds, of \nunwanted e-mails each day may have little time or energy for anything \nother than opting-out from unwanted spam.\n  According to one organization's calculations, if just one percent of \nthe approximately 24 million small businesses in the U.S. sent every \nAmerican just one spam a year, that would amount to over 600 pieces of \nspam for each person to sift through and opt out of each day. And this \nfigure may be conservative, as it does not include the large businesses \nthat also engage in online advertising.\n  I am also troubled by the labeling requirement in the CAN SPAM Act, \nwhich makes it unlawful to send an unsolicited commercial e-mail \nmessage unless it provides, among other things, `` clear and \nconspicuous identification that the message is an advertisement or \nsolicitation,'' and ``a valid physical postal address of the sender''. \nWhile we all want to curb spam, we must be mindful of its status as \nprotected commercial speech, and ensure that any restrictions we impose \non it are as narrowly tailored as possible.\n\n[[Page S13044]]\n\n  Reducing the volume of junk commercial e-mail, and so protecting \nlegitimate Internet communications, is not an easy matter. There are \nimportant First Amendment interests to consider, as well as the need to \npreserve the ability of legitimate marketers to use e-mail responsibly. \nWe must be sure we get this right, so as not to exacerbate an already \nterribly vexing problem. This is especially important given the \npreemption provisions of the CAN SPAM Act, which will override many of \nthe tough anti-spamming laws already enacted by the States.\n  My distinguished colleagues from Wyoming and Pennsylvania offered an \namendment requiring ``warning labels'' on certain commercial electronic \nmail. While I appreciate my colleagues' efforts to protect our children \nfrom the on-line assault of internet pornography--an important goal \nthat we all share--I fear the amendment has been drafted in haste and \nraises significant constitutional issues that require further analysis.\n  First, the amendment incorporates broad and vague phrases such as \n``devoted to sexual matters'' that are not otherwise defined in the \nlaw. I expressed similar concerns during debate on the Communications \nDecency Act, CDA, which the Supreme Court struck down as \nunconstitutional in 1996. The CDA also punished as a felony anyone who \ntransmitted ``obscene'' or ``indecent'' material over the Internet. The \nCDA was deemed too vague as to what was ``indecent'' or ``obscene.'' \nSome of the terms and phrases used in the Enzi-Santorum amendment may \nbe deemed equally vague when subjected to judicial scrutiny.\n  There are also first amendment concerns to regulating commercial \nelectronic mail in ways that require specific labels on protected \nspeech. Such requirements inhibit both the speaker's right to express \nand the listener's right to access constitutionally protected material.\n  More importantly, existing laws already ban obscenity, harassment, \nchild pornography and enticing minors into sexual activity.\n  As a father and a grandfather, I well appreciate the challenge of \nlimiting a child's exposure to sexually inappropriate material. Yet, no \nlegislation we could pass would be an effective substitute for parental \ninvolvement. We must be vigilant about feel-good efforts to involve \ngovernment, either directly or indirectly, in regulating the content of \nthe Internet.\n  For these reasons, the Enzi-Santorum amendment raises serious legal \nissues that mandate further exploration before a determination can be \nmade on the proposed law's constitutional viability.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the sponsors of the CAN \nSPAM Act on these issues as the bill proceeds to conference.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Burns-\nWyden CAN-SPAM Act, which would impose limitations and penalties on the \ntransmission of unsolicited commercial electronic mail via the \nInternet.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Wyden and Burns, for \ntheir leadership in tackling this problem which affects so many \nconsumers in my State of Washington. Unsolicited commercial email or \n``spam'' is a major irritant to consumers and businesses alike. Spam \nexposes computer users--often young children--to pornography, sexual \npredators, fraudulent schemes, and other unwanted or harmful messages. \nIn addition, spam costs American business close to $10 billion each \nyear in lost productivity, additional infrastructure costs, and legal \nfees--costs that are ultimately borne by consumers. By clogging our \ncomputers, spam threatens to deprive us of the tremendous benefits \nprovided by the Internet.\n  This bill represents a crucial first step in combating the \nexponential increase in the volume of spam, which today accounts for \nhalf of all email messages. Because of the global nature of this \nproblem and the anonymity that the Internet affords spammers, it is \nimpossible for states or individuals alone to take meaningful steps to \nreduce the impact of this nuisance, and self-regulation is simply not \nan option. The overwhelming volume of sleazy and fraudulent \nsolicitations originating from criminal organizations demands a tough \nresponse that imposes both civil and criminal penalties.\n  That is precisely why this bill is so necessary. To protect computer \nusers in my State and across the country, we must take immediate steps \nto stem the mountain of spam hitting email inboxes every day.\n  The Burns-Wyden bill is a long-awaited step in the right direction. \nThe bill has been carefully negotiated and improved. By allowing \nenforcement by State attorneys general and by Internet service \nproviders, we have increased the odds of successful enforcement against \nthe worst spammers. By prohibiting harvesting of email addresses, the \nuse of technology to send thousands of spammed messages, and by \nprohibiting false and misleading message headers, the bill will send a \nclear message to the most abusive spammers that their practices will no \nlonger be tolerated.\n  But enforcement will remain a challenge. Spammers have every \nincentive to increase the volume of their messages because the marginal \ncost of sending another message is virtually nothing. And because of \nthe anonymity and global nature of the internet, spammers can hide \ntheir identity and move their operations offshore.\n  While the bill before us will finally put in place a Federal approach \nto the global problem of spam, there is no single solution to this \ncomplex problem. I am pleased that the bill will require the Federal \nTrade Commission to develop legislation to establish a national Do Not \nEmail registry modeled on the Do Not Call registry, but I believe there \nmay come a point at which additional protections are necessary to \nprotect consumers and to protect the growth of the information economy.\n  I think we all recognize that we have much more work to do to solve \nthis problem, but the Burns-Wyden bill is an excellent first step in \naddressing the problem, and I am pleased to help pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. Under \nthe previous order, I believe the vote will start at 6:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on the engrossment and \nthird reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall it \npass?\n  Mr. BURNS.

HARDIMAN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senate \nwill soon take up in executive session the nomination of Thomas M. \nHardiman to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, and I recommend to my colleagues that he be \nconfirmed. He has an outstanding academic record.\n  Mr. Hardiman received his bachelor's degree, cum laude, from the \nUniversity of Notre Dame in 1987. He received his law degree, cum laude \nagain, from Georgetown University Law Center. He was notes and comments \neditor of the Georgetown Law Journal, which is an indication of \nacademic achievement and legal excellence in writing. He has been \nadmitted to the bars of Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, and \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He has been in the active practice of \nlaw since 1990. He currently is a partner in the prestigious Pittsburgh \nfirm of Reed Smith.\n  He has been very active with professional affiliations as a \nPennsylvania Young Lawyers Division delegate to the American Bar \nAssociation's House of Delegates. He served as a hearing officer for \nthe Pennsylvania Disciplinary Board. He has been active in community \naffairs, president of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Pittsburgh, \nand he currently serves as director of that organization. He was \nformerly an adjunct faculty member of LaRoche College.\n  As suggested by the dates of graduation, Mr. Hardiman is a young man, \nin his late thirties. I think he brings an element of diversity to the \ncourt, tempering some of the judges who are older. But starting at the \nage of 38 affords an opportunity to develop skills and expertise on the \ndistrict court as a trial judge.\n  From what I know about him, and I have observed him over the better \npart of the past decade, he has the capability perhaps to become an \nappellate judge. That will depend upon the development of his skills \nand his professional accomplishments as a judge.\n  He was recommended by the nonpartisan nominating panel which Senator \nSantorum and I have. He is a vigorous young man. He has a family, a \nwife and three children, residing in Fox Chapel. I think he will make \nan outstanding addition to the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13045-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13045-S13046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN MEMORY OF IRA PAULL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in memory of Ira Paull, who \npassed away suddenly on September 28 at the age of 52.\n  I was very fortunate to work with Ira during the 7 years he spent on \nCapitol Hill as a staff member on the Senate Banking Committee. He \nworked on the staff of Senators John Heinz, Jake Garn, and Alfonse \nD'Amato. Ira was an integral part of virtually every critical piece of \nlegislation that came out of the Banking Committee. His knowledge was \nvast and his counsel well-respected by Senators on both sides of the \naisle. I personally had the privilege of working with Ira in my \ncapacity as chairman of the Securities Subcommittee. In particular, I \nhave fond memories of Ira as he accompanied me, Senator Heinz, and my \nstaff on a congressional delegation to Europe in 1990 looking into \nEuropean Community Financial Services issues.\n  Ira's reputation on the Hill was that of a bright and talented \nlawyer, and also of an individual with a quick wit and a tremendous \nsense of humor. He became well-known for writing opening statements for \ncommittee hearings that were not only well-informed and comprehensive, \nbut would even, on occasion, incorporate rhyme or poetry that would \nbring a smile to everyone's face.\n  Though his job on the committee was to provide counsel to Republican \nSenators, he earned a great deal of respect from Democrats as well. He \nformed deep and lasting friendships with staff members from both sides \nof the aisle, including my own staff, who valued his advice and counsel \nand cherished his friendship.\n  Ira Paull was a hard worker, a dedicated public servant, and a \nwonderful person who was taken from us far too soon. He will be greatly \nmissed by everyone who had the opportunity to know him.\n  I offer my deepest sympathies to his brother Gerson, to his sisters, \nSusan, Leah, and Linda, and to his entire family.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record statements on Ira's \npassing submitted by former Senators Garn and D'Amato.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      On the Passing of Ira Paull\n\n                           Senator Jake Garn\n\n       I first met Ira Paull in 1988 when he joined the staff of \n     Senator John Heinz as his legislative assistant specializing \n     in securities issues. A year later he joined the Banking \n     Committee staff and I saw first hand how Ira's expertise in \n     banking, securities and accounting made an invaluable \n     contribution to the work of the Committee. Ira played a key \n     role in all of the key significant legislation addressed by \n     the Committee during my tenure as ranking member. Many of \n     these laws were of critical importance to the financial \n     stability of the United States, such as the legislation that \n     resolved the savings and loan crisis and the law that \n     restored the financial strength of the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation. Ira's knowledge of accounting was \n     especially crucial to the Committee's work on these measures, \n     and the legislation adopted by the Congress reflects much of \n     the input and advice we received from him.\n       Ira's intellect and technical expertise alone would have \n     made him a wonderful asset to the Banking Committee staff. \n     But Ira's contribution went well beyond that. Ira took it \n     upon himself to share his knowledge and become an adviser to \n     senior staff and a mentor to younger staff. He was \n     universally respected for his personal integrity and strength \n     of convictions. Ira had strong beliefs about Aright and \n     wrong--and to his credit, never feared to express his views. \n     He also had a remarkable sense of humor, and members of the \n     Committee on both sides of the aisle enjoyed the statements \n     Ira prepared. His sense of humor also served to keep staff \n     morale high during the periods of high stress when staff was \n     required to work long hours due to the press of the \n     legislative schedule.\n       The passing of Ira Paull is a loss for all of us. He was a \n     bright light that shone on many people, including myself. He \n     will be missed by many, but forgotten by no one.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         In Memory of Ira Paull\n\n                       Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato\n\n       It is with deep sadness that I submit this statement about \n     the passing of former Senate Banking Committee staff person, \n     Ira Paull.\n       Ira was a strong presence on the Committee staff for a \n     number of years, staffing first Senator Heinz, then Senator \n     Garn and finally me when he became the Deputy Staff Director \n     under my Chairmanship.\n       No matter who Ira worked for at the time, though, we all \n     looked to him for his quick and concise explanations--Ira \n     could always cut to the chase. If any of us wanted something \n     more than that, Ira could also spend days on the details. He \n     was one of the few staff people that could actually do both. \n     Whether the explanation was a few minutes or a few hours \n     though, he was always passionate about whatever the Committee \n     was doing.\n       In fact, few could show such passion as Ira about the \n     Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 or the minutiae of \n     thrift regulation. Ira's passion for the law showed no mercy \n     for lobbyists or staff representing members with contrary \n     positions to Ira's successive bosses. He was a strong \n     advocate for his member and very effective at getting what \n     his boss needed.\n       I remember one particular situation back when Congress \n     passed FDICIA in 1991. It was\n\n[[Page S13046]]\n\n     right around the time that a minority-owned New York bank, \n     Freedom National Bank, had failed. They had all kinds of \n     community funds commingled and when the bank failed, FDIC \n     insurance would look at all of the accounts as one big, \n     single account. My office had gotten dozens of calls from the \n     Harlem community that stood to lose college scholarship funds \n     and all kinds of community program money. During the \n     conference, I explained the bank's predicament and got \n     included in the bill an amendment to look at each account \n     separately and basically cover all the deposits made by the \n     community programs.\n       FDICIA had one of those conferences that finished at 3:00 \n     am and when the bill was voted on by the House and Senate the \n     next day, the Freedom National Bank amendment was nowhere to \n     be found. Both Houses were set to adjourn right after the \n     bill passed, but Ira worked Legislative Councils of both \n     Houses, the Chairmen of the Committees, the staff people, and \n     the Parliamentarians. With the usual Ira tenaciousness, he \n     tracked down every person who could help--no matter where \n     they were. Finally, Ira and I ran over to the House to do \n     what couldn't be done over the telephone. We arrived on the \n     floor, right as the House announced its adjournment sine die. \n     Two minutes later, the House floor reopened, passed the \n     Freedom National amendment, and readjourned.\n       That kind of dedication, that kind of passion and that kind \n     of can do and do attitude is what I will always remember \n     about Ira. The Freedom National Bank situation happened long \n     before I was Chairman of Banking--at the time, I was third in \n     seniority at the Committee. Ira was a pro and worked that \n     issue as if it was his money at stake.\n       He was a wonderful person, with a great passion and a great \n     way with words--drafting the most imaginative and creative \n     statements which the Congressional Record will memorialize \n     forever. And, of course, I will always remember Ira's laugh, \n     the great guffaw.\n       I join my colleagues today to bid a fond farewell to Ira \n     Paull and to thank him one last time for all he did during \n     his time at the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13046-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am opposed to the conference report on S. \n3, the Partial Birth Abortion Act.\n  In 1973--26 years ago now--the Supreme Court affirmed for the first \ntime a woman's right to choose. This landmark decision was carefully \ncrafted to be both balanced and responsible while holding the rights of \nwomen in America paramount in reproductive decisions. It is clear that \nthe underlying Santorum bill does not hold the rights of women \nparamount--instead, it infringes on those rights in the most grievous \nof circumstances.\n  Indeed, S. 3 undermines basic tenets of Roe v. Wade, which maintained \nthat women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but after \nviability--the time at which it first becomes realistically possible \nfor fetal life to be maintained outside the women's body--States could \nban abortions only if they also allowed exceptions for cases in which a \nwoman's life or health is endangered. And the Supreme Court reaffirmed \ntheir support for exceptions for health of the mother just 3 years ago.\n  In Stenberg vs. Carhart, a case involving the constitutionality of \nNebraska's partial birth abortion ban statute, the Supreme Court \ninvalidated the Nebraska statute because it lacks an exception for the \nperformance of the D & X dilation and extraction procedure when \nnecessary to protect the health of the mother, and because it imposes \nan undue burden on a woman's ability to have an abortion. This case was \nrepresentative of 21 cases throughout the Nation. Regrettably, however, \nSenator Santorum's legislation disregards both Supreme Court decisions \nby not providing an exception for the health of the mother and \nproviding only a narrowly defined life exception.\n  And let there be no mistake I stand here today to reaffirm that no \nviable fetus should be aborted--by any method--unless it is absolutely \nnecessary to protect the life or health of the mother. Period.\n  During the Senate consideration of this bill earlier this year, I \nonce again cosponsored Senator Durbin's amendment which specifies that \npostviability abortions would only be lawful if the physician \nperforming the abortion and an independent physician certified in \nwriting that continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's \nlife or risk grievous injury to her physical health. It mirrors laws \nalready on the books in 41 States, including my home State of Maine, \nwhich ban postviability abortions while at the same time including life \nand health exceptions mandated by the Supreme Court under Roe v. Wade.\n  This amendment, which was tabled during the Senate's debate, would \nhave lowered the number of abortions because it bans all postviability \nabortions. S. 3, in contrast, will not prevent a single abortion. \nSadly, it will force women to choose another potentially, more harmful \nprocedure.\n  Is this what we really want? To put women's health and lives at risk? \nAnd shouldn't these most critical decisions be left to those with \nmedical training--not politicians?\n  The findings in S. 3 would have you believe that this procedure is \nnever necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother and that \nin fact it poses significant health risks to a woman. This is simply \nnot true. Let me explain why there must be a health exception for \n``grievous physical injury'' in two circumstances.\n  First, the language was to apply in those heart-wrenching cases where \na wanted pregnancy seriously threatens the health of the mother. The \nlanguage would allow a doctor in these tragic cases to perform an \nabortion because he or she believes it is critical to preserving the \nhealth of a woman facing: peripartal cardiomyopathy, a form of cardiac \nfailure which is often caused by the pregnancy, which can result in \ndeath or untreatable heart disease; pre-eclampsia, or high blood \npressure which is caused by a pregnancy, which can result in kidney \nfailure, stroke or death; and uterine ruptures which could result in \ninfertility.\n  Second, the language also applied when a woman has a life-threatening \ncondition which requires life-saving treatment. It applies to those \ntragic cases, for example, when a woman needs chemotherapy when \npregnant, so the families face the terrible choice of continuing the \npregnancy or providing life-saving treatment. These conditions include: \nbreast cancer; lymphoma, which has a 50 percent mortality rate if \nuntreated; and primary pulmonary hypertension, which has a 50 percent \nmaternal mortality rate.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues, who could seriously object under these \ncircumstances?\n  I cosponsored this amendment because I believed that it was a \ncommonsense approach to a serious problem for American women and a \ncontentious issue for the United States Congress. Unfortunately, the \nomission of this or any other exemption from this ban in cases when the \nlife of the mother is threatened poses a significant and likely a \nconstitutional problem, and without such an exception, I could not \nsupport this conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13046-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13046-S13047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE IN AZERBAIJAN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today Human Rights Watch released a \nstatement condemning what it calls a ``brutal political crackdown'' in \nAzerbaijan following its flawed October 15 presidential elections. In \nthe words of Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch, ``Azerbaijan is \ngoing through its most serious human rights crisis of the past decade. \nIf this crackdown continues, there won't be an opposition left in \nAzerbaijan by the end of the month.'' I direct my colleagues' attention \nto Human Rights Watch's disturbing conclusions and ask unanimous \nconsent that its report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Azerbaijan: Government Launches Crackdown After Election, Hundreds of \n                      Opposition Members Arrested\n\n       New York, October 22, 2003.--Azerbaijani authorities have \n     unleashed a massive and brutal political crackdown, arresting \n     hundreds of opposition leaders and activists since the \n     October 15 presidential election, Human Rights Watch said \n     today. Ilham Aliev, the son of the outgoing leader, was \n     elected president in a vote that international and local \n     observers said was marred by widespread fraud.\n       ``The Azerbaijani authorities are using the post-election \n     violence, an affair in which they themselves played a major \n     role, to justify a massive crackdown on the opposition,'' \n     said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's senior emergencies \n     researcher. ``Arbitrary arrests have to stop. Those arrested \n     without cause must be released immediately, and those in \n     custody should have access to an attorney.''\n       Human Rights Watch called on the government to publish a \n     full list of all those arrested in the aftermath of the \n     election, their\n\n[[Page S13047]]\n\n     whereabouts and the charges against them. Human Rights Watch \n     urged the international community to press the Azerbaijani \n     government to launch an independent commission, with \n     international participation, to investigate election fraud.\n        Almost immediately after the polls closed on October 15, \n     violence erupted between opposition supporters and the \n     police. Later that evening, Azerbaijani security forces \n     attacked peaceful opposition supporters gathered outside the \n     headquarters of the main opposition party, Musavat \n     (``Equality''), injuring at least 50 protesters.\n        Most of the arrests have occurred since October 16, when \n     attempts by the security forces to prevent a march organized \n     by the opposition turned violent. For details, please see \n     Human Rights Watch press release ``Azerbaijan: Post-Election \n     Clashes Turn Deadly.''\n        Human Rights Watch has been able to confirm at least 190 \n     arrests of opposition leaders and supporters, although the \n     actual number of detainees is much higher. For example, the \n     Minister of Interior stated on October 17 that 190 persons \n     had been detained during the October 16 violence alone. Many \n     of those arrested were beaten while being taken into custody.\n        The charges, if any, against those detained are unknown, \n     as in many cases they have not had access to counsel.\n        Several national leaders of the opposition have been among \n     those arrested, including Sardar Jalaloglu, secretary-general \n     of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party (ADP), taken from his home \n     on October 18 by armed masked men; Igbal Agazadeh, chair \n     of the Umid (``Hope'') Party, arrested on October 17; \n     Panah Huseinov, chair of the Khalq (``Nation'') Party, and \n     a former prime minister of Azerbaijan, arrested on October \n     19; and Vagif Hajibeili, chair of the Ahrar party, \n     arrested on October 17.\n       Most of the national leaders are being held at the \n     Organized Crime Unit of the Ministry of Interior, a \n     department that routinely uses torture and other physical \n     abuse against detainees, according to Human Rights Watch \n     research. For details, please see Human Rights Watch briefing \n     paper ``Azerbaijan: Presidential Elections 2003.''\n       The main opposition leader and presidential contender Isa \n     Gambar, chair of the Musavat party, is under house arrest, \n     and his bodyguards have been detained. Several Musavat deputy \n     chiefs have been arrested, including Sulheddin Akper, deputy \n     chief for international affairs; Ibrahim Ibrahimli, deputy \n     chief for humanitarian affairs; Arif Hajiev, deputy chief for \n     organizational affairs; and Mirbaba Babaev, a member of the \n     Musavat supreme council.\n       The campaign of arrest has also focused on members of the \n     ``Our Azerbaijan'' bloc, including many civil society \n     leaders, who supported the candidacy of Musavat leader Isa \n     Gambar. Mehti Mehtiev, director of the Human Rights Resource \n     Center, was arrested at his home on October 18. Itimar \n     Asadov, chair of the Karabakh Invalids Association, was \n     arrested on October 17. The security forces also attempted to \n     arrest Ilgar Ibrahimoglu, a major religious leader and the \n     head of the Center for the Protection of Conscience and \n     Religious Freedom; he received refuge in the Norwegian \n     Embassy after two of his associates, Azad Nazimanoglu and \n     Najaf Allahverdiyev, were arrested on October 17.\n       The authorities have also detained local opposition \n     activists in villages and towns throughout Azerbaijan. For \n     example, on October 17, police in the town of Saatli arrested \n     Agarza Miriev, the local Musavat chief; Beibala Akperov, his \n     deputy; Mikhail Humbatov, chair of the local ADP branch; \n     Chingiz Umudov, the local chief of the Liberal Party; and \n     Fakhreddin Abdiev, the local chief of the Azerbaijan Popular \n     Front Party (APFP).\n       Among other local leaders whose arrest Human Rights Watch \n     has been able to confirm are: the chairs or deputy chairs of \n     the Musavat party branches of Ali Bairamli, Gazakh, Gabala, \n     Ismaili, and Jalilabad, Sumgait; the head of the ADP branches \n     in Ali Bairamli, Imishli, and Zagatla; the chairs of the \n     Azerbaijani National Independence Party (ANIP) branches in \n     Ganja, Quba, and Shamkir; and the chairs of the APFP branches \n     in Jalilabad and Siazan. Human Rights Watch also confirmed \n     the arrest of the head of the Umid party in Ali Bairamli. All \n     of their names are on file with Human Rights Watch.\n       In addition, the Azerbaijani authorities have arrested \n     dozens of opposition members who served as observers and \n     polling-station officials during the October 15 election \n     because they refused to sign vote tallies from their polling \n     stations that they believed were fraudulent. The tallies, \n     known as protocols, require the signatures of polling-station \n     officials. In the town of Ganja alone, Human Rights Watch has \n     obtained the names of 32 opposition polling-station officials \n     who are currently being detained for their refusal to sign \n     fraudulent vote tallies.\n       International monitors from the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe and \n     the National Institute for Democracy (NDI) have confirmed \n     widespread fraud on election day. According to many reports, \n     the families of opposition election officials who refused to \n     sign forged protocols have also come under pressure and been \n     victims of intimidation from government officials, and in \n     some cases have themselves been arrested.\n       Human Rights Watch calls on the Azerbaijani authorities to \n     immediately end the crackdown against members of the \n     opposition. Human Rights Watch further urged the Azerbaijani \n     government to carry out a prompt, independent and impartial \n     investigation into the violence plaguing the country prior \n     and subsequent to the election, and to investigate and \n     prosecute security officials and others implicated in abuses. \n     Urgent international action is needed to prevent a further \n     decline in human rights conditions in Azerbaijan, Human \n     Rights Watch stressed.\n       Human Rights Watch also urges the Council of Europe and the \n     OSCE, together with the United States and the European Union, \n     to press the Aerbaijani government to form an independent \n     commission to investigate election fraud. Election experts \n     from the Council of Europe and OSCE should be part of this \n     commission.\n       ``Azerbaijan is giong through its most serious human rights \n     crisis of the past decade,'' said Bouckaert. ``If this \n     crackdown continues, there won't be an opposition left in \n     Azerbaijan by the end of the month.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13047-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13047-S13048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        STATUS OF ENERGY BILL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, yesterday, in a joint statement, Senator \nDomenici and Representative Tauzin indicated that because of continued \ndisagreements over energy tax provisions that additional conference \nmeetings on comprehensive energy legislation will not occur this week. \nAt the same time, Representative Tauzin and Senator Domenici announced \nthat final agreements had been reached on ethanol and electricity. I \nlearned about these developments, as did my other Democratic colleagues \nwho serve on the conference committee to the energy bill, not from \nmeeting with the chairman of the conference, but through third-hand \nnews accounts.\n  The exclusion of Democrats from the conference committee process is \nwell known. Yesterday, Senator Bingaman, the ranking democrat on the \nSenate Energy Committee and one of the Senate's foremost experts on \nenergy matters, raised these same points on the Senate floor. By \nchoosing not to release to the public Republican-bargained agreements \non ethanol and electricity, the Congress runs a substantial risk of \nharming South Dakota farmers and consumers, while failing to produce \nthe long-term energy policy our country requires.\n  Implementing an aggressive renewable fuels standard that grows demand \nfor ethanol is vitally important to the ethanol industry, American \nfarmers, and our long-term energy security. South Dakota is at the \nforefront of expanding ethanol production with 1 of every 3 rows of \ncorn in South Dakota devoted to ethanol production. Nearly 8,000 South \nDakota farm families are connected to my State's nine ethanol \nfacilities. Implementing a Renewable Fuels Standard, RFS, that \nsignificantly benefits this growing industry is more important than \nslapping together an agreement cut by a few Senators in order to grease \nthe wheels for passage of a broader energy bill.\n  As I look at the list of Republican conferees serving on the energy \nconference, I am very concerned that by excluding Democrats, such as \nSenators Dorgan, Daschle, and Baucus, that the ethanol agreement \nconstructed will not produce the long-term benefits South Dakota's \nmember-owned ethanol facilities and farmers expect from this bill. This \nconcern is not only shared by Senate Democrats, but many Republican \nSenators who want to grow ethanol production. Last Friday, 29 Senators \nwrote to Senator Domenici and Representative Tauzin reiterating that \nthe conference accept the Senate's ethanol agreement that passed on a \nbipartisan vote of 68 to 28. Unfortunately, opponents of renewable \nfuels appear to be prevailing within the conference. Therefore, I have \ngreat concerns with the decision by Senator Domenici not to release the \nethanol and electricity agreements to the public so that it could be \nreviewed by all conferees.\n  By refusing to release the ethanol and electricity agreements, South \nDakotans are deprived of the opportunity to understand how this bill \nwill impact their pocketbook and livelihood. Notwithstanding a vague \nagreement to allow conferees to review the language 24 hours before a \nfinal vote, this closed process could ultimately produce a bill that \nhurts my constituents. The electricity provisions in this bill have a \nsignificant impact on the thousands of customers in my State served by \nrural\n\n[[Page S13048]]\n\nelectric cooperatives, yet this complicated section that could easily \ncomprise over 100 pages of text will be released only one day before a \nfinal vote. My concerns go far beyond procedural fairness but speak \ndirectly to what type of electricity market Congress envisions taking \nshape in the next decade, and how to ensure that markets do not \ndisadvantage consumers. Will the authority over setting rates and \nensuring the reliability of the power grid be handled primarily through \nindividual States or the Federal Government? What incentives are \ncontained in the bill to encourage utilities to serve less populated \nregions of the country and maintain the infrastructure needed for \nreliable and dependable service? The answers to these complicated \nquestions lie within the closely guarded deals agreed to by a handful \nof Senators and Congressman.\n  It is very important that the conferees have access to these \nagreements as soon as possible so that conferees can share them with \nour constituents. The Senate has twice passed comprehensive energy \nlegislation in the last 2 years because of an open and deliberative \nprocess that produced compromise and solutions on ethanol and \nelectricity, as well as other contentious provisions. That same \nopenness is needed at this time if we are to construct an energy policy \nthat grows domestic energy sources and secures reliable and available \nsupplies of energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13048-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in \nWashington, D.C. On August 21, 2003, Aaryn Marshall, 25, was shot and \nkilled. Mr. Marshall was a transgender individual, and dressed and \nlived as a woman. Police have classified the second-degree murder as a \nhate crime. Mr. Marshall was one of three transgendered residents shot \nin the city in a six-day period in August.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13048-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DANIEL W. McGINTY\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDaniel W. McGinty, upon his retirement from the Federal Government \nafter 33 years of distinguished and dedicated service to our Nation and \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Over the last 10 years, some of us in this Chamber have had dealings \nwith Dan, as he carried out his responsibilities as the director of \ncongressional and public affairs for the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) \nand most recently with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). \nHis frequent dealings with the staff of the Armed Services Committees \nof the Senate and House have been a paragon of professionalism, \ndiplomacy, and conscientious service. With integrity and an engaging \npersonal style, Dan consisently exercised a remarkable talent for \nreconciling divergent points of view, and doing so in a way that \nresulted in mutually acceptable outcome for all involved, be it in the \narena of legislation or constituent services.\n  Dan's career journey began more than three decades ago. Upon his \ngraduation from Eastern New Mexico University in 1970, he entered the \nArmy as a counterintelligence agent at Ft. Ord, California. Following \nan honorable discharge in 1973, Dan began his Federal civilian career \nat Kirtland Air Force Base, NM, progressing through a variety of \ncontract-management positions over the ensuing 10 years.\n  In the mid-1980s, Dan got his first taste of life in the Nation's \nCapital, serving as the strategic planning officer on the staff of the \nCommander, Air Force Systems Command. After 4 years in that position, \nhe returned to Kirtland AFB to head up the resources-planning division. \nThen in 1989, upon the issuance of Defense Management Review Decision \n916, which placed all Defense contract administration under DLA's \nDefense Contract Management Command, Dan returned to the Washington, \nDC, area to serve as the director of program and technical support for \nspecial programs at DCMC headquarters.\n  But all that was mere prelude to what Dan will best be remembered \nfor--his proficiency, acumen, and credibility as the congressional \naffairs impresario for DLA and DCMA, two of the Defense Department's \nleading combat-support agencies. Since February 1994, he has been a \nhighly effective ambassador to Capitol Hill, articulating agency \nprograms and deftly conveying his agencies' perspective on emerging \nlegislation.\n  Displaying an enviable blend of affability and sophistication, Dan \nestablished and enjoyed a marvelous rapport with Senate and House \nstaff. Always responsive and informed, he consistently met the \ncongressional and media demands placed on him while protecting and \npromoting the interests of the agencies he represented.\n  Whether he was contributing to the successful development of a \nclassified weapons systems program, responding to pointed questions \nfrom reporters, or explaining contract-management initiatives to \ncongressional staff, Dan McGinty carried out his pressure-packed \nresponsibilities with unwavering diligence, integrity, and competence.\n  On the occasion of his retirement from Federal service, I offer my \ncongratulations and thanks to this respected resident of northern \nVirginia, and wish him and his wife, Sue, well in their future \npursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13048-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CELEBRATING WORLD CUP SPEEDSKATING IN MARQUETTE, MICHIGAN\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I call attention to a wonderful \nsporting event that will be held Friday, Saturday and Sunday in the \ncity of Marquette in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\n  On those days the United States Olympic Education Center will host \nWorld Cup speedskating at the Berry Events Center at Northern Michigan \nUniversity.\n  I am sure you recall how short track speedskating suddenly became the \nsport of the hour during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, as \nwe all cheered on the American speedskating phenomenon Apolo Ohno. The \nexcitement of this high-speed sport, where a slip and a fall always \nseems to be just a step away, became one of the most-talked about \nevents of the games.\n  When the Olympic games were finished and Apolo left with his medals, \nI am afraid that for most viewers speedskating slipped back into the \nsports shadows. It was not likely to be a sport that would bump \nfootball, golf or NASCAR from the prime Sunday afternoon viewing slot.\n  Despite this media eclipse, however, speedskating remains as riveting \nas it was during the Olympics. Highly-trained athletes still challenge \nboth gravity and centrifugal force on the razor edge of their skates. \nStrategists on the track still plot their pace, waiting for the right \nmoment to begin a sprint or challenge for the lead. And 150 of the \nworld's best speedskaters from more than 25 countries will thrill \ncrowds of northern Michigan residents who know their winter sports, \nfrom dog-sledding to ski-jumping.\n  The event also promises an economic boost to an area that has been \nsustained many economic blows, and it will showcase Marquette, MI, an \nAll-American community.\n  I have long supported the United States Olympic Education Center at \nNorthern Michigan University, and I praise them for their successful \neffort in matching this world-class event to an area that I have always \nconsidered world-class in its natural beauty--Michigan's Upper \nPeninsula.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13048-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13048-S13049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN RECOGNITION OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES COMMISSION\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the work of \nthe Hous-\n\n[[Page S13049]]\n\ning Opportunities Commission of Montgomery County, MD. Today, the \nHousing Opportunities Commission is celebrating the 10th anniversary of \nits Family Self Sufficiency, FSS, program, which helps low-income \nfamilies with section 8 housing vouchers or living in public housing \nmeet their educational and employment goals. The Housing Opportunities \nCommission has established a wonderful program that provides resources \nto low-income families to help them find and retain employment along \nwith the opportunity for families to put away savings. These savings \nallow families to pay for educational opportunities, transportation or \neven the purchase of a home. While many housing authorities operate \nFamily Self Sufficiency programs, I believe that the Housing \nOpportunities Commission has done an extraordinary job of helping its \nresidents achieve economic independence.\n  In the 10 years that the Commission has operated the Family Self \nSufficiency program, almost 350 people have graduated and are well on \ntheir way to financial independence. These families faced significant \nbarriers to gaining employment--33 percent were on welfare or were \nunemployed, many had no high school degree and 95 percent are single \nparents. Despite these obstacles, all 347 graduates have been able to \nretain stable employment, and 25 percent of the FSS graduates have \npurchased their own homes, a remarkable achievement.\n  The Housing Opportunities Commission, HOC, has been committed to this \nimportant program for 10 years. By providing intensive case management, \nopportunities for education and job training and assistance in finding \nand paying for child care, HOC has ensured that the families enrolled \nin FSS can make the transition from welfare to work a successful one.\n  In addition to working to better the lives of Montgomery County \nresidents, the Housing Opportunities Commission has been a strong \nadvocate for the program, helping me and others in Congress fight to \ncontinue and even expand the FSS program. In 1998, my colleagues and I \nfought to keep this program and thankfully, we were able to strengthen \nit by requiring that certain increases in income were disregarded for \npurposes of determining the amount of rent a family pays. Families who \ntake part in FSS and increase their incomes are able to save money in \nan escrow account instead of paying more in rent. This is a great \nencouragement for families to find better employment, and it ensures \nthat funds are available when necessary for emergencies. In addition, \nlast year, I introduced legislation which would expand the program so \nthat families living in project-based section 8 developments could also \nbenefit from a housing agency's self-sufficiency programs.\n  The Family Self Sufficiency program is one that changes lives for the \nbetter, and that is evident when looking at this year's participants in \nHOC's program. This year, 36 new families will graduate from the FSS \nprogram in Montgomery County, and I want to recognize the work that \nthey have done to become self-sufficient. Ninety-two percent of these \ngraduates have participated in education and/or job training courses \nand seven graduates have become homeowners.\n  These individuals are not only better positioned to participate in \nthe job market, but they are providing stability for their families and \nmodels for their communities. The staff at HOC and the graduates of the \nFSS program, present, past, and future, are to be commended for their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13049-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13049-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13049-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill and joint resolution were read the second time, \nand placed on the calendar:\n\n       H.R. 1446.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of Ohio \n     relative to the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, the human embryo is a living organism of the \n     species Homo sapiens at the earliest stages of development \n     (including the single-celled stage), and human cloning a \n     human being at the embryonic stage of life and grows this new \n     human being solely to be exploited (``reproductive cloning) \n     or destroyed (so-called ``therapeutic'' cloning) through \n     nontherapeutic research and experimentation; and\n       Whereas, human cloning is a manufacturing process in which \n     a human being is created in a laboratory; human cloning \n     indicates a utilitarian view in which a human being is \n     created merely for usefulness with no respect for the dignity \n     of that human being; and human cloning creates a human being \n     who is the twin of a parent, has no other biological parent, \n     and is the child of the grandparents, thereby causing serious \n     moral, social, and legal issues; and\n       Whereas, current human cloning attempts pose a substantial \n     risk of producing human beings with unpredictable but \n     potentially devastating health problems; and\n       Whereas, such human cloning attempts are grossly \n     irresponsible and unethical; and\n       Whereas, the United States House of Representatives passed \n     the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001, a complete ban, \n     and the President of the United States has called for a \n     complete human cloning ban; and\n       Whereas, a complete human cloning ban is achieved by the \n     passage of the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003 as \n     introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Sam\n\n[[Page S13050]]\n\n     Brownback (S. 245) and in the United States House of \n     Representatives by Representative Dave Weldon (H.R. 234) and \n     is not achieved by the passage of other human cloning \n     prohibition acts that allow the creation of human embryos by \n     cloning so long as they are killed for research: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly of the State of Ohio \n     urges the 108th Congress of the United States to pass and the \n     President to sign the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2003; \n     and be it further *  *  *\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-307.

Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, \n     Imposts and Excises . . .''; and\n        Whereas, their intent is unambiguous, made clear by the \n     analysis of James Madison, who observed in The Federalist No. \n     48\n\n[[Page S13052]]\n\n     that ``. . . the legislative department alone has access to \n     the pockets of the people . . .''; and\n        Whereas, the same view is expressed by Alexander Hamilton, \n     who asked rhetorically in The Federalist No. 33, ``[w]hat is \n     the power of laying and collecting taxes but a legislative \n     power . . .?,'' and follows consistently in The Federalist \n     No. 78, in which he argued that the judiciary should be the \n     least dangerous branch of government inasmuch as judges would \n     have ``. . . no influence over either the sword or the purse \n     . . .''; and\n        Whereas, yet today, Hamilton's argument no longer rings \n     true; through legal orders and the exercise of judicial \n     threat and intimidation, federal courts have usurped the role \n     of the legislative branch and have gone so far as to apply it \n     even to non-federal levels of government, mandating state and \n     local requirements that have the direct, or indirect, effect \n     of imposing judicial taxes upon the states and their \n     political subdivisions; and\n        Whereas, in so vesting itself by fiat with control of the \n     public purse strings, the federal judiciary has contravened \n     and overridden the constitutional separation of powers \n     between the different branches--and levels--of government, \n     threatening creation of a fiscal oligarchy unbeholden to \n     influence by the electorate; and\n        Whereas, the states and Congress have too long ignored \n     this self-proclamation and seizure of taxation prerogatives, \n     and it behooves all Americans to preserve their rights by the \n     adoption of an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, re-establishing the fundamental link between \n     taxation and representation; and\n       Whereas, seeking to reverse the aforementioned Jenkins \n     decision of 1990, lawmakers in 23 other States--and in two \n     territories of the United States--beginning in 1993, have \n     already adopted and transmitted to Congress memorials \n     requesting that Congress propose an amendment to the United \n     States Constitution, and those memorials have been entered in \n     the Congressional Record as follows:\n       the Missouri General Assembly in 1993 (Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution No. 9) designated as POM-175 in Volume 139 of the \n     Congressional Record at page 14565;\n       the Colorado General Assembly in 1994 (Senate Joint \n     Memorial No. 94-2) designated as POM-569 in Volume 140 of the \n     Congressional Record at page 15070;\n       the New York Senate in 1994 (Senate No. 3352) designated as \n     POM-578 in Volume 140 of the Congressional Record at page \n     15073;\n       the Tennessee General Assembly in 1994 (Senate Joint \n     Resolution No. 372) designated as POM-580 in Volume 140 of \n     the Congressional Record at page 15074;\n       the Arizona Legislature in 1995 (Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution No. 1014) designated as POM-523 in Volume 142 of \n     the Congressional Record at pages 6586 and 6587;\n       the Louisiana Legislature in 1995 (Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution No. 11) designated as POM-525 in Volume 142 of the \n     Congressional Record at page 6587;\n       the Massachusetts Senate in 1995 (unnumbered resolution) \n     designated as POM-625 in Volume 142 of the Congressional \n     Record at pages 14940 and 14941 and designated as POM-638 at \n     page 15486;\n       the Nevada Legislature in 1995 (Senate Joint Resolution No. \n     2) designated as POM-287 in Volume 141 of the Congressional \n     Record at page 22422;\n       the Alaska Legislature in both 1996 and 1998 (House Joint \n     Resolution No. 30 in 1996) designated as POM-622 in Volume \n     142 of the Congressional Record at pages 14939 and 14940;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to visas for temporary agricultural workers; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 314\n\n       Whereas, the tragic events of September 11, 2001, have \n     caused us to reexamine a host of policies and practices to do \n     all we can to increase the security of our state and nation. \n     Because of the magnitude of the attacks and the fact that \n     murderers plotted the attacks over a long period of time, we \n     are now making greater efforts to address the issue of aliens \n     who are here illegally; and\n       Whereas, as the issue of immigration is closely examined, \n     it is imperative that our nation remember the vitally \n     important role that law-abiding aliens play in our country. \n     Temporary workers meet a necessary and productive need in \n     many sectors of our economy. This is most apparent in the \n     area of agriculture. Michigan, which benefits greatly from \n     the efforts of seasonal agricultural workers, especially from \n     Mexico, is keenly aware of how much these workers contribute \n     to our state; and\n       Whereas, the country's policies toward temporary \n     agricultural workers need to be assessed in the context of \n     the importance of these people to our nation. The current \n     number of visas for temporary agricultural workers may not be \n     sufficient. If this number is too low, it may have the effect \n     of increasing the number of aliens here without \n     documentation, even though seasonal farm workers would rather \n     be here by following all of the regulations. The current \n     program used for temporary agricultural workers visa \n     processing (H2A) should be reformed. Making the process of \n     gaining the proper visa smoother and increasing the number of \n     these workers who can be here lawfully may well benefit the \n     economy as well as increase national security: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service to determine the \n     appropriateness of increasing the number of visas for \n     temporary agricultural workers, and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13052-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13052-S13053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HATCH, from the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n[[Page S13053]]\n\n       Report to accompany S. 1293, A bill to criminalize the \n     sending of predatory and abusive e-mail (Rept.

A bill to permit biomedical research corporations to engage \nin certain equity financings without incurring limitations on net \noperating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the \nBiotechnology Future Investment Expansion Act of 2003. I am pleased \nthat Senator Carper is cosponsoring this important, bipartisan bill.\n  Biotechnology holds great promise for breakthroughs in health care, \nagriculture and defense against bioterrorism. However, recent years \nhave seen promising biotech medical therapies endangered due to flawed \ntax treatment and a lack of willing capital. This legislation will \nlevel the playing field to encourage further investment and innovation \nin this vital sector of our economy.\n  The nearly 1,500 biotechnology companies in the U.S. have produced \n130 FDA-approved products while another 350 biotech drug products and \nvaccines are currently in clinical trials. Most biotechnology \nresearchers work in promising, but relatively narrow fields, and only a \nsmall number of their peers are qualified to evaluate the theoretical \npromise of any new idea. On average, it takes these researchers more \nthan 10 years and $500 million to develop a new biotech therapy, and \nthis highly capital-intensive research is more often done at small-to-\nmedium-sized companies that are yet to market a saleable product.\n  These factors combine to create an industry structure that is unique \nin our economic history. Unfortunately, this unique structure prevents \nthe biotechnology industry from utilizing research incentives intended \nto promote just the kind of research it engages in. Specifically, net \noperating loss carryforwards (NOLs), which are meant to allow research-\nintensive industries like biotechnology to apply current losses against \nfuture profits for tax purposes, are routinely made worthless to \nbiotech companies due to an unintended consequence of the tax code. In \nfact, the current tax treatment of NOLs impairs, rather than fosters, \nbiotechnology research. This is because rules designed to prevent abuse \nof NOLs through acquisition often inadvertently trigger restrictions on \nthe use of a biotech firm's NOLs, rendering them useless in many cases, \nwhen all the company has done is raise more capital.\n  Section 382, which for the most part has proven to be an effective \nguard against tax abusive NOL trafficking, describes the many \ncircumstances that can be classified as an ownership change. \nUnfortunately, those circumstances apply to and penalize the frequent \nbiotech practice of raising equity in successive financing rounds. This \npractice is essential to successfully negotiating the long product \ndevelopment and Food and Drug Administration approval processes.\n  These limitations unintentionally discourage biotechnology research \nand leave the firms that would otherwise conduct that research in dire \nfinancial straits. Without these firms, the money that is being poured \ninto research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and elsewhere \nto combat diseases such as cancer, AIDS, hepatitis, cardiovascular \nailments, diabetes, and central nervous system disorders, as well as \nmany rare diseases, will have a significantly reduced potential to lead \nto new cures. We may never know what cures will be lost without action.\n  Recognizing the unique structure of the biotech industry--a structure \nthat the architects and stewards of the Tax Code likely never \nimagined--this legislation is narrowly drafted to exempt certain \nqualified investments in biotechnology from Section 382 restrictions. \nThis change will spur investment in biotechnology, so we can continue \nthe pursuit of innovative and life-saving therapies, all while \ncontinuing to prevent the fraudulent use of NOLs, as Section 382 \nintends.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Reed, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 1774. A bill to repeal the sunset provisions in the Undetectable \nFirearms Act of 1988; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Terrorist Firearms Detection Act of 2003.\n  Since the atrocities of September 11, Congress has acted with strong \nbipartisan support to win the war on terrorism and protect the country \nfrom future attacks. We've improved the security of our airports and \nour borders, strengthened our defenses against bioterrorism, and given \nlaw enforcement new powers to investigate terrorist threats and prevent \nterrorism.\n  But Congress has not yet acted to renew one of the Nation's most \nessential protections against terrorism. The Undetectable Firearms \nAct--also known as the ``plastic gun'' law--makes it illegal to \nmanufacture, import, possess, or transfer a firearm that is not \ndetectable by walk-through metal detectors or airport x-ray machines. \nOnly firearms necessary for certain military and intelligence uses are \nexempt.\n  This law was first enacted in 1988, long before the attacks on 9/11, \nand it is more important than ever now. It has been extended once since \nit was first enacted, but it is now scheduled to expire on December 10. \nThe administration has made no public statements on the need to renew \nit, and neither has the Republican leadership of the House or Senate. \nUnless Congress and the President act soon, Americans will find \nthemselves needlessly vulnerable to terrorist attacks and other gun \nviolence in airlines, airports, schools, and office buildings.\n  The gun industry clearly has the technology to manufacture firearms \nthat cannot be detected by metal detectors and x-ray machines.\n  As early as 1986, Congress's Office of Technology Assessment found \nthat ``technology does exist to manufacture certain firearms which \nwould be completely or almost completely non-metallic,'' and that \n``plastic handguns may be available on the commercial market quite \nsoon.''\n  A 1985 report by the American Firearms Industry emphasized the \nprofitability of plastic guns for the industry: ``The American plastic \ngun will shortly make its appearance. Plastic is the `common' word, but \nit's really liquid crystal polymer. . . . [I]n the long run, if a 100% \nplastic gun works, this would be great for sales. What this does is \nmake everything that has been produced in this century obsolete. That \nis exactly what our industry desperately needs. This will give us a \nwhole new, and real reason to resell every hunter and shooter in \nAmerica.''\n  In 1986, Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi tried to purchase more than \n100 handguns produced in Austria and made almost entirely of hardened \nplastic.\n  The technology of gun manufacturers has clearly improved since the \n1980's--and the desire of terrorists to attack Americans has soared. We \nknow that terrorists are exploiting the weaknesses and loopholes in \nU.S. gun laws.\n  In 2000, a member of the Middle East terrorist group Hezbollah was \nconvicted in Detroit on gun charges and conspiracy to ship guns and \nammunition to Lebanon. He had bought many of those guns at gun shows in \nMichigan.\n  In 2001, American soldiers found a terrorist training manual entitled \n``How Can I Train Myself for Jihad'' in a house in Afghanistan. It \nstated: ``In other countries, e.g., some states of USA. . . . it is \nperfectly legal for members of the public to own certain types of \nfirearms. If you live in such a country, obtain an assault rifle \nlegally . . . learn how to use it properly and go and practice in the \nareas allowed for such training.''\n  What could be clearer? We know what's coming. Terrorists are eager to \nexploit weaknesses in our gun laws, and there is no doubt that \nAmericans will be at much greater risk if Congress fails to renew the \nUndetectable Firearms Act.\n  Just last week, Admiral James M. Loy of the Transportation Security \nAdministration testified that, according to U.S. intelligence, \nterrorists are more likely to try to hijack a commercial airliner than \nattempt to shoot\n\n[[Page S13056]]\n\ndown an aircraft with shoulder-fired missiles. The December 2001 arrest \nof attempted ``shoe bomber'' Richard Reid showed just how committed \nterrorists are to smuggling undetectable plastic explosives onto \nairplanes. Reid was stopped at the last minute by alert passengers and \ncrew, not by any detection machinery. The legalization of undetectable \nguns will clearly increase the danger to flight crews, passengers and \nother citizens exponentially.\n  The need for action is urgent. The Terrorist Firearms Detection Act \nwill renew the Act and make it permanent. The danger to security from \nplastic firearms will not sunset, and the law that bans them shouldn't \nsunset either.\n  The Terrorist Firearms Detection Act is supported by Americans for \nGun Safety, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence United with the \nMillion Mom March, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Violence \nPolicy Center. The only organization to have opposed the ban on plastic \nguns in the past is the National Rifle Association, and it's fair to \nask, ``Whose side are they on?'' If they insist on another sunset, \nperhaps we can sunset the NRA instead.\n  The bill we are introducing today is only one of several steps that \nCongress should take to protect our people from gun violence. Senator \nLautenberg's Homeland Security Gun Safety Act will close the loopholes \nin our gun laws that allow rogue gun dealers to evade the law and sell \nguns illegally to criminals and terrorists. That's how the D.C. snipers \nacquired their Bushmaster rifle.\n  Congress should also act to strengthen criminal background checks for \ngun purchases under the Brady Law, renew the assault weapons ban, and \nclose the ``gun show loophole'' once and for all. Each of these gun-\nsafety measures is needed to protect our people in communities across \nthe country, and I urge my colleagues to support them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13056-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 249--TO STRIKE PARAGRAPH 2 OF RULE XXII OF THE \n           STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE, RELATING TO CLOTURE\n\n  Mr. MILLER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 74\n\n       Whereas there are reported missing in the United States \n     approximately 2,000 children each day and up to 800,000 \n     children each year;\n       Whereas the National Center for Missing and Exploited \n     Children was established 19 years ago as the Nation's \n     resource center and clearinghouse for information on \n     America's missing children, and issued a national call to \n     action requesting the participation of every citizen to \n     assist in the search for the country's missing youth;\n       Whereas it is the collective responsibility of all \n     Americans to better protect the Nation's children, as well as \n     to assist in the search for those who are missing;\n       Whereas the issuance of a stamp bearing the image of a \n     missing child sends a powerful message, both at its unveiling \n     and on each letter on which it is sent, that Americans will \n     neither tolerate the victimization of their children nor rest \n     until each missing child is reunited with his or her family; \n     and\n       Whereas the Missing Children's Stamp Committee, \n     headquartered in New York State, has collected more than \n     26,000 letters from around the world in support of such a \n     stamp: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) a postage stamp should be issued by the United States \n     Postal Service to honor all missing children; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Commission of the United States \n     Postal Service should recommend to the Postmaster General \n     that such a stamp be issued.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nShelby, to submit a resolution to encourage the United States Postal \nService Stamp Advisory Committee to issue the National Missing and \nExploited Children's Postage Stamp. I am proud to join my colleague \nCongressman Boehlert, the champion of this legislation in the House, \nand am honored to be a part of this effort.\n  We introduce this resolution today on the 14th anniversary of the \nabduction of Jacob Wetterling. Jacob was only 11 years old when he was \nkidnapped at gunpoint while riding his bike on his way home from a \nconvenience store in St. Joseph, MN. Though he was taken from his \nfamily and friends on this day his memory is still alive. With support \nfrom his community, Jacob's parents established the Jacob Wetterling \nFoundation, which has successfully advocated for local and national \nlegislation to help prevent future abductions and to protect thousands \nof children from sexual predators.\n  There are 800,000 parents every year, like the Wetterlings, who \nendure the loss of a child and are struggling to come to terms with the \nhelplessness, anger, and frustration that consume them during the \nensuing weeks and months. Many of my colleagues know all too well the \nagony of losing a child. As parents, community members, legislators, we \nare all affected when a child goes missing.\n  I want to take this opportunity to recognize the important work of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). This \norganization was established by Congress in 1984 through the Missing \nChildren's Assistance Act to carry out the mission of finding missing \nchildren, combating child sexual exploitation, and preventing child \nvictimization. Through its partnership with 18,000 law enforcement \nagencies across the United States and abroad, NCMEC's is unparalleled \nin its commitment to this issue.\n  Last year, I was proud to submit the Code Adam Act, a resolution \nencouraging public places to employ a Code Adam protocol to thwart \nchild abductions in commercial establishments. The Code Adam protocol \nwas named in memory of 6-year-old Adam Walsh, the son of John Walsh, \nco-founder of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \nand host of ``America's Most Wanted.'' Adam was murdered after being \nkidnapped from a Florida shopping mall in 1981. The Code Adam Protocol \nrequires store employees to announce a ``Code Adam'' alert over the \npublic-address system when a customer reports a missing child. All \ndesignated employees receive a brief description of the child, \nimmediately stop their normal work to search for that child, and \nmonitor all exists to help prevent the child from leaving the store. \nThe Code Adam Act was approved by Congress in April of this year as \npart of the PROTECT Act and was signed into law on April 30, 2003 by \nthe President. It will undoubtedly play an important role in finding \nmissing children and returning them safely to their homes.\n  I was also a proud cosponsor of the National AMBER Alert Network Act \nof 2003. This Act brings critical financial assistance to States to \nhelp them implement AMBER plans. It also creates an AMBER coordinator \nwithin the Department of Justice. AMBER, which stands for America's \nMissing: Broadcast Emergency Response was created in 1996 after the \nabduction and murder of Amber Hagerman in Texas. It's an emergency \nalert plan like that used in storm warnings that alerts a community \nabout the recent disappearance of a child. With the help of the \nNational Center of Missing and Exploited Children, the broadcast \ncommunity, and members of law enforcement, the AMBER Alert helped find \n105 children\n\n[[Page S13057]]\n\nacross the country. Justice Department Statistics show that 74 percent \nof kidnapped children who are later found murdered are killed within \nthe first 3 hours of their abduction. The National Amber Alert Network \nAct will help law enforcement, in those early critical hours, as they \nwork hard to find a missing child. I am pleased that it was also \napproved by Congress and signed into law as part of the PROTECT Act.\n\n  Ten years ago, on August 18, 1993, Sara Ann Woods, a child of \nHerkimer County, NY, was abducted as she was riding home from her \nfather's church in Litchfield, NY. After 3 years her kidnapper \nconfessed to her murder, leaving the town devastated. Sara's death has \nbeen and continues to be the inspiration behind this legislation. I \nalso want to mention Marc Klaas and John Walsh, the honorary co-\nchairmen of the Missing Children's Stamp Committee in Mohawk Valley, \nNY, and Herkimer County Legislator John Brezinski, who has worked \ntirelessly on this effort.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort with Senators Shelby, \nDeWine, Lincoln, Kennedy, Lautenberg, Hagel and Miller as original \ncosponsors.\n  According to a poll by Zogby, more than two out of every three \nAmericans support a National Missing and Exploited Children's Postage \nStamp. This commemorative stamp will help raise awareness and honor \nthese missing children and their families. This stamp will reach \nindividuals across geographic and socioeconomic spectrums, and we know \nthat when it comes to combating these terrible crimes, awareness is \ncrucial. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I believe \nthat it will make a difference in protecting the lives of our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13057-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1891.

I am very hopeful we can continue with this \nsort of efficient movement on the floor of the Senate for the remaining \nissues we have this year.\n  We do continue to work toward an agreement on a range of issues. They \ninclude Healthy Forests and the Internet tax moratorium, which is \ncurrently being worked on.\n  The CARE Act, as my colleagues can tell, continues to be a challenge, \nbut I hold out the hope that we will be able to send that bill to \nconference. Senator Rick Santorum has done just a superb job in \nshepherding that bill through the Senate. The companion bill has passed \nthe House of Representatives, and indeed it is time to address it in \nthe conference.\n  We are also looking toward an agreement on fair credit reporting \nwhich does have strong bipartisan support in this body. There are very \nfew objections. I hope we can take care of that in short order. We will \ncontinue to push very hard for that particular bill.\n  Also today, we addressed an issue on which we can't give up. We can't \nreally accept as the final punctuation mark the outcome of the vote \ntoday where we had 59 Senators say it is time for us to solve the class \naction challenge before this body. We didn't have 60 Senators. We had \n59--1 short. If we had just one other colleague come forward and say, \nyes, this is a problem for the American people, it is a problem for our \neconomy, it is a problem for our families, we would have been able to \nproceed with class action reform.\n  I want to take a couple of minutes and comment, because I didn't have \nthe opportunity earlier today, on the importance of class action \nreform. I should preface that by saying that just yesterday I came to \nthe floor to talk about my upbeat optimism for really the first time in \nthe last several months with regard to our economy.\n  That is in part for having traveled around the country this past \nweekend and talked to a lot of people in various occupations and \nvarious jobs. You can just see and sense and you can feel that \nincreased consumer optimism that is around the country.\n  Indeed, we had some very good economic numbers, some of which I \nmentioned yesterday. The Department of Commerce reported that \nconsumption is strong in this third quarter. Consumption grew by an \nannualized rate of over 12 percent. Many economists say this third-\nquarter consumption may be the strongest in almost 4 years.\n  New housing starts are annualized to be about 1.9 million based on \nthe results from last month. That is probably the highest in terms of \nhousing starts in the last 17 years. Production from our factories \nincreased 3.5 percent in this quarter. It had been negative the quarter \nbefore that. The Department of Labor also delivered the report that \ninitial jobless claims are at their lowest levels since February and \nthat in August the nonfarm sector employment rose by 57,000 jobs.\n  All of that I think is very encouraging news. As these economic \nindices continue to improve, with some lag time, that is translated \ninto increased jobs. But that is not enough. We have a lot we can do \nand we should be doing on the floor of Senate. We need to have smart \nprogrowth fiscal policies because we know that helps create jobs. It \ngives job security for those who are currently working.\n  I am optimistic that we are going to see this continued improvement \nin the economy, but equally importantly in job creation.\n  The sort of structural problems we need to address: Taking action on \nclass action reform. Class action lawsuits are a problem. What makes it \neven more important for us to address now is it is a problem that is \ngetting worse with time. A recent survey found that State court class \naction filings skyrocketed by 1,315 percent in just 10 years. The \nresult of this glut of claims--many unnecessary, many frivolous \nclaims--is that it clogs the State courts, it wastes taxpayer dollars, \nand it inhibits innovative in entrepreneurship that we all know is so \ncrucial to job growth. All the purported victims ever get in this \nsordid process is a little coupon--a measly little coupon. I say that \nnot just figuratively but literally.\n\n  A couple of examples:\n  In a suit against Blockbuster, plaintiffs' lawyers alleged that their \nclients were being fleeced by excessive late fees. They sued the video \nrental chain for restitution. The result was that each of their clients \nreceived a $1 coupon offer for future rentals while the\n\n[[Page S13062]]\n\nlawyers at the same time pocketed over $9 million. What is interesting \nis that, meanwhile, Blockbuster was allowed to continue that same late \nfee practice that the lawsuit was ostensibly launched to end--$9 \nmillion to the lawyers and a $1 coupon--but the practice continued.\n  You say that is outrageous and it couldn't be. It is a fact.\n  Another anecdote and equally outrageous had to do with Coca-Cola and \napple juice. What happened a few years ago was the plaintiffs' lawyers \ncharged that the Coca-Cola drink company was improperly adding \nsweeteners to its apple juice. These plaintiffs' lawyers, who were \nparading as vigilant deans of public health, managed to secure--yes, \nonce again--a 50-cent coupon for the apple juice victims but the \nlawyers received $1.5 million.\n  If you think that is outrageous, in a class action suit against the \nBank of Boston plaintiffs actually lost money when their accounts were \ndrawn down to pay their lawyers $8.5 million in fees.\n  That is large business. Also, these large suits have a direct impact \non small businesses. These small businesses get drawn into this feeding \nfrenzy that is going on around the country. What happens is that in \norder to avoid going to Federal court, the class action legal team will \nrope in local small businesses in the area as codefendants in order to \nget that case decided in--it may be an adjacent county or an adjacent \nState--a favorable State. Once the window during which the real class \naction target can remove the case to the Federal court closes, that \nunlucky mom-and-pop shop that happened to be in the wrong county or the \nwrong town at the wrong time is dropped from the case, but not before \nthey have had to invest considerable sums of money in this process of \ndefending themselves.\n  Such lawsuits are frivolous. Such lawsuits are unnecessary. They are \nwasteful and they translate into a burden on our economy, a burden on \nour judicial system, a burden on taxpayers, and clearly a burden on the \npractice of law. Who can help but be cynical about a system which we \nhave today that awards lawyers millions of dollars over an apple juice \nsweetener dispute?\n  So this can't go on. Too many of these lawsuits are little more than \noperations which shake down these small businesses or these large \nbusinesses.\n  Oftentimes the lawyers are counting on the company to pay a sizable \nsettlement just to avoid that higher cost of going to court. \nCompanies--whether big or small--should no longer be subjected to this \nblackmail, which is wrong and unfair. It needs to stop.\n  Today, we tried to take this issue to the floor of the Senate so it \ncould, once and for all, be addressed. Indeed, a majority--it was a \nbipartisan majority--of Senators said, yes, it is a problem; yes, it \ndeserves to be debated in the Senate; yes, several may have wanted to \namend it; yes, it is time to address this issue which is a burden on \nthe taxpayer. It is a burden on working men and women. It is a burden \non small businesses. It is a burden on families.\n  That was a majority. But in this body it takes 60 votes, not just a \nmajority, 60 of 100 Senators to say, yes, we are going to address that. \nWe only had 59.\n  I hope my colleagues will come back to the table. As majority leader, \nI promise I will stay on this issue until we have it resolved. It may \ntake constituents around the country saying, yes, it is important to \ncall Senators, to talk to Senators and encourage Senators in town \nmeetings, to say, yes, it is important to address this problem.\n  I hope my colleagues recognize the significance of this issue to our \neconomy and to working families.\n  If one more person came forward, we would be able to address this \nonce and for all. That would be good for the country. It would be good \nfor the law. It would be good for the economy. And it is good for the \nlegitimate claims that are out there and should be fairly and \nappropriately settled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13062-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13062-S13063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS RECOGNITION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SERVICES OF DIRECT \n                   SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS TO INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Government \n     and the States should make it a priority to promote a stable, \n     quality direct support workforce for individuals with mental \n     retardation or other developmental disabilities that advances \n     our Nation's commitment to community integration for such \n     individuals and to personal security for them and their \n     families.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has agreed to \npass S. Con. Res. 21, the Direct Support Professional Recognition \nResolution. Earlier this year, I introduced this bipartisan resolution \nwith Senator Lincoln. This resolution recognizes the importance of \ndirect support professionals who are responsible for helping those with \nmental retardation and disabilities integrate into and excel in \ncommunities across the nation.\n  These professionals provide a wide range of supportive services to \ntheir clients on a daily basis, including habitation, health needs, \npersonal care and hygiene, employment, transportation, recreation, \nhousekeeping and other home management-related supports and services so \nthat these individuals can live and work in their communities. These \njobs are demanding both physically and emotionally, and these direct \nsupport professionals should be commended for the important work they \ndo. This resolution and action by the Senate recognizes just how \nimportant they are to others in need.\n  The recruitment and retention of quality, trained direct support \nworkers is critical to providing high-quality support and services to \ndisabled individuals. Unfortunately, there is a crisis in the direct \nsupport field, particularly in finding and keeping quality direct \nsupport workers. In fact, the annual turnover rates of direct support \nworkers range from 40 percent and 75 percent.\n  Several factors have contributed to this crisis, including a \ntightened labor market, growing demand for community-based care, and \nlegal decisions supporting community integration. Unfortunately, many \nparents who rely on direct support professionals to help care for with \ndisabled child in the community are becoming concerned that these \nprofessionals may not be available in the future. No parent should be \nfaced with these types of worries.\n  This resolution draws much-needed attention to the problems \nsurrounding the long-term care infrastructure for individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities who live in their communities. The \nresolution calls on the Federal and State governments to make it a \npriority to promote a quality, stable direct support workforce that \nadvances this nation's commitment to community integration for \nindividuals with mental retardation and other developmental \ndisabilities.\n  Without well-trained and quality direct support professionals, many \ndisabled individuals may find living in the community more difficult. \nWe shouldn't let that happen, and I hope this resolution can help focus \nCongress's and the Nation's attention on this important matter.\n  I am grateful for the Senate's passage of this resolution and its \nconcern for our direct support professionals and those individuals they \ncare for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13063-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination on today's Executive Calendar, calendar No. 249. I further \nask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n                             THE JUDICIARY\n\n       Thomas M. Hardiman, of Pennsylvania, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate recently voted to confirm an \noutstanding district court nominee to the Western District of \nPennsylvania named Kim Gibson. Today, the leadership has decided to \nbring up the nomination of Thomas Hardiman who happens to be nominated \nto the very same court.\n  Unfortunately, this nominee's suitability for the Federal bench pales \nin comparison to Judge Gibson. Judge Gibson came to us with judicial \nexperience, a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the ABA, and the \nhighest rating from his local bar association.\n  In contrast, Mr. Hardiman has no judicial experience, a relatively \nsmall amount of litigation experience and has been given very low peer-\nreview ratings by the ABA and the same local bar association that \n``highly recommended'' Judge Gibson. The Allegheny County Bar \nAssociation recently released its opinions about the three pending \njudicial nominees from their community. After their extensive review, \nthe Bar Association determined that they could simply ``not recommend'' \nMr. Hardiman for a lifetime appointment to their Federal trial court.\n  Although neither Bar Association explained precisely why Mr. Hardiman \nreceived such bad reviews, his communications with the Judiciary \nCommittee potentially shed some light on their concerns.\n  Mr. Hardiman showed a lack of candor in describing the extent of his \nlitigation experience. After reporting that he had tried 54 cases to \njudgment, he subsequently revised the number downward to 19, and then \nupon further review he explained that several of these 19 cases were \nnot actually trials that resulted in a judgment.\n  In addition, opposing counsel contacted the committee to raise \nconcerns about Mr. Hardiman's exceedingly narrow view of fair housing \nstatutes and his questionable litigation tactics. Counsel in a housing \ndiscrimination case entitled, Alexander v. Riga, criticized Mr. \nHardiman's conduct when he represented landlords who repeatedly refused \nto show African-American couples an apartment that was for rent. \nDespite a jury finding of discrimination, Mr. Hardiman argued that \nthere was no resulting damage and the district court adopted his \nreasoning.\n\n[[Page S13064]]\n\n  On appeal to the Third Circuit, Mr. Hardiman analogized the harm \nresulting from the racial discrimination at issue to running a red \nlight. The Third Circuit criticized his dismissive analogy and found \nthat his argument and the district court's adoption of it would \nundermine the Federal housing statutes. The Third Circuit rejected Mr. \nHardiman's argument and reversed the trial court.\n  I am also troubled by Mr. Hardiman's discovery tactics. In answers to \nwritten committee questions, he admitted that in the Riga case he \nrepeatedly violated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by issuing a \nsubpoena to a nonparty without noticing opposing counsel in this case. \nAfter answering two rounds of written questions, Mr. Hardiman \nsubsequently admitted that he had not even reviewed his Riga files \nbefore submitting his answers to the committee.\n  Even the trial judge criticized Mr. Hardiman's associate about their \nlitigation strategy and tactics in this case, including the improper \nsubpoenas. Significantly less troubling matters stalled many judicial \nnominees of President Clinton.\n  If this were anytime between 1995 and 2000 and this were a Clinton \nnominee, the Republican majority would never have accorded this type of \nnomination a vote. Recall the fate of Clarence Sundrum, Dolly Gee, the \n8 district court nominees to vacancies in Pennsylvania and so many \nothers blocked by Republicans from ever being considered.\n  The Senate has already confirmed 165 of this President's judicial \nnominees. The current pace of confirmation stands in stark contrast to \nwhat occurred with judicial nominees during the Clinton administration. \nIt was not until well into the fourth year of President Clinton's \nsecond term, when Republicans controlled the Senate, before this many \njudicial nominees were confirmed.\n  It took President Reagan his entire first term to get this many \njudicial nominees confirmed, and that was with a Senate that was \ncontrolled by the same party.\n  It also took President George H.W. Bush well into his fourth year to \nget this many of his judicial nominees confirmed.\n  In contrast, today, with the shifts in Senate control, it has \neffectively taken a little more than 2 years of rapid Senate action to \nconfirm 165 judicial nominees for this President, including 100 during \nDemocratic control. This year alone the Senate has confirmed 65 \njudicial nominees, including 12 circuit court nominees in 2003. This \nincludes more judicial confirmations in just 10 months than Republicans \nallowed for President Clinton in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, or 2000. \nOverall, we have confirmed 29 circuit court nominees of President Bush \nsince July of 2001, which is more than were confirmed at this time in \nthe third year of President Reagan's first term, President George H.W. \nBush's term, or either of President Clinton's terms.\n  The Senate has held hearings for 13 Pennsylvania nominees of \nPresident Bush's to the Federal courts in Pennsylvania. While I was \nchairman, the Senate held hearings for and confirmed 10 nominees to the \ndistrict courts in Pennsylvania, plus Judge D. Brooks Smith to the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals. In total, we have already confirmed 13 \nof this President's judicial nominees to the Federal courts in the \nState of Pennsylvania. Five of these new judges have already been \nconfirmed to the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania indicates that \nPresident Bush's nominees have been treated far better than President \nClinton's. This treatment is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in \nPennsylvania were kept vacant during Republican control of the Senate \nwhen President Clinton was in the White House, particularly regarding \nnominees in the western half of the State.\n  Just a few months ago, on May 16, 2003, Jon Delano wrote in the \nPittsburgh Business Times, an article titled ``Despite Bush Protests, \nCourt Vacancies are Down,'' about how this President's nominees in the \nwestern part of Pennsylvania have been treated more fairly than \nPresident Clinton's nominees.\n  He wrote:\n\n       Take the Western District of Pennsylvania, for example. \n     During the years of the Santorum filibuster, that court of 10 \n     judges had as many as five vacancies. Today, the Senate has \n     confirmed four Bush appointees--Judges Joy Conti, David \n     Cercone, Terry McVerry, and Art Schwab--and the fifth \n     nomination, attorney Tom Hardiman, has just been sent to the \n     Senate.\n       With the elevation and confirmation of Judge Brooks Smith \n     to the U.S. Court of Appeals, the president still needs to \n     name one more judge to the local court, but once completed, \n     Mr. Bush, with less than three years in office, will have \n     named--and the Senate will have confirmed--six of the 10 \n     judges on the local Federal court. That hardly sounds like \n     obstructionism.\n\n  Despite the best efforts and diligence of the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure the confirmation of all of the \njudicial nominees from every part of his home State, there were 10 \nnominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who never got a \nvote: Patrick Toole, John Bingler, Robert Freedberg, Lynette Norton, \nLegrome Davis, David Fineman, David Cercone, Harry Litman, Stephen \nLieberman, and Robert Cindrich to the Third Circuit.\n  Despite how well-qualified these nominees were, they were never \nconsidered by the Senate, many waited more than a year for action.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Hardiman's record is similar to the record of far \ntoo many of President Bush's judicial nominees. Far too many of this \nPresident's judicial nominees have less courtroom experience than \npartisan experience.\n  In fact, 25 of this President's judicial nominees have earned partial \nor majority ``Not Qualified'' ratings from the ABA. In addition to the \nABA's review, Mr. Hardiman was also ``not recommended'' by his county \nbar association.\n  Certainly, the citizens of Western Pennsylvania deserve a well-\nqualified judiciary to hear their important legal claims in Federal \ncourt.\n  I have great respect for the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nappreciate his efforts to help shepherd the White House's nomination \nthrough the Senate.\n  After considering the negative impression Mr. Hardiman has made on \nhis fellow Pennsylvanians regarding his suitability for this lifetime \nappointment and his conduct before the Judiciary Committee, I believe \nthat this is among the weakest nominees we have considered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/22/senate-section/article/S13064-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
