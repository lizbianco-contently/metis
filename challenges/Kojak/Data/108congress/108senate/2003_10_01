Mr. President, this is a land of opportunity. Americans \nknow if they are willing to work hard, they can realize their dreams. \nHard work built this country and hard work is what has enabled \ngenerations of Americans to own a home, make a stronger community, and \ngive their children a good education.\n  Americans have always been willing to work hard to reach their goals, \nand we are working longer hours today than ever before. Almost one-\nthird of the labor force regularly works longer than a 40-hour week and \n20 percent work longer than 50 hours. Fifty years\n\n[[Page S12214]]\n\nago, as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act, we established the \nprinciple of overtime pay for those who work more than 40 hours a week. \nThis recognized the value of hard work and rewarded those who worked \nthe hardest. Families who work hard depend upon overtime pay. For the \nfamilies who do earn overtime, it makes up one-fourth of their total \nsalary.\n  Having said all this, I cannot understand why the President is \nproposing to change the rules on overtime pay. His proposal would \neliminate overtime wages for 8 million workers--nurses, firefighters, \npolice officers, flight attendants, preschool teachers, cooks, \nsecretaries, and fast-food shift managers. This proposal would amount \nto a pay cut for these hard-working families. It would also mean fewer \njobs because companies would simply force their employees to work \nlonger hours without paying overtime instead of hiring new workers.\n  In the current economic situation, when millions of Americans are out \nof work, it does not make sense to do something that will stifle the \ncreation of new jobs. Even for the workers who would still qualify for \novertime, this is a bad rule. Why? Because big companies will force the \novertime-exempt workers to put in longer hours and cut the hours of \nthose who qualify for overtime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I noticed an editorial in the Washington Post yesterday \nwhich pointed out:\n\n       Despite a veto threat from President Bush, the House should \n     vote to block the rules. While the overtime regulations need \n     updating, the administration proposal tilts too far in the \n     direction of employers. It ought to be redrawn in a more \n     balanced way. . . . The new rules would give employers far \n     more freedom to disqualify employees.\n\n  I think that is what the Senator from Nevada is saying, as I \nunderstand it, that those rules that have been drafted by the \nadministration are one-sided. They are going to work to the \ndisadvantage of employees just at a time when we know American workers \nare working longer and harder than any other industrial nation in the \nworld, as this chart shows, particularly with regard to women who are \nout there, who have joined the workforce.\n\n  This is in 1979. Middle-income mothers worked 55 percent more than \nthey did 20 years ago, 895 hours compared to 1,388 hours. American \nworkers are working longer hours. They are working harder. The mothers \nof small children are working longer and harder to make ends meet in a \ndifficult economy. Then the administration promotes these regulations, \nwhich any fairminded person would believe are skewed to the \ndisadvantage and unfairness to employees--particularly to nurses, \nparticularly to firefighters, particularly to police, who are the \nfront-line defense in homeland security.\n  I am wondering how the Senator from Nevada views this proposal by the \nadministration, in terms of fairness to workers in his own State.\n  Mr. REID. With the Senator from Massachusetts on the floor, I will \nrespond this way. The Senator from Massachusetts has led the fight for \ndecades on raising the minimum wage. I say to my friend, it seems so \nunusual, so absurd to me that this administration on the one hand will \nnot let us even have a vote on raising the minimum wage, yet at the \nsame time they are trying to cut overtime from people.\n  I received a call from a 58-year-old man in Las Vegas, my friend, \nSunday night. He said, You know, my diabetes is getting worse. I think \nI am going to have to go on injections. I have been taking a pill, but \nI am 58 years old and it is getting worse. He said, The reason I am \nconcerned is I have no health insurance. My wife has health insurance \nbut I have no health insurance.\n  This man works 60, 70 hours a week. He has two jobs. But both jobs \nare such that he doesn't qualify for the fringe benefits. The fringe \nbenefits, among other things, are health insurance. So he works two \njobs, hard work, he is 58 years old, and he has no health insurance.\n  I say to my friend, I cannot imagine the mental gyrations this \nadministration has to go through to, on the one hand, prevent people \nfrom getting a basic fair minimum wage and, on the other hand, wanting \npeople to work more than 40 hours a week, reversing what has been in \neffect since the mid-1930s.\n  I repeat, on the one hand, no raising of the minimum wage, and on the \nother hand let's have you work longer hours.\n  I ask my friend from Massachusetts, Can you in any way correlate in \nyour mind how an administration could go forward on this plan? I guess \nit is a plan.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have been joined by the Senator from Iowa, who has \nbeen a leader in the Senate on this issue. Let me just mention one \nother item in response to the question of the Senator. Not only is it \nthe opposition of the administration to the increase of the minimum \nwage, which now at the end of this year will have lost all of the gains \nsince the last increase--so the administration is against that--the \nadministration is against the long-term unemployment compensation. \nThese are workers who have been trying to gain work. They have been out \nlooking for jobs. Historically, as we have reviewed this issue with the \nSenator from Iowa and the Senator from Nevada, when we get the \nunemployment compensation, we have been responsive to this, for years, \nin a bipartisan way--except for this administration.\n  So we are shortchanging the minimum wage worker. We are shortchanging \nthe unemployed. And now the administration comes on top of that, at a \ntime when we have a disastrous economic policy, we have lost more than \n3 million jobs, and it says we are going to take it out on the overtime \nworkers, which in this instance affects the front-line workers, the \nhome guard, so to speak, the ones we are relying on to defend this \ncountry--the nurses, the firefighters, and the police.\n  What in the world is it about hard-working Americans who are working \nhard to provide for their families that this administration just can't \nstand?\n  I see our friend and leader here from Iowa, who has been so involved \nin this issue. I know he has some important observations as well.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and our assistant \nminority leader, the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, for bringing up \nthis issue today.\n\n  Again, more disturbing news has come out this week, I say to the \nSenator from Massachusetts. He has covered the increase in poverty in \nthis country. More and more people are being left behind and \nunemployment continues to go up. At that very time, this administration \nwants to pull the rug out from underneath people who work hard, to take \naway their overtime protection. That is coming to a head this week, I \nsay to the Senator from Massachusetts, because the House of \nRepresentatives, the other body, is going to be appointing conferees to \ngo to conference with us. I understand the motion will be made to \ninstruct the conferees to yield to the Senate position which, as you \nknow, is to deny the administration the funds necessary to carry out \nthese proposed changes in overtime. So I am hopeful the House will \nagain vote right on this and make sure we keep the Senate provisions \nand deny the administration the ability to go ahead and just yank away \nthe overtime protections for millions of Americans.\n  Again, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts why is it--I don't know \nif there is any real answer. Why is it this administration is so intent \non keeping the minimum wage as low as it is? Why are they so intent on \nthat? What do they gain by doing that, by denying hard-working \nAmericans an increase in the minimum wage? What does the administration \ngain for themselves or for this country by taking away the overtime \nprotections for our workers which have been there since 1938? Why would \nthe administration be doing this if we are facing at this time higher \nrates of unemployment, poverty going up?\n  I don't know what the Senator's response to that will be, but in my \nview, this is so ideologically driven. This administration, I think, if \nit had its way, would take away all overtime protections, take away the \nminimum wage. They don't even believe in a minimum wage. They wouldn't \neven have a minimum wage. They would have our\n\n[[Page S12215]]\n\nworkers compete at the lowest possible level with workers from the \nThird World countries. It is not enough they are shipping our \nmanufacturing jobs out of this country, they are now shipping into this \ncountry labor standards from Third World countries.\n  Again, I don't know. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \npointing this out this morning. I think we need to discuss this more.\n  We are going to be discussing a supplemental appropriations bill on \nthe floor today and for the next few days of $87 billion. That is for \nrebuilding Iraq. Some of that is for the military, but with $21 billion \nwe are going to build sewer and water systems, we are going to build \nnew schools, we are going to rebuild some swampland--there is \neverything in there to rebuild the economy of Iraq. At the same time \nthis administration wants to keep minimum wages low. They will not help \nus get the minimum wage up. And they want to take away overtime \nprotection. What kind of fairness is there in that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has answered his own question. I think it is \na pretty clear indication that the administration listens to K Street, \nwhich is another way of saying the principal powerful special \ninterests, rather than Main Street, Main Street, where it is \nhappening--whether it is in the rural or urban areas of Iowa, or my own \nState of Massachusetts.\n  These are hard-working people at the minimum wage. This issue, the \nminimum wage, is a women's issue because the majority of people who \nreceive the minimum wage are women. It is a children's issue because \nmore than one-third of the women who receive the minimum wage have \nchildren, so it is a family issue. It is a civil rights issue because \nso many of these men and women are men and women of color. And it is a \nfairness issue. America and Americans understand fairness. If you work \n40 hours a week you should not have to live in poverty. Yet this \nadministration is strongly opposed to this and is using every different \nparliamentary trick to deny us a vote.\n  The majority Members of this body favor an increase in the minimum \nwage, but the administration is strongly against it and we are \nbasically unable to get it. I think the majority favors also extending \na hand to those millions of Americans who are unemployed, who have \nworked hard all their lives and, because of the economic policies, have \nbeen put into the lists of the unemployed. They have been out there \nlooking. Increasing numbers of those have been leaving the job market.\n  We have historically recognized that we would offer a helping hand to \nthose who want to work, who can work and who will work to provide for \ntheir families during the slump in the economy, and the administration \nsays no. Beyond all of that, it says we are going to exclude 8 million \nhard working Americans from possible coverage for overtime.\n  I speak for all of our people in Massachusettes when I thank the \nSenator from Iowa for his leadership in the Senate and for the strong \nvote we got in the Senate. We had a bipartisan vote on that. It is \nenormously instructive and important for the administration to hear.\n  I certainly know the administration is working very hard against the \nposition of the Senator from Iowa and in the House of Representatives. \nBut I hope the kind of expression we saw here in the Senate will be \nfollowed by the House.\n  I thank the Senator for all of his good work.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis kind remarks, but he has been the leader in terms of workers' \nrights for all of his time in the Senate. I am honored to be able to \nwork with him to make sure we continue to support our working families.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts that the Secretary of Labor \njust wrote a recent editorial which ran in the Omaha World Herald, \nwhich is across the river from Iowa. It is interesting that she wrote \nmy amendment ``if enacted, would be a huge setback for U.S. workers \nfrom getting overtime pay for the first time.''\n  What she is talking about there is part of this proposal would \nincrease the threshold for guaranteed overtime pay from $8,060 a year \nto $22,100 a year. My amendment does not affect that. What we passed \nhere in the Senate protecting overtime pay does not even remotely \naffect it. If the Secretary of Labor wants to increase the threshold \nfrom $8,060 a year to $22,100 a year, what is she waiting for? She can \ndo that tomorrow. She could have done that this spring in the rules and \nregulations. It is because certain friends of this administration and \nindustries say they wouldn't support it unless we made other changes to \ntake away overtime protection from other workers.\n  It is true the proposed regulation does increase the threshold. That \nis fine. Our amendment doesn't touch that. With the other hand they \ntake away overtime pay protection for over 8 million Americans. Then \nthey say they want to simplify the rules. The proposal is far from \nsimple. It is as complex as ever.\n  The Society for Human Resource Management was quoted in the Chicago \nTribune:\n\n       It looks like they're just moving from one ambiguity to the \n     next.\n\n  These rules and regulations can be simplified and updated without \ntaking away workers' overtime pay protection. Again, don't take my word \nfor it. Here is what industry says from a May 2003 analysis by Hewitt \nAssociates, a global human resources outsourcing and consulting firm, \nto its clients on their Web site.\n  They said:\n\n       These proposed changes--\n\nby the Secretary of Labor--\n\n     --likely will open the door for employers to reclassify a \n     large number of previously nonexempt employees as exempt.\n\n  Exempt from overtime pay protection.\n\n       The resulting effect on compensation and morale could be \n     detrimental, as employees previously accustomed to earning, \n     in some cases, significant amounts of overtime would suddenly \n     lose that opportunity.\n\n  That is not me saying that. That is a May 2003 analysis by Hewitt \nAssociates, a global human resources outsourcing and consulting firm, \nto their clients which include more than half of the Fortune 500 \ncompanies.\n  There you have it. This is industry driven to take away the overtime \npay protection so they can work people longer and not pay them any \nmore.\n  As I pointed out on the floor previously, and as the Senator from \nMassachusetts did, this is antiworker and it is antifamily. Many of \nthese people are women. They are already paying for child care. Now \nthey are going to have to work longer and pay more for child care, and \nthey don't get a nickel more for overtime. It is not fair. It is not \nright.\n  I hope the House of Representatives will vote strongly to instruct \ntheir conferees to adopt the Senate provision. Let us have the \nadministration go back and let us have a fair and reasonable updating \nof overtime regulations.\n  Yesterday, on Tuesday, September 30, there was a lead editorial in \nthe Washington Post entitled ``Fighting Over Overtime.''\n  It said:\n\n       Despite a veto threat from President Bush, the House should \n     vote to block the rules. While the overtime regulations need \n     updating--\n\n  We all agree with that.\n\n     --the administration proposal tilts too far in the direction \n     of employers. It ought to be redrawn in a more balanced way.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 30, 2003]\n\n                         Fighting Over Overtime\n\n       For 65 years employees have been entitled to an hour-and-a-\n     half's pay for every extra hour they have worked beyond the \n     standard 40-hour work week. But those protections don't \n     extent to certain white-collar workers--people in executive, \n     administrative and professional positions--and figuring out \n     which employees are covered has become a particularly \n     byzantine area of labor law. The Bush administration has \n     proposed a sweeping rewrite that it says will better protect \n     the most vulnerable workers while giving employers clearer \n     guidance. Labor groups argue that the improved coverage is so \n     limited, and the exceptions so broadly written, that millions \n     of workers would be deprived of eligibility for overtime. The \n     Senate voted this month to prevent the new rules from taking \n     effect, and while the House voted narrowly the other way, it \n     is set for another vote this week. Despite a veto threat from \n     President Bush, the House should vote to block the rules. \n     While the overtime regulations need updating, the \n     administration proposal tilts too far in the direction of \n     employers. It ought to be redrawn in a more balanced way.\n\n[[Page S12216]]\n\n       Employees who earn less than $8,060 per year are \n     automatically entitled to overtime. The Department of Labor \n     wants to raise that floor to $22,100. The increase would \n     provide automatic coverage to 1.3 million workers, the \n     administration says, while labor groups say the number is \n     much smaller. An increase in the minimum level is overdue (it \n     was last raised in 1975), but the amount proposed by Labor--\n     $5,000 less than would result simply from adjusting for \n     inflation--is too low. The proposed rules would also make it \n     more difficult for employees who earn more than $65,000 to \n     qualify for overtime pay.\n       The biggest problem with the changes would be in the middle \n     range of workers who earn between $22,100 and $65,000. In \n     this area, the new rules would give employers far more \n     freedom to disqualify employees. For example, employees would \n     be considered exempt ``executives'' if they managed a \n     department, directed the work of two or more other employees \n     and had their recommendations about hiring, firing or \n     promotion ``given particular weight.'' Thus, a $23,000-a-year \n     supermarket produce manager could be refused overtime pay. \n     The Labor Department says the changes are merely intended to \n     make the rules easier to apply, not to deprive anyone of \n     overtime. Yet it's hard to see how some of its gauzy new \n     tests are going to promote any less misunderstanding. \n     Administrative workers, for example, are defined as those who \n     hold ``a position of responsibility'' with the employer, \n     something that is in turn defined as doing ``work of \n     substantial importance'' or ``requiring a high level of skill \n     or training.''\n       Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao, dismissing the arguments of \n     those who ``think employers are out to exploit workers,'' \n     says that businesses are lobbying for the changes ``not \n     because they're getting any particular benefit but because \n     they just want clarity.'' But employers and their advisers \n     see it differently. Hewitt Associates, a leading human \n     resources consultant, noted that ``employees previously \n     accustomed to earning, in some cases, significant amounts of \n     overtime pay would suddenly lose that opportunity.'' \n     Assessing the rules in a memo to clients, Proskauer Rose, a \n     law firm that represents employers, noted, ``Thankfully, \n     virtually all of these changes should ultimately be \n     beneficial to employers.'' Workers who earn overtime derive a \n     quarter of their income, on average, from overtime pay. They \n     might not be quite so thankful.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized on my own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Under the previous order, there \nare 9 minutes 40 seconds left on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. I will not take that much time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12216-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12216-S12217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CIA LEAK\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I also wanted to again comment on the \nstories appearing in the media about the leaked information regarding \nan undercover CIA agent. As we all know by now, a law was broken. It is \na Federal crime under the Intelligence Identity Protection Act of 1982 \nto intentionally disclose information identifying a covert agent by \nanyone not authorized to receive classified information. Conviction \nunder this crime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine \nof $50,000.\n  What do we know so far? We know a columnist, Mr. Robert Novak, \nreceived this information. He printed it in his column in the \nnewspaper.\n  It is interesting that we now find there were other journalists given \nthat information, but they did not write this. They did not print it. \nThat raises questions in itself as to why Mr. Novak went ahead and \nwrote this.\n  We know this was put out into the public. We know--at least it has \nbeen alleged--that Mr. Novak said he got the information from a ``high \nadministration official.'' The other journalists, I guess, who got this \ninformation said the same thing. We don't know whether it is in the \nWhite House or where it is. But there are all kinds of rumors and \nallegations floating around.\n  Now I see the Justice Department is starting to investigate. Isn't \nthat a sweetheart deal? Attorney General John Ashcroft, appointed by \nthis President, investigating the President. If a situation ever cried \nout for a special counsel, this is it.\n  Yet yesterday when the Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, wanted \nto just have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that a special counsel \nshould be appointed, the other side raised a nongermane objection to \nthis. We will continue to bring up this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. \nIn fact, when we have the opportunity, we will ask to have a vote on \nwhether a special counsel ought to be appointed, someone more \nindependent than Mr. Ashcroft.\n  There is a piece missing from the puzzle. We know a law was broken. \nWe know Mr. Novak, a journalist, printed in his column that it came \nfrom somewhere in the administration. But here is the missing part of \nthe puzzle that no one is writing about. Whoever gave that information \nto Mr. Novak got that information somewhere. This is classified \ninformation. The question is, Did someone in the CIA voluntarily give \nthat information to this individual? If that is the case, we have a \nreal problem in the CIA. If, however, someone in the administration is \nsaying the National Security Council, which has access to this kind of \nclassified information, then gave this information to another \nindividual in the administration, then we have a real problem in the \nNational Security Council of someone deliberately leaking this \nclassified information.\n\n  It is not enough just to find out who gave the information to Mr. \nNovak. We have to find out how that individual got the information in \nthe first place.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me finish this.\n  Did that individual have that information given by the CIA? Was it \ngiven to him by the National Security Council? How did that individual \ncome by this classified information? That is the missing part of this \npuzzle.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Iowa, does it not show the depths \nwhich have been reached if someone in the White House is prepared to \nnot only discredit but to disclose the identity of an intelligence \nagent, perhaps compromising their professional career, maybe \nendangering their life, in order to settle a political debt?\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, who has a memory of this--as I do, as \nwell--this is an echo of an enemies list of Richard Nixon's era where \nthey have decided at any cost they will go after their enemies, even in \nthe commission of a Federal felony, to disclose the identity of \nAmbassador Wilson's wife.\n  The Senator from Iowa is correct. It is true that the lengths to \nwhich this administration is willing to go to silence its critics \nharken back to an era that was one of the darkest eras in Presidential \npolitics.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nquestion.\n  Why was this name leaked to this columnist? It was to somehow \ndiscredit her husband. What had her husband done? He told the truth \nabout the lack of any evidence showing Iraq had gone to Niger to obtain \nbasically uranium or yellow cake. He had gone there to investigate, \nsaid there was nothing to it. So he told the truth. And now the \nadministration, because a truth did not comport with their imagination \nabout what was going on in Iraq, obviously put Mr. Wilson on their \nenemies list.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, this really does bring back \nmemories of enemies lists. The administration will go to any length, to \nthe length of breaking a law, to try to discredit anyone who tries to \npoint out the truth about what went on in Iraq.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will continue to yield, this calls for a \nspecial prosecutor. Does the Senator from Iowa recall last year when \nthere was a suspected leak of information from the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, the FBI, under Attorney General Ashcroft, called on every \nmember of the Senate Intelligence Committee to submit to a polygraph--\nfor every Senator to submit to a polygraph? I ask the Senator from \nIowa, what is the likelihood that Attorney General Ashcroft is going to \nask the highest ranking officials in the White House to submit to a \npolygraph and then disclose to the public whether or not they have \nagreed to do so?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Illinois, I am not serving on the \nIntelligence Committee. I had heard and been aware, and now the Senator \nhas validated that fact, the FBI did ask members of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee to take polygraphs. Again, it is a fair question \nthe Senator asks: Will the FBI ask all senior members of this \nadministration to sit down and take a polygraph test? If they asked \nSenators, why would they not ask the White House? I don't know. Will \nthey?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Further questioning the Senator from Iowa, I don't \nbelieve in polygraphs. I never recommend them. Most State courts do not \nrecognize the results, I don't think they are accurate. But it was a \npressure tactic by the FBI to try to get Senators on the Intelligence \nCommittee to say publicly whether they would submit to a\n\n[[Page S12217]]\n\npolygraph. It is an indication of what they can do when they want to.\n  The question is, Will they do it? Would Attorney General Ashcroft's \nDepartment of Justice do that to the highest ranking officials in \nPresident Bush's White House? The answer is obvious. So I ask, does \nthat not make the case for a special prosecutor?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely. The Senator from Illinois is correct. This \npoints to the need for a special counsel, someone independent of the \nJustice Department. This is serious stuff.\n  I notice that the columnist, Mr. Novak, said, well, this woman is \njust an analyst for the CIA.\n  I don't know. I never met these people. But now I understand she was \nindeed an undercover agent overseas. She may be doing something at the \nCIA right now, but prior to that she was. Again, I have no knowledge of \nthis. I only know what I have been reading in the papers.\n  It seems to me, in our war on terrorism, our best asset is not a \nmissile; it is not a nuclear device; it is the information we get. And \nif there is a chilling effect out there--that is what this is, a \nchilling effect--on getting information, it is a serious blow to our \nfight against terrorism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the men and women on \nthe front line in Iraq defending America in the fight against \nterrorism. We cannot forget them. There are a lot of other things going \non in Washington--including, by the way, the discussion of who said \nwhat to whom.\n  I digress for a moment to comment on calls for a special prosecutor. \nI am a slight student of history. In 1999 there was an effort in this \nbody, led by Senator Collins from Maine, a bipartisan effort, to put in \nplace a provision to allow for a special prosecutor. It was blocked, it \nwas stopped, by the very same folks today talking about the need for a \nspecial prosecutor. I will be very blunt: We are hearing rank political \nhypocrisy when it comes to claims about a special prosecutor.\n  I also note the calls that: The administration did this, the \nadministration did that. The President of the United States has been \nvery clear. If someone in his administration leaked information or did \nsomething that is illegal, they will be held accountable. That is what \nthe administration has said.\n  We have to get away from the politics and simply do the right thing. \nThe American public get it. They see through it. Unfortunately, it \ncasts a negative light on everyone when every battle is a political \nbattle other than simply doing the right thing.\n  One of the right things, by the way, being done is, today the \nPentagon has rolled out a program to bring troops home who have served \nin Iraq for over a year. These service men and women are going to get a \nwell-deserved rest. Unfortunately, the program only provides for \ntransportation to places such as Baltimore, Atlanta, Dallas, and Los \nAngeles. For folks who come from Minnesota, my State, that creates a \nburden and a hardship. Flights are very expensive if you have not \nplanned 2 weeks in advance, costing literally thousands of dollars.\n  This is a good start. It does not go far enough. Because I want to \nmake sure that the service men and women who had to pay--some, again, \n$1,000 or more for same-day tickets to see their loved ones--I have \nsubmitted, along with Senator Stevens, Senator Dayton, and Senator \nDorgan, an amendment to fix this unintended consequence of the R \nprogram.\n  If we acknowledge that our troops who have been in Iraq deserve a \nrest, we ought to make sure they get their way home. I thank the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, who has said \nthey will take care of this. My heartfelt thanks to the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12217-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12217-S12220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I speak today as a former mayor. I have \nbeen listening to the debate about the President's request for $87 \nbillion supplemental appropriations to support what our troops need in \nIraq. Yet there are some, who want to divide that, who say: Yes, we \nwill provide somehow $67 billion; that is what the troops need on the \nmilitary side, and to do that gives them moral clarity, while \nsupporting an additional $20 billion for infrastructure and other \nessential services is labeled as squandering American resources that \ncould be better used at home.\n\n  Let me offer some insight on what it takes to build a city, what it \nrequires to assure that those who live in a city feel ownership in \ntheir future, feel confident in their role in that city, and have the \nnecessary confidence to move that city forward.\n  First, to rebuild a city requires patience. A broken and decayed city \ndid not happen over night, and it will not be fixed overnight. What \nhappened in Iraq did not happen overnight. From 1970 onward, Saddam \nHussein never had a budget; he did not invest in infrastructure. In \nfact, he pillaged and raped that infrastructure for his own needs, for \nhis palaces, and to cover his friends.\n  So what you have are patterns of neglect that have set in and cities \nhave become stale and moribund. Their infrastructure starts to \ncollapse. That is what we have seen in Iraq. The water systems fail, \nthe sewer systems fail, and the power grids blow out after years of no \nmaintenance. The roads and sidewalks crack and shift and become \ndangerous to use. So you have the state of decay.\n  Second, to restore confidence and hope in a city requires commitment \nand investment. Safe streets do not just happen overnight. You have to \ntrain a police force. You have to recognize that the best partners in \nfighting crime are not the guns in their holsters but the people who \nlive in the neighborhoods who will support the law enforcement efforts.\n  Moms and dads living in a city need to have confidence in knowing the \npolice are there to protect and serve them, not to conduct covert \nactivities on behalf of the Government to deprive them of their \nfreedom, their liberty, and their lives. That has been the pattern in \nIraq for many years.\n  Third, to assure growth in a city, there must be a sense that there \nis a future in the city. This requires business believing there is room \nto grow. You have to grow jobs. You have to get paychecks to people who \nthen invest in homes and libraries and streets and sidewalks.\n  Rebuilding a city is a tough job. Now, increase that on a grand scale \nof rebuilding a nation, and I hope my point is becoming more evident.\n  The fact is, rebuilding Iraq--all of Iraq--is as important to the \nprotection of our soldiers as the equipment we give them to protect and \ndefend themselves. We have to win the peace. We have to win the peace \nand not just the war.\n  Rebuild a neighborhood and you keep parents from becoming bitter that \nthey do not have clean water or a functioning sewer. Make the \ninvestment in a library and you give the children a tool out of their \ndespair and bring the light of learning and opportunity into their \nlives.\n  If you remove people's hopes, you remove their incentive to be \nparticipants in the community. And if you choose not to invest in their \nlives, their homes, their communities, and their businesses, they will \nturn away from the light and seek the darkness.\n  The threat our troops face in the months ahead in Iraq is not just \nfrom the Baath loyalists or foreign terrorists who are simply trying to \nlive another day so they can kill another American soldier. The threat \nour troops face is that moms and dads in Iraq will lose confidence in \nthe promise America made to them not only to liberate them from the \nbrutality of Saddam Hussein but from the chains of despair.\n\n  We have seen it in our own cities. When we take away hope and \nconfidence in people, they strike out. Ask any cop in any American city \nwhat he fears most: a gang member packing a Glock or a neighborhood \nwhere people don't care what goes on outside their locked doors and \nwindows. You can always find a way to arrest the gangster, but it is \nnearly impossible to get people who have lost hope to open the doors to \ntheir lives once they have\n\n[[Page S12218]]\n\nbeen closed. And once hope is lost, the land becomes a swamp of \ndiscontent, a breeding ground for terrorists, unchecked by the \npopulace.\n  That is what we cannot allow to happen in Iraq. If we try to parse \nthe investment we make in Iraq, we parse the commitment to American \ntroops. This is not rhetoric. This is not drama. This is reality.\n  We need to invest in training Iraqis to become policemen now and \nensure that more American troops can come home sooner.\n  We need to invest in Iraqi infrastructure now and ensure that its \neconomy begins to recover. And more Iraqis will go back to work. And \nthe greater the hope grows, less anger will be directed toward American \ntroops.\n  We need to invest in Iraqi schools and libraries and hospitals, and \nconditions that lead to despair and striking out against American \nsoldiers diminish, and the breeding ground that terrorists prey on \nbecomes smaller and smaller, until they disappear completely.\n  The best way to take the gun or bomb out of the hand of a potential \nterrorist is to make sure they have food to eat, schools to attend, \nlibraries with books, hospitals with medicine, and communities that are \nsafe.\n  The best way to make a difference between an Iraqi citizen who works \nwith American soldiers instead of trying to kill them is to make sure \nthey have access to city services and the very real opportunity for a \njob.\n  There is this idea, I am afraid, that the rebuilding of Iraq is \ntaking too long and costing too much. There is a sense of panic that \nhas seemed to set in. There are those who roam the halls of Washington \nsaying: I told you so.\n  Throughout the political rhetoric that takes hold on both sides of \nthe aisle is a sort of posturing and positioning for who is more \nsupportive of American troops than the other. All the while, young men \nand women are laying down their lives to deliver on the commitment that \ntheir leaders of this country made to the people of Iraq.\n  It is time it ends. I am not the most senior guy here, nor am I the \nsmartest. I am not the most articulate, nor am I the most decorated. I \ndid not come to the Senate to prove on any given day or issue I am \nright. I came to the Senate on any given day or issue to simply do \nright. Today, I urge my colleagues again to turn this issue into \nsomething that does more to give honor to our democratic traditions, \nand to our American soldiers, than partisan speeches about who is to \nblame for this and who is to blame for that.\n  Everyone knows the pricetag is large. Everyone knows there are \nprograms in the United States that need support, too. I understand that \nas a former urban mayor. Let us not lose our sense of perspective. The \ntask before us in Iraq may be gargantuan in its cost, but the cost of \nfailure is unacceptably high.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Texas is motioning for the \nfloor. I yield for her.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, what is the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Has the Senator from Minnesota finished? Because I \nneed to allocate 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I will finish in 90 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me ask for 1 additional \nminute for the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I do not need to remind my colleagues how much money \ndisappeared from the American and world economy on September 11. \nSuccess will build world confidence and investment far beyond this \ninvestment in Iraq. Failure would cost us far more.\n  We can, and will, argue over the nature of this commitment. Should it \nbe a grant or loan? We know we cannot let a single American dollar go \nto paying off the debt Iraqis owe to the French or Germans who propped \nup Saddam Hussein. We know we cannot load Iraq with debt it cannot \nrepay while urging other nations to forgo their debt.\n  This body will vigorously debate this issue, as it should, but let us \nnot pit the needs of home against the safety of our troops in Iraq. I \nsay this without hesitation: We put our troops in Iraq at grave risk if \nwe do not win the peace. I urge my colleagues not to let political \nshowmanship put American lives at risk.\n  The mayor in me says it is time to get back to work in this body and \nsupport those efforts that will get Iraq and its people back to work.\n  Restoring hope and confidence will, in turn, create new investment \nthat will save American lives and ensure that Iraq and its people have \na brighter hope for a better tomorrow.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nthose profound remarks and appreciate his weighing in on this issue.\n  Mr. President, we now have 20 minutes left; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield up to 9 minutes to the Senator \nfrom North Carolina; following that, up to 9 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee; and then I ask unanimous consent to use 3 minutes of \nleader time, which has been cleared by Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, thousands of young men and women from bases \nin my home State of North Carolina are currently fighting the war on \nterror in Iraq. We are forging a process of peace; and in doing so, we \nare moving toward turning control of the government and society back to \nthe Iraqi people.\n  With the major battles over in Iraq, our Nation is helping to rebuild \nschools and hospitals, water supply systems and roadways. Part of the \nPresident's supplemental request is being designated for the \ncontinuation of these efforts. The stabilization of Iraq depends on \nproviding the Iraqi people basic services as well as humanitarian \nrelief. And the safety of our men and women in uniform depends on the \nstabilization of Iraq.\n  Our forces are on the offensive, and continue to capture key figures \nin Saddam Hussein's evil regime, so that they may be brought to \njustice. The vast majority of the President's request will go directly \nto American troops, giving them the pay, the equipment, and other \nresources necessary to fight the war on terror. We must ensure that \nthese funds are available to allow them to complete their mission and \nreturn home safely.\n  Recently a proud grandmother met with my 102-year-old mother in \nSalisbury, North Carolina. This grandmother forwarded me a letter from \nher grandson, Christopher Shawn Jensen, who is currently stationed in \nBaghdad. I would like to read to you what a soldier on the front lines \nhas to say. I will read just a portion:\n\n       I was invited to meet with a local Iraqi who works the \n     engineering for our building's electricity . . . He graduated \n     from the Baghdad University in engineering and showed me his \n     class picture (from 1979). We talked about what it was like \n     then, and the difference now. You could see the suffering in \n     his eyes as he talked about the years of terror, the people \n     lived with while Saddam was in power. I felt the same \n     emotions of sadness for these people when I first rolled up \n     here from Kuwait, to see their cheering faces of relief . . . \n     many a soldier's eyes were filled with tears that day . . . I \n     pray that we finish the job we started.\n\n  At the end of the letter to his grandmother, Shawn made a request to \nhis friends and family. ``I have started the ball rolling for several \nideas, he writes, to help in the effort to free Iraqis and also to help \nto make this a safer place for liberty and freedom. I know many of you \nhave big hearts and want to help, you just don't know how. Here are \nsome things you can help with. I have written to the Editor of the \nWilmington Star newspaper. The children in Iraq learn on the dirty \nfloors in their schools. They need approximately 200,000 desks for \ntheir schools. I am trying to build support for a program where the \nAmerican citizen can buy support for the Iraqi children.'' And let me \nadd, my husband, Bob Dole, has already committed to Shawn's effort.\n  Shawn's letter continues, ``We are also collecting money from the \nsoldiers here and we are going to buy back\n\n[[Page S12219]]\n\nweapons from the populous of Iraq. We are using the little money we \nearn in a combat zone to start this program. The regular citizens have \nall kinds of weapons like grenades, bombs, and rockets . . . things \nregular citizens don't need. We are asking American citizens to match \nfunds that we are collecting for this cause. My father can be contacted \nfor this via phone or a web-site that has been started.''\n  Shawn Jensen understands what freedom means to the people of Iraq--\nindeed he is seeing it first hand. He is so committed to making Iraq a \nsafe place for his fellow soldiers to complete their mission, and for \nthe Iraqi people to live in a free and orderly society, that he and his \nfellow soldiers are making these tremendous sacrifices.\n  My friend, Secretary of State Colin Powell, described last week his \nvisit to Iraq in the most poignant terms, He said, ``anyone who doubts \nthe wisdom of President Bush's course in Iraq should stand, as I did, \nby the side of the mass grave in Iraq's north. That terrible site holds \nthe remains of 5,000 innocent men, women and children who were gassed \nto death by Saddam Hussein's criminal regime.''\n  Recently, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee, on which \nI serve, Ambassador Paul Bremer outlined a clear and well-defined \ncourse of action in Iraq. As he noted, there will be bumps along the \nway, but it is critical for us to stay the course. As he has said so \npoignantly, ``Gone are Saddam Hussein's torture chambers,'' he wrote. \n``Gone are his mass killings and rape rooms. And gone is his threat to \nAmerica and the international community.'' As we go forward, it is this \nthat we should keep in mind.\n  Today in Iraq, streets are lined with shops selling newspaper and \nbooks representing varied opinions. Already, 160 newspapers have sprung \nup in Iraq. Schools and universities are open; parents are forming \nPTA's; 95 percent of health clinics are open, and Iraq is on the way to \na democratic government. Eighty-five percent of towns now have city \ncouncils. And a Constitution will soon be written, followed next year \nby elections which will provide legitimacy and credibility to the \ngovernment. And millions of dollars of humanitarian aid are going to \nthe Iraqi people to make sure they have food, water and shelter.\n  Iraqis are also being trained to maintain peace and order in their \nown country. Thousands of members of the Iraqi police force will be \ntrained over the next several months in Eastern Europe. And the area \naround Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, one of the most dangerous sections \nin Iraq, is currently being patrolled by the Iraqi army. These measures \nare part of the larger goal of turning over the security of Iraq to the \nIraqis.\n  Certainly, the operation there is proving to be a dangerous and more \ngrinding conflict than some expected. The President addressed this fact \ncandidly and resolutely in his recent address to the Nation. While \nSaddam Hussein was building palaces, the infrastructure was \ndeteriorating terribly, more than we realized. Adequate resources for \nthe proper reconstruction are essential to providing security and \nallowing our troops to leave as soon as possible.\n  Eliminating terror is more than removing the leaders of an evil \nregime from power. Terrorism must be torn out by its roots, ensuring \nthat there is no toehold for its sponsors to reestablish their violent \nways. The bottom line; we can fight them there, or we can fight them \nhere.\n  The President's call for a supplemental spending bill for operations \nin Iraq has spawned the most recent round of debate over the war on \nterror. For those who have criticized the cost of the war, understand \nthat inaction would be much more devastating. Just look at the \nSeptember 11 attacks. One study has pegged the cost to the economy at \nwell over $2 trillion. And a Brookings Institution study estimates that \na biological terrorist attack against a major U.S. city would cost our \neconomy $750 billion.\n  There are other critics who have accused the military of being slow \nin their progress. But consider these numbers I heard recently from \nDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. It took 3 years after World War II \nto establish an independent central bank in Germany; it was established \nin Iraq in 2 months. Police in Germany were establish after 14 months; \nin Iraq, 2 months. A new currency in Germany took 3 years; it took 2\\1/\n2\\ months in Iraq. The cabinet in Germany was created after 14 months. \nIraq has a cabinet today--after just 4 months!\n  We cannot afford not to do what is necessary to win the war against \nterror and secure our homeland. The funding for the war is necessary \nand significant, but it is temporary. The cost of fighting this war is \nwell below the cost of previous conflicts.\n  And more than words . . . more than negotiations . . . the \nPresident's significant spending request sends an unmistakable signal \nto the sponsors of terror, to the liberated Iraqi citizens, and to the \nworld--that the United States of America is staying the course. Attacks \non U.S. troops and other targets in Iraq are aimed at undermining \nfreedom and democracy--but these attacks will not cause us to shy away \nfrom our commitment. Failure to follow through in our mission would \nleave a lethal void--a void that would rapidly be filled by terror and \nits supporters. President Bush has said, ``Liberty is not America's \ngift to the world, it is God's gift to Mankind.''\n  I believe that God's gift to all of his children is liberty--and also \njustice and equality, tolerance and opportunity. These belong to all \npeople--no matter where they live. Let us remember the steadfast \nresolve of Shawn Jensen in that letter to his grandmother. He is a \nwitness to a country being transformed from a reign of terror to a \nbeacon of hope. Let us, like him, commit to the stabilization of Iraq \ndiminishing the threat to our troops and ensuring greater stability and \npeace in the Middle East.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the challenge described by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina is immense: Restructuring the economy and \ngovernment of a country that has borne decades of neglect by a \ntyrannical regime. If we fail, the consequences could be a disaster. A \nfractured, failed Iraq could become a safe haven for terrorists, a \ncaldron for fomenting extremism, and a destabilizing force to its \nneighbors, throwing the entire Middle East into chaos. If we succeed, \nthe results could be extraordinary. A democratic and economically \nvibrant Iraq would be a shining example to her neighbors that Islam and \ndemocracy can coexist. More important, such an Iraq would be a friend \nto the United States.\n  I have often come to this floor to talk about the importance of \nteaching our children American history and civics so they grow up \nlearning what it means to be an American.\n  Former President Harry Truman put it this way. He said:\n\n       The only thing new is the history you've forgotten.\n\n  Let me look at history. I am reminded most about the choices we made \nwhen dealing with postwar Germany, after World War I and World War II. \nAt the end of World War I, we made a grave mistake. We punished Germany \nfor its actions. The Treaty of Versailles, which formally declared the \nend of the war, ordered Germany to repay its debt to other European \ncountries and denied any aid for reconstructing war-torn Germany. Even \nthough a new democratic government sprang up in Germany at that time, \nthe Weimar Republic, we chose not to provide help but to tell the \nGermans to ``pay up.'' In other words, we defeated them, left them in \nruins, sent them a bill, and went home.\n  Sometimes we forget that Adolf Hitler was elected in a democratic \nGermany. What was the result? As early as 1922, a young Hitler was \nalready railing against the Treaty of Versailles and the payments \nGermany was forced to make. Eleven years later, in 1933, Hitler became \nthe Chancellor of Germany--elected. Again, he blamed the Treaty of \nVersailles for Germany's woes. He said:\n\n       We want to liberate Germany from the fetters of an \n     impossible parliamentary democracy.\n\n  Under such a heavy burden of debt, with a failed reconstruction \npolicy, Hitler convinced the German people that democracy was too much \nof a burden. We all know what happened next--another world war that was \nmore devastating than the first.\n  Our post-World War I policy with Germany was a complete failure.\n\n[[Page S12220]]\n\n  One can imagine a similar scenario playing out in Iraq today if we \nmake the wrong choice. Let's say the United States, after getting a new \nIraqi government in place, decides to go home and orders Iraq to pay \nits bills, as some on the other side of the aisle would have us do. It \nis not hard to imagine a new Iraqi leader emerging who blames Iraq's \neconomic woes on the United States, who decries the debt we are making \nIraq repay, who says we only waged the war in order to encumber its \noil; a new leader coming to power on the wave of anti-American \nsentiment who proceeds to destroy the fledgling democratic system the \nUnited States helped to establish in Iraq; and suddenly, a few years \ndown the road, we have a new evil tyrant running Iraq, who is a clear \nenemy of the United States and could start pursuing policies similar to \nthose of Saddam Hussein, or even worse.\n  Fortunately, there is another choice. After World War II, we took a \nvery different approach to postwar Germany. In 1948, after a failed \npolicy of loaning money to war-torn countries in Europe, the United \nStates adopted the Marshall plan, named for Secretary of State George \nC. Marshall. The Marshall plan was a 4-year initiative to rebuild the \neconomies of 16 countries in Europe, including Germany. The Marshall \nplan cost $13.3 billion and a lot of effort. Ninety percent of the \nmoney spent on the Marshall plan--nearly $12 billion--was grant money, \nnot loan money.\n  What was the result? At first, the results were uncertain. Germany's \neconomy looked shaky. But over time, our continued investment paid \ndividends. A continent that had been fighting for a thousand years \nbecame a democracy and became our ally.\n  In Japan--in another part of the world--our help took a country that \nhad invaded us and made it an ally. The results could not have been \nbetter after World War II. Our policy was a complete success.\n  That is why I believe we need a Marshall plan for Iraq. We need a 4- \nor 5-year plan for reconstructing Iraq, and we need to face up to the \ncost of the plan. We need to understand it is more for us, the United \nStates, than it is for them. President Bush has laid out the first \nstages of such a plan.\n  The Marshall plan was used for a variety of purposes to reconstruct \nwar-torn Europe, including Germany. It paid for the building of \nrailroads and water systems, for needed medicines, modernizing \nfactories, for restoring ports to allow foreign trade, and much more. \nPresident Bush's request for funding will pay for many of the same \nthings: restoring Iraq's ports on the Persian Gulf, building roads, \nrestoring power and water systems, needed medicines, reopening schools, \nand much more.\n\n  Some say funding Iraq's reconstruction would be too costly. But the \ncost of the President's request for rebuilding Iraq--$20.3 billion--is \nactually far less than what we spent on the Marshall plan. That was $13 \nbillion then, between 1948 and 1952, and that would be at least $102 \nbillion in today's dollars.\n  Another way to compare the cost is percentage of gross domestic \nproduct. The Marshall plan cost 1.1 percent of our GDP during the 4 \nyears it was in place. President Bush's proposal would be only one-\nfifth of 1 percent. Again, the Marshall plan was five times the cost of \nPresident Bush's Iraq plan.\n  Or we can compare the cost as a percentage of the Federal budget. The \nMarshall plan cost 7 percent of the Federal budget during the years it \nwas enacted. The President's requested funds, when added to those \nalready spent on reconstruction, were only 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget.\n  So this idea that we are spending more on Iraq than we did after \nWorld War II is totally false.\n  We can learn a valuable lesson from history. After World War I, we \nmade Germany pay its debts. We left them in ruin. We went home. As a \nresult, we got Adolf Hitler. After World War II, we pursued the \nMarshall plan, and it did cost some money. But as a result, we won \ndemocratic allies in more parts of the world.\n  President Kennedy said it best in his 1961 inaugural address. This is \nwhat he said:\n\n       We will pay any price, bear any burden . . . to assure the \n     survival and success of liberty.\n\n  The people of Iraq, like the people of Germany 60 years ago, lived \nunder an evil tyrant who wreaked havoc on his neighbors and his own \npeople. In both cases, the evil tyrant was overthrown by the United \nStates and its allies. America and its allies temporarily took over the \nadministration of Germany and Iraq. We paid for the German \nreconstruction under the Marshall plan. We should do the same in Iraq \nand support the President's request. We cannot afford, in our own \ninterests, to do anything less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I asked for the leader time because I \nwish to respond to some of the remarks I heard on the floor earlier \nregarding the CIA leaks.\n  Mr. President, every one of us in this country would be very \nconcerned about a leak regarding someone who was undercover and \noperating for the CIA, and we would want to get to the bottom of the \nissue if there were a leak. In fact, that is exactly what is happening. \nBut I think it has been distorted and I think it has been blown way out \nof proportion before we really know the facts. So I want to set the \nrecord straight on a few issues.\n  First of all, many people on the other side are asking for a special \ncounsel. Right now, the FBI is investigating this as a routine leak. \nThe CIA Director, George Tenet, according to Bob Novak, did not request \nthe investigation separately in some major way. The CIA Director was \nnot involved because this is in fact routine.\n  According to Bob Novak, any leak of classified information is \nroutinely passed by the CIA to the Justice Department, averaging one a \nweek. This investigative request was made in July, shortly after the \noriginal column was published. This was a routine investigation of \nsomething that appeared to be a leak and which may be a leak. The \ninvestigation has been ongoing since July. I think it is certainly \npremature to start making this a political issue, talking about a \nspecial counsel, when we don't even know the facts yet.\n  Bob Novak wrote a subsequent column that appeared today in the \nWashington Post. I think it is very important because it was his \noriginal column that outed the woman who was a CIA employee. He says \nvery clearly, first: I did not receive a planned leak. Now, it has been \naccused on television shows across America that the White House somehow \nleaked information about a CIA operative to the press.\n  The man who wrote the story said:\n\n       I did not receive a planned leak. Secondly, the CIA never \n     warned me that the disclosure of Wilson's wife working at the \n     agency would endanger her or anybody else and, third, it was \n     not much of a secret.\n\n  According to him, this has been well known around Washington and, in \nfact, was even reported in the National Review Online from a \nnongovernmental source before Mr. Novak's column appeared.\n  Mr. Novak said an administration official told him this information \nbut not the White House. He says this did not come from the White \nHouse.\n  I think it is very important that we tone down the rhetoric on this \nissue. It is an issue that should be investigated. It is being \ninvestigated. The President has said he wants it to be investigated. He \nhas said it is important to him that it be investigated. He wants \neveryone in the White House to be fully cooperative, and the author of \nthe story says no one in the White House was involved. So I think we \nneed to tone it down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. shall be equally divided for debate only.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in behalf of the Committee on \nAppropriations, I present to the Senate a bill making emergency \nsupplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan security and \nreconstruction for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004.\n  The bill was reported favorably by the committee by a vote of 29 to \n0. During 6 hours of deliberation, the committee considered many \namendments and rejected most of them, but I am sure we will have the \nopportunity to reconsider some of these suggested changes on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  This bill is requested by the President and is a matter of some \nurgency. It is an emergency supplemental appropriations bill which \nshould be acted upon without delay, but, of course, with the thoughtful \nand careful consideration which the subject matter clearly requires.\n  The President's request has been considered in hearings held by the \nAppropriations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and the Banking Committee. During these hearings \nand through 16 witnesses, the case has been well made that these \nemergency funds are needed and should be approved.\n  The funds appropriated by this bill will provide the equipment, fuel, \nammunition, and subsistence our troops need as they complete their \nmissions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill includes military pay, \nincluding imminent danger pay and family separation allowance, at the \nlevels authorized in the fiscal year 2003 emergency supplemental for \nthe duration of fiscal year 2004.\n  We have also provided funding for equipment needed by our troops. \nSome of the items for which emergency funds are provided are fuel for \nmilitary vehicles and aircraft, improved humvees, and body armor to \nbetter protect our troops.\n  We have increased the level of funding requested by the President for \noperation and maintenance funding for the Army and for replenishment of \nprepositioned war stocks.\n  This bill includes appropriations to purchase more electrical \ngenerators, moneys for mail service, and improvements in troop housing \nand facilities.\n  The bill includes $412 million in military construction funding that \nwill provide support facilities for our soldiers in base camps \nthroughout Iraq, as well as urgently needed runways and taxiways to \nsupport Air Force operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The Armed Forces and the coalition of nations that are involved are \nmaking remarkable progress in Iraq. It has been less than 1 year since \nwe gave the President the authority to use force against the Saddam \nHussein regime.\n  During our hearings on this bill, Ambassador Bremer pointed out that \nthe coalition has already opened all of Iraq's 240 hospitals and nearly \nevery health clinic. Almost every university and secondary school in \nthat nation has been reopened, and the Iraqi people have begun to share \nin providing the security for their own country. Tens of thousands have \nbeen trained as police officers or members of the new Iraqi Army.\n  We are also providing funding to help rebuild Iraq's infrastructure. \nThis funding will improve electrical, transportation and \ntelecommunications systems, as well as the infrastructure that will \nenable Iraq to sustain itself without our assistance in the years \nahead. But it is essential that we act now to approve these funds. We \nshould act expeditiously on this bill. Our military needs the funding \nto carry out their missions. The coalition provisional authority needs \nthe support provided by this bill now.\n  I invite the attention of the Senate to the provisions of the bill. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe following statement in explanation of the recommendations of the \nCommittee on Appropriations on the bill, S. 1689, making emergency \nsupplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan security and \nrecovery for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other \npurposes.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExplanatory Statement of the Recommendations of the Senate Committee on \n Appropriations on Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Iraq and \n             Afghanistan Security and Reconstruction, 2004\n\n       The Committee on Appropriations reports the bill (S. 1689) \n     making emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq and \n     Afghanistan security and reconstruction for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes, reports \n     favorably thereon and recommends that the bill do pass.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       This bill makes appropriations for the military functions \n     of the Department of Defense as it prosecutes the war in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, as well as for relief and reconstruction \n     efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to continue anti-\n     terrorism efforts around the world.\n\n                                Hearings\n\n       The Committee held hearings on September 22, 24, and 25, \n     2003 and heard testimony from Ambassador Paul Bremer; Hon. \n     Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense; General Richard \n     Meyers, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; General John \n     Abizaid, Commanding General United States Central Command; \n     Dr. Dov Zakheim, Under Secrteary of Defense (Comptroller); \n     Peter Rodman, Assistant Secretary of Defense Secretary for \n     International Security Affairs; and General Peter Pace, Vice \n     Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff from the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n                          Summary of the Bill\n\n       On September 17, 2003, the President submitted requests for \n     $87,039,804,000 in new budget authority for programs under \n     the Department of Defense, Department of State, United States \n     Agency for International Development, and the Iraq Relief and \n     Reconstruction Fund. The Committee recommends $87,004,004,000 \n     in new budget authority.\n       The President's supplemental requests are contained in \n     budget estimate No. 17, transmitted on September 17, 2003 (H. \n     Doc. 108-126).\n\n                          Committee Priorities\n\n       The primary goals of this bill are to fund the ongoing \n     military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as relief \n     and reconstruction activities in those countries. To \n     accomplish the first goal, the Committee is providing \n     $66,560,004,000 to prosecute the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n     These funds are for increased operational tempo, military \n     personnel costs, military construction, procurement of \n     equipment, increased maintenance and military health care \n     support. To achieve the second goal, the Committee is \n     providing $21,444,000,000 to help secure the transition to \n     democracy in both Iraq and Afghanistan. These funds are for \n     enhanced security and reconstruction activities including \n     border enforcement, building a national police service in \n     Iraq, standing up a new Iraqi army and continued building of \n     the Afghan National Army, reconstituted judicial systems, \n     rehabilitation of Iraq's oil infrastructure, and provision of \n     basic electricity, water and sewer services and other \n     critical reconstruction needs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n                       TITLE I--NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n                               CHAPTER 1\n\n                        Subcommittee on Defense\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n\n2004 supplemental estimate..............................$65,147,554,000\nCommittee recommendation.................................65,147,554,000\n\n                           MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n                      Special Pays and Allowances\n\n       The Supplemental request includes $1,248,200,000 for \n     enhanced Special Pays included Family Separation Allowance \n     [FSA], Imminent Danger Pay [IDP], and Hostile Duty Pay [HDP]. \n     The Department's request would fund FSA and IDP at the \n     enhanced levels authorized in the fiscal year 2003 Emergency \n     Wartime Supplemental Appropriation Act (Public Law 108-11) \n     for the first 3 months of the fiscal year. Beginning January \n     1, 2004, the Department requests that FSA and IDP return to \n     the levels authorized prior to enactment of Public Law 108-\n     11, and that the Committee authorize an increase in Hardship \n     Duty Pay to offset the reductions to FSA and IDP. However, \n     the requested increase in HDP would only cover those \n     individuals serving in the combat zone in support of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The \n     Department's proposal would not provide a benefit to those \n     servicemembers who have been mobilized and deployed \n     throughout the United States in support of Operation Noble \n     Eagle, nor would it provide a benefit to those servicemembers \n     deployed overseas in support of other contingency operations \n     such as Bosnia and Kosovo. The Committee does not approve the \n     Department's request, and instead supports the continuation \n     of FSA and IDP at the levels authorized in Public Law 108-11 \n     for all of fiscal year 2004. The Committee directs the \n     Department to use the funds requested for increased Hardship \n     Duty Pay to fund the full year increase to FSA and IDP for \n     all eligible recipients.\n\n[[Page S12222]]\n\n                        Military Personnel, Army\n\n2004 supplemental estimate..............................$12,858,870,000\nCommittee recommendation.................................12,858,870,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $12,858,870,000 for Military \n     Personnel, Army.

The recommendation is \n     $60,500,000 below the supplemental budget request. The \n     request included $60,500,000 to construct an interim United \n     States diplomatic facility in Iraq. The Committee reminds the \n     Department that $61,500,000 was provided for this purpose in \n     Public Law 108-11, the Emergency Wartime Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act of 2003. The Committee is aware of the \n     Department's reprogramming request to utilize $43,900,000 of \n     these funds to construct an interim facility for United \n     States Agency for International Development and other United \n     States Government employees engaged in reconstruction efforts \n     in Afghanistan and $16,600,000 of these funds to cover the \n     personnel, transportation, and equipment costs of United \n     States Government officials tasked with advising the Afghan \n     transitional government on reconstruction. This request is \n     contained under the ``Capital investment fund'' of chapter 2 \n     of this title. Also, the Committee approves the Department's \n     reprogramming request to utilize $14,500,000 under Worldwide \n     Security Upgrades for security requirements in Afghanistan, \n     and directs that these funds only be used for the security of \n     the main United States Embassy compound and security \n     assistance to United Nations offices and personnel and non-\n     governmental organization offices and personnel.\n\n\n           EMERGENCIES IN THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE\n\n2004 supplemental estimate..................................$50,000,000\nCommittee recommendation.....................................90,500,000\n\n       The Committee recommends $90,500,000 for Emergencies in the \n     Diplomatic and Consular Service.

The Committee also provides that funds \n     allocated under this heading for programs and sectors may be \n     reallocated by the President for those programs and sectors.\n       The Committee strongly supports programs and activities to \n     promote freedom, democratic institutions, and the rule of law \n     in Iraq and provides that not less than $100,000,000 shall be \n     made available for democracy building activities in that \n     country in support of the development and ratification of a \n     constitution, national elections and women's development \n     programs. The Committee directs that not less than $5,000,000 \n     be made available to Iraqi nongovernmental organizations in \n     Iraq in a timely manner, in grants of up to $100,000. The \n     Committee also expects sufficient funding to be provided to \n     the National Endowment for Democracy, the International \n     Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute \n     for political party and other democracy building activities.\n       The Committee recommends not less than $20,000,000 for \n     media outreach activities in Iraq that utilizes low cost, \n     advanced technology tools.\n       The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for a program, such as \n     that administered by the International Commission on Missing \n     Persons, to locate, recover, and identify Iraqis missing as a \n     result of authoritarian rule or conflict.\n       The Committee again provides that funds shall be made \n     available for Iraqi civilians who suffer losses as a result \n     of military operations in Iraq. The Committee supports the \n     provision of medical, rehabilitation, shelter, microcredit \n     and other appropriate assistance to these individuals. The \n     Committee expects all relevant agencies and organizations to \n     coordinate efforts in providing this assistance.\n       The Committee recognizes that conflict and decades of \n     neglect devastated Iraq's health infrastructure, resulting in \n     a lack of medical equipment and supplies, and health \n     professionals with expertise in pediatric medical \n     specialties. The Committee is concerned that children with \n     critical health problems cannot obtain life-saving treatments \n     in Iraq. The Committee strongly supports activities that can \n     have an immediate impact in addressing the needs of these \n     children, such as the Emergency Health Services for the \n     Children of Iraq program sponsored jointly by Kurdish Human \n     Rights Watch and Vanderbilt University Children's Hospital.\n       The Committee notes the important contributions that \n     nongovernmental organizations have made to relief and \n     reconstruction efforts in Iraq, and urges that they be \n     utilized to the maximum extent practicable. The Committee \n     also recommends that organizations with experience in post-\n     conflict governance matters--such as the United States \n     Institute of Peace--be utilized in reconstruction efforts in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       The Committee recommends that not less than $2,000,000 be \n     made available to support organizations working in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan and other complex humanitarian emergency and war \n     settings, to apply public health strategies and epidemiology \n     to mitigate the impact of the conflict on civilian \n     populations. Programs supported should include those which \n     collect, analyze, and use multi-sector data for programmatic \n     decision-making and evaluation of assistance programs during \n     and after conflict.\n\n                         Economic Support Fund\n\n2004 supplemental estimate.................................$422,000,000\nCommittee recommendation....................................422,000,000\n\n       The Committee provides $422,000,000 for an additional \n     amount for Economic Support Fund (ESF) for accelerated \n     assistance for Afghanistan.\n       The Committee also provides authority to use up to \n     $200,000,000 in Economic Support Funds contained in the \n     Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, 2004 for debt reduction for Pakistan.\n       The Committee recognizes the progress of Internews in the \n     establishment of independent news media in Afghanistan. \n     However, absent additional long-term support opportunities \n     for advancement may be lost. The Committee recommends that \n     additional funds be made available for the expansion of local \n     stations to regional stations, the establishment of national \n     independent broadcasting, and support for daily news \n     programs.\n       The Committee directs that not less than $15,000,000 be \n     made available for media outreach activities in Afghanistan \n     that utilizes low cost, advanced technology tools.\n       In addition to other purposes for which ESF assistance is \n     used in Afghanistan, not less than $5,000,000 should be made \n     available through appropriate humanitarian organizations for \n     additional food, clothing, heating and cooking fuel, \n     emergency shelter materials, and other basic necessities for \n     displaced Afghans in Kabul.\n\n        United States Emergency Fund for Complex Foreign Crises\n\n2004 supplemental estimate.................................$100,000,000\nCommittee recommendation....................................100,000,000\n\n       The Committee provides $100,000,000 for the United States \n     Emergency Fund for Complex Foreign Crises. While the \n     Committee understands the need for flexibility in meeting \n     unforeseen complex foreign crises, it includes congressional \n     notification for these funds, which may be waived if human \n     health or welfare is at substantial risk.\n       Among other activities, the Committee expects these funds \n     to support operations and programs to prevent or respond to \n     foreign territorial disputes, armed ethnic and civil \n     conflicts that pose threats to regional and international \n     peace, and acts of ethnic cleansing, mass killing or \n     genocide. In addition, the Committee supports the use of \n     these funds for peace and humanitarian efforts, such as \n     required in Liberia.\n\n                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n          International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement\n\n2004 supplemental estimate.................................$120,000,000\nCommittee recommendation....................................120,000,000\n\n\n[[Page S12225]]\n\n\n       The Committee provides $120,000,000 for an additional \n     amount in International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement \n     assistance for Afghanistan.

The Committee includes transfer authority \n     between accounts in chapter 2 of this title, with the total \n     amount authorized to be transferred not to exceed \n     $200,000,000. The Committee directs that it be consulted \n     before this authority is exercised. The Committee includes \n     the same notification requirement as contained in section 501 \n     of Public Law 108-11.\n       Sec. 2302. The Committee includes authority permitting \n     assistance or other financing contained in chapter 2 of this \n     title for Iraq notwithstanding any other provision of law.\n       Sec. 2303. The Committee includes authority to allow \n     appropriations provided in chapter 2 of this title to be made \n     available without specific authorization of such \n     appropriation.\n       Sec. 2304. The Committee extends section 1503 of Public Law \n     108-11 through September 30, 2005. The Committee notes that \n     extending the inapplicability of section 307 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 is particularly important as the \n     United States pursues long-range efforts to assist Iraq and \n     marshal resources from the international community.\n       Sec. 2305. The Committee amends the first proviso of \n     section 1504 of Public Law 108-11 to include Iraqi military, \n     private security force, other official security forces, \n     police force, or forces from other countries in Iraq \n     supporting United States efforts in Iraq. The Committee notes \n     that other official security forces include Ministry of \n     Interior forces, border guards, and civil defense forces. The \n     Committee also notes that a private security force include \n     those providing security services to contractors, \n     nongovernmental organizations or other organizations \n     affiliated with United States efforts in Iraq.\n       Sec. 2306. The Committee extends key provisions of Public \n     Law 107-57 regarding restrictions that would otherwise limit \n     assistance to Pakistan.\n       Sec. 2307. The Committee includes authority to allow the \n     Overseas Private Investment Corporation to provide political \n     risk insurance, direct loans, and guarantees in Iraq.\n       Sec. 2308. The Committee includes a notification \n     requirement for certain accounts under chapter 2 of this \n     title.\n       Sec. 2309. The Committee provides that the Secretary of \n     State shall submit a report on a monthly basis detailing Iraq \n     oil production and oil revenues.\n       Sec. 2310. The Committee directs that none of the funds in \n     this Act may be used to pay debts incurred by the former \n     government.\n\n                 TITLE III--GENERAL PROVISION, THIS ACT\n\n       Sec. 3001.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to take this time to talk about \nsome of the successes that our wonderful military uniformed personnel \nare having in Iraq. We see a lot on the television that looks like \nthings are in chaos, and in some places they are.\n  I want to talk about some of the good things because I think as we \ntake up this supplemental appropriation, we are going to be talking \nabout what this money is going for and why we need to put $20 billion \ninto rebuilding Iraq.\n  This picture illustrates so well what we are going to be doing with \nthis money and why we need that $20 billion to help us rebuild Iraq.\n  The schools are starting today in Iraq. Millions of schoolchildren \nare beginning to go to school today. According to TSgt Mark Getsy from \nthe 506th Air Expeditionary Group, these children have been climbing \nthe gates for weeks, climbing the gates because they are so excited \nthat they are going to get to go to school. Why are they excited? Why \nare they able to go to school?\n  I will give some instances of how successful we are. Air Force and \nArmy volunteers have extended a helping hand to these children for \nweeks so that their education can be in the best possible facilities. \nMembers of the Air Force's 506th Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron \nat Kirkuk Air Base and the Army's Battle Companies 2nd Battalion, 503rd \nAirborne, have teamed up to renovate two schools in the local area. The \nfirst school is a model for the rest of the Kirkuk schools, and it is \nopening today.\n  Said 1SG Richard Weik, the Army project officer:\n\n       We adopted the schools because they were close to our safe \n     houses. The first thing we did was go around and assess the \n     electrical and plumbing situation. It was a mess.\n\n  The Army called in Air Force electricians to help get the school \nready for business. TSgt Jack Vollriede, an electrician from the 506th \nECES, said Air Force electricians were already working in the area on \nArmy safe houses when they heard about the project.\n\n       The Army asked us if we would check out the electrical work \n     being done at the school. I saw the work needing (to be) done \n     was very similar to what I do in my civilian job back home so \n     I asked others in my shop to volunteer and help out with the \n     project.\n\n  Since mid-September, more than 10 electricians have been working \ndaily to get the schools up and running. Vollriede said it was hard at \nfirst to find the right parts, but the team managed to accomplish a \ngreat deal in a short period of time.\n\n       We have completed five electrical service panel \n     replacements, installed emergency lighting, fixed all the \n     interior lighting, and even fixed the school bell. We are now \n     working on installing grounded outlets for computers in all \n     the classrooms and offices.\n\n  I know the Senator from Montana is in the Chamber and is scheduled to \nspeak. I will yield to him as soon as he is ready, but I first will say \nhow important this is. It is happening all over Iraq. These Army and \nAir Force volunteers are coming in and fixing the schools so that these \nchildren can start learning, not just the limited knowledge that they \nhad during Saddam Hussein's time but knowledge of the world, knowledge \nof freedom, knowledge of other horizons that they will be able to share \nwhen they get their education. They know it and they are excited about \nit. It is something that America is providing.\n  The $20 billion that we are going to be voting on in the $87 billion \npackage is going to encompass projects like this that will start the \nprocess for the Iraqi people to have a better quality of life, educated \nchildren--what every person in the world would like to have: quality of \nlife and education for their children--and that is what the money will \ngo for. So we are going to be debating why we need $20 billion to \nrebuild Iraq. It is for the national security of the United States that \nthese children start school, that our great volunteers help them do it, \nbecause if we can get these children educated and a quality of life, \nand an economy for the people of Iraq, those terrorists will not have a \nsafe haven. Those terrorists will be driven away by the Iraqi people \nbecause they will see the difference in their lives when they have \nfreedom versus when they live under a tyrant or when they have \nterrorists in their midst.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Before the Senator from Texas leaves the floor, I do not \nknow where she got hold of that poster, but I have said ever since the \ninvasion started, and the assault towards Baghdad, our greatest \nambassadors, who are on the ground and are still there today, are our \nwarriors. The effects of our action in Iraq will not really be felt for \nanother 10 years or so. When the young folks seen in that poster become \nadult age, they will remember that warrior who walked up to them, \ndusty, sandy, dirty, greasy, ladened with armor, weapons and goggles on \nhis helmet; yet they reached out the hand of friendship in the form of \na bottle of water or a candy bar.\n  One must remember these young folks were hunkered down in their homes \nand told how evil this Army was that was approaching their area. When \nthe Army arrived, they found out those things they had been deprived \nof, the bare essentials to survive the last few days, were available \nand had come from the hand of an American soldier or marine. That is \nwhy we hear so many of our military on the ground today telling us to \nrebuild the infrastructure, bring back the central services so these \npeople can live, improve their quality of life, and rebuild their own \ncountry.\n  To a man, all the military people I have visited with who have come \nhome have said that.\n\n[[Page S12228]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, responding to the comments of the \nSenator from Montana, he could not be on target any more. I hear the \nsame thing from the men and women who return, the men and women I \ntalked to when I was in Iraq and Afghanistan. I agree with the Senator \nthat it is those wonderful, clean-cut, all-American soldiers who give \nthe best possible image of our country.\n  This picture is of a soldier from A Company, the 101st Airborne \nDivision. He is handing out school supplies. The A Company took up a \ncollection in the town of Mosul. They went to the local economy and \nthey bought school supplies for these children to be able to have \npencils, erasers, and paper when they go to school. One could not ask \nfor better ambassadors. They did it from their own pockets because they \nknow what we are doing in this country is important for the security of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is the genius of our country, when we look at it. We \nhave always lived for the next generation. Our mothers and fathers \nwanted us to be educated better than they were.\n  I was raised on a small farm in the Midwest before I went to Montana \nwhen I was 18. The generation before us wanted us to be educated better \nthan they were. They wanted us to start up the economic ladder a little \nbit better than they started. I was a product of the Great Depression \nin the 1930s. In doing that in the family unit, of living for the next \ngeneration, this system has afforded the highest quality of life and \nstandard of living for more of its citizens than any other society that \nhas been developed on the face of this planet. That is what makes this \nparticular mission in Iraq, in the Middle East, very important. Those \nyoung people who met and have a very positive view of Americans, who \nare the young ages of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12--the most impressionable years \nof a young person's life--will never forget that. That will be burned \nin their brains. There might be a lot of propaganda flying around, but \nthey know. They shook the hand of and met our best ambassadors.\n\n  We didn't start this fight. We didn't start this fight. Because if 9/\n11 of the year '01 doesn't mean anything else, it should carry the same \nsignificance as Pearl Harbor or any other devastating attack that has \nbeen carried out against this country. We didn't start this fight, but \nthey brought the fight to the wrong people and the wrong country \nbecause of our values and because what we really believe in is that \nfreedom equals opportunity, opportunity means choices, and choices have \nconsequences.\n  It is this warrior who cleared the way. The polls now say the \nmajority of the people in Iraq believe they are now better off than \nthey were under the tyrant Saddam Hussein.\n  Why is $21 billion important? Saddam Hussein had a knack of \ncontrolling his people. He did it through the rationing of central \nservices, the very basics of our community. He only had about 60 \npercent or 70 percent capacity to produce as much electricity for his \ncountry as he needed. So if he didn't like you, or you made him mad, or \nyou came from the wrong side of the creek, you didn't get electricity. \nIf anybody wanted centrally controlled health care? He had it. He \nrationed it. He used it to control. Water, whatever the central \nservices, his infrastructure was in complete disarray. But he liked it \nlike that. So he had to go, that tyrant--mass graves, history of \ngassing people, killing people, raiding his neighbors.\n  So we didn't start this fight. We are sure going to conclude it. We \nare sure going to develop a country of people who desire to be free and \nto live, to educate and to raise their kids in a free society. \nRepresentative government has already taken over in Iraq.\n  The overwhelming majority of these funds, of course, go to our \nmilitary in this particular piece of supplemental funds for Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  But those who would deny them freedoms and opportunities, and control \nthem through fear, understand what this is about. It is about people \nwho are in charge of their own destiny and are not afraid to stand for \nfreedom or die for the next generation. That is what it is all about. \nThat is what this President envisioned when we were hit on 9/11. He \ndidn't ask for those planes to fly into the World Trade Center or hit \nthe Pentagon or the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. He didn't ask \nfor the first attack on the World Trade Center. He didn't ask for the \nattacks on the USS Cole, Khobar Towers, our embassies around the world.\n  There is no negotiating with folks who use fear to control. For, if \nwe fail here, the battle line is probably our own country. Since the \nCivil War, not a shot has been fired here. We have always carried the \nfight to the enemy's ground. That is what it is all about.\n  Representative government in small towns and political bounds and \npolitical units in Iraq have already taken hold. We are already \nestablishing an interim government in Baghdad and it will not be long \nbefore they have a constitution, they will have elections.\n  Our interest there is in the generation of school kids because it is \nan investment. Is it an investment? Yes, but it is an investment in \nhuman lives, in human endeavors. Sure, it is a lot of money, but money \nis a tool. Money is a tool that can bring good or it can be evil, and \nwe have chosen to use ours in the name of good.\n  Yesterday in committee we had some very good ideas on how we should \nhelp these people get on their own feet and prosper, how we can help. \nYes, the $20 or $21 billion in this will do that. But how to administer \nthat, what should it go for? What should it do? Because it is America's \nhand. It is not our hand of Congress, it is the people of America \nreaching out because the people of the United States know what is at \nstake. There were some very good ideas. Some were premature. Some will \nbe considered here on the floor of the Senate and they will be argued \non their own merits.\n  But when we take a look at the overall package, it is a pretty solid \npackage that we extend toward these people who now stand in harm's way, \nwho now risk some disdain from their neighbors for joining a police \nforce or a militia that will stand for good. It takes some bravery to \ndo that, in a land where terrorism and death and destruction have been \ncommonplace for the last 2 decades.\n  We will be that steel in their backbone. But we also have to give \nthem the funds with which to build. They have made the decision. There \nare polls which indicate that. They have made the decision to stand for \ngood and right and freedom. That is what this bill is all about. It may \nbe characterized in many ways, but I think it is America's best hour. \nTo establish another democracy in the Middle East where basically there \nis only one, to expand those freedoms now to the other side of the \nriver, it is a noble and just thing to do.\n  I thank the Chair for the time to express my views about the \nimportance of this legislation. Their values are not much different \nthan ours: Their families, their kids, their country. Our ability to \nfix irrigation systems and communication systems so they can talk, and \na system within which they can feed themselves, and have something to \nsay about their own destiny, that is a noble cause. That is an American \ncause. That is what we are all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we begin the most consequential \nnational security debate in a generation.\n  At stake is more than just the fate of $87 billion in spending.\n  This debate will speak to the lives of hundreds of thousands of our \nmen and women in uniform, who are being asked to risk everything for \ntheir country.\n  It will speak to America's taxpayers who are being asked to shoulder \nthe burden of the administration's Iraq policy with little or no help \nfrom our friends and allies around the globe. And it will speak to our \nNation's responsibilities and its role in the world today and for years \nto come.\n  Let me begin, though, by talking specifically about what this debate \nis not about.\n  Democrats and Republicans are united in our support for all our brave \nservice men and women.\n  They continue to bring honor to their country. Inspired by their \nperformance of duty to us, we pledge to live up to our duty to them.\n  Democrats will do everything in our power to ensure that our troops \nhave every tool and resource necessary to do the job we are asking of \nthem. Democrats and Republicans are also united in our commitment to a \nfree, stable,\n\n[[Page S12229]]\n\nand secure Iraq. Terror must not be the successor to tyranny.\n  Therefore, Democrats are committed to doing everything possible to \nkeep Saddam Hussein from returning to power and to keep terrorists from \nexploiting Iraq as a base of operations.\n  Our mission in Iraq will remain unfinished until Iraqis are governed \nby a constitutional government, defended by their own security forces, \nprotected by their own police and judicial system, and provided for by \na functioning infrastructure financed with Iraqi resources.\n  The United States must not and will not prematurely abrogate its \nresponsibility to a fully liberated and self-sufficient Iraq.\n  In short, this debate is not about whether or not we should run from \nour obligations to our troops and to rebuild Iraq. We will not.\n  Simply, this debate is about how to ensure our objectives for Iraq \nare met successfully and our troops brought home to their loved ones as \nsafely and quickly as possible.\n  Day after day, we receive more evidence of the inadequacy of the \nadministration's plan for the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Yesterday, the New York Times reported that 650,000 tons of Iraqi \nmunitions lie unprotected. There is evidence the 500 pound bomb that \nterrorists used to destroy the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad may in fact \nhave been stolen from one of Saddam's old munitions depots. This news \ncomes to us 3 weeks after the Pentagon assured us that all known \nweapons sites had already been secured.\n  In spite of these concerns, the administration continues to say that \nits pre-war planning was adequate to the task, and that it has the \nright prescriptions for Iraq's future.\n  But an objective look at the record indicates that the White House's \nplan for post-Saddam Iraq was either inadequate or altogether non-\nexistent.\n  In its post-combat report, the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that \nthe post-war plan was not sufficient to some of the most critical \nchallenges we face in post-Saddam Iraq.\n  I quote from that report:\n\n       Late formation of [post-conflict] organizations limited \n     time available for the development of detailed plans and pre-\n     deployment coordination. . . . Weapons of mass destruction \n     (WMD) elimination and exploitation planning efforts did not \n     occur early enough in the process to allow CentCom to \n     effectively execute the mission.'' It concludes, ``The extent \n     of the planning required was underestimated.''\n\n  Just yesterday I learned from Iraq's Governing Council that the \nadministration had failed to consult them when putting together its \nproposal to rebuild Iraq.\n  Think about that. At the same time the administration professes its \ndesire to put Iraqis in charge of Iraq, it failed to seek their counsel \nabout Iraq's most urgent needs. Instead, the administration chose to \nhave Ambassador Bremer and its experts here in Washington determine \nwhat was best for the citizens of Baghdad and Basra.\n  The administration's inadequate post-Saddam planning continues to \nhave gravest consequences.\n  On a daily basis, our soldiers follow orders that place them in \nmortal danger because they understand their work serves a greater \npurpose and a larger strategy. But when we place them in situations \nwhere there is no effective strategy or plan, this danger is greatly \nincreased.\n  Sadly, this is a lesson our Nation has had several opportunities to \nlearn. Retired General Anthony Zinni put it best. He said in a recent \nspeech:\n\n       [Our troops] should never be put on a battlefield without a \n     strategic plan, not only for the fighting--our generals will \n     take care of that--but for the aftermath and winning that \n     war.\n       Where are we, the American people, if we accept this, if we \n     accept this level of sacrifice without that level of \n     planning? Almost everyone in this room, of my \n     contemporaries--our feelings and our sensitivities were \n     forged on the battlefields of Vietnam; where we heard the \n     garbage and the lies, and we saw the sacrifice.\n       We swore never again would we do that. We swore never again \n     would we allow it to happen. And I ask you, is it happening \n     again? And you're going to have to answer that question, just \n     like the American people are.\n       And remember, everyone of those young men and women that do \n     not come back is not only a personal tragedy, it's a national \n     tragedy.\n\n  By asking the right questions and making the right changes to the \nadministration's supplemental request, the Senate can act to correct \nthese mistakes and ensure success in Iraq. But time is running short--\nin Iraq and here at home.\n  As Iraqis become accustomed to terrorism as a daily fact of life, \nthey are looking to U.S. leadership for reasons to be hopeful.\n  They want to work with us to build a better future for themselves, \nbut they need to know that we are committed to that future. At the same \ntime, Americans are growing impatient. The costs of success, both in \nlives and in money, appear without end.\n  For both Iraqis and Americans, the window to demonstrate a clear plan \nfor Iraq's future is closing.\n  The next 3 months are crucial to turning around the security \nsituation, which is volatile in key parts of the country.\n  Iraqis, Americans, and the entire world are watching closely to see \nhow resolutely the coalition will handle this challenge. The Iraqi \npopulation has high expectations, and the window for cooperation may \nclose rapidly if they do not see progress on delivering security, basic \nservices, opportunities for broad political involvement, and economic \nopportunity.\n  The ``hearts and minds'' of key segments of the Sunni and Shi'a \ncommunities are in play and can be won, but only if the Coalition \nProvisional Authority--CPA--and new Iraqi authorities deliver in short \norder.\n  To do so, the CPA will have to dramatically and expeditiously augment \nits operational capacity throughout the country, so that civilian- led \nrebuilding can proceed while there are still significant numbers of \ncoalition forces in Iraq to provide maximum leverage over those who \nseek to thwart the process.\n  We believe the greatest opportunity for success lies in \ninternationalizing the effort to stabilize and rebuild Iraq.\n  It reduces the risk to U.S. service men and women and the cost to \nU.S. taxpayers. It increases the international legitimacy of the post-\nSaddam effort. It makes Iraq the world's challenge and the world's \nresponsibility.\n  This can be accomplished through two simple steps. First, the \nPresident needs to make obtaining greater cooperation among our allies \nhis top national security priority and be willing to do what is \nreasonable to obtain their support.\n  It is not enough for the President to make speeches or insist on \nresolutions at the United Nations that essentially restate policy \npositions that to date have left us working largely alone.\n  Second, the administration needs to produce a clear plan that \ndemonstrates both to our Armed Forces and to our taxpayers precisely \nwhat sacrifices will be expected of them, both now and in the future, \nin order to accomplish our objectives.\n  This supplemental budget request does not take either of those steps.\n  Before the Senate is one bill, but in truth, there are two separate \nand distinct requests. First, is the $67 billion requested to equip our \ntroops to do their job. Democrats have no objection to this request and \nwe would be willing to approve this funding this very day.\n  Alongside funding to support our troops stands an additional $20 \nbillion to aid in the rebuilding of Iraq. As I said earlier, Democrats \nremain committed to doing whatever it takes to provide Iraq with the \ntools and resources necessary to join the community of nations as a \nsafe, responsible, self-sufficient member.\n  But a supplemental request is not a plan. And we have serious \nmisgivings about providing the funds requested until we have confidence \nthey will be used in service to a plan that will successfully achieve \nour objectives in Iraq.\n  That confidence is undermined when Americans read reports that firms \nwith close personal and financial ties to the White House are winning \nno-bid contracts, raising the appearance of impropriety and cronyism.\n  That confidence is further eroded when Americans learn that many of \nthe items within this supplemental request seem grossly inflated or \ndubious. The American taxpayer is being asked to pick up the cost of \n600 radios and telephones at the cost of $6,000 apiece, pickup trucks \nat $33,000 a piece. Iraqi prisoners will be incarcerated at $50,000 per \nyear, more than twice the cost in\n\n[[Page S12230]]\n\nAmerican prisons. And Iraqi entrepreneurs will receive business \ntraining costing $10,000 per month, more than two-and-a-half times the \ncost of an education at the Harvard Business School.\n  To be sure, many investments within this bill are worthwhile. But we \nshould bring the same vigilance to control unnecessary spending that we \nbring to spending here at home. That is the root of the questions we \nwill ask and the amendments we will offer.\n  We have sought to raise important questions such as these since the \nvery beginning of the Iraqi conflict. Unfortunately, upon each \noccasion, Republicans opted to question our motives and in some cases, \neven our patriotism.\n  Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman John Warner said last week of \nour soldiers, ``Their fathers, their uncles, their grandfathers have \nserved in previous military conflicts, and they look upon the Congress \nas that bastion that safeguards those that are put in harm's way. I \nask, do these comments constitute embracing, as we should, those \nfamilies, those children? Is that safeguarding those put in harm's way? \nI say no.''\n  Senate Intelligence Chairman Roberts even suggested that the posing \nof questions put the lives of our soldiers at risk. ``I'm very \nconcerned that if the criticism is so harsh as to create the impression \nof lack of resolve, I wonder what goes through the minds of . . . not \nonly our men and women serving in uniform, but the very terrorists who \nare killing our troops and their fellow Iraqis.''\n  These comments represent a low-point in the Senate's proud tradition \nof deliberation and debate. The right to question our leaders is the \nfoundation of our democracy.\n  Demanding answers in a time of war strengthens our democracy, rather \nthan weakening it. President Teddy Roosevelt once said, ``To announce \nthat there must be no criticism of the President or that we are to \nstand by the President right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and \nservile but it is also morally treasonable to the American public.''\n  As American citizens, we are obligated to ask these questions. And as \nSenators, we are not only obligated but empowered by our Constitution \nto demand answers. That is precisely what we will do during this \ndebate.\n  As this debate proceeds, Democrats will offer a series of proposals \nthat are designed to win back the trust of the Nation and the support \nof the world for our Iraq policy.\n  First, the White House must develop and inform Congress and American \npeople about plans for success before gaining access to reconstruction \nfunds. Second, the President should increase efforts to gain \ninternational involvement, both in terms of financial support and \ncommitment of troops.\n  Third, those who have benefitted most from our Nation's prosperity \nshould help pay their fair share for its defense. By rolling back the \nPresident's tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of Americans for \njust 1 year, we can pay for the full cost of this request without \nincreasing the national debt.\n  Fourth, we need to ensure fair, open competition for contracts.\n  Finally, the White House should to transfer control of the \nreconstruction of Iraq from the Defense Department to the State \nDepartment, which has expertise and experience in nation building.\n  History will remember what we say in this debate, because it will \nshape not just the fate of this spending request but the fate of Iraq, \nthe Middle East, and America's foreign policy for years to come.\n  I am confident that the Senate will live up to its responsibility to \nour troops and provide them with the support they need and have earned.\n  I am hopeful that Republicans will join Democrats in insisting that \nthe White House offer a clear plan to go along with the unprecedented \nlevel of funding we have been asked to provide.\n  When our armed forces toppled Saddam Hussein's regime, Americans \nbecame bound to the Iraqi people and responsible for their fate.\n  We are committed to fulfilling that responsibility by providing the \nresources and support they need to become fully independent members in \nthe community of nations.\n  But our vision cannot be clouded by false optimism or blinded by \nstubborn pride.\n  It is not too late to change course and bring a real plan and real \ncooperation, to the American rebuilding of Iraq. This opportunity will \nnot last much longer.\n  We can't afford to let it, and the future of a secure Middle East, \nslip through our fingers.\n  The cost of success is great; the cost of failure is even greater.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my friend from Wisconsin how long he will be.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Wisconsin be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, and I be recognized for 15 minutes following \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Wisconsin who was here before me.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I again especially \nthank the Senator from Arizona for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have begun a debate that may ultimately \nbe more consequential than the war debate we had in this Chamber last \nOctober, which culminated in the votes of 77 Senators authorizing the \nPresident of the United States to go to war against Saddam Hussein's \nIraq. A negative Senate vote last fall, before our country was \ncommitted to liberating and reconstructing Iraq, would have weakened \nthe President's leadership and made America less secure. But a vote \nagainst reconstructing Iraq now, with 130,000 American forces on the \nground, American credibility before our friends and enemies at stake, \nand the enormous responsibility of helping the Iraqi people rebuild \ntheir country now on our shoulders, would doom Iraq's transformation to \nfailure, with grave consequences for the entire Middle East, and \ndevastate American leadership in a dangerous world.\n  An extraordinary allied military campaign in Iraq overthrew, in 3 \nweeks, a Baathist regime that had ruled for three decades. Americans \nwere rightly proud not only of our military's exemplary performance, \nbut of the cause for which they fought: ending the threat posed by \nSaddam Hussein's regime and liberating the Iraqi people from his \ntyrannical rule. With their liberation came an obligation: to help them \nrestore their devastated and demoralized country until it is stable, \nand secure, and free, and therefore, no longer poses a threat to its \npeople or its neighbors. That job is not close to being done. We have \nnot yet won the peace. And we do not have time to spare.\n  If we do not meaningfully improve services and security in Iraq over \nthe next few months, it may be too late. The danger is that our failure \nto improve daily life, security, and Iraqis' participation in their own \ngovernance will erode their patience and fuel a minority's appeal for \ninsurrection. We will risk an irreversible loss of Iraqi confidence and \nreinforce the efforts of extremists who seek our defeat and threaten \nIraq's democratic future. That is why we have to pass this supplemental \nspending bill, urgently.\n  There are two fundamental errors we could make in postwar Iraq. We \ncould stay too long, denying Iraqi sovereignty to a proud and talented \npeople who have the human and material resources to build a progressive \nand modern Arab state. We cannot repeat in Iraq the example of the \nBalkans, where Bosnia and Kosovo remain U.N. protectorates years after \nour just military intervention. Few things would inflame Iraqi and Arab \nopinion more than a long-term United States occupation of Iraq. But \nAmerica is not an imperial nation. We will leave Iraq when our job is \ndone, and we will leave behind an Iraq that is whole, free, and at \npeace.\n  The other danger, and the greater risk, is that we leave too soon--\nbefore basic Iraqi services are up and running, before law and order \nare restored, and before there is a competent, representative Iraqi \ngovernment in place to answer to the Iraqi people. They key to a\n\n[[Page S12231]]\n\ntimely United States withdrawal from Iraq, and for the quickest \nrestoration of Iraqi sovereignty, is to maximize our commitment now to \nproviding the security and services that will allow the fragile \ninstitutions of democracy to take root. A serious United States \ninvestment in Iraq's future is the only way we can leave the Iraqi \npeople and their leaders with a functioning, progressive state that \nwill be an example for the region and a future partner and ally of the \nUnited States.\n\n  Some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle accept that Iraq \nrequires substantial and immediate reconstruction funding, but would \nprovide that funding in the form of loans to be repaid to the United \nStates or international financial institutions when the Iraqi economy \nis up and running again. This would gravely damage America's reputation \nand our support within Iraq. Asseting our claim to Iraq's oil revenues \nover the next 10 or 20 years would confirm the propaganda of our \nenemies and the suspicions of skeptics across the Arab world and closer \nto home: that this was a war for oil. It would also make it impossible \nfor us to encourage countries like Russia, France, and Germany, which \nhold enormous levels of Iraqi debt from Saddam Hussein's era, to write \noff some of that debt in order to life its burden from the Iraqi \npeople.\n  Seeking control, whether directly or indirectly, over Iraq's future \noil revenues would condemn Iraq to be another ward of the international \ncommunity by denying the Iraqi people the key to their future \nprosperity. By making a claim that would prevent future oil revenues \nfrom being spent by a representative Iraqi government to meet the needs \nof the Iraqi people, we would impede the economic development that will \nbe key to a moderate, progressive Iraqi politics. We would make our \nimmediate task of reconstructing and securing Iraq much more difficult, \nbecause collateralizing Iraqi oil revenues would encourage more Iraqis \nto believe the message of the Baathists and terrorists who oppose us: \nthat we are in Iraq not to help the Iraqi people build a better future \nbut to serve our own narrow ends, at their expense. Ironically, we \nwould also make it more difficult for American forces to leave Iraq by \nhandicapping Iraqis' ability to reconstruct their country and govern \nthemselves. Providing reconstruction monies in the form of a loan would \nseriously undermine American national interests in the Middle East.\n  We will also debate the question of whether to divide this spending \nbill into military and reconstruction components. Proponents of this \napproach would substantially trim or vote down reconstruction funding, \nas if we should pay only for our troop presence in Iraq but spend \nlittle to nothing on what our troops are actually there to do: create \nbasic security and enable restoration of services so the Iraqis can \ngovern themselves. The reconstruction and military components of this \nspending request are inextricably linked. Part of the answer to the \nsecurity challenges we face in Iraq is restoring basic services and \nempowering Iraqis to play a greater role in their own security. Voting \nagainst reconstruction funds will seriously degrade the security \nenvironment as greater numbers of frustrated Iraqis fall prey to the \nextremists' appeals to oppose our presence, putting our troops in \ngreater danger and imperiling their core mission of stabilizing Iraq.\n  At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week, I asked \nAmbassador Paul Bremer what would happen if Congress did not pass the \nreconstruction portion of the President's supplemental spending \nrequest. Here is his response: ``Well, it would be directly contrary to \nAmerican's interest--obviously, it would be contrary to the Iraqi \npeople's interest, but it would be contrary to our interest, because it \nwould create a situation of much greater insecurity. I think we would \nfind more of the population turning against us. I think we would find \nmore attacks on coalition forces. Eventually, Iraq would . . . recede \ninto a situation of chaos, not dissimilar from what was experienced in \nLebanon in the 1970s and 1980s, and we would find another breeding \nground for terrorists. So I think it's a rather grim outlook.''\n\n  I would encourage my colleagues who may be considering efforts to \nsplit this bill into military and reconstruction components in order to \ndecrease or vote down reconstruction funding to contemplate the \nprospect of the kind of state collapse and civil war that destroyed \nLebanon happening in Iraq as a result of our own shortsightedness.\n  The Senate will also consider proposals to reduce tax cuts for the \nwealthy in order to pay for Iraqi reconstruction. I voted against the \nPresident's tax cut package in 2003, in part because the costs of this \nwar and its aftermath were unknown at the time. But given what is at \nstake for the Iraqi people and for America's national interest, I \ncannot support proposals to raise taxes to fund our mission in Iraq. \nSuch proposals, if not linked to the Iraq supplemental, would have \nmerit, but were they to pass as part of this package they would \nendanger its passage, transforming a domestic political dispute into \nwhat would quickly become a foreign policy defeat. Our success in Iraq \nis too important to take that chance.\n  This bill is not perfect. I intend to offer an amendment to provide \nfor regular auditing of the Coalition Provisional authority's budget, \nand I suspect the Senate will add additional reporting requirements to \nbetter inform us about how reconstruction money is being spent. But \ngiven the urgency of our mission in Iraq, I intend to strongly support \nthe President's budget request, oppose all amendments that could \nendanger its passage, and do everything I can to see that the United \nStates honors the commitment we have entered into to help the Iraqi \npeople stand up a legitimate, representative government that does not \nthreaten them or their neighbors, and that is a force for good in a \ndangerous region.\n  Every so often in this Chamber, we deal with an issue of such gravity \nthat it transcends partisan divisions. Providing for Iraq's democratic \nfuture should be such an issue. I encourage my colleagues to gauge \ncarefully the broader national interest, as we conduct what I hope is a \ncivilized and high-minded debate. To a large extent, or choices will \ndetermine the success or failure of what I believe to be the most \nimportant foreign policy challenge in a generation.\n  Failure to make the necessary political and financial commitment to \nbuild the new Iraq could endanger American leadership in the world, \nempower our enemies, and condemn Iraqis to renewed tyranny. We must act \nurgently to transform our military success into political victory. \nPassage of these supplemental funds will move us meaningfully towards \nthat goal. Stripping reconstruction aid or providing it in the form of \na loan that will incite Iraqi and Arab hostility against us will only \nmake the job of our service men and women in Iraq harder and could doom \nthem to failure. After all their sacrifice, and in light of the \npotential a free and stable Iraq holds for the future of the Middle \neast and America's position in the world, it would be disgraceful to \nturn our backs now.\n  Iraq's transformation into a progressive Arab state could set the \nregion that produced Saddam Hussein, the Taliban, and al-Qaida on a new \ncourse in which democratic expression and economic prosperity, rather \nthan a radicalizing mix of humiliation, poverty, and repression, define \na new modernity in the Muslim world that does not express itself in \nways that threaten its people or other nations. Conversely, a forced \nUnited States retreat from Iraq would be the most serious American \ndefeat on the global stage since Vietnam. I don't make that statement \nlightly. I repeat: A forced United States retreat from Iraq would be \nthe most serious American defeat on the global stage since Vietnam.\n  Our mission in Iraq is too important to fail. But it is winnable, \nbecause an Iraqi majority shares our vision of a free and progressive \nIraq. Our national interest demands that we help them realize this \ngoal.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S12232]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we are debating the emergency \nsupplemental bill that deals with the request for funds for our \nmilitary, as well as for reconstruction in the country of Iraq.\n  I believe it is necessary to provide the funding that is requested \nfor our military, and I believe the President will find wide support \nfor that on the Senate floor. I believe it is also necessary for \nreconstruction to occur in Iraq. I don't disagree with that issue at \nall. However, I disagree as to where the funding should come for this \nreconstruction.\n  I agree with my colleague who talked about this being an important \ntime and that there are very important questions for the Senate to \nconfront. These are serious questions and need to be dealt with in a \nserious way. I expect this debate will be respectful, even though we \nhave some disagreements.\n  I think there is more agreement than disagreement on most of these \nquestions. I mentioned that when the President requests funding for our \nDefense Department and our soldiers who are on a mission this country \nhas asked them to undertake, we have an obligation to provide the \nnecessary funding for them to complete their mission. America cannot \nask its sons and daughters to go to war and then withhold anything that \nis necessary for them to complete their mission. That which is needed \nin the Defense Department, that which those who are commanding our \nsoldiers say they need to finish this job, we must provide and, in my \njudgment, will provide.\n  This appropriations request, however, includes not only resources for \nour military, but also resources for the reconstruction of Iraq. I want \nto talk about that for a bit because we had a long debate in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee yesterday and had several votes. The votes \nturned out to be one-vote margins. I want to talk about that.\n  First, let me say I believe that, while I have not visited Iraq, \nthere are many important and positive things happening in the country \nof Iraq. Yesterday one of my colleagues asked the question: Why are \nthose positive developments not being reported? I expect, based on \ntalking to folks who have visited there, and from Ambassador Bremer's \ntestimony, and others, including colleagues who have visited there, \nthat there are things happening in that country which are very \npositive. I agree with that. Those who ask the question ``why are they \nnot being reported'' might watch the television news in Washington, DC, \ntonight and see what is reported. What is reported is negative. It is \nnot just with what is happening in Iraq, it is what is happening \neverywhere. That is the way the business works. Turn on the television \ntonight in Washington, DC, and see what the lead story will be. It will \nbe a murder, or a kidnapping, or a robbery, or an accident. That is \njust the way it works.\n\n  That is what is happening in Iraq. The media is reporting the bad \nnews. That is what they will report tonight here in Washington, DC. \nThere is an old saying, ``bad news travels halfway around the world \nbefore good news gets its shoes on.'' Never is that manifested more \nrelentlessly than in our media. I understand that. It is not just \nhappening with Iraq.\n  But from eyewitnesses and those who have been on the ground in Iraq, \nwe know that there are positive things happening there.\n  Having said that, we cannot dismiss the fact there are some \nsignificant problems and challenges in Iraq as well. It is not ordinary \nand normal, and it is not something we should ever become accustomed \nto, to wake up in the morning and turn on the news and hear of another \nAmerican soldier who was killed, or more American soldiers wounded. \nThat is not something we can become accustomed to in this country.\n  I also believe, as I indicated, that as we consider a piece of \nlegislation with a price tag of $87 billion to support the troops and \nprovide the resources necessary for the troops and also to provide for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq, it is an appropriate and important time to \nask some questions about especially the portion dealing with \nreconstruction. That is what I focused on yesterday in the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Let me talk about this reconstruction. This is a new subject that is \noffered us by the President--reconstruction. We understood what the \nPresident planned to do with respect to the campaign called shock and \nawe, which was a military campaign, would be devastating in its \nconsequences to the Iraqi troops, but not devastating to the country of \nIraq in terms of infrastructure, because we deliberately did not target \nthe infrastructure there. We did not target their electric grid, their \npowerplants, their dams, their roads, or their bridges. We deliberately \ndid not do that and we were successful in avoiding that. So then what \nis the requirement for reconstruction?\n  The requirement for reconstruction, by and large, stems from a long-\nterm deterioration of the assets of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, No. 1; \nand No. 2, from a type of guerrilla activity by insurgents inside the \ncountry of Iraq--Iraqis themselves, among others--to destroy property \nand infrastructure in Iraq. That is what caused this administration to \nask us for nearly $21 billion to reconstruct the country of Iraq.\n  Let me say that the request for the reconstruction of Iraq is a \nrequest for grants, where we will take the money from our Treasury--or \nborrow the money, as will be the case, because we are very deeply in \ndebt in this country at this point and our annual budget deficit is \nroughly in the $475 billion range. We will borrow money to provide it \nto the Iraqis for reconstruction. Let me go back to some things and \nindicate why some of us are surprised by a request for nearly $21 \nbillion to reconstruct Iraq.\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said this on March 27 of \nthis year:\n\n       And on a rough recollection, oil revenues of that country \n     could bring in between $50 and $100 billion over the course \n     of the next two or three years. We're dealing with a country \n     that can really finance its own reconstruction, and \n     relatively soon.\n\n  Again, Mr. Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense, said just 5 months \nago:\n\n       We're dealing with a country that can really finance its \n     own reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  Richard Armitage, Assistant Secretary of State, said:\n\n       When we approach the question of Iraq, we realize here is a \n     country which has a resource. And it's obvious, it's oil. And \n     it can bring in and does bring in a certain amount of revenue \n     each year, it could--$10, $15, even $18 billion.\n\n  So this is not a broke country, first of all. He is describing the \nresources the country of Iraq has.\n  Vice President Cheney in March of this year said:\n\n       There are estimates out there.\n\n  Talking about Iraq.\n\n       It's important, though, to recognize that we've got a \n     different set of circumstances than we've had in Afghanistan. \n     In Afghanistan you've got a nation without significant \n     resources. In Iraq you've got a nation that's got the second-\n     largest oil reserves in the world, second only to Saudi \n     Arabia. It will generate billions of dollars a year in cash \n     flow if they get back to their production of roughly three \n     million barrels of oil a day, in the relatively near \n     future. And that flow of resources obviously belongs to \n     the Iraqi people and needs to be put to use by the Iraqi \n     people for the Iraqi people, and that will be one of our \n     major objectives.\n\n  That was Vice President Cheney.\n  So we have Richard Armitage, Assistant Secretary of State, saying \nIraq can be reconstructed with Iraq oil; Paul Wolfowitz, Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, saying Iraq can finance its own reconstruction; \nSecretary Rumsfeld, on March 27 of this year, said: I don't believe the \nUnited States has the responsibility for reconstruction, in a sense. \nThose funds can come from those various funds I mentioned--frozen \nassets, oil revenues, and a variety of other things, including Oil for \nFood which has a substantial number of billions of dollars in it.\n  We have the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, \nthe Assistant Secretary of State, and the Vice President.\n  Let me read quotes from Mr. Natsios who runs USAID, which is the \nagency in the State Department involved in reconstruction.\n  On April 23 on Ted Koppel's ``Nightline'' program, Ted Koppel says:\n\n       I mean, when you talk about 1.7, you're not suggesting that \n     the rebuilding of Iraq is going to be done for $1.7 billion?\n\n  Mr. Natsios, who runs this program for the administration, says:\n\n       Well, in terms of the American taxpayers' contribution, I \n     do, this is it for the U.S. The rest of the rebuilding of \n     Iraq will be done by\n\n[[Page S12233]]\n\n     other countries who already made pledges, Britain, Germany, \n     Norway, Japan, Canada, and Iraqi oil revenues . . .\n\n  Will be used eventually in several years when it is up and running \nand when a new government, democratically elected, will finish the job \nwith new revenues.\n\n       They are going to get $20 billion a year in oil revenues. \n     But the American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have \n     no plans for any further on funding for this.\n\n  This is 5 months ago from the point person in this administration \nwith respect to Iraq's reconstruction, saying $1.7 billion.\n  Ted Koppel comes back to him again on the same program and says:\n\n       You're saying the, the top cost for the U.S. taxpayer will \n     be $1.7 billion. No more than that?\n       Mr. Natsios: For the reconstruction. . . .\n       Ted Koppel: But as far as the reconstruction goes, the \n     American taxpayer will not be hit by more than $1.7 billion \n     no matter how long the process takes?\n       Mr. Natsios: That is our plan and that is our intention. \n     And these figures . . . I have to say, there's a little bit \n     of hoopla involved in this.\n\n  I guess he was referring to something else. There sure isn't a lot of \nhoopla involved in his figures.\n  Later in the program, Mr. Natsios says, responding to Ted Koppel:\n\n       That's correct, $1.7 billion is the limit on reconstruction \n     for Iraq.\n\n  That was 5 months ago from the point person on reconstruction in this \nadministration. Five months later, we are asked for $21 billion--$21 \nbillion. How did things change so quickly? Why did they change so \nquickly? Why was it decided that the obligation for the reconstruction \nof this country--not an impoverished country, I might say, a country \nwith the second largest reserves of oil in the entire world--why was it \ndecided the American taxpayers should bear this burden exclusively?\n  Ambassador Bremer testified before our Appropriations Committee. I \nasked him about this issue.\n  I said: Mr. Ambassador, Iraq has very substantial oil reserves. They \nhave liquid gold under that sand. They have the capability of pumping a \nlot of oil.\n  He said: Yes.\n  In fact, when I asked about how much they would pump, he said: By \nJuly of next year, we expect Iraq will be pumping 3 million barrels of \noil a day and, using their figures, we expect, when you take out of \nthat the amount necessary to be used in Iraq by Iraqis, the amount of \nmoney that they will sell on the export market will produce $16 billion \na year of revenue--$16 billion a year.\n  Yesterday, members of the Iraqi Governing Council were in town, and \nthey said they are going to be producing 6 million barrels of oil--\ndouble that. Let's use the more conservative figure of 3 million \nbarrels of oil produced a day by next July. This then is a country that \nhas the capability of producing $160 billion in 10 years from oil \nrevenue exports only or $320 billion in 20 years. Securitizing that oil \nproduction would be relatively easy for Iraq in order to raise the \nfunds to reconstruct what is needed to be reconstructed in Iraq.\n  I asked Ambassador Bremer, why then would you not propose that Iraqi \noil be used to reconstruct Iraq? He said: Because Iraq has substantial \nforeign indebtedness, they will not be able to encumber their oil \nrevenue; they will have to repay foreign indebtedness first.\n  I asked Ambassador Bremer to whom Iraq owed money. He said, France--I \nbelieve he said Russia first--Russia, France, Germany.\n  Following that hearing, I began to do some research on Iraq's \nindebtedness. It turns out that the largest of Iraq's creditors are \nSaudi Arabia and Kuwait. The best estimates are that Iraq owes \nsomewhere close to $25 billion to Saudi Arabia. And they owe somewhere \nclose to $25 billion to Kuwait. They owe somewhere between $20 billion \nand $30 billion to the other gulf states. They owe between $4 billion \nand $8 billion to France, $4 billion to Germany, and somewhere between \n$9 billion and $12 billion to Russia. But as one can see, the largest \ncreditors of the country of Iraq are Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n  Now, I find it strange that anyone would suggest that the debts of \nSaddam's regime must be honored, but that the current Iraqi Governing \nCouncil is not able to incur debts.\n  Some make the point that the Iraqi Governing Council has not been \ndemocratically elected. Well, does anyone think that Saddam Hussein was \nduly elected? Let's just remember the last couple of elections. In \n1995, Saddam Hussein ran for President of Iraq. He ran unopposed and \nwon 99.96 percent of the vote.\n  Out of 8 million ballots, supposedly only 3,000 people voted against \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Then in August of 2000, they had another election in Iraq and Saddam \nHussein ran again for President. He again ran unopposed. This time, the \nofficial election count was better, actually. With a 100 percent voter \nturnout, Saddam Hussein received 100 percent of the vote. That was \nactually the official count.\n  They provided no real polling booths. Voters were required to parade \ndown a gallery containing 28 portraits of Saddam Hussein. They were \nrequired to hold their ballots over their head as they walked down this \ngallery so that everyone could see how they voted. Before the election, \nthe Iraq phone company rigged their telephones so when a person picked \nup the phone to make a phone call, they heard the message that they had \na requirement to go out and vote for Saddam Hussein.\n  The fact is, there is very little tradition of democracy in Iraq, as \nwe know. The Saddam Hussein regime, which obligated the people of Iraq, \napparently, to $150 billion to $200 billion in foreign debt, was \ncertainly no more duly constituted a government than the current Iraqi \ncoalition authority or provisional authority.\n  I believe Iraq does need reconstruction funding, but I believe very \nstrongly that that ought not be the burden of the American people. I \nbelieve the result would be perverse if the American taxpayer was \nrequired to bear the burden of that $21 billion in expenditures, while \nIraq pumped its oil, sold it on the open market, and used the revenues \nto ship suitcases full of cash to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and, yes, \nRussia and France and Germany. I do not understand how anyone thinks \nthat is in our interest.\n  I will briefly describe what we are told is urgently necessary for \nreconstruction in Iraq. I think some items are urgent, some are not, in \norder to advance the Iraq economy and in order to provide the Iraq \npeople with an expanded set of opportunities and hope for the future.\n  The $21 billion includes, for example, reengineering business \npractices of the Iraq postal service, including instituting ZIP Codes. \nWell, that is not part of an urgent supplemental, in my judgment.\n  Then there is $54 million for a comprehensive consulting technical \nstudy for the Iraqi postal system. That is not urgent, in my judgment.\n  Restoring marshlands; two 4,000-bed prisons at $50,000 a bed; garbage \ntrucks at $50,000 apiece; creating best business practice and training \ncourses and opening job centers, and so on. I think some of this is \nlikely urgent, some of it not, but all of it can and should be paid for \nwith Iraqi oil.\n  I will describe how that could work and how it should work.\n  I offered an amendment in committee yesterday that would create an \nIraq Reconstruction Finance Agency. I lost that amendment by one vote. \nFollowing that, I offered a second amendment, which is a choice I do \nnot particularly favor but one that is better than a series of grants. \nThat amendment would provide that instead of grants, we extend loans.\n  Both amendments were defeated in the committee, and I will offer both \non the Senate floor as we proceed to have a debate about the \nreconstruction portion of this package.\n  The Iraqi Governing Council, I believe, has ample authority to create \nan Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority and do so in a way that \nobligates future oil revenues of Iraq through some securitization, by \nwhich they would sell securities against future oil revenues and raise \nthe money for reconstruction of Iraq. As one of my colleagues earlier \ntoday suggested, that is not in some way having the United States get \ntheir hands on Iraq oil. It is nothing of the sort. This is the people \nin Iraq making use of their resources, by securitizing their future oil \nreserves. Understand, they have the second largest reserves in the \nworld. This is not an impoverished country. They\n\n[[Page S12234]]\n\nhave dramatic and valuable resources. This is about Iraq citizens using \nIraqi oil to reconstruct the country of Iraq.\n  Why would someone choose the alternative of saying, let's have the \nAmerican taxpayer pay for the reconstruction of Iraq so that Iraq can \npump oil to pay for the past debts it owes to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait?\n\n  Ambassador Bremer told me they were not recommending the use of Iraq \noil for reconstruction because of the foreign debt that Iraq had and \nthat it had to resolve. I think it ought to be resolved this way: I \nbelieve Ambassador Bremer and the Iraq authority ought to go to the \ndonor conference and ought to be involved in bilateral and multilateral \ntalks in which they seek debt forgiveness. After all, Saddam Hussein \nshould not have been able to obligate the Iraq people and to mortgage \ntheir future. Saddam Hussein is gone. His government does not exist. \nWhy do we believe that loans from the Saudis to Iraq back in the 1980s \nought to be repaid now when those loans were made to Saddam Hussein? \nLet Saddam Hussein repay those loans, not the Iraqi people.\n  This was not a duly constituted government in the first instance. I \njust described the mechanism by which he was in power.\n  This is not a case, as my colleague earlier suggested, of just \ntreating this in a nonserious way, believing that somehow the money is \nnot needed for Iraq. I believe the military appropriations that the \nPresident has requested for our troops are related to reconstruction, \nbut I believe very strongly that much of what is requested for \nreconstruction is, A, not urgent and, B, certainly not reconstruction \nthat ought to be paid for by the American people.\n  Let me come again to this point: we were told time and time again \nthat the U.S. taxpayer would have, at most, a minimal financial burden \nin terms of reconstruction.\n  The representations to us all along, all year, have been that Iraq \noil would bear the burden for reconstruction. Vice President Cheney \nsaid on March 16 of this year--I am quoting directly:\n\n       In Iraq, you've got a nation that's got the second largest \n     oil reserves in the world, second only to Saudi Arabia. It \n     will generate billions of dollars a year in cash flow.\n\n  Ari Fleischer at the White House said:\n\n       Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country. It \n     has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people.\n\n  He is talking about Iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the \nburden for their own reconstruction.\n  Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense, said:\n\n       On a rough recollection, the oil revenues of that country \n     could bring between $50 billion to $100 billion over the \n     course of the next few years. We're dealing with a country \n     that can really finance its own reconstruction, and \n     relatively soon.\n\n  Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, on March 27, said:\n\n       I don't believe that the United States has the \n     responsibility for reconstruction, in a sense . . . And the \n     funds can come from those various sources I mentioned: frozen \n     assets, oil revenues, and a variety of other things.\n\n  The fact is, just months ago we were told by Secretary Rumsfeld, by \nDeputy Secretary Wolfowitz, by Vice President Cheney, and many others \nthat the U.S. taxpayer would not have to foot the bill.\n  We have not had anyone come to us to explain to us the reason for the \nchange.\n  We had Ambassador Bremer explain to us why he believes the proceeds \nfrom Iraqi oil are going to have to be committed to repay Iraq's \nforeign debt. Translated to the language from my hometown, it would be: \nIraqi oil should produce some revenue so the Iraqi people can pay off \nSaddam's debts to some of the richest countries in the world, Saudi \nArabia and Kuwait.\n  But nobody came forward to say, we did tell you all these things 4 or \n5 months ago, and did tell the American people and tell you in Congress \nyou are not going to have to pay for reconstruction of Iraq because \nIraqi oil is going to pay for it--no one has come forward to say, I was \nwrong then, or I have changed my mind.\n  The question is, Has the Vice President changed his mind? I am \nguessing so. Has Secretary Rumsfeld changed his mind? Has Mr. Wolfowitz \nchanged his mind? Has Mr. Armitage changed his mind?\n  I think it is important to ask the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, are we under a time limit at this point? \nCould I have explained to me the time on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 12:30 has been divided. All \ntime remains for the majority at this point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This time for debate was apparently evenly divided until \n12:30; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. What will be the circumstances of the floor this \nafternoon, could I ask the manager?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, if I might respond, the bill will be \nsubject to amendment at any time. We are hopeful there will be \namendments. Neither Senator Byrd nor I have spoken on the bill yet.\n  Once Senator Byrd has finished his comments, we will be back on the \nbill. Of course the Senator could speak at any time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I think at this time I should point out \nwhat we are doing because we have brought to the floor the President's \nemergency supplemental request for Iraq. Last evening, the President \nsigned the 2004 Defense Appropriations Committee bill. At the request \nof the Congress, specifically the Senate, the President did not include \nin that bill any funding for the war in Iraq or Afghanistan, and the \nfunding for that and the global war on terrorism is in the supplemental \nthat is before us now.\n  Many have asked for a great many things in connection with this \nsupplemental that is before us. I think it is good to review history \nbecause we have had the history studied by the Congressional Research \nService, and I am informed that no President before has asked, in \nadvance, for money to conduct a war. This President did that. He had a \nsupplemental before that carried us through fiscal year 2003. And this \nbill is theoretically to pick up on October 4 and carry forward the \nactivities in Iraq and Afghanistan and the war on global terrorism \nfollowing that time.\n  The bill does contain a substantial amount of money for the \nintelligence community, which is classified. This afternoon we will \nhold a hearing in our classified hearing room in the Capitol to explore \nsome of the ramifications of that. We have closed out the hearings we \nheld on this bill. I might say, in and of themselves, they are unique \nbecause I know of no hearing on a supplemental request of this type \nduring my time in the Senate. The request was made for hearings by my \ngood friend from West Virginia, and we have accommodated that. I know \nhe wishes we would have more hearings, but I believe we have explored \nthe proposals that have been presented to us as a Special Emergency \nSupplemental by the President, under these circumstances, as much as is \npossible because we have some time frames involved. The moneys for \ndefense activities in Iraq are in this bill. We have an enormous number \nof people involved in this activity now, and this bill asks for about \n$66 billion to continue those activities through the fiscal year of \n2004; that is, until September 30, 2004.\n  We have had presented to us, in addition to that Defense \nsupplemental, the request for $20.3 billion to carry out the activities \nof our Government in connection with the reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of Iraq during this period ahead of us. Many will ask--\ndemand that the money in this second category be strictly loans.\n  There is no government of Iraq yet. There is no one we can really \nhave obligated to repay it. We are exploring mechanisms that might be \npossible to set up ways in which a portion of the money would be \nrequired to be repaid. But the testimony before our committee was that \nthese two sums are inextricably entwined. They represent the best \neffort of the military department, our Department of Defense, and of \nour State Department and other Departments of the executive branch to \npresent to Congress an approach to try to move through the process of \nhaving an army of occupation in Iraq and move to establishing a new \nform of\n\n[[Page S12235]]\n\ngovernment in Iraq, supported by their people, and provide the security \nfor that government, provide the security for the people who will be \nrunning the oilfields, as have been mentioned here, with the power \nstations, and the schools and other activities that are still subject \nto some opposition by terrorists in Iraq.\n  I believe Ambassador Bremer and his people have presented a coherent \noutline of what we are going to do. But the demand is to know in \nadvance what is going to happen, almost on a daily basis: What are you \ngoing to do? Really, the contingencies in advance of us, now, of our \nGovernment, are unique.\n\n  If you look at Germany or look at Japan, we had a military government \nof occupation. We provided the complete security. We provided the \ncomplete government in the past when we ended the war. We did that to a \ngreat extent in other places, too, where we helped in Kosovo, Bosnia, \nand other areas. We were, for several years, involved in both of those \nareas.\n  We have been involved in this area less than a year. The proposal now \nis to carry into the next year a plan, which was presented to us in the \nSenate, in our security room, in July. Some people didn't get a copy of \nthat. That is unfortunate. But it was being presented to us during our \nhearings. That plan clearly sets forth the plan that was developed by \nAmbassador Bremer and by the State Department and our Department of \nDefense, to proceed now and not have an army in occupation, that we do \nnot want to be an occupier.\n  We want to continue our work to secure the area for the purpose of \nbuilding this new government, but we have actually had some of our \nmilitary people withdrawn from the areas of Iraq which have been \ncompletely pacified now and are normally operating. The local police \nare maintaining security. A portion of their new army is behind them, \nsecuring those areas. Still, it is a very volatile area and that is \nprimarily the area of concern.\n  It is that area that depends so much on the money that is in the \nsecond part of this bill. Ambassador Bremer personally told me a number \nof times the oil pipelines have been bombed, sabotaged. While they are \nrepairing those oil lines, the power stations have been brought back \ninto operation. As oil lines were completely restored, the power \nstations were blown up. As they are trying to bring both of them back, \nthen there are sniper activities in the Baghdad area, destabilizing the \nsituation as far as restoring tranquility in this country.\n  This is a time and a place that the forces of the United States, both \nmilitary and civilian, need guidance on a daily basis by the Commander \nin Chief and his representatives. This bill contains a sizable amount \nof money and the discretion to use that money to accomplish the \nobjectives they have set out. I, for one, endorse those objectives \nwholly because I believe they will bring our people home sooner and \nhave us have a friendly Iraq, rebuilding itself out of its oil income, \nonce we are able to stop this terrorist activity that is impeding the \nflow of oil.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned the amount of oil we were \ntold will be there next July. That is true. It will be there unless the \npipelines are blown up again. It will be there unless the power \nstations are blown up again. It takes power to run these pipelines. The \npower stations are there. They have been blown up also.\n  The problem with stability in this area is a very acute one. We have \nbeen warned of that. I think the plan they have presented, in the \njudgment of majority of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is such \nthat we should give the President's people this discretion. It is a lot \nof money. No one questions it is a lot of money. In the first place, we \nseparate the $66 billion for defense. I don't argue about that amount \nin terms of carrying forth our commitment to our men and women in \nuniform to see to it they have the supplies, the materials, the backup, \nthe rest and recreation, all of the things that are in this bill, to \nassure them we are with them and that we support them in every way \npossible to get this job done. But the main thing we want to do for \nthem is to get them home. The way to get them home is to assure that \nIraq once more can run its own affairs, defend itself, and can have \nreasonable success in dealing with terrorism. We can't eliminate \nterrorism completely from Iraq any more than we can completely \neliminate terrorism right now. We face terrorism at home. But the real \nproblem is how soon can they know they have the capability of meeting \nterrorism and trying to deal with it as they try to impede the \nreconstruction and rehabilitation of that country. We are going to have \nsome differences of opinion. There are differences really in \nphilosophy, as far as I am concerned.\n  I think we ought to listen more to the generals who are over there in \nuniform, as I have yet to hear complaints from any of the people who \nhave gone over there and who have been part of this tremendous success \nmilitarily. They report they are proud of what they have done, and they \nbelieve we are right, that we should as soon as possible have the \nIraqis run this country. That is the goal.\n  We have had this monstrous success militarily. Normally, any country \nbefore in history has sent in an occupation force, set up a government, \ntried to find out who should be the new leaders of the government, \nworked with them for a number of years, and then eventually withdrawn \ntheir forces. Of course, as I think the world knows, we have yet to \nwithdraw all of our forces from Europe from World War II. They started \nand became part of a permanent force over there almost, although I do \nthink we ought to reexamine that, and we will in the near future. The \nfuture for this area is not to have an occupation force. We still have \nforces in Kosovo and we still have forces in Bosnia. That is not the \ngoal of this activity. The goal of this activity is to liberate Iraq \nand give it the ability to restore its government under a concept of \nfree men and women determining their own future.\n  That means to me that we respond to the request of the President of \nthe United States and give his people the discretion to use this money \nto the extent it is necessary.\n  I believe it is now time that we call up the bill. Is it pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I would like to address my friend. I \ndon't believe we need control of time now, if the Senator agrees. I \nwill finish my remarks and then yield to Senator Byrd, if that is \nagreeable. Is there any pending motion which I should make?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is none.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I will close.\n  It is my hope the Senate will also realize the request we have made--\nI have made it to the leadership on both sides--to take the defense \nportion of this bill first. The House has not acted upon this bill yet. \nWe will go on recess on Friday. While we are gone, the House will act \non it. It is my opinion that the House should know how we feel about \nthe defense side, the $66 billion. We should await their action on the \n$20.3 billion.\n  That is to me sort of a division of labor, you might say. We have \nworked very hard on the defense side of the bill. I believe we have a \ngeneral agreement of where we are going to come out with it. We \npresented what we call the chairman's mark in the bill that is before \nthe Senate today. It will be subject to some amendments. I hope Members \nwill cooperate by looking at that portion of the bill first. We will \ndeal with the $20.3 billion when we believe we have completed that \nreview.\n  I would like to be able to tell the House that we have finished the \ndefense portion and we await your consideration of what you think we \nshould do with the $20.3 billion. They have had some substantial \nhearings on that side, too. The House held hearings on both portions of \nthis request from the President.\n  I believe this is a new approach to funding this kind of an \noperation. It is a new operation. We would be wise to proceed, and when \nwe come back from our recess to have before us then the House bill, to \nlook at what the House bill has done and present our portion of the \nbill pertaining to the $20.3 billion. Some people may disagree, and \nsome people think we should separate the bill--I know there is that \nfeeling--and delete from the consideration anything that is not \nstrictly defense. I disagree with that.\n  General Abizaid, who is our commander in chief there in the region,\n\n[[Page S12236]]\n\nstated very clearly that he needs both portions of this bill. If we \ndon't have the money for the people of Iraq to proceed to establish \ntheir own security, their own military, and deal with their own \nreconstruction problems immediately, we will need more money to send \nmore troops in there to protect ourselves and to protect the Iraqis. \nThis is a transitional phase which we have in the $20.3 billion. As I \nhave said publicly, it is risky. The President has taken a great risk. \nThere are terrorists loose there. We have to remember Saddam Hussein \nlet loose all of the prisoners from the jails--all of them. He opened \nthe borders of Iraq to terrorists. Those are the people now who are \nraising havoc in that country. Many of them have been apprehended, but \nmany are still at large. The $20.3 billion is aimed at providing a \nsecurity base for the Iraqi government to come into being, to deal with \nsecurity, to deal with antiterrorism, and to deal with restoring the \nproductive capacity of their major resource; that is, the oil.\n  If it is successful, as has been indicated, by July, we will probably \nsee that Iraq could produce oil somewhere near 3 million barrels a day.\n  I say parenthetically, Madam President, that in our State, we have \nproduced about 2.1 million barrels a day in the past. We don't produce \nthat now because of the obstruction against us in terms of going into \nareas where we know we could obtain oil to restore the daily output of \nour production facilities. We could be back up to 2.1 million barrels a \nday very quickly, too. The Iraqis are predicted to have even more \nreserves. I am not sure this is the case. They might get up as high as \n6 million barrels a day. I hope for the sake of the world they do. But \nI am reminded of the fact that when we first started producing oil from \nPrudhoe Bay in Alaska, the estimate was we had approximately 1 billion \nbarrels of oil. This last year, as the occupant of the Chair knows, we \nproduced our 14th billion barrel of oil. Estimates are estimates. \nSometimes they are high and sometimes they are low. But the estimates \nare that Iraq will be a major producer in the future. I hope that is so \nbecause they will have a stable government. They will have a free \ngovernment. They will have the ability to determine their own future.\n\n  We have a chance to explain to them how we treat some of our oil \nincome and how we have created our permanent fund that produces income \nfor every person in Alaska once a year--the shareholders of public \ndevelopment of resources. Prudhoe Bay oil is produced from State lands. \nThe oil in Iraq is produced from the Iraqi-owned government and Iraqi \ngovernment land. They have a rosy future if they wisely manage their \nmoney as they reconstruct their country, and if they have some concept \nof trying to save part of it and use the earnings to benefit all of \ntheir people. That is what we have done in Alaska. It has been very \nsuccessful. I hope they will be able to do that.\n  The problem right now is how we get from where we are with \nsubstantial force. They are still subject to severe security \nrequirements because of the terrorism. Should we put in more \nantiterrorist people of the United States in uniform, or from our \nintelligence services, or should we help the Iraqis get to the point \nwhere they can feel they can start to protect themselves, particularly \nin the areas of the remaining intensity of terrorists?\n  This bill should pass. We should give the President's people the \ngreatest flexibility possible, much more than we have in the past, \nbecause it is for a short period of time. It is for the remainder of \nfiscal year 2004, for the period of time after the bill becomes law, \nsometime in October, until the following September. We will know during \nthat period whether their approach will succeed.\n  One thing is very clear: this Congress will not walk away from Iraq. \nThis President will not walk away from Iraq. We will not withdraw our \npeople from Iraq and leave chaos in Iraq. Clearly, we have the \nobligation to finish what we started. This is the plan to finish what \nwe started.\n  Some people want a roadmap, a daily report, with every single aspect \nof what is going on, producing another request for another report. Do \nyou know what happens to the reports? They get filed in some filing \ncabinet somewhere, some computer, and no one pays any attention to \nthem.\n  I will oppose a great many of these reports because we have provided \nin the bill for quarterly reports, we provided in the bill for \ncontinuation of the reports requested in the supplemental for 2003. \nThat is sufficient. To my knowledge, no one raised an objection to what \nwe received so far. I don't know why we should add to that number of \nreports we require from the people who represent us in both military \nand civilian agencies in Iraq.\n  I look forward to debate. It has been strenuous so far. I expect it \nto get a little more strenuous. Clearly, it is a turning point in the \nhistory of the United States. We have followed the pattern of the \nCaesars. We have gone in and been a liberator and then occupied area \nand stayed there. Look at Germany, how long we stayed there, and Japan, \nhow long we stayed there: 4 years after the war was over in Japan. Do \nwe want to do that in Iraq? We believe we can reduce that time our \nmilitary people are there if we follow the proposals before the Senate \nfrom Ambassador Bremer who funnels both the recommendations of the \nState Department and the Department of Defense to the Congress through \nthe President's request in the supplemental.\n  I remind Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee there will be \na hearing in S. 407 at 5 p.m. and we do expect amendments to be \noffered. I hope there will be an opportunity to have a vote on some of \nthem today although that may not be possible. The President of the \nUnited States is signing the Homeland Security bill within an hour to \nhour and a half. Many of the Members of Congress have been invited to \nbe present. It is my intention to ask the Senate to withhold voting \nwhile they are gone. They are at the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We expect to have a vote sometime around 3:30, between that \nand the time of our hearing in S. 407. We would not object to a vote \nduring that hearing. We are just right upstairs. From 5 p.m. we will be \nin the hearing. I will not request we have no votes during that time.\n  We will not have votes too late because we have an understanding with \nour colleagues from the Democratic Party who have an event tonight that \nwe have agreed we will not have votes during the time they are at that \ndinner.\n  Again, I am asking people to come forward and offer amendments. I \nurge Members to present amendments to the defense side first, if at all \npossible. We are prepared, however, for any amendments offered.\n  I yield to my friend from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the Senate today takes up the President's \n$87 billion Iraq war supplemental. This is a massive spending bill that \nholds vast implications for America's long-term foreign policy \nobjective. It will have an enormous impact on American taxpayers for \nyears to come.\n  It is a measure that deserves our full attention, our thoughtful \nconsideration, our thorough scrutiny. This is not an issue to be \nmeasured by the standard of party loyalty. This is a matter that cries \nout for solemn deliberation, personal integrity, and intellectual \nhonesty.\n  I remain concerned that the Senate is acting with unnecessary haste \nin calling up this bill today, less than 24 hours since it was reported \nout of the committee, but I compliment the leaders and especially the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for \nresponding to concerns that I and other Senators have raised. In fact, \nthere is no need for the Senate to act too quickly. The House has not \nyet even taken up its version of the supplemental. While it is not a \nconstitutional requirement the House act first, it has been customary \nfor many years that the House of Representatives act first. It is \nsmoother and more thorough. It is more reasonable to go about \nlegislating if the Senate lets the House act first so the House bill \ncan be before Senators for their debate and amendment.\n  The House has not taken up its version of the supplemental. Senators \nare being asked to legislate on this massive spending bill without the \nbenefit of a committee report, without the benefit of printed committee \nhearing, without the benefit of the input by other committees such as \nthe Armed\n\n[[Page S12237]]\n\nServices Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The Senate ought to have the printed hearings of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. We ought to have the printed \nhearings containing the testimony of Ambassador Bremer, containing the \ntestimony of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, containing the testimony of \nother witnesses. Why do we spend all of our time in Senate hearings if \nwe do not intend to make those printed hearings available to our \ncolleagues and to ourselves as we go forward with Senate debate? That \nis one of the tremendous benefits in having hearings so that they will \nbe printed. Why have them? Because they will be printed then, for our \ncolleagues to scrutinize and to help bring back memories of those \nMembers on the Senate Appropriations Committee as to what the testimony \nwas, what the answers were to the questions that were asked.\n\n  But here we have been rushed. We have had hearings--some hearings. I \nasked for more hearings, more than once, more than twice. Several times \nI asked for more hearings. But even with the hearings that we had, we \ndo not have printed copies of hearings before us.\n  No, there has been a rush, a mad rush to move forward on this bill. \nThere was some talk about even having the final action on the bill by \nthe end of this week. Fortunately, with the aid of the distinguished \nchairman, and others, that press for action by the end of this week is \nno longer upon us. That was an unreasonable expectation. It did not \nmeasure up to common sense. And it certainly was not the best thing. \nFortunately, that is no longer the goal of the party in control here.\n  There are many aspects of this bill that trouble me, but what \nconcerns me as much as anything else, or perhaps most, is the \nfundamental reason that this measure is before the Senate today. \nAmerican taxpayers have been presented with an $87 billion bill for the \nmilitary occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. That is a big, big \nbill--$87 billion. That is $87 for every minute since Jesus Christ was \nborn, $87 for every minute since the water was changed into wine, $87 \nfor every minute since Jesus Christ was born.\n  That is a lot of money. That is more than $3,000 for every Iraqi man, \nwoman, boy, and girl. Now, think about that. The taxpayers are being \nasked--the taxpayers of this country are being asked--to shell out more \nthan $3,000 for every Iraqi man, woman, boy, and girl. That is what \nthis bill does.\n  There are roughly 25 million, we will say, Iraqis. One thousand \ndollars per each Iraqi is $25 billion. Pretty easy to compute. So $75 \nbillion would be $3,000 per every Iraqi. And $87 billion is roughly, \nlet's say, $3,500 for every Iraqi--every man, woman, boy, and girl.\n  Now, this is $87 billion on top of the $79 billion which was \nappropriated in the fiscal year 2003 supplemental passed by the Senate \nin April of this year.\n  We are putting upon the American taxpayers a load. This \nadministration, in this bill that we are being asked to pass, is asking \nthe American taxpayers to shell out--in this bill--over $3,000 per \nIraqi man, woman, boy, and girl, on top of the $79 billion in the \nfiscal year 2003 supplemental.\n  So when you add both of these together, this year we will have--if we \npass this bill hook, line, and sinker--we will, in the Senate, have \npassed legislation requiring the American taxpayers to shell out $6,600 \nper Iraqi--$6,600 per Iraqi.\n  Well, the American taxpayers have been presented with an $87 billion \nbill for the military occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. Why? \nBecause the President decided 6 months ago to launch a preemptive \nstrike on Iraq in the face of very shaky evidence and worldwide \nopposition--strong worldwide opposition.\n  We have seen the lengths to which some in this administration will \ngo. Now we learn of retribution efforts aimed at those who tried to \ncorrect the zealous propaganda which drove this Nation into war. Now \nthe taxpayer is asked to pay the piper--pay the piper. It is a steep \nprice, indeed, in treasure and in blood.\n  Much has been made of the fact that we must pass this bill quickly \nand without question to show our support for the troops. I do not \nagree. ``Support the Troops'' is a bumper sticker. ``Support the \nTroops'' is a bumper sticker, a bumper sticker. That is what it is: \n``Support the Troops''--a bumper sticker. It is not a foreign policy.\n  Rubberstamping this bill is not--N-O-T--an expression of support for \nour troops except in the most simplistic of ways. Rubberstamping this \nbill merely means that thousands of American soldiers will be sentenced \nto another year in Iraq, without the Senate even demanding to know why \nso many United States soldiers need to remain there, how long they are \ngoing to be there, or why this President has failed to persuade more \nnations to send troops to help.\n  Are we to ask our troops to shoulder this burden alone for another \nyear? Are we to ask our troops to shoulder this burden alone for years \nto come? When is this administration going to face the fact that we \nneed international help? We want to help our troops. Let's get other \nnations to send their troops there and, thus, help our troops and help \nus to bring our troops home. We are certainly not serving the long-term \ninterests of the military by rushing to embrace this bill.\n\n  The headline in yesterday's USA Today newspaper sums up the situation \nsuccinctly: ``Army Reserve Fears Troop Exodus.'' That was the headline: \n``Army Reserve Fears Troop Exodus.'' According to the article in \nyesterday's USA Today, the chief of the Army Reserves is concerned that \nthe excessive demands on the Guard and Reserves as a result of the war \nin Iraq could wreak havoc on military retention rates. That is a \nserious matter.\n  Last week, another report documented a sharp drop in National Guard \nrecruiting rates. The military decisions this administration is making \nin Iraq today will have serious long-term consequences on the viability \nof America's All-Volunteer Armed Forces in the future, not to mention \nour ability to counter future threats to our own national security.\n  It is time to face these facts. We are stretched thin. We are \nstretched thin, and a long United States occupation in Iraq is not \nwise. Moreover, how are we to exercise proper oversight of $87 billion?\n  The Wall Street Journal of September 26 states:\n\n       Without a United Nations imprimatur, the Administration has \n     constructed its so-called coalition of the willing in \n     piecemeal fashion, cutting open-ended, individual deals with \n     each country that is willing to send troops--save Britain, \n     which is picking up its own tab. Officials who have seen \n     these agreements acknowledge the deals are notably short on \n     specifics. In most cases, the U.S. will foot the bill for \n     transporting, equipping and feeding troops during their \n     service in Iraq, with no dollar figures mentioned and no cap \n     on costs.\n\n  It is not in our Nation's interest to rush this bill through the \nSenate. By rushing to war based on inadequate, incorrect, or \nunsubstantiated intelligence, without developing an international \nconsensus, President Bush has undermined the credibility of our Nation. \nWe need to make sure we do not compound that error by hustling this \nbill through the Senate without adequate scrutiny and consideration.\n  The $20.3 billion contained in the spending bill for Iraq \nreconstruction is equally troubling. For months, top administration \nofficials assured the American people that Iraq, sitting atop the \nsecond--and possibly the largest--supply of oil in the world, could \nfinance its own reconstruction. Only now do we learn how woefully off \nthe mark the administration was on this count. Only now do we learn \nthat $20.3 billion is just a downpayment--hear me out there--just a \ndownpayment, and that the reconstruction of Iraq will cost as much as \n$60 or $70 billion or more.\n  Last week, Ambassador Paul Bremer, the head of the Coalition \nProvisional Authority in Iraq, told the Senate Appropriations Committee \nthat Iraq could not finance its own reconstruction because it was \noverburdened with Saddam Hussein's debts to France, Germany, Russia, \nJapan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. Ambassador Bremer conveniently ignored \nthe debt the United States is incurring in this spending package. The \ndebt the United States is incurring, the additional burden that will be \nbrought to bear upon the American taxpayer by this legislation, \nAmbassador Bremer ignored that.\n  The President is insisting we pay for the war in Iraq and the \nreconstruction\n\n[[Page S12238]]\n\nof that nation by plunging our own country deeper into debt. Every \ndollar we spend in Iraq to avoid increasing Iraq's debt is an IOU we \nare passing on to our children. Think of it. We are writing a $20.3 \nbillion IOU for this year alone for building a massive new \ninfrastructure in Iraq.\n\n  The money the President wants to borrow for Iraq will come directly \nout of American taxpayers' wallets in the form of Medicare and Social \nSecurity surplus receipts. That is your money. We have collected that \nmoney from the pockets of American workers, the American workers who \ngave their sweat in the factories, in the mines, in the fields, on the \noceans--the American workers. No one told them they were paying to \nrebuild Iraq. We don't even know how much of the $20 billion in \nreconstruction funds will flow to government contractors in Iraq. \nEstimates range from one-third of the reconstruction funds to almost \nall of them. Whatever the amount is, we know that the size and the \nscope of the profits being made will be enormous.\n  Former Bush administration officials are even setting up consulting \nfirms. Listen to that. Former Bush administration officials are even \nsetting up consulting firms to act as middlemen for contractors hoping \nto take part in the Iraq bonanza. Are we turning the U.S. Treasury into \na grab bag for favorite campaign contributors to be financed at \ntaxpayer expense? Is that why the administration is so reluctant to \nmake concessions that would bring other countries on board?\n  Instead of redoubling our efforts to spread the burden of rebuilding \nIraq among the international community, the President appears content \nto simply present the bill to the American taxpayers, and to their \nchildren.\n  The stability of Iraq is of concern to nations other than the United \nStates. Could they be resisting helping out because they resent the \nPresident's highhanded decision to spurn the United Nations and attack \nIraq on his own terms with only meager international support?\n  There is a donors conference in Madrid later this month. Could we be \noverbilling the American taxpayers by rushing this package through the \nSenate now and signing up for $20.3 billion in debt before we even try \nto make the real accommodations which would encourage other nations to \nreach into their own pockets?\n  The package before the Senate goes far beyond asking the Senate to \nwrite a check on the taxpayers' account for $87 billion. The package \nbefore us asks the Senate to underwrite the long-term democratization \nof Iraq as some sort of catalyst for triggering the democratization of \nthe entire Middle East. One cannot help but wonder how the United \nStates can single-handedly precipitate the democratization of the \nentire Middle East when, with all our will and all our might, we cannot \neven budge the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process. How are we \ngoing to do it? Where is the muscle?\n  I expect there will be a number of amendments offered to this \nsupplemental package. I have several I intend to offer. If they are \nadopted, they will, in my opinion, improve this bill. Whether they will \nimprove it enough to win my endorsement remains to be seen.\n  I was opposed to the President's war in Iraq before it began. I am \nstrongly opposed to the doctrine of preemption on which the war in Iraq \nwas predicated--the doctrine of preemption, unilateralism, preemption, \nstrike-first, invade first.\n  I support unconditionally the men and the women in uniform and their \nfamilies--they are bearing the most direct burden of the war in Iraq--\nbut I remain unconvinced that this bill is the best way to offer those \ntroops our support. I, frankly, think our most meaningful support would \nbe to take the diplomatic steps needed to get help from other nations \nwhich will result in getting our troops out of the quicksands of Iraq. \nThat is the way to support the troops. Get other nations in. This bill \ndoes not do that.\n  This bill, in my opinion, sets the United States up for what could \nwell be a prolonged military and financial investment in Iraq. It \nignores the hard realities of democratization of totally different \ncultures. It ignores the religious divisions which inflame the Middle \nEast.\n  Again, I thank Senator Stevens for his willingness to accommodate me \nand others who have expressed concerns with this bill. I appreciate the \ndifficult conditions under which he is working. I look forward to a \nfull and robust debate. I encourage all Senators to focus closely on \nthis bill, listen carefully to the debate, and draw their own \nconclusions in the fullness of time based on a dispassionate evaluation \nof the merits of individual amendments.\n  I will have more to say at a later time. For now, I ask my colleagues \nto consider carefully the implications of the policies implied in the \nfunding of the bill before us and to give this measure the full time \nand attention it deserves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have a Senator who is on the way now \nto offer an amendment. I will be happy to receive that.\n  In response to my good friend, our senior Member of the Senate, I \nunderstand his position fully and I appreciate that he understands \nmine.\n  Having been involved in my lifetime in service overseas, I have, \nsince I have been in the Senate, traveled many places in the world to \ntalk to our men and women in uniform. I find that today's group of \nyoung men and women who represent us in our military service are the \nfinest I have ever known. I think the job they did in Iraq was \noutstanding.\n  I have been privileged to read a whole series of letters that have \nbeen written to families by those young men and women. As I have said \nbefore today, I have not seen one that indicated any doubt about the \nwork they have done or lack of any sense of real commitment to that \njob. They have just been really tremendous letters.\n  It is a different experience to go overseas now and visit these \npeople. They have the Internet. They have tents or buildings where they \ncan literally attend college during part of their days. They have \ntelephone service. They have mail service quite frequently--I am sure \nnot as frequently as they would like.\n  Going back to my day, I didn't have a telephone call from the time I \nleft home until the time I got back to Hawaii, having spent the better \npart of 2 years roaming the world. We didn't have the Internet, \nobviously. We didn't have much mail. Yet we came back with the belief \nthat what we had done was the right thing.\n  I think these people, when they come home, will tell us that. I think \nthe world will see a new generation of Americans, a different group, \neducated in a new age, in terms of war, knowing what they are capable \nof and knowing the horrors of war.\n  The impact of those people in the future is going to have a great \ndeal to do with our foreign policy. I do believe they know now what it \ntakes to follow on after a war. I can tell you, since I was coming \nhome, I am sure most people from my generation would say the same \nthing: We didn't think about who was going to rule Germany, or we \ndidn't think about terrorists in Germany or who was going to run Japan; \nwe knew the military was going to do it. They were sending military \nreplacements at the time.\n  This is not that world. This is a different world now. Those kids of \nours are going to come home when we have replaced them with Iraqis who \nare capable of defending themselves. We are going to move into that \nage, a rapid reconstruction of that country. This is the way to do it.\n  It is a lot of money, no question about it. But the supplemental we \nput up before was primarily for defense. Two-thirds of this money is \nfor defense. I don't know any argument about really the total amount of \nthis. We didn't have arguments in terms of providing for our men and \nwomen who were dispatched to win the war. The problem is too often \npeople talking about the whole amount as being the whole amount for \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  That is not true. The major portion of our spending has been because \nwe rely upon a volunteer Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast \nGuard. We have promised them we will go to every degree to support \nthem, to provide them their needs, to see their families are cared for, \nand particularly to give them the kind of weaponry which will permit \nthem to survive.\n\n[[Page S12239]]\n\n  As I said in the committee and before the press, in World War I, \nmanpower was expendable. In World War II, manpower was expendable. Even \nin Korea, manpower was expendable. We do not do that now. We do not \nhave that philosophy as a Government, as a people. We put people in the \nfield to win wars and come home at tremendous cost. We pay that cost, \nand this bill is for that cost--$66 billion for defense expenditures.\n  I don't expect to hear too many questions about those defense \nexpenditures because they are necessary to maintain this force. History \nwill show it is probably the most superb military operation in history, \nkeeping in mind how it had to be changed when we no longer could use \nTurkey for access to the northern part of Iraq, the way it shifted, the \ncommand worked--I think the commanders have been sheer military \ngeniuses, and they have done a good job under Secretary Rumsfeld. I \nbelieve we should support them, we should take them further, and we \nshould do our best to make certain everything we do is designed to do \none thing: to bring those people home; to give them a chance to come \nhome and tell us what they did and, above all, not going into a period \nof military occupation of this country.\n  That was not our mission, and I do believe the American people, once \nthey realize what we are doing, will understand why it costs money to \nfight wars the way we fought this one and to fight for the peace with \nthis supplemental money when it is provided to the administration.\n  I am informed the Senator who was going to come to the Chamber will \nnot come for another 25 minutes.\n  I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Illinois wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I am happy to come \nto the floor and speak on the bill which we considered yesterday in the \nAppropriations Committee, and that is the administration's request for \n$87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  First, there are items in this bill which I think are very valuable. \nWe were all shocked to learn the Department of Defense had a policy \nwhich required those soldiers who were gravely injured and returned to \nthe United States for medical treatment would be charged on a per diem, \ndaily basis for the food they ate at the hospital.\n  It is my understanding this bill, among other things, eliminates that \nrequirement. Thank goodness. I cannot believe it existed, and it is \ncertainly unconscionable that men and women who have been gravely \ninjured and are going through medical treatment and rehabilitation \nwould be charged extra for the food they are served. I am glad that \nrequirement is removed.\n  I also salute my chairman, Senator Stevens from Alaska, for stopping \nthe administration from changing compensation for the military which \nwould have created a very great inequity and a disservice for so many \nactive soldiers and activated guardsmen and reservists who are assigned \nto locations other than Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The administration proposal originally would have resulted in the \nfamily separation allowance--the money which we would give them so \nfamilies can get through this tough time--being eliminated for those \nserving outside of the Iraq and Afghan theaters. This bill changes that \nprovision. So two Department of Defense policies which did not help our \nsoldiers and, in fact, I think were unfair to them, have been corrected \nby this bill. I salute the chairman and members of the committee for \njoining in making certain that happened.\n  Let me also add, this bill includes about $67 billion for the \nmaintenance of our military in Iraq and Afghanistan. I totally support \nthat effort. I came to the floor last October and voted against the \nuse-of-force resolution, but I feel today, as I did shortly thereafter, \nthat with the beginning of the hostilities, that vote, frankly, should \nbe set aside and we should focus on making certain the men and women \nserving this country have everything they need to not only accomplish \ntheir missions but come home safely. The request from the \nadministration for some $67 billion for that purpose is money that I \nthink should be made available through this Congress, and I totally \nendorse it.\n  Of course, there is another portion of this bill, and that other \nportion relates to the so-called reconstruction of Iraq. That, of \ncourse, raises other questions, questions which I don't believe have \nbeen adequately addressed by this Congress.\n  It strikes me as unusual that we are pushing through this $87 billion \nsupplemental appropriations bill on such an expedited schedule that we \nhave not taken the time to ask the hard questions. Keep in mind the $87 \nbillion included in this bill is a sum total of taxpayer spending over \nand above the total we spend each year on Federal aid to education and \nforeign aid. So we are putting in this one bill $87 billion and \nbringing it for consideration by the Senate in a matter of days, when \nthese other items--foreign aid and education--take weeks and months of \nreview and preparation before they come to the floor.\n\n  Of course, Senator Byrd has led our side in asking the question: Why \ndo we have to do this with such an abbreviated schedule where we don't \ntake the time to ask the hard questions? When Ambassador Bremer, who \nserves our country in Iraq at this time, came to speak before the \nSenators' luncheon 2 weeks ago, I asked him a series of questions about \nthe reconstruction effort.\n  The first question I asked him was this: If we didn't appropriate a \npenny, if we didn't give you anything, when would you run out of money \nfor the reconstruction effort?\n  He said: December 1, maybe January 1, but somewhere in that range.\n  Clearly, a matter of a week or more to ask hard questions about the \nreconstruction of Iraq would not create any disadvantage to the efforts \nof Ambassador Bremer and the efforts on the ground in Iraq. But the \nadministration, the White House, is hellbent on moving this \nappropriations bill through as quickly as possible.\n  I went on to ask Ambassador Bremer: If we are putting $20 billion \ninto the reconstruction of Iraq, what is the total cost? What would be \nthe total commitment necessary for us to reconstruct Iraq as you see \nit? I asked him this question 2 weeks ago.\n  He said: $60 billion is the total cost. That is the estimate given to \nus by the World Bank, $60 billion.\n  I said: The difference, obviously, of $40 billion is unresolved at \nthis moment. Where will it come from?\n  Ambassador Bremer told us it would come from donor countries that \nwould give money to this effort to rebuild Iraq.\n  I have to tell you in all candor, as I said to him, all of the \ncoalition of the willing, all of the countries in the world have \npledged less than $2 billion. Where are you going to find the \nremainder?\n  He said we have to work on that.\n  Again, we find the Bush administration without a real plan and a real \nbudget for the reconstruction of Iraq. I said to Ambassador Bremer at \nthis point: Can you give me your word and the word of this \nadministration that you will not come back to us and ask for more money \nthan the $20 billion being requested for reconstruction in this \nappropriations?\n  He said: That's it, $20 billion; that's it. That is all the United \nStates needs to come up with.\n  It doesn't add up. You can't put together $20 billion in this bill, \n$2 billion for the rest of the world and total $60 billion. This could \nbe a bait-and-switch situation, and I think Senator Byrd has raised \nthat point. Once we have invested the first $20 billion, are we likely \nto leave? The next argument would be: Come on, you don't want to stop. \nYou can't change horses in midstream. Let's finish it out. Let's finish \nthe job, which means more demands on the American people.\n  I hope you understand the skepticism that many of us bring to this \ndebate is based primarily on actual statements made by the Bush \nadministration about the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Do my colleagues recall last year, when economic adviser at the White \nHouse Lawrence Lindsey, on September 15, said he estimated that the \ncost of the war, military and reconstruction, would be between $100 \nbillion and $200 billion? Remember when he said that? As a result of \nthat statement, he was admonished by Mitch Daniels, then Budget \nDirector, who said:\n\n\n[[Page S12240]]\n\n\n       $100 billion to $200 billion is likely very, very high, if \n     it's meant to apply to the cost to taxpayers.\n\n  So Mitch Daniels was sent out to admonish Larry Lindsey to not use \nfigures like $100 billion to $200 billion.\n  I would ask Senator Byrd: If I am not mistaken, did we not first \nappropriate $79 billion in a supplemental appropriation for Iraq and \nnow we are coming back with the second supplemental request of $87 \nbillion and more to follow? Are we not talking already over $160 \nbillion that is being spent through these supplemental appropriations?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. In response to the Senator, if I may say, the first action \nby the Senate was in April of this year when the Congress passed the \n2003 supplemental appropriations bill. That appropriated $79 billion. \nThe Senate is now being asked to enact an $87 billion 2004 supplemental \nappropriation. That is before the Senate today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At the moment, the sum total of those bills, if I am not \nmistaken, if this turns out to be $87 billion, is somewhere in the \nrange of $166 billion?\n  Mr. BYRD. It is indeed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator, our Democratic leader and ranking \nmember on the Appropriations Committee, because it turns out that \nLawrence Lindsey was right. He said it was going to cost about $100 \nbillion to $200 billion. He lost his job over that statement. He was \nasked to leave the administration.\n  Mitch Daniels, then Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nwas quoted on December 31, 2002, in the New York Times, as having said \nthen:\n\n       The administration's top budget official estimated today \n     that the cost of a war with Iraq could be in the range of $50 \n     billion to $60 billion.\n\n  Well, we have blown past that, clearly. As I have noted, we are at \n$166 billion and counting. The ultimate cost of reconstruction, if it \nis $60 billion, means another $40 billion has to be found, and there \nare not many coalition donors willing to step forward with real money, \nand that is the reality.\n  The other thing that troubles many of us is that this administration, \nin justifying the invasion of Iraq, said many things. They said, No. 1, \nSaddam Hussein is a tyrant who should be replaced. No one argued with \nthat. Everyone agreed. He was a dictator who was cruel to his own \npeople, a threat to the region, and potentially a threat beyond. But \nthen when they started building the case of why we had to do it \nquickly, before we built a coalition of support, before we brought in \nthe United Nations behind us, the administration said we cannot wait; \nwe have to go it alone; we have to create our own coalition; we have to \ngo outside the United Nations for the following reasons: First, they \nsaid Saddam Hussein is developing nuclear weapons. Well, guess what. \nThere is no evidence of that. That was the first thing they told us was \nthe reason for the urgency, to get in there and stop the development of \nthese nuclear weapons. Here we are more than 5 months after the end of \nmilitary hostilities with no evidence whatsoever. In fact, the \nstatements by the President about this uranium, this yellowcake, coming \nin from Africa to Iraq, that he made in his State of the Union Address, \nhe has had to say within the last few weeks were just wrong; that \nevidence was not there. There was no reason to make that statement.\n\n  Then they went on to say there is immediacy for this invasion because \nof the chemical and biological weapons. In fact, it has now been \ndeclassified that we had identified 550 suspected sites of weapons of \nmass destruction, chemical and biological weapons, in Iraq. We are 5 \nmonths after the fact, and after thousands of our inspectors have \ncombed all of those sites and others, they have come up empty. Now, Mr. \nKay may find some evidence of something, but in the 550 sites of \nweapons of mass destruction they just were not discovered.\n  Then there was the argument that not only did they have those weapons \nbut they could launch them in 45 minutes--the word ``launch'' was \nused--as a threat to the region, as a threat to the United States. That \nwas repeated by Prime Minister Tony Blair as well as this \nadministration, and in fact there is no evidence whatsoever that is the \ncase.\n  Then the argument was made, wait a minute, keep in mind that Saddam \nHussein was part of this grand terrorist conspiracy that struck the \nUnited States on September 11, 2001, in concert with al-Qaida. Just 2 \nweeks ago, the President had to come forward, after Vice President \nCheney had said something very similar, and correct the record and say, \nno, we have no evidence of linkage between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. \nSo here we have a case that is being built for the invasion of Iraq \nwithout a coalition that is global, without the support of the United \nNations, and we find that the rationale, the arguments for it, have all \nbroken down and fallen apart.\n  Others raised the question at the time, well, after we win in Iraq, \nafter we have deposed Saddam Hussein, they asked President Bush and his \nadministration, how will we rebuild it? What is the future of Iraq? And \nthat is where the statements started pouring out that are relevant to \nthis debate.\n  Vice President Cheney on ``Meet the Press,'' March 16, 2003:\n\n       In Iraq, you've got a nation that's got the second-largest \n     oil reserves in the world, second only to Saudi Arabia. It \n     will generate billions of dollars a year in cash flow if they \n     get back to their production of roughly three million barrels \n     of oil a day. . . .\n\n  That was Vice President Cheney pointing to the oil reserves of Iraq \nas the way they will rebuild their nation.\n  Paul Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Defense, the \nman who is credited with being the architect of this Iraq strategy, the \nman who was pushing harder than most for the invasion of Iraq even if \nthe United States had to go it alone, stated on March 27, 2003, when \nasked about the cost of reconstruction:\n\n       And on a rough recollection, the oil revenues of that \n     country could bring between $50 and $100 billion over the \n     course of the next two or three years. . . . We're dealing \n     with a country that can really finance its own \n     reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  Six months ago, the leaders in this administration were telling the \nAmerican people they would not have to bear this burden; the Iraqis \nwith their oil revenues will be the ones to bear the burden.\n\n  Quoting Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld from March 27, 2003:\n\n       I don't believe that the United States has the \n     responsibility for reconstruction, in a sense. . . . And the \n     funds can come from those various sources I mentioned: frozen \n     assets, oil revenues and a variety of other things, including \n     the Oil for Food, which has a very substantial number of \n     billions of dollars in it.\n\n  So here we have the leaders in the administration who were \ncategorical in saying that this day would never come, that we would not \nbe on the Senate floor saying to the American people we need billions \nof dollars for Iraq, saying to the American people we need to add to \nthe deficit of this Nation at the expense of spending for America's \nschools and America's health care, saying that we need to add to our \nNation's deficit and money being taken out of the Social Security trust \nfund. The administration told us time and time again this day would \nnever come. Yet here we are a few days after, 2 weeks after, and the \nPresident tells us this is the only way we can end our commitment to \nIraq, the only way we can bring the troops home, to spend literally \nbillions of dollars for the reconstruction of this nation.\n  Let me give one other quote from USAID Administration Natsios. He \nworks in the Department of State. Mr. Natsios is responsible for the \nagency that does reconstruction, redevelopment, and rebuilding around \nthe world. That is what that agency does.\n  The date is April 23 of this year, 6 months ago. He appeared on \n``Nightline'' with Ted Koppel. Ted Koppel said to him:\n\n       I think you'll agree, this is a much bigger project--\n\n  Referring to Iraq--\n\n     than any that's been talked about. Indeed, I understand that \n     more money is expected to be spent on this than was spent on \n     the entire Marshall Plan for the rebuilding of Europe after \n     World War II.\n\n  Natsios replied:\n\n       No, no. This doesn't even compare remotely with the size of \n     the Marshall Plan.\n\n  Koppel:\n\n       The Marshall Plan was $97 billion.\n\n  Natsios:\n\n\n[[Page S12241]]\n\n\n       This is $1.7 billion--\n\n  Not $97 billion. Natsios corrects him and says this is $1.7 billion \nfor Iraq.\n  Koppel says:\n\n       All right, this is the first. I mean, when you talk about \n     1.7, you're not suggesting that the rebuilding of Iraq is \n     gonna be done for $1.7 billion?\n\n  Natsios replied:\n\n       Well, in terms of the American taxpayer's contribution, I \n     do, this is it for the US. The rest of the rebuilding of Iraq \n     will be done by other countries who have already made \n     pledges, Britain, Germany, Norway, Japan, Canada, and Iraqi \n     oil revenues, eventually in several years, when it's up and \n     running and there's a new government that's been \n     democratically elected, will finish the job with their own \n     revenues. They're going to get in $20 billion a year in oil \n     revenues. But the American part of this will be $1.7 billion. \n     We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.\n\n  Six months ago, the Department of State USAID Administrator tells you \nthe sum total of America's responsibility for Iraq is $1.7 billion. And \nwe come today with a bill on the floor that is 20 times that--not quite \n20 times that; it is $20 billion to be accurate.\n  Koppel couldn't believe it:\n\n       And we're back once again with Andrew Natsios, \n     administrator for the Agency for International Development. I \n     want to be sure I understood you correctly. You're saying the \n     . . . top cost for the U.S. taxpayer will be $1.7 billion. No \n     more than that?\n\n  Natsios says:\n\n       For the reconstruction.\n\n  That is it. Those are the commitments made by the administration that \nled us up to this moment in the debate, and it is that point we have \nreached where we are now debating on the floor a reconstruction bill \nfar in excess of what we ever anticipated.\n  Because it is in excess, many of us believe we need to step back and \nacknowledge the obvious. Though the administration and the military may \nhave had an excellent plan for the military conquest of Iraq, they did \nnot have a plan to rebuild that nation. They had no idea what it would \ncost, and they come to the American people today asking for more money \nthan was ever imagined even 6 months ago by the leaders of this same \nadministration.\n  I am going to yield the floor at this point because I know Senator \nByrd wants to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  This Senator is a little confused. I understand the Senator from \nIllinois to say he is fully in support of the defense money. Yet when \nhe talks about the money he is unwilling to support, he includes it in \nthe total $87 billion.\n  Are we talking about the $20.3 billion or are we talking about the \n$87 billion? Certainly the $87 billion, if the Senator from Illinois is \nconsistent, includes the $66 billion which he will support. It would \ncome from borrowed moneys from Social Security trust funds and other \nfunds, that is true.\n  I think the American public out there is going to be confused about \nthis business, the $66 billion. Is the Senator from Illinois talking \nabout $66 billion? I thought he said he was going to support that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for asking that question, allowing me \nto clarify, because I want to make it clear, as I thought I had.\n  When it comes to the money to support the troops, I am there for \nevery dollar. That is why I think Senator Byrd's amendment is so \nimportant, so we can--\n  Mr. STEVENS. Why does the Senator mention $87 billion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is the total cost of this bill, if I am not \nmistaken. The difference, of course, the $20.3 billion, or $21 billion, \nfor reconstruction. I concede we have to add to our deficit and borrow \nfrom the trust fund to support the troops. I will do that and go home \nand defend it. But when it comes to the $20 billion for reconstruction, \nthis administration is asking 15 or 16 times more than they were asking \n6 months ago.\n  So let's be very clear to the American people. The reconstruction of \nIraq, with a total cost of $60 billion, is just getting started with \nthis bill. We are in for the long haul, if we pass this bill as \nwritten.\n\n  Senator Byrd has an appropriate amendment he offered in committee. \nLet's separate it. Let's vote for the support of troops. Let's make \nthat clear and get it done. But then, to go on beyond that and the \nreconstruction, let's address that in the specific terms it deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I sought, in the Appropriations Committee on \nyesterday, to sever the title that involves the reconstruction money \nfor Iraq and send to the Senate two bills, one dealing with the \nmilitary funding and one dealing with the reconstruction. I failed on a \nparty line vote.\n  I am trying, at this time, to do virtually the same thing. I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be divided into two freestanding bills, \nthe first including funds for our military in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nthe funds for rebuilding the Iraqi security forces and the emergency \ndesignation included in title III, the second bill including the funds \nfor Iraq's reconstruction and the emergency designation included in \ntitle III, and that the second bill be laid aside to be considered \nimmediately upon the disposition of the first bill dealing with the \nfunds for our military.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nstate the Senator from West Virginia did offer this amendment. It would \nhave the impact of splitting these two portions of our programs that \ndeal with Iraq and leaving just a portion of the money. As I \nunderstand, it would leave $5-plus billion in the fund from the $20.3 \nbillion.\n  So I really am compelled to tell the Senator that I don't think we \ncan be for the troops, be for helping the troops, and be against the \n$20.3 billion. So I am compelled to object, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator withhold his objection temporarily?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do withhold the objection. I am happy to have a dialog \non this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is withheld.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the manager of the bill and chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, the President has asked Congress to appropriate a \ngreat deal of money for the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. But \nthe American people have not yet been convinced that spending this \nmoney is the right thing to do. One poll conducted by the Washington \nPost found that 61 percent opposed spending $87 billion for Iraq and \nthat 85 percent were concerned about our country becoming bogged down \nin a long and costly peacekeeping mission.\n  One of the most contentious parts of the President's request is $20.3 \nbillion in reconstruction aid for Iraq. The more details that come out \nabout this aid, the more the American people are uncomfortable with \nthis spending. They are seeking important answers to fair questions. \nWhy can't our allies bear some of the cost? How much money will \nthe administration seek for Iraq after this aid package? What about our \nneeds for reconstruction here at home?\n\n  In the 14 days we have had in which to examine the President's \nsupplemental appropriations package, I do not think anyone has come up \nwith the answers to those questions. What we do know is that this \nreconstruction money will not cover all that is needed to be done in \nIraq. Ambassador Bremer, in his testimony to the Appropriations \nCommittee, stated there are $60 billion to $70 billion in \nreconstruction needs in Iraq over the next 4 to 5 years. Spending $20.3 \nbillion now could leave us on the hook to spend billions more later.\n  Before we commit our country to this path, we would be wise to seek a \nconsensus and common understanding of the appropriate roles for the \nUnited States, our allies, and the Iraqi people in rebuilding that \ncountry.\n  I am offering a unanimous consent request to divide the bill that is \nbefore the Senate so we may give close scrutiny to the two distinct \nissues that are addressed in this bill, the $65.6 billion in defense \nfunding that is contained in title I, plus the $5.1 billion for Iraq's \nsecurity forces; and the remaining $15.2 billion in foreign aid \nspending in title\n\n[[Page S12242]]\n\nII for Iraqi reconstruction. Each of these elements is deserving of \ndebate on its own right.\n  The administration is sure to oppose dividing the content of this \nbill so that the Senate may consider independently the issues of \nmilitary funding and reconstruction funds. But, why? Perhaps the White \nHouse is afraid that its $15.2 billion for Iraqi reconstruction cannot \nwithstand the scrutiny of the full Senate unless it is wrapped up in \nthe guise of support for our troops.\n  But that has not been administration's argument. We have heard again \nand again from Ambassador Bremer and Secretary Rumsfeld that the \nadministration views this reconstruction money as every bit as \nimportant as the military portion of the bill.\n  If they are confident in their case, let the Senate divide the bill. \nPerhaps the administration's arguments will carry the day. But the \nAmerican people know this is really two bills wrapped into one.\n  In just a few days, the Senate will go into a week-long recess and \nour constituents will ask Senators what they are doing to scrutinize \nthe huge amount of reconstruction spending in the bill. The American \npeople want us to deal with reconstruction spending differently than \nwith military spending. We owe it to them to consider the two \ncomponents of this bill in the most reasonable manner possible by \ndividing the bill and giving each part the scrutiny it is due.\n  The task of rebuilding Iraq will be enormous. The American people are \nbeginning to understand this. The United States can hardly afford to \nbear the costs of reconstruction by ourselves. For this reason alone, \nwe should debate the issue of reconstruction separately from the \nrequest the President has made for our armed services. My unanimous \nconsent request is a commonsense approach to proceeding with this \ndebate in the Senate.\n  Let me again repeat my request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be divided into \ntwo freestanding bills, the first including the funds for our military \nin Iraq and Afghanistan and the funds for rebuilding the Iraqi security \nforces and the emergency designation included in title III; the second \nincluding the funds for Iraq reconstruction and the emergency \ndesignation included in title III, and that the second bill be laid \naside to be considered immediately upon the disposition of the first \nbill dealing with the funds for our military.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again reserving the right to object, I \nthink the Senator's explanation and the presentation of the Senator \nfrom Illinois demonstrates the problem. The poll the Senator has \nmentioned by the Washington Post polled $87 billion. Yet there is no \nrelevant objection to $66 billion of that money. Why didn't they poll \nthe $20.3 billion? I don't think the American public has been told that \n$20.3 billion is part of the process that will eventually reduce the \nmilitary expense and bring our people back.\n  We have taken the position of a single package--a fund for the \nmilitary operation, and a fund for reconstruction and restoration of \nIraq going on concomitantly so we don't have to go into a period of \nmilitary occupation.\n  I think the Senator's amendment is sort of a dangerous thing because \nit says go ahead with the military operation but we won't give you any \nmoney to help to stand up the Iraqi army, or to stand up the Iraqi \nsecurity force, or to take action to assure the powerplants are working \nand the oil pipelines are working because we think we ought to wait \nuntil there is a government. You cannot get a new government without \nsome reconstruction and without some security and without some \nmechanism to assist our forces so our forces can draw back and not take \nover the whole job.\n  I object to the Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I respect my colleague greatly, and I \nrespect his reasons for objecting to my unanimous consent request.\n  I have already offered the unanimous consent request to divide the \nPresident's supplemental request into portions, one on the $71.5 \nbillion for our military and for Iraq's own security force, and one for \n$15.2 billion in reconstruction aid. Although there was objection to my \nrequest, the American people understand why the issue of security is \nnot the same as the issue of reconstruction. The amendment that I will \nnow offer would strike $15.2 billion in reconstruction aid from the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. This would allow the Senate to \nproceed with its consideration of $70.7 billion in security-related \nfunding for Iraq, $5.6 billion for the Department of Defense, $5.1 \nbillion for building the new Iraqi army and a national police force, \nand $1 billion for aid to Afghanistan, and State Department operations. \nAdopting my amendment would allow the Senate to return to the issue of \nreconstruction after completing action on the President's request for \nsecurity-related funding.\n\n  In the meantime, the Senate should give more careful consideration to \nthe administration's plan for rebuilding Iraq. We should take a closer \nlook at the plan for postwar Iraq. The plan distributed by Ambassador \nBremer to the Appropriations Committee on September 22 adds but 28 \npages. The plan provides few details, and it only looks out on the next \n5 months of our occupation. However, in the same hearing, Ambassador \nBremer said he had a plan that ran to 98 pages and containing 300 or \n400 individual action items. That does not sound like the plan he gave \nto the Appropriations Committee. It sounds as if the Senate does not \neven have the full version of the administration's plan for the \nreconstruction for Iraq.\n  Surely if we are to commit the United States to spending $15.2 \nbillion over the next 12 months, Congress should be able to see the \nfull plan for the rebuilding of Iraq. If it is indeed just the 28 pages \nthat were given to the Appropriations Committee, I think we are in \ntrouble.\n  If Congress is going to pay for the activities that are called for in \nthe plan to reconstruct Iraq, we should also have a say on formulating \nthat plan. By waiting to approve the $15.2 billion in reconstruction \nfunding, Congress could take advantage of that time to debate the \nproper role of the United States, our allies, and the Iraqi people in \nsharing the cost of reconstruction.\n  The cost of acting without a solid plan for rebuilding Iraq could be \nvery high--well beyond the $15.2 billion in reconstruction funds the \nPresident has requested for the next year. We could end up wasting \nbillions of dollars more and losing even greater numbers of American \ntroops. In the words of Publius Cyrus, nothing can be done at once \nhastily and prudently.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to give Congress more time to consider \nthis $15.2 billion in rebuilding aid, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1794\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1794.\n\n(Purpose: Strike $15.2 billion of the $20.3 billion in Iraq Relief and \n Reconstruction Funds, leaving $5.1 billion for training and equipping \n  the Iraqi Defense Corps and Iraqi national security forces and for \n               other public safety and justice purposes)\n\n       On page 25, line 7, strike ``rehabilitation and \n     reconstruction in Iraq'' and all that follows through page \n     28, line 15 and insert ``in Iraq, $5,136,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended, for security, including public \n     safety requirements, national security and justice; Provided, \n     That these funds may be transferred to any Federal account \n     for any Federal government activity to accomplish the \n     purposes provided herein: Provided further, That \n     notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, none of the \n     funds appropriated under this heading may be made available \n     to enter into any contract or follow-on contract that uses \n     other than full and open competitive contracting procedures \n     as defined in 41 U.S.C. 403(6).''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are Senators who are at the signing \nceremony. Can we get an agreement on a time to vote on the Senator's \namendment? I would like to see us vote on the Senator's amendment \nsometime around 4 o'clock. Is that possible?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not in a position at the moment to respond to that \nrequest, I say most respectfully.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \ncourtesy in\n\n[[Page S12243]]\n\nbringing this amendment forward. It is one of the key issues of this \nbill. The Senator has offered an amendment. As I understand, it would \nleave the defense money before the Senate and would strike all but \n$5.136 billion for the public safety and national security requirements \nof the proposal presented by the President in the emergency \nsupplemental bill.\n  In my judgment, this tries to separate just a portion of the problem. \nThe problem that has been brought before our committee is the problem \nof thousands of Iraqi people who do not have jobs because the economy \nis not functioning in this triangle where terrorists are. They do not \nhave security. This maintains the money for the security and public \nsafety, but it does not maintain the money for restoring the jails. All \nthe jails were destroyed and all the prisoners were let go. It does not \nrestore the money necessary to proceed with the development of the \nsystems that will lead to restoration of the economy and it does not \ncover the balance of the money in the plan for this fiscal year. We \nbelieve it carries beyond the July period when, hopefully by that time, \nIraqi oil money will be flowing at a rate where they can pick up and do \nthe reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq.\n  I am compelled to say I oppose this amendment. It is my hope we can \nget an early vote on it. It is a significant portion of the problem. \nMany people came to me as chairman and asked, why don't you take the \ndefense portions separately and take the rest in a separate bill? That \nis what Senator Byrd tried to do in his previous unanimous consent \nrequest. We conferred at length with Ambassador Bremer, with \nSecretary Rumsfeld, with General Abizaid. They were all before our \ncommittee. They all said this process is one of tying together the \nreconstruction and rehabilitation with our continued military \noperations with the hope that as the reconstruction moves forward, our \npeople can move out and we can start the process of withdrawing as soon \nas it starts. That has already occurred. General Pace testified some of \nour people have already been withdrawn from the areas where we think \nthere has been peace and stability restored. Although those areas do \nnot have a national government, they have local governments that are \nnow functioning. We are providing some security in the background \nthere, that is true. They need that for a little while more.\n\n  I firmly believe that if we can get this plan going and have the \nreconstruction funds go forward with the military operations, there is \nsupport for our soldiers there now and assurance that we will go into a \nperiod where there comes a time we can withdraw more and more of our \nforces. The plan the President has presented is a plan that could work. \nI am not here to say I know it will work; it could work. If it worked, \nit would be the first time in history this has been done. But there is \na substantial chance it will work.\n  There is another greater question ahead, a question of whether a \nportion of the moneys should be repaid. We will have to address that \nquestion in the near future. I thank the Senator for raising this \nissue. It is the key issue he attached to a unanimous consent agreement \nand I opposed.\n  For those who support the concept, you cannot be for the troops and \nagainst the money. We need to assure the troops have the support they \nshould have coming out of the Iraqi people and out of the restoration \nof their ability to defend themselves and to police for themselves and \nset up their own new government.\n  This is the intertwining of these two proposals. I tell my friend I \nmust oppose this. I will ask for the vote to occur sometime soon, I \nhope, because we ought to get this subject behind us as quickly as \npossible.\n  I don't know if the Senator is willing to talk of a time certain. \nBecause of the problem of the signing ceremony for the Homeland \nSecurity bill, it will not be possible to have the vote before 4, but I \nam happy to have the vote at any time after 4 if the Senator is willing \nto call for a vote.\n  How long would the Senator from Rhode Island like to speak?\n  Mr. REED. I will use about 20 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. He is not speaking on the Senator's amendment, but has \nhis own statement?\n  Mr. REED. I will make a statement and also concur with the amendment \nof the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. After the Senator from Rhode Island, I would like to \nspeak on the Byrd amendment for 15 minutes. I am happy to accommodate \nthe floor managers if we want to rotate back and forth.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That can be accommodated with a time limit we are \nthinking about. Senator McConnell has a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. \nI hope we establish a procedure where we have an amendment from one \nside, the other side, and work on a basis of comity when that time \ncomes.\n  I am happy to yield the floor. I hope we have the dialog as to when \nthe vote will take place in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I rise to indicate my support for the approach adopted by \nthe Senator from West Virginia. It is clear to everyone in this chamber \nand to the American public that we will fund our forces in the field. \nIn fact, I am prepared in the next day or so to bring forth amendments \nto increase the resources going to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nIt is absolutely essential.\n  It is also essential we are given the time and the opportunity to \nlook carefully at the reconstruction funds. The Senator from West \nVirginia has an amendment that allows that. I concur with his \namendment.\n  I will take a broader view at this time of the process before the \nSenate. As we debate the administration's request for a supplemental \nappropriation of $87 billion for operations in Iraq, a salient fact \nemerges. We are committing ourselves to a long-term, expensive \ninvolvement in Iraq. We should realistically assume that significant \nmilitary forces will be committed to Iraq for at least 10 years. The \ncost of maintaining the forces will not become negligible. Indeed, they \nare likely to spike even higher at times based on the level of violence \nand instability.\n  This reality should also shape our views on force structure. The \nnature of this insurgency places significant demands on the Army. \nWithout the contribution of additional international forces, the strain \non our military forces, but particularly the Army, will be serious. \nThese strains will be reflected in unsustainable operations tempo and \nheightened demands for military police rather than conventional combat \nforces. Ultimately, these stresses could seriously erode recruitment \nand retention.\n  The administration is increasingly aware of these problems. Last \nweek, Secretary Rumsfeld indicated the Pentagon was preparing for the \ncallup of a large number of Army Reserves and National Guard. This is \nonly a short-term solution at best. Today, the Rhode Island National \nGuard is in the thick of a fight in the Sunni triangle. The 115th \nmilitary police company, the 119th military police company, and the \n118th police battalion have performed with distinction and sadly have \nalready sustained three soldiers killed in action along with several \nwounded in action. These are proud and patriotic soldiers who will \ncontinue to do their duty.\n  However, in the face of the probability of repeated callups over the \nnext several years, I am concerned many of these soldiers will leave \nthe Guard rather than face the prospects of repeatedly leaving their \nfamilies.\n  Given the escalating costs in both lives and national resources, it \nis incumbent upon us to ask whether we have blundered into a strategic \nmistake of the first magnitude.\n  The first principle of war is: ``Objective.'' In the words of the \nArmy field manual:\n\n     direct every military operation toward a clearly defined, \n     decisive and attainable objective.\n\n  The evolving rationale for a preemptive attack began with the \nassertion that the Saddam Hussein regime had weapons of mass \ndestruction of immediate concern to the United States.\n  In addition, the administration consistently implied and, at times, \novertly asserted that there was a ``terrorist link'' with Iraq. The \nlarger implication was this ``terrorist link'' was tied directly to al-\nQaida. Both of these assertions have been proven to be exaggerated.\n  Now the administration claims we must stay and rebuild Iraq because \nto\n\n[[Page S12244]]\n\nwithdraw would be a grievous blow to our power and prestige. This point \nhas merit. But the kaleidoscope of rationales for our operations are \nanything but ``clearly defined.''\n  Secondly, our actions should be focused on a decisive outcome. The \ngreatest danger facing the United States is another terrorist attack on \nour homeland with weapons of mass destruction. One must ask whether our \nactions in Iraq are decisive in blunting this threat.\n  Contrary to the President's assertion, Iraq is not the center of the \nwar on terrorism. Indeed, one of the vexing aspects of the war on \nterror is the lack of a clearly defined center. The al-Qaida threat is \ninternational. But, if one were to look for a more lucrative place to \nstrike at al-Qaida, it would be the Afghan-Pakistan border where bin \nLaden dwells, not Iraq under Saddam Hussein.\n  When Secretary Wolfowitz testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee, he displayed for the cameras entry documents for jihadists \nkilled in Iraq. He was, once again, trying to make the terrorist \nconnection. However, all of these documents showed that the individuals \nentered Iraq after March 19, the date hostilities commenced. Now a new \nrationale may be emerging from the administration: Our operations in \nIraq are a giant trap to lure in Islamic terrorists so that they can be \ndestroyed. But this logic misses the point. The jihadists racing to \nengage us in Iraq are not necessarily the same people who are plotting \nto strike us here at home. In fact, our actions may have fermented new \nlegions of jihadists with ready access to Iraq. I posed the following \nquestion to General Abizaid when he appeared before the Armed Services \nCommittee last week: If there is another terrorist attack against the \nUnited States, is it more likely to emanate from Baghdad or from the \nAfghan-Pakistan border? His answer is instructive:\n\n       Senator, if there is another attack on the United States, \n     it would be organized, planned, and executed through a \n     worldwide network of connections that are borderless. It \n     would be difficult to say where its geographic center would \n     be. There are certainly places on the Afghan/Pakistan border \n     that are semi-havens for terrorists, in the Waziristan area, \n     that the Pakistanis are working to clean up. There are other \n     ungoverned spaces where this is also possible. It is possible \n     that a terrorist group working in Baghdad, or New York for \n     that matter, could organize the attack, so there is no \n     geographic center that I would point to other than to say \n     we've got a lot of cells in a lot of locations that require \n     careful, difficult work to uncover and destroy.\n\n  We are in the midst of a global war, but we are disproportionately \nconcentrating our effort in Iraq. Now, I do understand there are \nsignificant resources here for Afghanistan, and that is appropriate, \nbecause Afghanistan today is in a very precarious position. But a \ndisproportionate concentration of resources are being directed in Iraq \nwhen the real existential threat to the United States--a threat that \ncould mean a catastrophic attack upon the United States--is worldwide, \ndiffuse, and disbursed. And one has to question that logic.\n  While we focus on Iraq, both the North Koreans and the Iranians are \nmarching toward nuclear futures. If these nations obtain nuclear \nweapons, then the barriers against proliferation will slip even \nfurther. Once again, if the greatest threat facing us is nuclear armed \nterrorists, is our strategic fixation with Iraq justified?\n  A third aspect of proper military objective is that the outcome must \nbe ascertainable. The administration's stated goal today is to \ntransform Iraq into a market economy and constitutional democracy. Some \ndoubt whether this goal can ever be achieved. It certainly cannot be \nachieved quickly and at low cost.\n\n  The administration has placed us in a predicament where we cannot \nafford to lose, but winning may have a negligible effect on the \nexistential threat to the Nation, an event with a catastrophic impact \non the United States. This could be a textbook definition of poor \nstrategy.\n  Now the administration comes before us promoting this appropriations \nbill as a Marshall plan for Iraq. Many of my colleagues have pointed \nout that this is revisionist history, a term that is frequently used in \nWashington today. The Marshall plan was not whisked through Congress in \na few weeks. It was subject to what the Congressional Research Service \ndescribed as ``perhaps the most thorough examination prior to launching \nof any program.'' The CRS added that President Truman ``closely \nconsulted with Congress.'' The authorization was for 1 year, allowing \nthe Congress, again, as described by CRS:\n\n     ample opportunity to oversee the Plan's implementation and \n     consider additional funding. Three more times during the life \n     of the Plan, Congress would be required to authorize and \n     appropriate funds. In each year, Congress held hearings, \n     debated, and further amended the legislation.\n\n  I think this comment is in the spirit of the Byrd amendment because \nthe Byrd amendment will allow us at least a small opportunity for that \nimplementation, that oversight, that review that was so present in the \nMarshall plan.\n  The Marshall plan differed in significant details from the proposal \nwe have before us. The Marshall plan required a dollar-per-dollar match \nby the recipient. It was not an unconditional grant from the Treasury \nof the United States. About 10 percent of the aid was in the form of \nloans that required repayment. The Marshall plan was based on \ntransparency, not secret contracts to companies favored by the \nadministration.\n  But it is not just revisionist history; it is highly selective \nhistory. If a Marshall plan is the proper economic tonic for Iraq, why \naren't our occupation policies after World War II the right security \npolicy?\n  Former Ambassador James Dobbins and his associates at Rand conducted \na careful review of nation-building efforts since World War II. \nAmbassador Dobbins was President Bush's special envoy to Afghanistan \nafter the defeat of the Taliban. Prior to that service, he oversaw \npostwar efforts in Kosovo, Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. This report \npoints out:\n\n       On V-E day, General Dwight D. Eisenhower had 61 U.S. \n     divisions (1,622,000 men) in Germany out of a total of \n     3,077,000 men in Europe. These soldiers became the occupation \n     force for the U.S. sector. They manned border crossings, \n     maintained checkpoints at road junctions, and conducted \n     patrols throughout the sector. The occupation was \n     comprehensive and demonstrated the scope of the German \n     defeat.\n\n  Our occupation in Iraq is anything but comprehensive and has yet to \ndemonstrate to significant sectors in Iraq the scope of the defeat of \nthe Saddam Hussein regime.\n  Pressures in 1945 to shift forces to the Pacific theater and to \n``bring the boys home'' led to a reduction of our forces in Germany. \nNevertheless, we maintained a robust military presence in Germany \ncompared to our current deployment in Iraq.\n  This chart is illustrative of the comparison of what our forces would \nlook like if we adopted the same policies in terms of troops to \npopulation that we did in 1945.\n  This chart projects the experience in several different nation-\nbuilding scenarios on the present situation in Iraq. In other words, it \ntakes the ratio of the troops we used then versus population to the \ncurrent population of Iraq. And it is instructive.\n  The first blue bar shows the kind of forces we would have if we were \nadopting anything close to the German approach after World War II. It \nis literally off the charts. This shown here is the 600,000 troop \nlevel. Our troop level is here--this red line--about 142,000 troops.\n  The next column, in the red, is Japan. It is slightly less than the \npresent troop level in Iraq, but there was a unique feature in \nJapan. Rather than changing the regime in Japan, as we have in Iraq, we \nbasically co-opted the regime, keeping Hirohito in power, and his \npresence was a decisive factor in limiting the troops we needed. The \nnext column is the Somalia level. Again, this is a situation in which \nmany would argue insufficient troops caused a tactical defeat on the \nground and a strategic retreat which was embarrassing for the United \nStates. It is certainly not the model for peacekeeping.\n\n  The next column is Haiti, a situation in which our entry into the \ncountry was unopposed. There was very little violence. It was a small \ncountry, even though it had a significant population for its size. We \nturned over our efforts to the United Nations within 2 years.\n  Instructive are the next two columns: Bosnia and Kosovo. In these two \ncountries, under the Clinton administration, we went in with robust \nforces.\n\n[[Page S12245]]\n\nAs a result, there was none of the violence that we anticipated. We \nhave actually made progress, limited I would add, to ensure that there \nis at least a growing economy and a growing civic culture in these \ncountries--a remarkable difference between the force levels relative to \nthose we have in Iraq.\n  The final column is Afghanistan, another situation in which the \nadministration has deliberately kept our forces low. Again, we are \nreaping some of those costs today as we see heightened terror, a \nrebounding Taliban, the largest increase in production of opium and \nheroin in the world, at least getting to those proportions, and that is \nanother example.\n  We can see throughout the course of the next 3 years projected \nforward where these troops sizes are significant. It raises the \nquestion: If the economic policy is the right policy, if this is a \nMarshall plan, where is the Marshall-like support in terms of troops on \nthe ground?\n  The administration repeatedly makes the point that stability and \nreconstruction go hand in hand. They have seized on the Marshall plan \nto justify this request for billions of dollars but ignore the reality \nthat stability is hard to come by with insufficient forces.\n  For example, the New York Times reported just yesterday ``that as \nmuch as 650,000 tons of ammunition remains at thousands of sites used \nby the former Iraqi security forces and that much of it has not been \nsecured and will take years to destroy. Meanwhile, insurgents are \nobtaining huge amounts of weapons and explosives to attack our troops \neach day. While we wait for international forces or Iraqi security \nforces, these attacks go on.\n  Indeed, in the same article, General Abizaid sounded a cautionary \nnote about reliance on Iraqi security. He said:\n\n       There's probably places where we have put Iraqi guards that \n     may be vulnerable to people that would come in and bribe the \n     guards.\n\n  There are respected voices that say we do not need more American \ntroops. They say we need better intelligence and international \nreinforcements to change the appearance of the occupation. But while we \nwait for our intelligence apparatus to mature and for the arrival of \ninternational reinforcements, who will secure the ammunition dumps and \nthe pipelines? Efforts to train Iraqis are underway, but the \navailability and reliability of these troops is today uncertain.\n  The administration is quick to brandish the Marshall plan to justify \nthis appropriation. But it is not a Marshall Plan, it is a belated \nattempt to provide resources for a thinly stretched occupation force \nwhile throwing huge amounts of money at reconstruction with the hope \nthat some of it will stick. And this appropriation is the second \npayment. Congress has already appropriated $74.8 billion in emergency \nfunds for Iraq this year. The demands in Iraq will be significant and \npersistent. There are more payments to come.\n  The real question before us is not whether this legislation will \npass. The real question is whether the United States can sustain this \neffort in Iraq over many years. The United States must set a defined, \ndecisive, and obtainable objective in Iraq. Then we must sustain the \neffort to achieve that objective. To sustain such an objective and such \nan effort, we must move more aggressively and quickly to secure \ninternational support, both military and financial support. This means \ngiving the United Nations a meaningful role in Iraq without ceding our \nleadership. Without such a development, our attempt to obtain \nsignificant military and financial assistance from the world community \nwill be futile.\n\n  To sustain such an effort, we must expand our military forces, \nparticularly our Army, so that we can guarantee a predictable rotation \nof our troops into and out of Iraq and so that we can lessen our \nreliance on Reserve and National Guard troops. The strain on our ground \nforces is severe. And because of our reliance on Reserve and National \nGuard, this strain is transmitted to every town in America. The support \nof the American people will be continually tested as they see their \nneighbors serve and sacrifice without relief and with uncertain \nresults.\n  To sustain such an effort, we must pay for it. It is simply \nirresponsible to run huge deficits to pay for the operation in Iraq. \nThe cost to our economy in the inevitable rise of interest rates and \nthe dampening of growth and the cost to our society in the \ndeterioration of social investment will not go unnoticed and will be \nparticularly resented if scarce American resources are strengthening \nthe Iraqi economy and improving the quality of life of the Iraqi \npeople.\n  If we fail in these tasks, money alone, the money in this bill, will \nnot allow us to stay the course.\n  Finally, we must place the objective and effort in Iraq in context. \nWe must recognize that the existential threats to America are not in \nIraq. They are worldwide. Al-Qaida has global reach, and we have not \nyet finished hunting down and destroying their operatives. The \nproliferation of nuclear weapons is a worldwide problem with both Iran \nand North Korea on the precipice. We have yet to develop an effective \nstrategy to counter their nuclear ambitions.\n  The protection of our homeland is an ongoing challenge. The title of \na recent report of the Council on Foreign Relations actively conveyed \nthese challenges: ``Emergency Responders: Drastically Underfunded, \nDangerously Unprepared.'' The bill for these dangers still must be paid \nregardless of what we do with this legislation. We must be mindful of \nthis as we go forward, and we must be honest and candid with the \nAmerican people. To sustain this effort, we must follow through on the \ntasks I have suggested. This bill is just part of that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today, as has been stated by my \ncolleagues, starts one of the most important debates that we will have \nin this Congress or any Congress, I believe. And the decision that is \ngoing to be made over the next 2 weeks will, in all consequence, be as \nimportant as the decision that was made in October a year ago when this \nbody voted to grant the authority to the President to bring us to war, \na resolution which I voted against.\n  At the outset, I want to speak briefly to the amendment before the \nSenate; that is, the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia \nseparating those items that could be considered reconstruction and \nrehabilitation, and those items which are directly related to the \nsupport of our troops and say why I believe this is so important. That \nis because we do not have a good idea about what the administration's \npolicy is on the issues of rehabilitation and the reconstruction in \nIraq. We don't have the plan of the administration.\n  I don't say that lightly. I am a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. Just a week ago we had Ambassador Bremer before us. The \nmembers of our committee were sent this document which is called the \n``Coalition Provisional Authority, Achieving the Vision to Restore Full \nSovereignty to the Iraqi People.'' It is 28 pages long. The cover page \nsays:\n\n       A working document of July 23.\n\n  We are now on the 1st of October. We had hearings a week ago. We were \ngiven the working document of July 23, these 28 pages. If you review \nthis document about our strategy in Iraq, you will find out on the \nvarious pages--take page 9--we will, on the issues of security and \ngiving the goals, August to October, they say in item 4 on that page, \nlocate, secure, and eliminate weapons of mass destruction, from August \nto October. From November to January, continue to locate and eliminate \nthe weapons of mass destruction. Then, February on, it says continue to \nlocate and secure and eliminate the weapons of mass destruction.\n  That is the plan. This program is full of those kinds of \nplatitudinous, empty statements and is basically an insult to our \ntroops and to our Congress. During the course of that hearing, the \nSenator from Michigan asked Mr. Bremer when we would have a more \ncomprehensive document as to what the plan is on the reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of Iraq. This is his quote on September 25:\n\n       I will keep you informed, but I want to keep my hands free \n     as to how I do that.\n\n  That was an answer to Senator Levin, the ranking minority member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, when he asked Ambassador Bremer: You have \nsubmitted this document to us, which is a working document, July 23. \nWhen is this going to be updated? When are we going to get the plan?\n\n[[Page S12246]]\n\n  He said:\n\n       I will keep you informed, but I want to keep my hands free \n     as to how I do that.\n\n  And we have not had anything since that time. We had one document and \nthat is the 58 or 59 pages that lists the items requested. It is not a \nplan; it is a budget. It is a budget on various items that are going to \nbe necessary, but no plan.\n  The administration and the military knew how to win the war. That was \nnever going to be the challenge or the question. But they have had no \nplan on how to win the peace. They still don't have a plan to win the \npeace. The Byrd amendment is trying to separate what is called for in \nterms of the support for our troops to this rehabilitation and \nreconstruction, to try to get the administration prior to the time we \nare going to have a final vote to say what is the plan on \nrehabilitation, what is the plan in terms of reconstruction. But we \nhave not had that. We have not had it in the Armed Services Committee.\n  We have the long list of items, some of which I will refer to in my \ncomments, but we still don't have the plan. The fact is, it is being \nmade up every single day over in Iraq. As we consider those reports we \nall see every evening or morning on the Americans who lose their lives \nover there, we also haven't got a real understanding of what security \nis like in the major populated areas of that community. As we are \nreminded in the excellent study that has been done by Mr. Dobbins and \nRAND, it talks about how historically those individuals who are subject \nto occupation view those who occupy their country. Perhaps some start \noff and support them as liberators, but others will never forgive them \nfor occupying their country.\n  But there is one powerful factor and force, and that is the issue of \nsecurity. It is security not just out in the streets and the highways \nbetween various communities, but it is what is happening in downtown \nBaghdad every single day and night. The number of people who are \ngetting killed, the numbers who are coming into the morgues, the break-\nins taking place in people's houses, and the rapes taking place in \nthose communities have given a sense of insecurity to the people in \nBaghdad and many other communities. We don't have a plan about how we \nare going to deal with this. We are told we are training the police--\n40-some-odd-thousand police--who were there under Saddam Hussein, the \ngreat majority of whom were torturers and exterminators. But we have a \nnew view and we are retraining them in some particular way.\n\n  I talked with some extraordinarily impressive young Americans who \njust came from Faluja. I talked with them in Massachusetts, and they \npointed out that the Iraqi police trained in their area won't leave the \nbarracks. They are frightened that if they are seen leaving the \nbarracks, something will happen to them or their families.\n  As we know, as the very important Dobbins document points out, \nwhether you are talking about Algeria, Northern Ireland, or Malaysia in \n1958, or the West Bank, or Kosovo--any of these areas--what you need to \ndo is start to train a disciplined police force, and it takes 12 to 15 \nmonths--a new force adequately trained and highly motivated and that \ncan move toward the security issues. That is not the case. We are asked \nto pour billions of dollars in taxpayers' funds into Iraq.\n  I think any fair reading of these requests would have to say the \noverall strategy--whatever it is--is a top-down strategy, not a bottom-\nup one. What we are seeing in the initial reports coming from Iraq is \nthe areas where they are having the greatest progress is where the \nstakeholders are buying into the efforts in these local communities. \nMost of the positive reports are coming as a result of the leadership \nof the military, many of whom have gone through the campaigns in Kosovo \nand other parts of the world, where they have seen what can work and \nwhat is necessary.\n  So it is appropriate that we have some opportunity to talk about and \nask about this amount of resources that are being requested to go to \nIraq. There are a number of questions, obviously, that are going to be \nraised, such as the whole issue of contracting and who is getting the \ncontracting. What are the circumstances of those contracts? What kind \nof transparency is there over there? Are we taking these contracts with \nsingle-bid contracts, with those who have a questionable record in \nterms of the performance, and overcharging the Defense Department? Are \nwe giving opportunities for contracts to other countries around the \nworld who have had a relationship and know how to be able to \nreconstruct and rebuild? Are we excluding them? What are the \ncircumstances of this?\n  These issues are going to be raised, as they should be. It is not \nclear from what is coming out from the Appropriations Committee that \nmany of these issues have been addressed. I know they will be by my \ncolleagues. It is not just about the administration's policy and its \nconduct in Iraq. It is about the way we pursue American interests in a \ndangerous world, about the way our Government makes one of the most \nimportant decisions, whether to send young men and women to war.\n  It is wrong to put American lives on the line for a dubious cause. \nMany of us continue to believe the war in Iraq was the wrong war at the \nwrong time. There were alternatives short of a premature rush to a \nunilateral war, alternatives that could have accomplished our goals in \nIraq with far fewer casualties and far less damage to our goals in the \nwar against terrorism.\n  I commend my friend and colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, for \nonce again reminding us what Mr. Tenet, who was head of the CIA, \nreminded the Armed Services Committee time in and time out--all of last \nyear, up until the period of August--that the greatest threat to the \nUnited States was terrorism and, obviously, the increasing concern that \nall of us have about North Korea, Iran, and the deterioration and \nspiraling violence in the Middle East.\n  Our troops deserve a plan that will bring in adequate foreign forces \nimmediately to share the burden of restoring the security and involve \nthe international community in building a new democracy for the future \nof Iraq.\n  There is no question the Senate owes it to our men and women in \nuniform to provide the support they need, to bring the day closer when \nour troops can come home with dignity and honor, and Iraq will truly be \nfree.\n  The $87 billion cannot be a blank check. That is why I support the \nByrd amendment. Congress must hold the administration accountable. The \nAmerican people deserve to know how the money will be spent. Things are \nout of control in Iraq. We need to stop the downward spiral, protect \nour interests, and protect the lives of American soldiers.\n  The administration must tell the country in much greater detail what \nit intends to do with the $87 billion and its plans for sharing the \nburden with our allies and the United Nations to achieve our goals. The \nAmerican people are entitled to know whether, with all the current \ndifficulties, the administration has a plausible plan for the future \ninstead of digging the current hole even deeper.\n  Our soldiers' lives are constantly at stake. Patriotism is not the \nissue. The safety of our 140,000 American service men and women serving \nin Iraq today is the immediate issue. It is our solemn responsibility \nto question, and question vigorously, the administration's current \nrequest for funds. So far, the administration has failed utterly to \nprovide a plausible plan for the future of Iraq and ensure the safety \nof our troops.\n  In its rush to war, the administration failed to recognize the danger \nand the complexity of the occupation. They repeatedly underestimated \nthe likely cost of this enormous undertaking. Opposing voices in the \nadministration were ignored.\n  Last September, the chief Presidential economic adviser, Lawrence \nLindsey, said that the total cost of the Iraqi involvement might be as \nmuch as $200 billion. His estimate was quickly rejected by White House \nBudget Director Mitch Daniels who said Mr. Lindsey's estimate was \n``very, very high'' and suggested the cost to be a more manageable $50 \nbillion or $60 billion.\n  I raise this history because in many instances the people who are \nmaking the recommendations on the rehabilitation of Iraq are the same \nones who miscalculated and misdirected the policy for months in the \npast. If we are going to take a look at this policy\n\n[[Page S12247]]\n\ntoday, it is only appropriate to see what they had suggested over the \npast months.\n  As I mentioned, when Mr. Lindsey was corrected by Mitch Daniels who \nsaid Mr. Lindsey's estimate was ``very, very high'' and suggested the \ncost would be a more manageable $50 billion or $60 billion, the \nindependent analysis indicated the cost might approach $300 billion, \nand Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld called that ``baloney.''\n  I say that against the background of what Ambassador Bremer, when he \nwas asked, when he was before the Armed Services Committee, about this \n$21 billion or $23 billion, whether we could expect they would be back \nbefore the appropriators and asking for more billions of dollars, and \nsaid: Don't count us out; don't count us out.\n  The American people ought to understand this is a downpayment for the \nadministration. This isn't the beginning and the end. This is just the \ndownpayment. We have to ask ourselves, What is the policy?\n  Last spring, as part of a broader coalition in an effort to win the \nsupport of the American people for the military, the administration \nbegan to argue that Iraq can pay for its own reconstruction. The war \nmight be costly, we were told, but it would be quick and decisive. The \nfinancial obligation of the United States would be limited because the \nliberated Iraqi people would use their extraordinary wealth from the \nworld's second largest reserves of oil to finance the reconstruction.\n\n  What the Nation heard from the Bush administration was clear: Don't \nworry about the cost. Iraq can pay for their own reconstruction.\n  Here they are a few weeks later with the $23 billion request. People \nought to ask: Is this the beginning, the middle, or the end? What is \nthe plan?\n  As the Congress debates the administration's request, we should be \nlooking for better answers from the administration, insisting on at \nleast minimal accountability. Before the war, the administration said, \n``Trust us,'' and Congress did. We should have followed President \nReagan's wise counsel from years ago: ``Trust but verify.'' Hopefully, \nit is not too late to verify.\n  Until this month, no one in the administration, other than Larry \nLindsey, who is no longer in the administration, said the war with Iraq \nand its aftermath would be expensive. The administration's numbers were \nworse than fuzzy math, and the American people have a right to be \nfurious about the gross disparity with the true costs. And they will be \neven more furious as they learn more and more about what we are being \nasked to fund.\n  The administration, obviously, did at least have one clearly thought-\nout plan--they didn't have a plan for peace. They want $400 million for \nmaximum security prisons. That is $50,000 a bed.\n  They want $800 million for international police training for 1,500 \nofficers. That is $530,000 per officer. Ask any mayor what it costs \nthem to train a police officer in their community.\n  They want a fund for consultants at $200,000 a year. That is double \nnormal pay. They want $1.4 billion to reimburse cooperating nations for \nsupport provided to U.S. military operations. I would love to find out \nhow that money is going to be spent. For what is that $1.4 billion \nintended?\n  The Bush administration went to the United Nations for help last \nweek, hat in hand and wallet open. But so far the response from other \nnations has been: Why should we help clean up America's mess in Iraq?\n  Presumably, the negotiating is still continuing over how much \nauthority the U.N. will have, how many contracts other nations will \nreceive, and how many troops they will send. Could this be the most \nembarrassing week the United States has ever had at the United Nations?\n  Trust but verify. That is why Congress has to stop writing a blank \ncheck for Iraq. That is why Congress needs better answers. That is why \nwe need accountability. Credibility on the war is in tatters both at \nhome and in the United Nations, and our troops are paying for it with \ntheir lives.\n  Our action on this legislation may well be a defining moment for the \nwar on Iraq, for the war on terrorism, for America's role in the world. \nCut and run is not an option. Hopefully, a concerned Congress and a \nchastened administration can work together to set things right on Iraq \nand right with other nations.\n  If there is any silver lining to this crisis, let us hope it is that \nthe administration's go-it-alone policy toward the rest of the world is \nhistory and we are back on a better and less dangerous course for the \nfuture.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise to make some remarks about the \nsupplemental appropriations measure before us.\n  I was struck by the concerns of my colleague from Massachusetts about \nhow bad things are in Iraq. In case some of my colleagues missed it, \nthere was a very telling op-ed piece in this morning's Washington Post \nby Representative Jim Marshall, a freshman Democrat from the Third \nDistrict of Georgia. He went to Princeton and left to go to Vietnam. He \nwas awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart as a Ranger. He \nattended Boston University Law School and in 1995 was mayor of Macon, \nGA. He is in the House. He had a very urgent plea.\n  He said: ``Don't play politics on Iraq,'' directed at his Democratic \ncolleagues. He said he had heard all of these political charges, using \nthe words and phrases such as ``quagmire,'' ``our failure in Iraq,'' \n``just another Vietnam,'' or ``the Bush administration has no plan.''\n  He said:\n\n       I went to Iraq a couple weeks ago to resolve for myself the \n     recent contrast between gloomy news coverage and optimistic \n     Pentagon reports of our progress. My trip left no doubt that \n     the Pentagon's version is far closer to reality. Our news \n     coverage disproportionately dwells on the deaths, mistakes \n     and setbacks suffered by coalition forces.\n\n  I think this op-ed is worth reading. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that this op-ed be printed in the Record after my remarks for \nthe edification and elucidation of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I just came from a very interesting \nluncheon meeting where we listened to Dr. Chalabi, a member of the \nIraqi Governing Council. He had almost the same thing to say. He said: \nWhat President Bush has done is magnificent. Our people are victorious; \nthey are not vanquished. Our failure is that the media is not carrying \nthe stories. The antiwar folks who opposed the war from the beginning \nare talking about the problems of liberation rather than the success of \na free people.\n  He would like to have a chance to tell his story more widely, and I \nhope he is listened to. He said there are large areas of Iraq where \nmarines are withdrawing, turning the area over to coalition forces from \nother countries, Macedonia and Spain. He said the Iraqis are in the \nprocess of being trained and equipped to go out as police and as \nmilitary. With the backup of U.S. troops, they will be able to take on \nmore of the responsibilities of defending against armed paramilitary \ngroups and maintaining peace and order.\n  He said this is a tremendous development. They are setting up a free \nmarket in Iraq. They are cutting customs rates and tax rates. I would \nlike some of my colleagues to hear what he says about the need for \nlower taxes. I think that is important as well.\n  It is clear we are in a debate. I gather my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, while we all recognize that $87 billion is a lot of \nmoney, they are willing to support the $66 billion to support our \ntroops in Iraq. It costs us more than $4 billion a month to maintain \nour troops in Iraq, and we cannot, as was just said by my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, cut and run.\n  So what are we going to do to make sure we do not continue to have \nareas where terrorists are harbored in hostile, tyrannical, \nauthoritarian governments in the Middle East? Well, we are on the path \nto helping the Iraqis establish a free country. Their ideas of freedom \nmay be different than ours, but basically Iraqis governing Iraqis, \nproviding security for Iraq, and helping us weed out the criminals, the \nthugs, the paramilitary groups and the terrorists who live over there.\n  Now, $21 billion of the President's request is proposed as a grant to \nhelp the Iraqis get on their feet. This is a very\n\n[[Page S12248]]\n\nimportant investment. It is a lot of money, but when we look at the \ncosts of 9/11, the cost was horrifying in human terms. Over 3,000 \npeople killed, some of them horrible deaths. It is a day and a picture \nthat none of us will ever forget and we never should forget. These \nterrorists operated out of safe havens, in countries which were ruled \nby authoritarian tyrants. We are wiping out those governments. Under \nPresident Bush's leadership, we wiped the Taliban out of Afghanistan. \nAfghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists. By a vote of 77 \nto 23, we said clean out the terrorists in Iraq, get rid of the Saddam \nHussein government. That is the most important step.\n  Some people want to go back and fight the war. If we want to get back \ninto it and say, why did we go, we can go back into that, but I think \nit is time we started looking ahead to see what we do. The $21 billion \nis absolutely essential to give the Iraqis the startup funds, the seed \nmoney to build that free and safe country.\n  What do we gain from it? Some of my colleagues say it ought to be in \nthe form of loans or we should not spend that much. Well, what we get \nfor it is the opportunity to bring our troops home sooner, to make sure \nour troops have the ability to work with Iraqi military and police, so \nwe can use the Iraqi people who understand the country and know the \nlanguage and know what is going on there as our allies.\n  As I understand it, the pending amendment leaves money in for the \ntroops, but it does not leave money in to restore the electricity, to \nprovide clean water, or to clean up the sewage.\n  There is a lot that has been done in the country already. I hear \ncarping voices saying we did not have any plans for the peace. Well, we \nhad a lot of plans. We had plans to take out Saddam Hussein's \nRepublican Guard and his elite forces before they used gas or \nbiological weapons. We did it. They had plans to protect the oil wells \nso they could not turn Iraq into a blazing inferno, and we did that. We \nhad plans to help the Iraqis get on their feet. In less than 5 months, \nvirtually all major Iraqi hospitals and universities have been \nreopened.\n\n  We cleaned out the weapons caches that were there. There are now \n70,000 Iraqis being armed and trained. The first ones are graduating \nthe end of this week. It took 14 months to establish a police force in \npost-war Germany, 10 years to begin training a new German army. We are \nway ahead.\n  Commerce is opening up. Five thousand Iraqi small businesses have \nbeen opened since liberation. The independent central bank has a new \ncurrency announced in just 2 months. Here is a 5 dinar note from the \nCentral Bank of Iraq. The reason I can read it, it is in English. The \nother side, I will just have to take their word for it. This is the \ncurrency they have put out. It took them 3 years in Germany to do it.\n  The Iraqi Governing Council is making decisions. We listened to Dr. \nChalabi tell us what they plan to do, how they want to move forward, \nand how the participation by the United States in this next step is \nvitally important.\n  To date, our coalition has provided some 8,000 civil affairs projects \nwith their assistance, and we are making progress towards showing the \nIraqis and the people in the neighboring countries that there is a \nbetter way to do it than to have a Saddam Hussein regime.\n  The issue before us in this pending amendment is whether we cut \nreconstruction funds by two-thirds. This was similar to an amendment we \ndebated yesterday in the Appropriations Committee. That amendment just \ncut out two-thirds of the reconstruction funds, left one-third of the \nreconstruction funds. We defeated that. This one cuts out all of the \nreconstruction funds.\n  The arguments made there, and I guess I will let the people who want \nto cut out the reconstruction funds make their arguments here, but they \nsay we ought to go to the donors conference and let the donors decide.\n  What kind of leadership is it for us, on the Senate floor, to take \nthe President's proposal for a $21 billion reconstruction fund and cut \nit to $5 billion? That is leadership? Is that going to cause other \ncountries to step forward and say we are going to make grants?\n  We want to see a strong, independent, free Iraq. We have to turn on \nthe power. We have to turn on the lights. As of yesterday, I believe we \nwere back up to the power generation of the pre-war era, 4,400 \nmegawatts. That still only supplies about 60 percent of Iraq. We are \ntrying to get the power restored. We are trying to get the water clean \nso people do not get sick. We are trying to get the sewage cleaned up \nso they can go about the business of building a civilized government.\n  Some are saying we can use the oil revenues to collateralize. Well, \nthat does not really work because there is no government in Iraq that \ncan sign a loan. They cannot take out a loan at the World Bank. They \nhave not established a constitution, which is a necessary precedent for \nmaking an international loan. If we called it a loan, Ambassador \nBremer, our representative on the provisional governing authority, \nwould have to sign it. It would be our loan. We would be making that \nloan.\n  They have over $200 billion of debts outstanding that I hope they \nwill never pay. The interest on those loans would be more than \nswallowed up by the projected oil revenues. So they are in a position \nwhere there is no practical way that they can repay that.\n  Once we get them up and started and they get a government, then they \ncan go to the World Bank and get loans pledged against future oil \nrevenue, and they can get the capital, but we have to get them over \nthat first hump. Unless and until we do that, there is no government, \nthere is no security. The Iraqis are not controlling their destiny. We \ncannot expect them to carry new burdens of debt. They are going to have \nenough trouble as it is. And we hope to get the oil production up--6 \nmillion barrels a day. That is what Dr. Chalabi said. But it is going \nto require $38 billion of new investment to do it. That is where the \ncollateral will be pledged to get the Iraqi oil production up.\n\n  Do we want to go in and say the reason we came to Iraq was for your \noil? That is not why we went. That is not why we went. We went to stop \nthe production of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The previous administration, President Clinton's administration, and \nour colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle, said that, time \nafter time. We went in to stop weapons of mass destruction, to bring \nsome order out of a country that had been terrorized by a ruthless \ntyrant over the years. Do we want to go in now and tell the people of \nthe Middle East that it really was about oil? We want a claim on your \noil?\n  That would be extremely shortsighted. That is not a sound investment \nin peace.\n  When you take a look at the cost of our maintaining troops over \nthere, the cost of another terrorist attack, the cost we are going to \nhave to face if we do not bring peace and stability to a couple of \nmajor countries in the Middle East--Afghanistan and Iraq--we are going \nto spend a lot more time and shed a lot more American blood before we \ncan see an end to this terrorist war.\n  President Bush said the war against terrorism will be a long one. \nUnfortunately, he was correct. We are going to have to ``bear any \nburden, pay any price.'' I believe a well-known Democratic President \nonce said that; I think he was from Massachusetts.\n  We have to carry on the battle to show the people of the Middle East \nthat there is a better way to protect our people from terrorist \nattacks.\n  There is no question that the battle against terrorism is being \nfought in Baghdad. There are a lot of questions about what went on \nbefore. There will be a report coming out of our Intelligence Committee \non that. I can't go into it, will not go into that until a report is \nissued. But I can tell you right now, when you apply the ``show me'' \ntest that we take in Missouri, the battle against terrorism is going on \nin Baghdad.\n  It is like a roach motel. All the terrorists are coming into Baghdad. \nWe have our best trained, we have our best equipped, we have our best \nprepared troops. We are working to get the best intelligence possible \nso we can destroy the terrorist cells, kill the terrorists, capture \nthem as many as we can.\n  We are fighting the battle in Baghdad rather than Boston or Boise or \nBaldwin, MO, or Burlington, NC.\n  This is unfortunate, where we have to continue the battle on \nterrorism. But we are doing it on their territory and our terms. They \nstarted this war\n\n[[Page S12249]]\n\non our territory on their terms. This is a mark of genius. This is \ntremendous leadership that this administration has shown. I am proud \nthat three-quarters of this body supported the President when he said \nwe needed to go in and clean out this nest of vipers, this fountainhead \nof weapons of mass destruction with the potential of nuclear weapons.\n  We have won the war against Hussein's government. Now we need to win \nthe peace. I am convinced we can win the peace. But I believe, as \nAmbassador Bremer said to us in the Appropriations Committee, as \nSecretary Rumsfeld said, this $21 billion is the best hope we have of \nassuring we win the peace in Iraq. Winning the peace in Iraq is vitally \nimportant.\n  We can't walk away now and leave Iraq to fester and let the Baath \nParty back in again, the remnants of the Republican Guard, the \nterrorist organizations who threatened their neighbors, oppressed their \nown people, and threatened our well-being and safety over the years. We \ncannot let them back in. This $21 billion is the best investment we can \nmake to bring our troops home, to win the peace.\n  I hope we will have a strong vote not to try to cut the peace element \nout of the appropriations bill, moneys that are necessary to make sure \nwe can have our troops there, protect our troops, and maintain order \nagainst the terrorists who are in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 1, 2003]\n\n                      Don't Play Politics On Iraq\n\n                           (By Jim Marshall)\n\n       My first trip to a combat zone occurred in 1969. I was a \n     21-year-old staff sergeant, naive as hell, a freshly trained \n     Army Ranger who had left Princeton University to volunteer \n     for ground combat in Vietnam. I vividly recall feeling way \n     out of step with my Ivy League colleagues.\n       Well, that same out-of-step feeling is back. But this time \n     it's about Iraq and involves some of my professional \n     colleagues, political leaders and activists who are \n     carelessly using words and phrases such as ``quagmire,'' \n     ``our failure in Iraq,'' ``this is just another Vietnam,'' or \n     ``the Bush administration has no plan.''\n       I went to Iraq a couple of weeks ago to resolve for myself \n     the recent contrast between gloomy news coverage and \n     optimistic Pentagon reports of our progress. My trip left no \n     doubt that the Pentagon's version is far closer to reality. \n     Our news coverage disproportionately dwells on the deaths, \n     mistakes and setbacks suffered by coalition forces. Some will \n     attribute this to a grand left-wing conspiracy, but a more \n     plausible explanation is simply the tendency of our news \n     media to focus on bad news. It sells. Few Americans think \n     local news coverage fairly captures the essence of daily life \n     and progress in their hometowns. Coverage from Iraq is no \n     different.\n       Falsely bleak Iraq news circulating in the United States is \n     a serious problem for coalition forces because it discourages \n     Iraqi cooperation, the key to our ultimate success or \n     failure, a daily determinant of life or death for American \n     soldiers. As one example, coalition forces are now \n     discovering nearly 50 percent of the improvised explosive \n     devices through tips. Guess how they discover the rest.\n       We not only need Iraqi tips and intelligence, we need \n     fighting by our side and eventually assuming full \n     responsibility for their internal security. But Iraqis have \n     not forgotten the 1991 Gulf War. America encouraged the \n     Shiites to rebel, then abandoned them to be slaughtered. I \n     visited one of the mass graves, mute testimony to the wisdom \n     of being cautious about relying on American politicians to \n     live up to their commitments.\n       For Iraqis, news of America's resolve is critical to any \n     decision to cooperate with coalition forces, a decision that \n     can lead to death. Newspaper start-up ventures and sales of \n     satellite dishes absolutely exploded following the collapse \n     of Saddam Hussein's regime. With this on top of the Internet, \n     Iraqis do get the picture from America--literally.\n       Many in Washington view the contest for the presidency and \n     control of Congress as a zero-sum game without external costs \n     or benefits. Politicians and activists in each party \n     reflexively celebrate, spread and embellish news that is bad \n     for the opposition. But to do that now with regard to Iraq \n     harms our troops and our effort. Concerning Iraq, this normal \n     political tripe can impose a heavy external cost.\n       It is too soon to determine whether Iraqis will step \n     forward to secure their own freedom. For now, responsible \n     Democrats should carefully avoid using the language of \n     failure. It is false. It endangers our troops and our effort. \n     It can be unforgivably self-fulfilling.\n       Democratic candidates for the presidency should repeatedly \n     hammer home their support, if elected, for helping the Iraqi \n     people secure their own freedom. It is fine for each to \n     contend that he or she is a better choice for securing \n     victory in Iraq. But in making this argument, care should be \n     taken not to dwell on perceived failures of the current team \n     or plan. Americans, with help from commentators and others, \n     will decide this for themselves.\n       Instead of being negative about Iraq, Democratic \n     presidential candidates should emphasize the positive aspects \n     of their own plans for Iraq. Save the negative attacks for \n     the issues of jobs and the economy. Iraqis are far less \n     likely to support the coalition effort if they think America \n     might withdraw following the 2004 election.\n       Finally, no better signal of our commitment to this effort \n     could currently be provided than for Congress to quickly \n     approve, with little dissent or dithering, the president's \n     request for an additional $87 billion for Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. Of course no one wants to spend such a sum. But \n     it is well worth it if it leads to a stable, secular \n     representative government in Iraq, something that could \n     immeasurably improve our future national security.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I listened with great interest to my \nfriend from Missouri. There is much that he had to say with which I \nagree. Except I wish we would, as they say in my home State--he was \nusing Missouri phrases--I wish he would get real and others would get \nreal about the connection between the likelihood of America's being \nstruck by another terrorist attack and our fighting in Baghdad.\n  I don't know one security expert who will tell you, including, as \nquoted by Senator Reid earlier today, General Abizaid, that the folks \nwe are fighting in the streets of Baghdad and in Iraq are the ones most \nlikely to strike the United States of America. That is not what our \nofficials tell us.\n  General Abizaid said, and I am paraphrasing him, that any attack \nwould be organized internationally. It will come from other places. As \na matter of fact, the argument can be made, because of a requirement of \nbeing so preoccupied and having to devote so many resources to Iraq, we \nare unable to spend the money we need to spend on homeland security.\n  For example, we have 106 nuclear powerplants, none of which are \nsecure, in the United States of America.\n  We have train tunnels in New York where 350,000 people today will \nride through them sitting in a car. Those tunnels are not secured; \nthere is no escape, no ventilation, and no lighting.\n  We are cutting the police program, so we are not going to supply \nmoney for local law enforcement. It is not going to be a special forces \nguy with night vision goggles who is going to come across a terrorist \nwho is about to poison the reservoir in a city or about to plant a bomb \nin a movie theater or about to do anything else--it is going to be a \nlocal cop.\n  That is not the reason I rose to speak today, but I wish we would get \nit straight about terror. In the larger sense, we have to deal with the \nwar on terror by dealing with the situation in the Middle East. I don't \ndisagree with that.\n  As was said in an article written not too long ago by Timothy Ash and \nhow the west could be won, I quote him:\n\n       To emerge ultimately the victorious against the war on \n     terrorism it is the peace we have to win first in Iraq and \n     then in the wider Middle East.\n\n  In the broad sense of the word, it is affected by what happens in \nIraq. But the idea that because we are fighting in Baghdad, we are not \nlikely to be attacked again in the subway, or an aircraft, or whatever, \nbecause they are preoccupied is as our British friends say, poppycock.\n  Many Members in this Chamber and millions of Americans did not \nsupport the war in Iraq. The same goes for the millions of people \naround the world. But I did. I voted to give President Bush the \nauthority to use force in Iraq. For me, the question was not whether we \nhad to deal with Saddam Hussein but when and how, and what we were \ngoing to do after we brought him down.\n  I believed then and I believe now it was the responsibility of the \nUnited States and the international community to enforce the solemn \nobligation Saddam Hussein made when he sued for peace in the gulf war \nin 1991. Those of us who understand the value of international \ninstitutions and rules must also understand that when rules and \ninstitutions are flouted, they must be defended, and by force if \nnecessary. That was, in my view, the underlying rationale to go to war \nin Iraq, a rationale enhanced by the fact that the one flouting the \nrule was a homicidal tyrant who murdered hundreds of thousands of \npeople and who, if left alone, would have eventually acquired weapons \nof\n\n[[Page S12250]]\n\nmass destruction, although he had none and there was no evidence he had \nany. But he would have gotten those weapons. That was the reason--not \nsome idea of preemption. We didn't need a new doctrine of preemption to \ngo after Saddam Hussein. He violated essentially a peace agreement he \nsigned in 1991. Had it been 1919 when he was defeated in Kuwait, he \nwould have been in Versailles, in France, signing a peace agreement. \nInstead, he was representing the United Nations and he signed on to \nUnited Nations resolutions, none of which he kept and I believe needed \nto be enforced.\n  But I also believed then, as I believe now, that this administration \ngot the when and the how and the what we do the day after dangerously \nwrong in Iraq. This administration wrongly painted Iraq as an imminent \nthreat to our society, something many of us at the time--not just now--\nsaid was not the case. It hyped the intelligence most likely to raise \nalarm bells of the American people. In speech after speech, television \nappearance after television appearance, the most senior administration \nofficials told us Iraq was on the verge of possessing a nuclear weapon.\n  Indeed, at the same time I was on a show, the Vice President on a \nsimilar show on a Sunday told us Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear \nweapons program. I didn't believe then, I don't believe now, and there \nis no evidence that that is true.\n  We are told that Iraq had UAVs--unmanned aerial vehicles--that could \ndrop lethal payloads on our shores--payloads of chemical and biological \nweapons; that Iraq could weaponize its chemical and biological arsenal \nin just 45 minutes; that the regime had a clear and present tie to al-\nQaida, and they implied that they were complicit in the events of 9/\n11--none of which I believe to be true. Yet I still voted to go into \nIraq because it wasn't about if but when we dealt with this guy.\n\n  The administration stated each of these allegations as accepted facts \nwhen in fact there was deep debate on each and every one of them within \nour own intelligence community. I believe the administration did this \nto create a false sense of urgency about the need to act immediately \nand that as a result we went to war too soon.\n  There is no reason we could not have waited a month or even 6 months \nor whatever time it took to build a true international coalition \nwithout in any way jeopardizing American security. And we went to war \nwithout the rest of the world.\n  As many of us said at the time--and the record will reflect--we \ndidn't believe we needed a single soldier from another country to win \nthe war. I stood on this floor and said I thought we would win this war \nin terms of defeating Saddam's government in much less than a month and \nmaybe as little as 2 weeks. I said it at the time. My fight was never \nwith the need for other troops to help us fight the war. But it was \nabsolutely clear from every expert we spoke to in my committee and \nfolks on the Council on Foreign Relations, folks from Rand, folks from \nall over this country who are experts on foreign policy, that we were \ngoing to need other countries to win the peace--to win the peace--which \nwas going to be considerably harder.\n  Just to put in perspective what we all know, we have had 313 men and \nwomen killed, 1,600 wounded--138 to win the war and 175 dead just \nstarting to win the peace.\n  On this floor I said if we did not have the support of the \ninternational community, somewhere between 2 and 10 body bags a week \nwould be coming home. But this unilateralism, this idea that we didn't \nneed anybody else, was not only misplaced but, for some in the \nadministration, arrogance.\n  So we went to war with the Brits and a coalition--a coalition which \nwas the most anemic coalition with whom we have ever gone to war, after \nthe Brits; the one without the rest of the world. And as many of us \nsaid at the time--and I wasn't the only one. Senator Lugar said it; \nSenator Hagel said it; a number of other Republicans said it--we didn't \nneed a single soldier to win the war, but we needed tens of thousands \nof soldiers to secure the peace--tens of thousands.\n  The chief of the Army got sacked because he dared to suggest we were \ngoing to need a couple hundred thousand troops to secure the peace when \nMr. Rumsfeld--or at least the administration--was implying we wouldn't \nneed more than 30,000 folks and we would be out of there in 6 months.\n  Just as bad, we went without a plan for the day after.\n  Don't just take my word for this. Keep in mind that I have been \nsupporting the President, and I will support this appropriation. But \nthere was no serious planning. General Garner said he didn't begin \nplanning and wasn't asked until January 6. I was chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and we held hearings in July of 2002. And \nwitness after witness after witness--former Commanders of NATO, former \nCommanders of CENTCOM--said the plan for peace should be running \nparallel with the plan for war. During those hearings, we wanted to \nknow what was going to happen not just the day after but the decade \nafter.\n  The President, I am told, has told people and I have told people. He \nasked me in front of a half dozen of my colleagues in the Cabinet Room \nback in September why I wasn't with him enthusiastically about going in \nand why I was insisting on him going to the United Nations. I went in \nthe Oval Office with him and said, Mr. President, I want to remind you \nthere is a reason your father did not go to Baghdad. And he looked at \nme like I was going to insult his father, for whom I have great \nrespect. I said, Mr. President, the reason your father didn't go to \nBaghdad, he didn't want to stay for 5 years. Are you ready to stay? \nObviously, I did not say it in that tone to the President but I asked, \nAre you ready to stay, Mr. President?\n\n  What was the impression given to the American people? The impression \nwas Johnny and Jane were going to come marching home by Christmas. Why \nare you National Guard folks so angry? Is it because you are not \npatriotic? Why are the reservists so angry? Is it because they are not \npatriotic? Heck, no, they are angry because they were led to believe it \nwas not going to cost much, it was not going to take long, and we would \nbe out of there.\n  Mr. BOND. May I ask if the distinguished Senator from Delaware will \nyield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent the vote in relation to the Byrd \namendment No. 1794 occur at 3:45 today; provided that no amendments be \nin order to the amendment prior to the vote; provided further that \nfollowing the vote, Senator McConnell be recognized to offer an \namendment. I further ask consent that following the disposition of the \nMcConnell amendment, the next amendment in order to the bill be offered \nby Senator Biden.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, I was told it would be \n4:45. I've been waiting for 4 hours to speak and I have at least \nanother 30 minutes to speak. If it is 3:45, I would object.\n  Mr. REID. How about if we made it 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. BIDEN. This is fine.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri amend his request to allow that.\n  I know Senator Smith is here to speak. How long do you wish to speak?\n  Mr. SMITH. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I don't think I will take this long, but so I don't get \ncalled on it, I will say half an hour.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that will be 10 minutes before 4 o'clock, so \nI ask if my friend would be further kind enough to allow Senator Biden \nanother 30 minutes, Senator Smith 10 minutes, Senator Boxer 8 minutes, \nand then we would vote.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I so amend the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, my committee, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, pleaded with the administration, month after month, \nbeginning well over a year ago, to share with us plans for \nreconstruction. We got obfuscation upon obfuscation, a rosy scenario \nabout oil revenues and being greeted as liberators, with most of our \ntroops coming home by Christmas.\n  When we really pressed--a certain word has worked its way into the \nlexicon of this administration--we were told the answer was \n``unknowable.'' I have never heard that word used as many times \nanywhere, let alone by the administration.\n\n[[Page S12251]]\n\n  In fact, the problems and prescriptions of postwar Iraq were \nabsolutely knowable. From the many hearings Senator Lugar and I \nconvened over this year as well as the Armed Services Committee, and \nthe work of our leading think tanks and policy experts from within the \nadministration itself, thanks to the State Department Future of Iraq \nProject, whose detailed postwar plans were apparently ignored by the \nDepartment of Defense, much of this was knowable.\n  We are paying a very high price for those mistakes now. I share the \nwidespread dismay at the miscalculations of this administration. I \nshare the shock of many that the reason the administration says it took \nus to war, weapons of mass destruction, no longer is of any apparent \ninterest to the most senior administration officials. I share the \nfrustration of Members of Congress that because of the administration's \nmany miscalculations leading up to war, the good options are gone and \nwe are now left to find the least bad of the remaining options.\n  I understand the sticker shock many of my colleagues feel about the \n$87 billion. I suspect my friend from Oregon, who was on this \ncommittee, I know for my friend Senator Lugar, I know for my friend \nSenator Hagel, I know for my friend Senator McCain, it came as no \nshock, none whatever.\n  To be blunt, the reason there is such consternation in the Congress \nand the country at the moment is not about the $87 billion, \nnotwithstanding that is an enormous amount. It is that we have lost \nfaith in the President. It is that we lost our confidence in his \nability to prosecute the peace. It is that we have great doubts since \nthere were so many fundamental miscalculations made about what would \nhappen after the regime fell. There is reason people are upset in the \nSenate. They doubt this administration has its act together.\n  My Republican friends will deny what the whole world knows publicly \nand privately acknowledge there is a giant rift in this administration \nas broad and as deep as the San Andreas Fault. On one side of the \nadministration there is Mr. Cheney, a fine man, Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. \nWolfowitz, Mr. Feif; on the other side there is the State Department \nand the uniformed military.\n  Think about this one little piece, talking about the plan. What was \nthe plan announced in great detail by Mr. Rumsfeld as to what would \nhappen immediately after Saddam fell? There was guy named Jake Garner, \na retired general, who was going to be dropped into Iraq along with a \nguy named Ahmed Chalabi, whom I know well, spent an hour with him alone \nin my office last night, the head of the Iraqi National Congress, that \nGarner announced when he hit the ground there would be elections within \na couple of months and that he was going to run the show.\n  How long did it take the President to figure out that was a gigantic \nmistake? About 2 weeks. And he should be complimented for it.\n\n  All this malarkey about the planning, where is Garner? Where did he \ngo? What happened to the election that was going to take place in a \ncouple months?\n  The administration got on the ground and realized they did not have a \nplan. So they got a guy named Bremer, first-rate guy, diplomat. Guess \nwhat. That diplomat does not report to the Secretary of State; he \nreports to the Secretary of Defense. Isn't that kind of interesting?\n  Assume we have gone in and the planning post-Saddam was as successful \nas the planning to take down Saddam. Assume we had gone in and the \ninternational community was doing what they do in every other \ncircumstance where we are building the peace: We usually supply 25 \npercent of the money, they supply 75 percent of the money--Bosnia, \nKosovo, even Afghanistan, NATO is now in. Assume we were not losing \nAmericans at the rate we are losing now. Assume this guy named Bremer, \na former official at the State Department, former comptroller, sent to \nIraq by the Secretary of Defense, did not come back and say the window \nof opportunity to win the peace is closing rapidly in Iraq. Assume he \ncame back and said, the window is wide open. We have time and things \nare moving. Would people in the Senate be flyspecking the $87 billion? \nNo.\n  My friend from Missouri has been in politics as long as I have. \nPresidents get pretty broad support when what they propose is working. \nWhat is happening here--and again, keep in mind, I'm for this \nmoney. But I am angry about what happened. I am angry about the refusal \nto listen. I am angry that we are there alone when we did not have to \nbe.\n\n  The administrations's assumptions were dead wrong, and the President \ntold the American people our mission was accomplished when he landed on \nthat aircraft carrier. And it had not even begun. It has not even \nbegun. And you wonder why the American people are mad. You wonder why, \nwhen you go home--and those of us who supported it going in are getting \nour brains kicked in at home--Democrat and Republican, we are wondering \nwhy the polls show--what?--57, 58, 60 percent of the American people \nsay: Don't vote for this money.\n  The reason is, they were not leveled with. It seems to me that \nexplains why there is so much concern on both sides of the aisle about \nthis supplemental. That explains why it is so important that we do more \nthan simply vote yea or nay on this $87 billion, why we need to have \nclear assurances from this administration that it understands--not \nacknowledges--just understands its mistakes to date and has a sensible \nplan to rectify them.\n  So for all the errors of the past, we must confront the reality of \nthe present and the imperative of the future. The reality of the \npresent is that the window of opportunity is closing on our ability to \nbring peace to Iraq.\n  As I said, that is not just my conclusion. It is the conclusion of \nthe former Deputy Defense Secretary, John Hamre, who was sent there by \nthe Defense Department. The imperative of the future is that we cannot \nafford to lose the peace in Iraq.\n  Losing the peace in Iraq is not about terror alone. It is so much \nbigger than that. Losing the peace in Iraq would condemn the United \nStates to deal with the consequences of Iraq: chaos, not just in more \nterrorism but what will happen.\n  If we lose Iraq, Iran becomes an incredibly empowered nation; Syria \nbecomes more emboldened; Turkey, an Islamic government, seeing a failed \nstate on their border, becomes more radicalized; Iran, surrounded by \nthe failed states of Iraq and Afghanistan, puts in jeopardy the very \nexistence of Pakistan.\n  Doesn't it occur to you a little bit why all of a sudden the \naccusations are the ISI is cooperating with the Pastun warlords in \nsouthern Afghanistan? These guys have figured it out. They are hedging \ntheir bets. They are hedging their bets. And if the Musharraf falls in \nPakistan, we are not talking about an Iraq, we are not talking about an \nAfghanistan, we are talking about a nuclear power that my friend on the \nIntelligence Committee knows, as well as I do, is seething--seething--\nwith terror. There is a whole province in northwestern Pakistan that is \ntotally uncontrollable, where most people think bin Laden is and Omar \nis, that they will not go in and we cannot go in.\n  So I wish to heck we would stop this stuff about: We are fighting \nterror in Baghdad. We are, but it is so much bigger than that, and the \nAmerican people have not been told it.\n  So we cannot afford to lose the peace.\n  I will make another outrageous prediction. If we lose the peace in \nIraq, you will see at least two of the following countries fall--\nJordan, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia. How will King Hussein stand with Iraq \nin shambles? How will that happen? How will any voice of moderation be \nwilling to speak up anywhere in the Middle East if Iraq falls? And you \nknow why Iraq may fall, beyond our mistakes? Because we have not \nleveled with the American people, and they may very well say: Bring the \nboys home.\n\n  I know my colleagues think I am a broken record on the Senate floor \nsaying this so many times, but the one thing we all learned from the \nVietnam generation--no matter whether we were for or against it, went \nor did not--is that no foreign policy can be sustained without the \ninformed consent of the American people, their informed consent before \nwe act.\n  In short, losing the peace would reinforce the view held by the \nextremists in the Arab and Islamic world that while the United States \ncan project\n\n[[Page S12252]]\n\npower, we have no staying power, and that all they have to do is wait \nus out.\n  It would confirm the concerns of many moderate Arab regimes expressed \nbefore we went to war with Iraq that we would not finish the job.\n  I think it is fair to say I met with every Arab head of state as \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I traveled to the region; \nI traveled to Afghanistan; I traveled to northern Iraq--all before the \nwar. I did not meet one Arab leader who defended Saddam Hussein. Yet I \ndid not meet a single one who said anything other than what I am about \nto paraphrase: If you go, make sure you finish the job because if you \ndo not, I am dead.\n  Our credibility in Iraq and the region and across the globe will be \nat rock bottom if we do not successfully secure the peace. America and \nAmericans will be far less secure to boot.\n  We have to show the wisdom and the commitment to help Iraq write a \ndifferent future so we can have a different future. And this \nsupplemental request is critical to that effort. We have to succeed in \ntransforming Iraq into a stable, unified country, with a representative \ngovernment. And success in that effort would begin the process of \nredrawing the strategic map of the region. It could boost the reformers \nin Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and elsewhere who have put Syria and its \nallies and Hezbollah on the defensive, and improve the climate of \nIsraeli-Palestinian peace. It would deal a significant setback to those \nwho argue that the only future for Arabs and Muslims is one of \nreligious extremism, perpetual conflict, economic stagnation, and \nautocratic governments.\n  So we are faced with a real choice. I say to my colleagues who \nopposed the use of force in the first place, who believe there is \nnothing this administration can do to win the peace, and who have \nconcluded that the dire consequences I have just predicted if we cut \nand run are outweighed by the consequences of being dragged down into a \nlong, protracted war, I respect their vote to say no. I disagree with \nthem, but I respect it.\n  I have concluded that the peace is winnable but not without a change \nof attitude and direction on the part of this administration.\n  I am convinced that winning the peace is possible if the President \nkeeps to the new course he seemed to set two weeks ago when he finally \naddressed the American people.\n  He vowed to make Iraq the world's problem, not just our own, by going \nback to the U.N. and seeking support of its members for troops, police \nand money.\n  And the President began to level with American people about the hard \nroad ahead to win the peace in terms of time, troops and treasure.\n  If he sticks to that course, tells us how we are going to pay for the \n$87 billion, and shows us a clear and coherent game plan, I believe we \nshould give him, and all of us, one last chance to get it right in \nIraq.\n  Since the President addressed the Nation, I have to admit I have been \ngiven many new reasons to be skeptical that the administration has \ngenuinely changed course.\n  The President's speech to the U.N. missed a crucial opportunity to \nrally the world to our side, just as he missed opportunities to get the \nworld with us before the war and in its immediate aftermath.\n  He should have made clear our willingness to bridge the differences \nwith our allies on a new U.N. resolution and to grant the U.N. real \nauthority. He should have laid our some specifics, and asked--asked--\nfor help.\n  So I am left questioning the sincerity of the President's midcourse \ncorrection.\n  If we want the world to share the burden, we have to share authority \nin Iraq in meaningful way.\n  The payers want to be players.\n  And I can't believe we can't find a compromise that meets our \nrightful concerns about the premature transfer of power. But that also \nempowers the U.N. and starts to put more power in the hands of the \nIraqi people.\n  I am also skeptical that the President will continue to level with \nthe American people about what it is going to take to win the peace. \nBeing open and honest about the commitment we must make to Iraq is the \nonly way to sustain public support. But the administration's approach \nto the supplemental concerns me on this account too.\n  The administration itself estimates the total cost of reconstruction \nin Iraq to be about $60 to $70 billion over the next 4 to 5 years. And \nI and others predict the final tab will be higher still.\n  The supplemental request covers $20 billion of that total. That begs \na critical question: Where is the remaining $40 to $50 billion coming \nfrom? Will it come from the international community? Normally, that \nwould be a reasonable expectation. The United States typically covers \nabout 25 percent of postconflcit reconstruction costs. By that ratio, \nwe could expect about $60 billion from the international community for \nIraq.\n  But we so poisoned the well in the lead up to this war and in its \naftermath that no one expects the international community to provide \nmore than $2 to $3 billion at the donors conference next month. That is \na terrible indictment of our foreign policy and a harsh example of the \nprice of unilateralism.\n  Will the missing money be generated by Iraq's oil revenues? That is \nwhat the administration led the American people to believe, and \nunfortunately even some Members of Congress now believe that is true.\n  In fact, if we are lucky, oil exports will generate about $14 billion \nnext year--just enough money to pay for the government's operating \ncosts and salaries for public sector workers, the police and the army. \nForget about oil paying for reconstruction.\n  Will the missing money be generated by others parts of the Iraqi \neconomy? Secretary Rumsfeld recently promoted the potential of Iraq's \ntourism industry. The banks of the Tigris may replace the Outer Banks \nas a destination of choice someday, but not any day soon.\n  Or maybe the missing money will come from taxpayers when the \nadministration comes back to Congress next year or the year after to \nask for more. If that is the plan, tell us now.\n  For today, this Congress must deal with the money that is being \nrequested.\n  Let me be clear, we must invest more in the effort to secure the \npeace in Iraq. I support the supplemental request. It is necessary and \nit is in our national security interest.\n  But that does not mean we should accept it on its face. The large \nnumber of proposed amendments to the supplemental are evidence that \nRepublicans and Democrats alike don't have the confidence to take the \nadministration at its word.\n  We need to build in strict reporting requirements--the kind Senator \nLugar and I tried to add to the original congressional authorization to \nuse force.\n  We need to know how the administration will pay for this \nsupplemental. We need to know how the money will be spent. And we need \nto see a coherent, detailed plan for success.\n  The first critical question that must be answered is: How are we \ngoing to pay for this $87 billion? It seems to me there are three \noptions: We can turn the money for reconstruction from a grant to a \nloan, to be recouped from Iraq when its economy gets going again. That \nsounds attractive. Why shouldn't the Iraqis pay for their own future.\n  But here's the problem. Iraq already owes the international community \na crippling amount--some $200 billion in debt and compensation claims. \nAdding to that debt will add to the dead weight holding back Iraq's \nrecovery.\n  The creditors are mostly European and Arab countries--the very \ncountries we are encouraging to contribute more to Iraq's \nreconstruction. And we are lobbying them to forgive or reschedule the \ndebt Iraq owes them.\n  How can we add to Iraq's debt, put ourselves first in line to be paid \nback, kick the other creditors out of line--and ask them to contribute \nmore and assume our debt? It won't work.\n  Second, we can do what the President is proposing: add to the \ndeficit, which is already close to $600 billion and pass along the bill \nto our children and grandchildren. That, to me, is unacceptable.\n  Or third, we can call on the patriotism of the American people, and \nask them to help finance the $87 billion the President has asked for. \nThe President was right in saying that success in Iraq requires all of \nus to sacrifice. But he\n\n[[Page S12253]]\n\nsquandered the opportunity to rally the most fortunate among us to the \ncause to help provide for our troops and meet the goal of achieving \nsecurity and stability in Iraq.\n  The bottom line is: The President doesn't seem to have a plan to pay \nfor troop support and reconstruction in both Afghanistan and Iraq. \nAfter squandering an annual Federal budget surplus in excess of $200 \nbillion upon taking office, and running up annual deficits estimated at \nnearly $500 billion in less than 3 years, it would be fiscally \nirresponsible for this administration to pass on the cost of our \nsecurity to our children and grandchildren. That gets it exactly \nbackwards.\n\n  We must step up to pay for our own security and that of future \ngenerations. In fact, as the President said in his State of the Union \nAddress:\n\n       This country has many challenges.\n       We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass \n     along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, \n     and other generations.\n       We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.\n\n  In keeping with that view, the most obvious, fiscally responsible \napproach is to reconsider a small portion of the $690 billion tax cuts \ntargeted for Americans with incomes in the top 2 percent--people with \nincomes exceeding $360,000 and averaging $980,000 per year.\n  Cutting taxes responsibly in the middle of a jobless recovery, \nespecially for the middle class, makes good sense. But never has any \nadministration summoned Americans to war and, at the same time, pushed \nthrough the biggest tax cuts in history, all in the face of already \nhistorically high deficits.\n  The result is a mixed message to the American people, who are left to \nwonder: How can we wage the fight against terrorism without paying any \nprice? In fact, the administration's thinking reflects a woeful \nmisunderstanding of the character of the American people.\n  I this post 9/11 period, Americans have been waiting to be asked to \ndo great things for this Nation.\n  Two years after that dark day, we have yet to tap into the surge of \npatriotism deeply felt by every American. Imagine if the President's \naddress to the Nation had included the following request:\n\n       To all of you in the top one percent--those fortunate \n     Americans whose average income is more than $1 million a year \n     . . .\n       I am asking you to forgo a small part of your tax cut.\n       Instead of getting $690 billion of cuts, you will have to \n     make do with only $600 billion in cuts so we can pay for \n     peace in Iraq, security in Afghanistan, and the war against \n     terrorism.\n\n  Would a single American watching on television have said: ``No way. \nThat's not fair.'' Of course not.\n  Reducing a small part of the tax cuts for those in the top 1 percent \nof income will have no bearing on an economic recovery. But it would \nrestore a sense of national purpose and unity that is our country's \ngreatest strength.\n  I hope the President will support an amendment to do just that--a \nbipartisan amendment to the supplemental that Senator Kerry and I will \noffer, along with Senators Chafee, Corzine, and Feinstein.\n  I think Americans would support the idea of paying for this mission \nfrom the $1.8 trillion in tax cuts enacted in the last 3 years.\n  Let's look at the numbers. Americans in this bracket make, on \naverage, $1 million a year. They are being asked to give up a single \nyear's worth of their $690 billion 10-year tax cut, and do it \ngradually.\n  For example, in a single year, 2008, the tax cuts going to the top 1 \npercent will total $87.7 billion--virtually the same amount of money \nthe President is requesting.\n  In my view, the most fortunate Americans surely would respond \nfavorably to such an idea. What we are saying is: They are no less \npatriotic than anyone else. But also they have the best ability to \ncontribute because their tax cut is so much greater than everyone \nelse's.\n  The top 1 percent will get a cumulative 10-year tax cut of nearly \n$690 billion. What I am proposing leaves them with a $600 billion tax \ncut. That is clearly not punitive. If someone proposed today that the \nrichest 1 percent get a tax cut of $600 billion, it would sound \noutrageous given the circumstances we now face, with growing deficits, \nand growing security needs.\n  In making this proposal, I am not arguing about the fairness of that \ndistribution. I have already stated my position on that when I voted \nagainst the tax cuts. But, whatever one thinks of the fairness of the \ntax cuts themselves, it is clear which Americans are in the best \nposition to give up a small part of what they are getting to pay for \nour mission in Iraq. And that, unfortunately, is the price we have to \npay for the unilateral foreign policy and the missed opportunities of \nthis administration.\n  If we give the administration the money it is seeking for Iraq's \nreconstruction, it must give us a clear and coherent plan for \nsucceeding where it has failed so far.\n  The No. 1 priority must be to inject a sense of urgency to our \nefforts. I don't want to minimize how hard this is, nor do I want to \nminimize the successes we have already achieved: Standing up the Iraqi \nGoverning Council, opening schools and hospitals, establishing local \ncouncils across the country. But all of this progress is jeopardized by \nour failure thus far to get it right in two fundamental areas: security \nand basic services.\n  If the Iraqi people do not soon see their living conditions improve, \nthey will begin to turn against us. Once that happens, the insecurity \nwe are seeing today will look mild by comparison.\n  In my judgment, there are five urgent priorities in Iraq.\n  We need a detailed gameplan to address them. And that plan should be \ndeveloped in close consultation with the Iraqi Governing Council.\n  First, we must improve the security situation on the ground for our \nsoldiers and for the Iraqi people. Over time, an Iraqi army can and \nshould take the place of our troops. But it will take time to train \nsuch a force 1, 2, 3 years.\n  In the meantime, the best way to take some of the heat off of our \nforces is to bring other countries in on the deal.\n  That is one reason a new U.N. resolution is important. If we had done \nthis right from the start, we would have been able to secure 60,000 or \n70,000 foreign troops. I doubt we will get more than another 10,000. \nBut every single foreign soldier helps.\n  For Iraqis, law and order has broken down in large parts of the \ncountry, especially in Baghdad and central Iraq. Murder, carjackings, \ntheft, and rape are taking place at an alarming rate. Criminal gangs \nare organizing at a rate far faster than we are fielding trained Iraqi \npolice.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about whether the number of foreign \nmilitary forces on the ground is adequate. What does not receive nearly \nenough attention is the urgent need to recruit international police \nforces to train and work alongside the Iraqi police. Our own officials \ntell us that we urgently need over 5,000 international police to train \nand patrol with Iraqis. We should have deployed them over 5 months ago \nwhen Baghdad fell. We should have started recruiting them 12 months \nago, just as President Clinton personally got on the phone to world \nleaders to recruit police months before we went into Haiti. Yet, to my \nknowledge, less than 10 percent of the international police forces we \nneed are on the ground.\n  Only Iraqis can effectively police Iraq. They know their country \nbetter than any foreigner. But we also know that the police under \nSaddam were corrupt and sadistic. They maintained order through fear \nand coercion. We have to start from scratch in recruiting and training \nan Iraqi police force. But that effort can't occur on a large scale \nuntil we get trainers in from abroad. And we can if the President \nbuilds an effective coalition, if he reaches out to our allies, and \nrecruits those forces.\n  The second priority is to restore basic services--particularly \nelectricity, water, and telephone service.\n  Ambassador Bremer set the end of September as a deadline for \nrestoring electricity to its prewar level of 4,400 megawatts. This is \nenough to meet about two-thirds of countrywide demand.\n  While falling temperatures will ease demand in coming weeks, toward \nthe end of October, the month of fasting or Ramadan will begin. Iraqis \nwill expect to have electricity available during the evening meal when \nthey break their fast. If they don't, we should expect their discontent \nto grow. It will take huge investments to bring the electricity grid up \nto the level where it can\n\n[[Page S12254]]\n\nmeet full demand countrywide. Ambassador Bremer estimates $13 billion. \nAnother official in Baghdad puts the price tag at a total of $21 \nbillion.\n  The third urgent priority is a strategic communications plan. The \nUnited States has the most advanced media industry in the world, yet we \nare being beaten on Iraqi airwaves by the likes of al-Jazeera and \nIranian TV and radio. The messages these outlets are broadcasting do \nnot cast the United States in a positive light.\n  The quality of our broadcasts in Iraq makes public access TV look \ngood. It is hard to imagine succeeding in Iraq if we cannot succeed at \ngetting our message out.\n  Few Iraqis have a sense of the priorities, plans, and progress of the \nUnited States. We need to communicate effectively and directly with \nthem. They need to hear us acknowledge their problems. They need to \nhear us describe our plans for fixing them. They need to hear \ntimetables. It is not that complicated.\n  Our fourth urgent priority is helping to rebuild Iraq's economy. The \nIraqi economy is broken. It was destroyed by 35 years of mismanagement, \nwars, sanctions, and extensive looting that followed Iraq's liberation. \nIt will take several years to recover.\n  Unemployment is over 60 percent. By contrast, at the height of the \nGreat Depression, our unemployment was just over 25 percent. A hot, \npoor, unemployed, and well-armed population is not a good combination. \nWe need to get people off the streets and involved in their country's \nreconstruction.\n  The final priority is to establish a clear timeline for handing power \nback to the Iraqis. There is a legitimate debate going on with the \nFrench over the pace of ``Iraqi-ization'' and the timing of elections. \nAll of us want to see sovereignty restored to Iraq as quickly as \npossible. But none of us want a process that is so rushed that it ends \nin failure.\n  Today, the best organized forces in Iraq are extremist religious \ngroups and ex-Baathists. They have the most to gain from early \nelections.\n  Building a strong, democratic center and the institutions of civil \nsociety will take time. We should seek a compromise at the U.N. that \ncreates a representative--perhaps partially elected--body that would \ndraft the new Iraqi constitution by early next year. That constitution \nshould be put before the people of Iraq in a referendum, and elections \nshould follow by next summer.\n  The administration should submit a detailed plan with specific \nbenchmarks and timelines in each of these areas I have mentioned.\n  The administration also must show us that, in working toward these \ngoals, it will spend the tax payers' money wisely. I have looked \nclosely at the budget request, as have most of my colleagues. And we \nhave a lot of questions. To cite just three examples:\n  Why does the administration propose to spend $33,000 apiece for \npickup trucks when you can get a new pickup here in the U.S. for \n$14,000? Our Iraqi friends deserve AC--but not leather seats and a CD \nchanger.\n  Why does the administration propose to spend $10,000 per student for \na month-long business course--more than double the monthly cost of \nHarvard Business School?\n  Why does it propose to spend $50,000 per prison bed--double the \naverage cost in the U.S.?\n  The bottom line is that we have an obligation to closely scrutinize \nthe President's request, to ensure we spend taxpayer dollars wisely and \neffectively. But we must face up to our foreign policy and national \nsecurity obligations as well. We cannot meet our national security \nneeds on the cheap, or by playing off domestic constituencies against \nour need to get it right in Iraq.\n  The stakes are too high, and an entire region's future--one that is \ncritical to America's security--is in the balance. Let's not take our \neye off the ball. Let's do the difficult thing, but the right thing.\n  Madam President, I just sum up by telling you what is in my heart. We \nhave three stark, basic choices. It is real simple. Given the facts--\nthe fact is, it is going to take years to build, not a democracy, just \na representative republic in Iraq. Never in history--never in history--\neven in countries with a tradition of western values and democracy, has \na representative democratic government been built in a short amount of \ntime--never. I challenge you to challenge your staffs to give me an \nexample where that has occurred.\n  So, No. 1, it is going to take a long time. It is going to take tens \nof billions of dollars beyond this. Mr. Bremer has begun to level, and \nlevel first with us. He says after this $20 billion downpayment for \nreconstruction, it is a minimum of $50 to $75 billion more--more--over \nthe next 4 years or so to do the essentials, to rebuild Iraq. Other \nthink tanks have said it is $100 billion. The World Bank says $75 \nbillion or so. That is another essential fact.\n  The third fact is this country has never been a country--never. It \nwas the outgrowth of a deal made after World War I. So we are putting \ntogether not a Germany, which was heterogenous, not a France, not a \ndefeated or victor in the last war, or big war; we are putting together \na country that has never been a country, other than held together by a \ndictator or an autocrat or a colonial power. It is going to take a lot \nof time.\n\n  Here is where we are. It is very simple. It is going to cost--\neverybody knows--billions of more dollars beyond this supplemental. It \nis going to take thousands of somebody's troops beyond those that are \nthere. And it is going to take a long time.\n  The choices are clear. We continue in our unilateral ways to take 95 \npercent of the casualties, pay 99 percent of the bill. One of the \nthings my colleagues know is that the Poles are being paid for by us. \nGod love them, they are there; we are happy they are there. Those other \n20 nations are being paid for by us, but for Great Britain. So we get \n95 percent of the deaths. We pay 90 percent of the bill, and we take 99 \npercent of the responsibility. That is one option.\n  The second option is--and which I predict this administration will do \nif this does not go right--declare victory and leave and see chaos \nensue. Some Democrats will suggest that. Some in the administration \nwill suggest that.\n  Or there is a third option. We get someone else to pay the bill with \nus. We get someone else to pay.\n  There is a fourth option that is not a real option. The Iraqis could \npay. Let's get this straight about Iraqi oil. No one before the war or \nafter the war is predicting in the next 5 or 6 years there will be more \nthan an excess of $5 to $10 billion a year to be able to pay for \nreconstruction after the cost of paying for the government. Read \nBremer's report. So this is poppycock about Iraqi oil will pay our way \nout.\n  We are left with the last option: We get the rest of the world to \njump in the tank with us. At the beginning of this process, the \nPresident tried to importune the Indian foreign minister to send a \ndivision. The Secretary of State and others said we are likely to get \nthat. The Turks were talking about a division. We were looking for 50 \nto 60,000 troops. Guess what. They ain't coming, folks.\n  Here is the deal, and it is real simple. The President can genuinely \ninternationalize this by sharing not only the responsibility but \nsharing the authority. We continue to act like Iraq is a prize we won. \nWe continue to challenge the world to help us.\n  I went to the head of the European Union not long ago and I said: \nJavier, what do we have to do to get your help?\n  He looked at me, held my shoulders, and said: Joe, ask. Not demand, \nnot challenge, ask. Ask. Ask.\n  There is not a major newspaper in America that didn't think the \nPresident of the United States blew that opportunity when he recently \nspoke to the United Nations. I am beginning to doubt--and I hope I am \nwrong--that the United States is genuinely sincere about the U-turn he \nhas made and wanting to engage the international community. I pray he \nmeans that.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator from Delaware yield for a question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. BOND. I am taken with the world view and the view of the peace by \nthe Senator from Delaware, but when he talks about the United Nations, \nas a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I wonder if he recalls \nthis discussion with the Secretary of State: Last week you engaged in \ntireless diplomatic efforts to seek such unity against Iraq. Oddly, \nother members of the Security Council continue to indulge the fantasy \nthat Saddam would suddenly begin listening to reason.\n\n[[Page S12255]]\n\nMembers of Congress do not share that delusion. We look forward to \nreceiving the President's recommendations with regard to the need to \nuse force to contain, if not destroy, Iraq's capability to produce \nweapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Is my colleague familiar with that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think you are quoting one of the most articulate men who \nhas ever served in the Senate. I wonder who you are talking about?\n  Mr. BOND. I am referring to the distinguished Senator from Delaware--\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thought that is who you were talking about.\n  Mr. BOND. Who I understood made this statement to the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator is absolutely right. If he wants to read the \nrest of the statement, he will point out we in fact should have \ncontinued to try to get the rest of the world to come along after the \nfact. Can you imagine if the President of the United States had said, \nthe day after the statue of Saddam fell, if he went on national \ntelevision and made the following speech: My fellow Americans, I tell \nyou that our fighting men and women have bravely defeated the present \ngovernment, but we have much to do. It will cost billions of dollars \nand take tens of thousands of troops for the foreseeable future. Toward \nthat end, I am going to ask our valued allies who disagreed with us, \nwhose democratic processes I respect but they disagreed with us, to now \nstep in and help us, ask them to participate in rebuilding Iraq and \nshare the responsibility of forming a new government and dealing with \nthe aftermath of Saddam. Toward that end, I have convened a meeting \nwith Mr. Chirac, Mr. Schroeder, the European Union, et cetera. What do \nyou think would have happened?\n  But what did we say? We said the same thing we said in Afghanistan. \nWhen the French offered to send 5,000 of their marines, when Schroeder \nrisked a vote of confidence by one vote, he succeeded in voting for \nsending 1,000 German marines to Afghanistan, Mr. Rumsfeld and company \nsaid: We don't need them. And they stiff-armed them.\n  Senator Lugar and I contacted the President and said: Please, please \naccept their forces.\n  We don't need them. We don't need them.\n  Technically we may not need them. But I would argue that is the nadir \nof diplomacy that I have witnessed in this body, and I am now the \nseventh most senior Member. The diplomacy has been so incredibly ham-\nhanded that we have to continue this foolish response. We have \nhamstrung ourselves in a way that makes it almost impossible to do what \neverybody on this floor knows we need to do.\n  It is real simple. If you think we can secure the peace in Iraq all \nby ourselves without anybody else's help, then have at it. Go to it. I \ndon't know any reason why Bremer should not be dual-hatted like we are \nin Bosnia. I don't know any reason why we should not be saying to the \nFrench, the Germans, the European Union, and the U.N., you help us form \nthis government. I don't know any reason why we didn't have them in \nthere in the first place, beginning the electoral process, why we \nstiff-armed them. I don't get it.\n  I do know the result. Whether you agree with me or not, somebody has \nto pay the bill. All my friends who don't like international \ninstitutions, all my unilateralist buddies who like to eat freedom \nfries and engage in their little pettiness, have fun, but go home and \nexplain to your people why only Americans are dying. Go home and \nexplain to your people why only American taxpayers are paying the bill. \nGo home and explain to your people why we have close to 200,000 troops \nin the region and 140,000 troops there. Bravo. Bravo. Aren't we tough.\n  It is about time we wake up. By the way, I will be seeking the floor \nlater today with an amendment. This President has come along and said: \nWe need $87 billion and, by the way, just add it to the deficit. Add it \nto our tab. Put it on the tab. Our kids will pay for our security.\n  So the budget deficit is going to approach $600 billion. Can anybody \nname a time for me in American history when a President took us to war \nand, after taking us to war, a war that I supported his going to, said: \nIt is going to be a long sacrifice, and, by the way, here is the \nlargest tax cut in the history of the United States of America, as we \ngo?\n  Can anybody name any time in American history when that has ever \nhappened? Isn't it kind of strange?\n  So, Madam President, I will not take the time to talk about how we \nshould pay for this now. But I will suggest--is there any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, to me, this is real basic. If we want \npeople to share the burden, we have to be willing to have people share \nthe responsibility. Why does the administration propose--by the way, we \nhave every right to look at the details of this $87 billion.\n  Why does this administration propose to spend $33,000 apiece for \npickup trucks when you can get a brand new pickup in the U.S. for \n$14,000? Our Iraqi friends deserve AC--but not leather seats and a CD \nchanger.\n  Why does the administration propose to spend $10,000 per student for \na month-long business course--more than double the monthly cost of the \nHarvard Business School?\n  Why does it propose to spend $50,000 per prison bed, which is double \nthe average cost of a U.S. prison bed?\n  The bottom line is we have an obligation to closely scrutinize the \nPresident's request, to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely \nand, most importantly, that this administration has changed its course \nbecause literally the future of our children is at stake if they don't \nget it right.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, today I have voted in support of \nSenator Byrd's amendment to strike $15.2 billion in reconstruction aid \nfrom the supplemental appropriations bill. I supported this amendment \nnot because I oppose the overall intent of some of this spending--\nhelping Iraqis establish order and setting the country on a path to \nstability and development--but because it is clear that there has been \ninsufficient planning and insufficient explanation as to how this $15.2 \nbillion in reconstruction assistance would be spent.\n  This portion of the request needs careful consideration and, frankly, \nthis portion of the policy desperately needs improvement. It makes \nsense to sever this portion from the rest of the request to allow for \nthat process without delaying action on all of the issues before us.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to explain my support for \nSenator Byrd's amendment No. 1794 to S. 1689. While I support funding \nthe reconstruction of Iraq, I believe in the necessity to consider \nthese two very important issues funding for Iraqi security and Iraqi \nreconstruction separately.\n  The purpose of the Byrd amendment was to separate the reconstruction \nportion from the security portion of S. 1689. Had Senator Byrd's \namendment passed we would have been able to take immediate action on \nthe security portion of S. 1689 and passed that portion before we left \ntown this week. We could have then, upon our return, looked more \nclosely at the President's request for reconstruction funding and taken \nthe time to give thorough scrutiny to the administration's request and \nbetter examine the ways in which we are prioritizing the spending \nrequests of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I failed, and it is certainly my \noversight--prior to a vote on the Byrd amendment, the managers should \nbe recognized. They have both agreed to 8 minutes each.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the managers have 8 minutes each prior \nto the vote on the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, that is on the Byrd \npending amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. To occur now?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, but first Senator Smith will speak, and then Senator \nBoxer will speak for 8 minutes, and you and Senator Byrd will have 8 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, before my friend Senator Biden leaves the \nfloor, I tell him that I think he is on the wrong\n\n[[Page S12256]]\n\nside of short-term politics, but he is on the right side of history to \nsupport the President's request for $87 billion. He has made many \npoints where the administration could have done this or that better. \nSome of them are valid.\n  I think it is important that we remind ourselves what this is really \nall about. What are the bigger issues at play here? I have believed \nthroughout my life as a child of the cold war that American foreign \npolicy is something to be proud of. Born in the early 1950s, I remember \nthe nuclear bomb drills, where we would get under our desks and \npractice how to survive a nuclear bomb. I remember great leaders such \nas Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, and then Reagan, standing up for the \nprinciples of the American Constitution at home and abroad.\n  I ask myself, what are the values of the American foreign policy? I \nbelieve they are the spread of democracy. I believe they are the \ndefense of human rights. I believe they are the expansion of prosperity \nand engaging in trade. The world doesn't need to fear the United States \nof America as long as those values are intact. I believe they are very \nmuch intact. When I came to this body in 1997, I was privileged to \nserve on the Foreign Relations Committee with Senator Biden. I remember \nduring the Clinton administration a feeling that our foreign policy was \nvery well intentioned, but there was uncertainty about what to do with \nit. We were attacked at the World Trade Center; we were attacked at the \nKhobar Towers; we were attacked in our ship in a port in Yemen; our \nembassies were blown up. In each case, our response was to hit them \nwith a cruise missile, but not the commitment to actually go get them.\n  I joined Senator Biden and others on the Democratic side in \nsupporting President Clinton in Kosovo, believing that the defense of \nhuman rights included stopping genocide on a massive scale in Bosnia. I \nremember when many Republicans criticized President Clinton for not \ncoming with a plan--planning for peace, having every jot and tittle \naccounted for in the expenditures in Kosovo.\n  I suspect if we look up what we have spent in Kosovo on a per-capita \nbasis, it is about the same as President Bush is proposing to spend in \nIraq. As important as Kosovo was in terms of our strategic interests, \nIraq is infinitely more important.\n  Now I believe America's best days are still ahead. I believe our role \nin world leadership is more important now than ever before. I believe \nafter the Second World War America was laden with debt and our people \nwanted to go home, and President Truman came to this place and said we \nhave to have a Marshall Plan to save Europe. It was one of the most \nbeneficent acts ever by a government over a continent that had been \nconquered and suffered much tyranny.\n  I believe that Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, MacArthur, and other \nleaders helped to save the free world in that act. But if you added it \nup at the time, as many did, and tried to make sense of it, it didn't \nmake sense. But as I say, Joe Biden is on the right side of history \nbecause America has been called to a new sphere of responsibility, just \nlike our parents were in Europe and in Asia.\n  I talked about the spread of democracy being one of the pillars of \nAmerican foreign policy. Democracy is setting its roots everywhere on \nthe planet except in Arabia. The Arab peoples have suffered mightily \nbecause of its absence, not having the rule of law. All you have to do \nis go look at the mass graves in Iraq to understand that. All you have \nto do is look at his people and his neighbors, the Iranians, who have \nsuffered the effects of weapons of mass destruction from Saddam Hussein \nto understand his danger. All you have to do is understand where Hamas \ngot its money to blow up the people of Israel; they got it from Saddam \nHussein.\n  I believed this President when he came to us and asked for our \nsupport. He said the threat was not imminent, but after 9/11 we could \nno longer wait until it is imminent when we are dealing with a madman \nlike Saddam Hussein.\n  Many of my colleagues criticize President Bush for not planning for \nthe peace. Well, frankly, we, the Republicans, criticized President \nClinton for not planning sufficiently for the peace in Kosovo. I am not \nsure how well you can plan for the peace, but I know every time a chief \nexecutive, Republican or Democrat, comes here and says I have a plan \nfor the peace, we have many of our colleagues simply say we cannot pay \nfor the peace. We can pay to win a war, but we want to go home when it \nis time to win the peace.\n  The American people, I know, are tired of paying, but world \nleadership and American interests in relationship to that are \npriceless, and sometimes we cannot tote it all up. But I ask you what \nkind of a world we will live in if we succeed in this vision of \nestablishing a democracy in Iraq. Think what that means to Arabia, to \nIsrael; think what that means to our country if we can avoid a future \n9/11.\n  It will make the pricetag for peace in Iraq look like a good price, \nand it will mean that while some will complain we have created a \nbreeding ground for terrorists in Iraq, in the Middle East, we can \nanswer, yes, we have, but the ground is there; it is not here. That is \nwhat I think President Bush is trying to do.\n  So when we criticize our leaders for bold vision, just as Republicans \ncriticized Roosevelt for Yalta, understand Roosevelt tilted the ship of \nstate in the right direction so we could ultimately win. Understand \nthat Truman laid the groundwork for democracy in Europe so we are not \nconstantly fighting between Germans and French. And understand that \nwhat President Bush is now saying is, after 9/11, no more of them. If \nthey want to fight, it is there, not here, and we have to go and win \nthe peace. It falls to us now to pay for it.\n  I say Joe Biden is on the wrong side of short-term politics but Joe \nBiden is on the right side of history, just as Republicans were when \nthey supported Truman with the Marshall plan. We are being asked to do \nsomething that is historic. If the time of the Americans is over with \nthe cold war, vote no. If the time of the Americans and American \nleadership is still present, vote yes, for this appropriation. Vote \nagainst the amendments that would gut it because I believe our place in \nthe world, democracy's future on this planet, is in large measure \ndetermined by what leadership we give to the world.\n  I wish I had more confidence in international organizations. I think \nwe should stay in them, but I don't believe we should ever have our \ninterests and our values subordinated to the veto of the Security \nCouncil of the United Nations. That would be a mistake. And if we had \never done that, we would never have defended Europe in the cold war, we \nwould never have defended our allies in Asia, because we never could \nhave gotten support of the Security Council for such things. So it does \nrequire American leadership, and sometimes, with allies such as the \nBritish, we have to go it nearly alone.\n  I believe the time of the Americans is still now, and I think we need \nto support this President because I think the peace of the world and \nthe spread of democracy are dependent upon it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement \nnow in effect be amended to allow the Senator from California to speak \nfor 10 minutes rather than 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. It is because I \nprize America's leadership in the world that I will be proudly \nsupporting Senator Byrd's amendment because Senator Byrd's amendment \nwill allow us to really look at what we are doing in Iraq. It is \nbecause I also prize this country and I respect and honor the needs of \nour people that I am supporting Senator Byrd's amendment.\n  If we look at what we spend in a year on items most important to the \npeople in this country, and we compare it to what they are about to \nspend in Iraq reconstruction which we were told would never fall to \nAmerican taxpayers, we will see that our people are being shortchanged.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment allows the funds for the military to move \nforward and even $5 billion of reconstruction for the Iraqi police to \nmove forward, but it withholds the $15 billion because he prizes \nAmerica's leadership, because he doesn't want us to look\n\n[[Page S12257]]\n\nfoolish, because he as well as I and many others are tired of reading \nin the newspaper comments from the Iraqis.\n  For example, this is one from USA Today. It tells of an Iraqi \nbusinessman who was surprised to see the $100 million estimate to build \na complex that will house more than 3,000 people. He said: I could \nbuild this for $10 million.\n  If someone comes to the floor and says Senator Byrd is turning his \nback on America's place in the world because Senator Byrd wants to \nprotect the people of this country and their taxpayer dollars so that \nwhen and if we do build housing or shopping malls in Iraq, it is done \nin the right way, I say the people who question him are on the wrong \ntrack.\n  I have another quote. A member of the Iraqi Governing Council--\nappointed by this administration, I might say--saying to Waxman staff \nover on the House side that non-Iraqi contractors had charged about $25 \nmillion to refurbish 20 police stations in Basra, a job that he said \nIraqis could have done for $5 million. This is a disaster.\n  My friend talked about President Roosevelt. Let me tell you what FDR \nsaid about this during World War II:\n\n       I don't want to see a single war millionaire created in the \n     U.S. as a result of this world disaster.\n\n  He was talking about war profiteering. Maybe my colleagues are \nsanguine about the scandals we have already seen with no big contracts \nin the back room to firms that have connections to the Vice President \nof the United States. I am not sanguine.\n  The Byrd amendment is saving us from the embarrassments that will \nflow, because they will flow. I have been in the area of military \nprocurement reform for a very long time. I served in the House for 10 \nyears. I served on the Armed Services Committee. I discovered a lot of \nproblems with military procurement, and you ain't seen nothing yet when \nyou already have Iraqis saying we are charging so much.\n  What Senator Byrd is saying to us is, before we send hard-earned \nAmerican tax dollars over there for a rebuilding, if you will--\nactually, it is not even a rebuilding; it is a building because a lot \nof the things they never had before--before we do that, we need to look \nat this situation.\n  When I see that the administration, the President, is asking for \n$33,000 apiece for 80 pickup trucks when here they cost $14,000, I say \nthank you, Senator Byrd.\n  When I see a $3.6 million request for satellite phones at an average \ncost of $6,000 and we are told by the Iraqis that they paid on May 12 \n$900 each, I say thank you, Senator Byrd.\n  And $2 million for museums and memorials when the Iraqis say they are \ntired of memorials. That is all Saddam ever gave them. They don't want \nmore memorials. I say thank you, Senator Byrd, for calling attention to \nthe fact that they want to build two prisons at a cost of $50,000 per \nprison bed where in America it cost $25,000 per prison bed.\n  Others have talked about the cost of a 4-week business course in Iraq \nat a cost of $10,000 per student when in Harvard it is $4,000. I say \nthank you, Senator Byrd.\n  Where is the money going? Into somebody's pocket where it doesn't \nbelong over there or over here? It doesn't matter; it is taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  Look at what we spend one year on drug enforcement, $1.6 billion, and \nour kids are dying of overdoses, and we don't have the money, and this \nadministration won't give us the money for education.\n  This President cut afterschool programs in half, throwing 1 million \nkids out on the street. Thank goodness we restored some of it. I say \nthank you, Senator Byrd.\n  You can make the most lofty statements you want about America's \nleadership. America's leadership doesn't move forward one iota when we \nare not careful and we don't look at what we are doing.\n  I think it is extraordinary: $9 million for a state-of-the-art Iraqi \npostal service. Per capita, this amount is greater than the Federal \nGovernment spends on the U.S. Postal Service. Tell that to our \nconstituents who are told they may not get Saturday mail deliveries.\n\n  My constituents are perplexed by this request. The President will not \npay for it. He is adding to an already overblown deficit. If we do not \ncount the Social Security trust fund, it is up to $700 billion. He will \nnot pay for it. The numbers do not add up. They do not make sense.\n  My people want us to do our share to help the Iraq people, but they \nwere told a different story from this administration. Press Secretary \nAri Fleischer:\n\n       Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi \n     people. And so there are a variety of means that Iraq has to \n     be able to shoulder much of the burden for their own \n     reconstruction.\n\n  Ari Fleischer, the spokesman for the President, said that in February \nof this year. In March of this year, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul \nWolfowitz:\n\n       There's a lot of money to pay for this that doesn't have to \n     be U.S. taxpayer money, and it starts with the assets of the \n     Iraqi people.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       We're dealing with a country that can really finance its \n     own reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  This is what my constituents were told, and now they are told they \nare supposed to blink their eye at tens of billions of dollars going \nfor things that cost half the price in this country.\n  How about Secretary Rumsfeld, the leader of this war:\n\n       I don't believe that the United States has the \n     responsibility for reconstruction.\n\n  Let me say that again. The top person in the Defense Department, \nSecretary Donald Rumsfeld:\n\n       I don't believe that the United States has the \n     responsibility for reconstruction.\n\n  That is not Barbara Boxer speaking. That is not Robert Byrd speaking. \nThat is not Senator Murray speaking or Senator Stabenow.\n  This is what the American people were told, and Senator Byrd is \nsaying to this administration that they did not tell us the truth about \nthis.\n  It goes deeper than that. This administration has been wrong down the \nline on this policy, and suddenly we are supposed to write this \nenormous check for this reconstruction. I look at it as a blank check--\nwhen one sees the numbers they have put forward. They were wrong on the \nweapons of mass destruction. They were wrong on what would happen after \nthe war. They were wrong when they failed to predict that the \nterrorists would move in and fill the void. They were wrong on what the \nrebuilding would cost. They were wrong on the state of Iraq's ability \nto recover economically. They were wrong on how many troops would be \nneeded. They were wrong on the oil revenues. They were wrong on how \nmuch other countries would contribute.\n  I know it is hard to listen to this. I know some of my colleagues on \nthe other side do not really want to listen to this, but these are the \nfacts. We are not operating from a lack of experience. What Senator \nByrd is saying--and he is making a plea to colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle--is that we need to take a further look at these requests, \nespecially at a point in time when we are told by this administration \nthat they cannot even meet our homeland defense needs.\n  I have an amendment to try to protect commercial aircraft from \nshoulder-fired missiles. Let's support Senator Byrd. He is doing the \nright thing for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be a period of 16 minutes \nequally divided between the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I assume this will be an up-or-down vote. \nI am pleased to make my statement first and let the Senator close. That \nwould put people on notice that we should be voting in 15 minutes.\n  I have said repeatedly that the President's supplemental must be \nconsidered as a complete package. This is one of the key votes on this \nbill. If we try to separate even a portion of the package of the $20.3 \nbillion, we will delay the return of our troops.\n  We are in a situation where the quicker the Iraqi people can get \ncontrol of their own affairs--or even greater control of their own \naffairs, I should say--the better off we will be and the sooner we will \nstart bringing our forces home.\n  Support for our forces is directly linked to the funds for security, \ninfrastructure repair, and freedom in Iraq. All of the witnesses who \nappeared before us from the military, the State Department, and \nAmbassador Bremer,\n\n[[Page S12258]]\n\nrepresenting both in Iraq, have indicated to us there is no question \nthat the safety of our people is linked to these funds for \nreconstruction and restoration of Iraq.\n  Our colleagues have said they support the military money, but the \nmilitary money must be increased greatly if the forces are not \nforthcoming from the Iraqi people to provide security and police. They \ncan provide their own people at much less cost than we can. To provide \nsecurity in a military concept will mean bringing a great many more \nmilitary people to Iraq to provide the security that is necessary to \ndeal with the situation, particularly in the triangle around Baghdad.\n  Our troops on the ground become greater targets the more the \ndissidents increase their control over the Iraqi people. The dissidents \nreally are those who are unhappy about their own lack of necessities, \ntheir own security, their own lack of fuel and electric power.\n  These costs for reconstruction are high, there is no question about \nit. If we compare it to other engagements we have had in the world, \nthey are not high on a per capita basis. We are dealing with many more \npeople in Iraq than we were in Bosnia, and many more than we were in \nKosovo. In both of those countries, we ended up with a period of long \noccupation that would have been unnecessary if we had moved into the \nconcept of aiding the people there to provide their own government and \ntheir own security and their own basic future.\n  I do hope the Senate will vote against the Byrd amendment. It is the \nfirst test really of the intention of this Senate to approve the \nrequest of the President of the United States, which has been supported \nby every person who is in authority in our Government today.\n  I wish I had with me some of the letters I have received, that have \nbeen read to me, from our military people in Iraq. Those who are \nserving there have done a magnificent job, and they know it. They are \nwriting their parents and telling them how proud they are of what they \nhave done and how proud they are to be helping these people have \npermanent freedom in their own country.\n  I urge that this amendment be defeated.\n  I do want to point out that what we are dealing with is the question \nof splitting this supplemental. The supplemental is in two parts. One \nis military, and one is for reconstruction and restoration of the Iraqi \npeople. To split off any part of it is to defeat the purpose of the \nadministration and to defeat the goals we sought to achieve by \ncommitting our forces to the cause of liberating Iraq.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first I thank my colleague, Senator Stevens, for his \ncourtesy. I want to tell him again that my association with him is not \nso fragile as to be injured by any differences we may have between us \non this amendment or any other question.\n  The American people have only recently been exposed to some of the \ndetails of the $15.2 billion in funds that the President has requested \nfor the reconstruction of Iraq. The more the public learns about this \nrequest, the more the people will want Congress to take a closer look \nat this request.\n  My amendment would strike $15.2 billion in reconstruction funding for \nIraq. But it does not touch 1 cent of the security-related funding in \nthis $87 billion appropriations bill. My amendment would allow the \nSenate to go back to the drawing board and consider an entirely new \nbill that would only contain funds for rebuilding Iraq.\n  A vote for the Byrd amendment is a vote for taking a fresh look at \n$15.2 billion in Iraqi reconstruction spending. A vote for the Byrd \namendment is a vote for more hearings, more hearings about why these \nfunds are needed, more hearings about your money. I have heard that \nexpression so much when it has been used by our friends on the other \nside, talking about the tax cuts, saying: It is your money. It is your \nmoney. It is the people's money that we are talking about here. A vote \nfor the Byrd amendment is a vote for more hearings about why these \nfunds are needed.\n  Are there reasons to vote against my amendment? There sure are. There \nsure are reasons to vote against my amendment. If Senators want to \nspend $10 million to hire 48 bureaucrats for Iraq at the cost of \n$208,333 per pencil pusher, that is a good reason to vote against my \namendment.\n  If Senators want to support $9 million for creating new ZIP Codes in \nIraq, vote against my amendment. That is a good reason. That is a dandy \nreason to vote against it.\n  Let me say that again. If Senators want to support $9 million for \ncreating new ZIP Codes in Iraq, vote against my amendment. Go to it.\n  If Senators want to buy 80 pickup trucks at $33,000 when pickup \ntrucks at a car dealership in any town in the USA start at just \n$14,000, vote against my amendment. Go to it. Vote against my \namendment.\n  A vote against the Byrd amendment to strike $15.2 billion in aid to \nIraq is a vote for a padded bill. Go to it. A padded bill. The \nquestionable items funded by this bill go on and on and on.\n  The President's request contains $3.6 million for 600 radios and \ntelephones at $6,000 each. How about that? According to the Business \nWeek of May 12, Iraqi merchants sold satellite phones during the war \nfor $900 each.\n  This bill has $20 million to send Iraqis to a 4-week business school \ncourse at a cost of $10,000 per month. How about that? That must be a \ngreat education. That must be a great education because tuition at \nHarvard Business School is less than $4,000 per month.\n  As long as we are talking about education, the administration also \nwants to spend $30 million for English classes, at a cost of $1,500 per \nstudent. How about that? Thirty million dollars for English classes at \na cost of $1,500 per student. Similar English programs in the United \nStates reportedly cost just $500 to $1,000 per student. And there is \nmore. There is more.\n  There are more reasons to vote against my amendment. For example, \nthere is also $2 million for museums and memorials. Is this money \nreally an emergency? Is it? Some Iraqis don't think so. On September \n29, USA Today quoted a car dealer in Iraq as saying about this money:\n\n       OK, garbage collection I can understand, but statues? After \n     Saddam, we are fed up with statues.\n\n  If Senators support this kind of excessive spending, then vote \nagainst the Byrd amendment. But I think the Senate must take a new look \nat the $15.2 billion in reconstruction spending proposed by the \nadministration. Interestingly, just yesterday, members Of the Iraqi \nGoverning Council told the leadership of the Senate that they had not \nbeen consulted in putting together this budget request for the \nreconstruction of Iraq. We need to make sure there is a coherent plan \nfor how this money is to be spent.\n\n  I do not yet have any confidence that the administration has a solid \nplan for how it plans to spend this money, and the lack of a plan could \nleave working Americans on the hook for billions of dollars more for \nmany years.\n  I also do not yet have confidence that the administration has a plan \nfor bringing in the international community to the occupation and \nreconstruction effort in Iraq. Some have argued that, if this \nreconstruction spending is delayed, it will result in increased danger \nto the troops. I simply don't understand how creating new ZIP Codes in \nIraq, how hiring more bureaucrats for Iraq, how purchasing more pickup \ntrucks for Iraq will make American troops any safer. What they need is \na plan and an exit strategy, which includes getting troops and money \nfrom the international community.\n  Vote for the Byrd amendment to strike this $15.2 billion and let the \nSenate take a new look at how we can share the cost of this \nreconstruction spending with the international community.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S12259]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

We are \ncurrently working on an agreement to set up the vote for that for \ntomorrow morning.

Madam President, I know the Senator from Louisiana is \ninterested in talking for a few minutes as in morning business. I ask \nunanimous consent the Senator from Louisiana be recognized for 4 \nminutes as in morning business, after which I be allowed to send my \namendment to the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  (The remarks of Senator Landrieu and Senator Craig are located in \ntoday's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I will shortly offer an amendment \nthat should be supported by everyone in the Senate. It seems to me it \nis time we had such a vote. It is an opportunity to set aside the \nrancor that has occasionally occurred during the consideration of this \nunderlying measure, both in the Appropriations Committee and since, and \nagree that the Armed Forces of the United States have performed \nbrilliantly in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom in, of course, Iraq.\n  Since October 7, 2001, when our Armed Forces of the United States and \nits coalition allies launched military operations in Afghanistan, \ndesignated as Operation Enduring Freedom, our soldiers and allies have \nremoved the Taliban regime, eliminated Afghanistan's terrorist \ninfrastructure, and captured significant and also important and \nnumerous members of al-Qaida.\n  Since March 19, 2003, when the Armed Forces of our country and its \ncoalition allies launched military operations, designated as Operation \nIraqi Freedom, our soldiers have removed Saddam Hussein's regime, \neliminated Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, ended Iraq's illicit and \nillegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and captured \nsignificant international terrorists.\n  During all of this time, during the heat of battle, our soldiers have \nacted with all the efficiency that wartime commands, but all the \ncompassion and understanding that an emerging peace requires. They have \nacted in the finest tradition of U.S. soldiers and are to be commended \nby this Senate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1795\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1795.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To commend the Armed Forces of the United States in the War \n                             on Terrorism)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.    COMMENDING THE ARMED FORCES FOR EFFORTS IN OPERATION \n                   ENDURING FREEDOM AND OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.\n\n       Recognizing and commending the members of the United States \n     Armed Forces and their leaders, and the allies of the United \n     States and their armed forces, who participated in Operation \n     Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom \n     in Iraq and recognizing the continuing dedication of military \n     families and employers and defense civilians and contractors \n     and the countless communities and patriotic organizations \n     that lent their support to the Armed Forces during those \n     operations.\n       Whereas the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the \n     United States, which killed thousands of people from the \n     United States and other countries in New York, Virginia, and \n     Pennsylvania, inaugurated the Global War on Terrorism;\n       Whereas the intelligence community quickly identified Al \n     Qaeda as a terrorist organization with global reach and the \n     President determined that United States national security \n     required the elimination of the Al Qaeda terrorist \n     organization;\n       Whereas the Taliban regime of Afghanistan had long harbored \n     Al Qaeda, providing members of that organization a safe haven \n     from which to attack the United States and its friends and \n     allies, and the refusal of that regime to discontinue its \n     support for international terrorism and surrender Al Qaeda's \n     leaders to the United States made it a threat to \n     international peace and security;\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein and his regime's longstanding \n     sponsorship of international terrorism, active pursuit of \n     weapons of mass destruction, use of such weapons against \n     Iraq's own citizens and neighboring countries, aggression \n     against Iraq's neighbors, and brutal repression of Iraq's \n     population made Saddam Hussein and his regime a threat to \n     international peace and security;\n       Whereas the United States pursued sustained diplomatic, \n     political, and economic efforts to remove those threats \n     peacefully;\n       Whereas on October 7, 2001, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations \n     in Afghanistan, designated as Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     that quickly caused the collapse of the Taliban regime, the \n     elimination of Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure, and \n     the capture of significant and numerous members of Al Qaeda;\n       Whereas on March 19, 2003, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations, \n     designed as Operation Iraqi Freedom, that quickly caused the \n     collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, the elimination of \n     Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, the end of Iraq's illicit \n     and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \n     and the capture of significant international terrorists;\n       Whereas in those two campaigns in the Global War on \n     Terrorism, as of September 27, 2003, nearly 165,000 members \n     of the United States Armed Forces, comprised of active, \n     reserve, and National Guard members and units, had mobilized \n     for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       Whereas success in those two campaigns in the Global War on \n     Terrorism would not have been possible without the \n     dedication, courage, and service of the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and the military and irregular forces of \n     the friends and allies of the United States;\n\n[[Page S12260]]\n\n       Whereas the support, love, and commitment from the families \n     of United States service personnel participating in those two \n     operations, as well as that of the communities and patriotic \n     organizations which provided support through the United \n     States Organization (USO), Operation Dear Abby, and Operation \n     UpLink, helped to sustain those service personnel and enabled \n     them to eliminate significant threats to United States \n     national security while liberating oppressed peoples from \n     dictatorial regimes;\n       Whereas the civilian employees of the Department of \n     Defense, through their hard work and dedication, enabled \n     United States military forces to quickly and effectively \n     achieve the United States military missions in Afghanistan \n     and Iraq;\n       Whereas the commitment of companies making their employees \n     available for military service, the creativity and initiate \n     of contractors equipping the Nation's Armed Forces with the \n     best and most modern equipment, and the ingenuity of service \n     companies assisting with the global overseas deployment of \n     the Armed Forces demonstrates that the entrepreneurial spirit \n     of the United States is an extraordinary valuable defense \n     asset; and\n       Whereas the Nation should pause to recognize tributes and \n     days of remembrance the sacrifice of those members of the \n     Armed Forces who died or were wounded in Operation Enduring \n     Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, as well as all who \n     served in or supported either of those operations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Therefore, the Senate\n       (1) conveys its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     families and friends of the members of United States and \n     coalition forces who have been injured, wounded, or killed \n     during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       (2) commends President George W. Bush, Secretary of Defense \n     Donald H. Rumsfeld, and United States Central Command \n     Commander General Tommy Franks, United States Army, for their \n     planning and execution of enormously successful military \n     campaigns in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       (3) expresses its highest commendation and most sincere \n     appreciation to the members of the United States Armed Forces \n     who participated in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom\n       (4) commends the Department of Defense civilian employees \n     and the defense contractor personnel whose skills made \n     possible the equipping of the greatest Armed Force in the \n     annals of modern military endeavor;\n       (5) supports the efforts of communities across the Nation--\n       (A) to prepare appropriate homecoming ceremonies to honor \n     and welcome home the members of the Armed Forces \n     participating in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and to recognize their contributions to United \n     States homeland security and to the Global War on Terrorism; \n     and\n       (B) to prepare appropriate ceremonies to commemorate with \n     tributes and days of remembrance the service and sacrifice of \n     those service members killed or wounded during those \n     operations.\n       (6) expresses the deep gratitude of the Nation to the 21 \n     steadfast allies in Operation Enduring Freedom and to the 49 \n     coalition members in Operation Iraqi Freedom, especially the \n     United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, whose forces, support, \n     and contributions were invaluable and unforgettable; and\n       (7) recommits the United States to ensuring the safety of \n     the United States homeland, to preventing weapons of mass \n     destruction from reaching the hands of terrorists, and to \n     helping the people of Iraq and Afghanistan build free and \n     vibrant democratic societies.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, we will have further debate and a \nvote on that amendment in the morning.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside so I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1796\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n     Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 1796.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds for the security and stabilization of Iraq \n  by suspending a portion of the reductions in the highest income tax \n                     rate for individual taxpayers)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Provision of Funds for Security and \n     Stabilization of Iraq Through Partial Suspension of \n     Reductions in Highest Income Tax Rate for Individual \n     Taxpayers.--Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to tax imposed) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(j) Provision of Funds for Security and Stabilization of \n     Iraq Through Partial Suspension of Reductions in Highest \n     Income Tax Rate.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In the case of any taxable year \n     beginning in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, the 35 \n     percent rate of tax under subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) \n     shall be adjusted to the percentage determined by the \n     Secretary to result in an increase in revenues into the \n     Treasury for all taxable years beginning in 2005, 2006, 2007, \n     2008, 2009, and 2010 equal to $87,000,000,000.\n       ``(2) Adjustment of tables.--The Secretary shall adjust the \n     tables prescribed under subsection (f) to carry out this \n     subsection.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning in 2005.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I promise I am not going to keep you \nlong. I plan on speaking in more detail to this tomorrow, but I wanted \nto lay this amendment down tonight.\n  With the help of Senator Kerry, Senator Chafee, Senator Corzine, and \nSenator Feinstein, we have a simple and we believe a very commonsense \namendment to pay for the President's request for funding the \nsupplemental for the war in Iraq.\n  For my bona fides here, I want to make it clear at the outset, No. 1, \nI voted to give the President the authority to go to Iraq, and I \nbelieve it was the correct vote. I am not at all happy with the way the \nadministration failed to plan for the fall of Saddam, notwithstanding \nthe importuning on the part of myself and many others--Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Congress--but nonetheless, I do not come at this as \nsomeone who is opposed to the idea the American public is going to be \nasked to spend more money to win the peace in Iraq. We are going to be \nasked to spend more money. It is inevitable.\n  I might add, even if we had every other nation in the world with us, \nour share would still be in the tens of billions of dollars to win the \npeace in Iraq. We would still have tens of thousands of American troops \nthere.\n  I am, as I stated earlier today, very--I should not have said it \nprobably--angry with the failure of this administration to abandon the \nassumptions they had which were dead wrong. It is understandable; we \nall make mistakes, but they were dead wrong what we would find in Iraq \nafter Saddam fell.\n  My colleague from Maine knows a great deal about American foreign \npolicy, both in her incarnation as a senior staff person and now as a \nserious United States Senator. She knows from her experience on the \nArmed Services Committee and she knows from her experience on \nintelligence matters of what I speak. I am not suggesting she agrees \nwith me; I am just suggesting she knows how much is at stake in winning \nthe peace in Iraq.\n  What I am about to say some will use an ad hominem argument and say \nthe reason Biden is doing this is because he is against funding the \npeace in Iraq. Wrong. I want to amend what the President sent us. I \nwant to refine it.\n  For example, I voted against the Byrd amendment. The Byrd amendment \nreally was designed to say we should deal with getting the money to the \ntroops right away and then let's talk about the remainder for \nrebuilding. I was likely to support that when it looked like we were \nnot going to be allowed to offer any amendments. I will have amendments \nto this legislation.\n  For example, we are spending something like $50,000 or $55,000 for \nevery prison bed we are going to build in Iraq. They need to build \nprisons. It is in our interest they do that. We spend half that in the \nUnited States. Why in the devil should we be spending twice as much in \nIraq? One of three things: We either have not calculated correctly or \nwe are padding contractors who are going to go in and do the job, or \nBremer and others are looking for some cushion to have money to do \nother things. In any of the three cases, it is the wrong way to go \nabout it.\n\n[[Page S12261]]\n\n  I will be offering an amendment that says we are going to cut part of \nthe money for rebuilding Iraq; that we are only going to pay $30,000 \nper prison bed like we do here. We are talking about spending on \neducation programs twice what we pay a student to go to Harvard \nBusiness School. There are a lot of things in the supplemental that \nrequire accountability. I am going to try to hold the administration \naccountable--not accountable for their sins, accountable so the \nAmerican public and we know what they are doing.\n\n  My friend from Maine--I do not want to get her in trouble, but I \nthink she and her colleagues were empathetic at least to the initial \nproposal, the so-called Biden-Lugar amendment before the war as to what \nthe conditions of going to war were. On the amendment, which we never \ngot to, because Mr. Gephardt reached a deal with the President and the \nHouse of Representatives and rendered our efforts moot, we had, I am \ntold, over 20 Republicans prepared to vote for it and 40 Democrats to \nvote for it.\n  What did that amendment have in it that the authorization we finally \npassed did not have? It had reporting requirements. The President was \nrequired to report on a regular basis what he was doing, how the war \nwas going, whether or not we were doing the following things. So I \nthink there should be reporting requirements tied to this $87 billion, \nand more. I will not bore you with what else.\n  The point I am trying to make is this is not a veiled attempt to \nsomehow undercut or defeat the President's request for significant \neconomic and military aid in Iraq. We have to do it, in my view.\n  The second point I want to make at the outset is I voted against the \nPresident's tax cuts. I think they were excessive. I think they were \ndangerous. I think they did not take into account the exigencies which \nwe are facing. I said so at the time. And I think they massively \ncontribute to the deficit. A lot of us disagree. Half a dozen of my \nDemocratic friends voted for it and most of my Republican friends voted \nfor it. I am not in any way impugning their vote with what I am about \nto try to do.\n  Further, the fact I was against the amendment--this is not a back-\ndoor way to try to rescind the tax cut. My colleagues at this point \nwill have to take that on faith, and hopefully, as I debate my \namendment, you will understand what I am trying to do. Some will say \nthe Biden, Kerry, Chafee, et cetera, amendment is designed to rescind \nthe President's tax cut. That is not what this is about.\n  I was listening to the President and, I might add, the President, I \nthink, were he to be asked--and there is no reason why he would be--and \nthe administration, including Dr. Rice and the Secretary of State, will \ntell you the last 6 months I have been saying to the President: Tell \nthe American people what it is going to cost. Tell them it is going to \nbe billions of dollars. Tell them it is going to take tens of thousands \nof troops for an extended period of time because, Mr. President, if you \ndon't, you are going to lose their support. They are going to be angry \nwhen they find out Johnny and Jane are not going to be marching home by \nChristmastime. They are going to be angry when they find out we are \ngoing to have to devote billions of dollars--tens of billions of \ndollars--to prosecute the peace, as we have already spent tens of \nbillions of dollars, over $70 billion, to prosecute ``the war.'' And \nthe President was reluctant to do that. I think his failure to level \nwith the American people early on is a serious mistake.\n  By the way, conservative senior Republicans, such as my friend \nSenator Domenici, have used words such as ``level with the American \npeople,'' or ``the administration should level.'' Senator Lugar has \nbeen saying that for 6, 8, 10 months. So this is not a partisan attack \non the President. This is just pointing out the President has to, to \nkeep these folks in the deal so we don't leave our troops over there \nstranded, in effect, so we don't divide this Nation--the only \nsimilarity between this and Vietnam, in my view, is this has the \npotential to divide the Nation. Not in the sense it is a quagmire. It \nis in a sense that it will divide the Nation, and we cannot afford a \ndivided Nation because if we lose the peace in Iraq--in a sense it is \nsilly me saying this to you, Madam President, because you know this \nbetter than most--if we lose the peace in Iraq, we will significantly \nstrengthen Iran.\n  We will significantly undermine the moderates in Iran. We will put \nincredible pressure on Musharraf in Pakistan, a nuclear power. We will \nput incredible pressure on the new Islamic party in Turkey that wants \nto become part of the European Union. We will probably cause every \nmoderate and modernizing voice in the Middle East to shut down. That is \na big problem well beyond terror.\n  If tonight the Lord Almighty came down and sat in this chair and \nsaid: I guarantee all of you Senators there will not be a single \nadditional terrorist attack anywhere against American or American \ninterests in the world for the next 10 years, does anybody think we \nstill do not have a multibillion dollar problem in Iraq? Does anybody \nthink we still do not have a multithousand troop problem in Iraq?\n  This is a country that has never been governed as a participatory \nrepublic, ever. This is a country that is not a country. This is not \nthe old Babylon. This is not the Babylonian Empire. This is a polyglot \nof elements of the Middle East that were put together by the colonial \npowers, Mr. Churchill, after World War I. It has never been a country.\n  Look how long it took to rebuild Germany, a unified, ethnically \ncoherent country--as a matter of fact, too ethnically coherent in a \nsense.\n  So this is going to take a long time. My effort is like that of \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island. We have to do more, not less. So this is \nnot designed to undercut the effort to rebuild Iraq. Nor is it designed \nas a back-door way of eliminating the President's tax cut. Let me tell \nmy colleagues what it is designed to do. It is designed to pay for what \nwe need to do. There is the $87 billion we are about to--I believe, I \npredict--at least the bulk of that we will vote for. The President will \nsign it into law. The question is: What happens? How is that $87 \nbillion, in effect, recorded on the books?\n  Well, the President's proposal is very simple and straightforward. It \nincreases the deficit to almost $600 billion. Just add the $87 billion \non top of the roughly $500 billion deficit for next year, and that is \nit.\n  Put another way, my granddaughters Naomi, Finnegan, and Roberta Mabel \nwill pay for my security. They will pay for reconstructing Iraq. Now \nwhere I come from, I thought it was the other way around. I thought we \nwere supposed to pay for our children's and our grandchildren's \nsecurity.\n  It is really simple. This is not hyperbole. This is not some great \ninsight. If it is added to the deficit, our children and grandchildren \npay for it. The pages will pay for my security, if we succeed in Iraq.\n  So that is one thing we can do. We can do the President's proposal. \nThe other way we can do it is some Members of both parties--I believe, \nalthough I am not certain, but I think the Senator from Texas still has \nthe view and some colleagues on my side, Senator Dorgan and others, \nbelieve there is so much oil in Iraq we can have them pay us back for \nthis $87 billion. So we can make it in the form of a loan.\n  There will be a vote on that. Someone will offer an amendment saying \nthis is a loan, not a grant. That is going to be very appealing to \neverybody listening to this little talk of mine. All my folks back home \nare saying: Joe, why would you not be for that? That is just fair. They \nhave all this money, all this oil. They should pay for the \nreconstruction. They should pay for us liberating them.\n  Well, if they could, they should, but the fact of the matter is Iraq \nalready owes in hard debt and reparations well over $100 billion to the \ninternational community, debts accumulated under Saddam Hussein. People \nlent them money. There were claims against their assets by those who \nwere hurt by the invasion into Kuwait. There are indemnification claims \nagainst them, almost $200 billion, we are told.\n  Everybody is big these days on using historical analogies, historical \nexamples, and as hopefully a relatively informed student of history, I \nwill use a comparison. We can either choose the World War I model of \nreconstruction or the World War II model. In World War I, the world \ndefeated Germany and concluded at Versailles that the whole war\n\n[[Page S12262]]\n\nwas Germany's fault and Germany should pay for its own reconstruction \nand Germany should pay reparations to France, England, and others for \nthe damage they did.\n  So the new government came along and we said, have at it, establish a \ndemocracy, rebuild your economy but, by the way, pay this overwhelming \ndebt first.\n  What happened? We ended up with Germany collapsing, the economy \ncollapsing, people using wheelbarrows full of deutsche marks to buy \nbread, and Hitler, the demagog, racist, no good son of a gun, playing \non the angers, fears, and frustrations of the Germans, and we had World \nWar II.\n  We can use the World War II model. The World War II model, to vastly \noversimplify it--thank God your mother and father and my mother and \nfather were a lot smarter than their mothers and fathers--they came \nalong and said, the leadership of Republicans like Vandenberg and \nDemocrats like Truman, the World War I model did not work. If we try to \nset up a new government in Germany, and in other parts of Europe, and \nwe say to them, first of all, you Germans caused 400,000 Americans to \ndie and over a million to be wounded and the debt, all of which is \naccurate, and you have to pay us off for the war first, does anybody \nbelieve we would have a democratic republic in Germany now?\n  What did we do? We did the exact opposite. After over a year of \ndebate, we did the exact opposite. A guy named Marshall made a speech \nat the university--he was a Secretary of State and former general--and \nwe had the Marshall Plan. Some little bit of that was loans, but the \nvast majority was grants, to give this fledgling new democracy, with \nthe Adenauers of the world, the opportunity to grow, because there has \nnever been a place where democracy has been able to take root without \neconomic growth. It has never happened.\n  So we did the opposite. We rebuilt Germany. Guess who benefited the \nmost. The United States. It started the greatest economic expansion in \nthe history of the United States of America.\n  There is a third model--a fourth model we can use. That is instead of \nindemnifying them, how do we go out and say to the rest of the world, \nlook, here is the deal? The deal is we want you, the rest of the world, \nto come up with $50 or $60 billion over the next couple years. We want \nyou to send 50,000 or 60,000 of your troops, which will cost other \nbillions of dollars, to be in Iraq. We want you to forgive the debt the \nold Iraqi Government owes you, and, by the way, our $20 billion we are \nputting in, we are going to indemnify against Iraqi oil, but not you.\n\n  That is what they call in some parts of my State being a penny wise \nand a pound foolish. We may indemnify our $20 billion but we are sure \nnot going to get anyone else to put in any money.\n  So this a very appealing bad idea. This is the ``painted, tainted \nrose'' of the song. This is not a good idea. This is the siren song. It \nsounds great.\n  I am going to have trouble explaining at home why I would not vote to \nhave Iraq pay their way. The reason I won't is it will cost the \nAmerican taxpayers more, because no one else will get in the game if we \ndo it and we will have to do it all.\n  The last way we can do this is we can pay for it. The President \nhimself used these words in the State of the Union. He said:\n\n       This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will \n     not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other \n     Congresses, other Presidents, or other generations.\n\n  This is a sentiment that is a principle we can all support with \nregard to Iraq. I would like to hold the President to his commitment. \nMr. President, do not pass on to my children and grandchildren the cost \nof this war. Let us pay for it.\n  How do you pay for it? The amendment I have sent to the desk would \ntake a small share, less than 5 percent of the $1.8 trillion tax cut we \nenacted in the last 3 years, to cover the $87 billion emergency \nsupplemental for Iraq. That would put the burden of paying for our \nmission in Iraq on Americans today, not our grandchildren, which, \ndespite the fine words I just quoted, is exactly what the President is \ndoing.\n  This $87 billion request will be added to the mountains of debt we \nhave already piled up. From a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 \ntrillion when the President came to office, this administration has, by \na kind of reverse alchemy, turned gold into lead. We face a $480 \nbillion deficit this year alone, and that is not counting the $164 \nbillion we will borrow from Social Security. There is no one in this \nChamber who is a better expert on Social Security than the Presiding \nOfficer, so she knows the real deficit is actually $644 billion.\n  So what do I do? I believe the fair, equitable way to deal with \npaying for this is to say to the wealthiest Americans, the top .7 \npercent, instead of you getting a total tax cut of $690 billion over \nthe term of this tax cut, you are only going to get $600 billion.\n  I tried this out on wealthy Americans, and wealthy Delawareans. Can \nyou imagine if the President of the United States, when he announced \nthis $87 billion supplemental, said: And because of this, I am going to \nask the wealthiest 1 percent of you--which means you have to be making \nat least $360,000 to get into that category of income. The average \nperson in that category makes $1 million per year--I am asking you to \nforgo 1 year of your tax cut; not the whole tax cut, just 1 year of the \n10 years of the tax cut you are getting.\n  The reason this will have no impact on economic recovery, for those \nwho say the tax cut is causing economic recovery, the way it works is, \nthis will be paid from the year 2005 to 2010. It instructs the \nCommissioner of Internal Revenue to find this $87 billion from that \ncategory over a 5-year period. There is not a serious economist in the \nworld who would say to you it would have any impact on recovery--none.\n  Do you know the interesting part about it? Wealthy people are \nprepared to do this. They know it is the right thing to do. They know \nit is the right thing to do. What frustrates me about some in your \nparty and my party is, some in your party think only the wealthiest in \nthe Nation have any brains, and some in my party think everything is \nclass warfare.\n  The truth is, wealthy Americans are as patriotic as the poorest \nAmerican, as patriotic as middle class Americans. They have not been \nasked to do anything yet. And to ask them to pay, give up 1 year of the \n10 years of their tax cut, about which I will go into details \ntomorrow--for someone making $360,000 a year would be something like, \nwhat is it, $1,400 per year for 5 years. That is a sacrifice?\n  Some have said to me on the shows I have been on--the television \nshows--Why don't you do it for all Americans? The truth is, middle-\nclass Americans need a tax break. Second, I am not taking away the tax \nbreak. Instead of getting 100 times what the middle-class American \ngets, you are only going to get 60 times.\n  Do you know what. I have not found a single wealthy American--I \nchallenge anyone who is making in that .7 percent, making over \n$360,000, to write me a letter--this is on C-SPAN--telling me you don't \nthink it is fair for you to give up 1 year of your tax cut out of 10, \nspread over 5 years.\n  I think the President vastly miscalculates the character of the \nAmerican people and the character of the wealthiest people among us.\n  So tomorrow, when we actually bring this up for debate, I will have \nmuch more detail to say. I promised you I would not keep you long. But \nI believe--and I sincerely believe this--this is the right thing to do. \nThe wealthiest people I am talking about I believe think it is the \nright thing to do. I hope we have the courage to do it.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, just over 2 years ago, our lives were \nforever changed when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon, claiming the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans and declaring \nwar on freedom and democracy everywhere.\n  In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, it became very \nclear that we would be engaged in a war against terrorism that would \nspan\n\n[[Page S12263]]\n\nyears rather than months and require the full attention of the United \nStates and our allies.\n  On September 12, 2001, I spoke on the Senate floor regarding the \nchallenge before America. I said:\n\n       Our determination to winning the war on terrorism must have \n     the same high priority that we gave to winning World War II, \n     and we must engage our allies in this war. We should make the \n     same preparations that we made for D-day and the world's \n     entry into the Persian Gulf war.\n\n  I also said:\n\n       Our actions must be ongoing and relentless, and be \n     dedicated to excising the cancer of terrorism wherever it \n     raises its ugly head. Our efforts cannot be another catharsis \n     after a national tragedy, and they must not fade away with \n     time and business as usual. We owe it to yesterday's victims \n     and their families, especially their children and \n     grandchildren, most of all we owe it to the American people \n     and the world community, to bring an end to terrorism \n     everywhere and forever.\n\n  Exactly one year ago this week, I spoke in the Senate as we \nconsidered a resolution authorizing the President to use military force \nto disarm Saddam Hussein and liberate the Iraqi people should our \ndiplomatic efforts fail. At that time, I said:\n\n       Saddam Hussein poses a clear threat to peace in the world, \n     to America and our interests, to regional stability and to \n     his own people.\n\n  That is why I voted in favor of a resolution expressing the \nconviction of Congress that the United States should exhaust all \ndiplomatic options first, but if Iraq resisted diplomatic solutions the \nPresident would be authorized to use all necessary means to enforce \nU.N. Security Council resolutions in Iraq.\n  Though we all hoped and prayed the growing crisis would not have to \nbe settled with military action, Iraq's 12-year defiance of the world \ncommunity ultimately left no other action. Joined by members of the \ninternational community, a United States-led coalition engaged in a \ncampaign against the Iraqi dictator, and as I stand before you 12 \nmonths later, the reign of terror of Saddam Hussein is no more. People \nin Iraq and people in the world can breathe easier now that Iraq is rid \nof a tyrant who used weapons of mass destruction to kill thousands of \nhis own people, an enemy of humanity who shunned democracy and balked \nat the rule of law. Saddam Hussein was a dangerous threat to his own \npeople, his regional neighbors, and the international community.\n  In an effort to perpetuate the fear on which his power was based, he \nused his own people as test subjects for the development of weapons of \nmass destruction. He depended on torture chambers as a method of \ncoercion. Operation Iraqi Freedom has annihilated this vile oppression. \nThis is significant not only for the well-being of the Iraqi people, \nbut it is also crucial for our national security and the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  This is as much about us, and our war against terrorism, and the \nsecurity of the American people, as it is about Iraq. I repeat: This is \nas much about us, our war against terrorism and the security of the \nAmerican people, as it is about Iraq.\n  We now have a chance of a lifetime to create a new paradigm of \ndemocracy in the Middle East and to do for this part of the world what \nwe did for Germany and Japan in the aftermath of World War II. Today, \n58 years after the Second World War, Japan is a strong ally in Asia, \nand Germany is no longer a threat but instead our partner in NATO and \npartners with its neighbors in the European Union.\n  We spent billions of dollars during the Cold War in anticipation that \none day our brothers and sisters behind the Iron Curtain and the Berlin \nWall would enjoy the freedom we have now enjoyed. Now the Wall is down, \nthe Curtain is torn, and we see democracy growing in that part of the \nworld. Many of us believed it would never happen.\n  Today we find ourselves with another historic opportunity to promote \na new era of peace, stability, and democracy in Iraq and the Middle \nEast. As Ken Pollack writes in his book ``The Threatening Storm\":\n\n       This is our one opportunity to create a stable, prosperous, \n     self-sufficient Arab state that could serve as a model for \n     the region. This is our one opportunity to turn Iraq from a \n     malignant growth helping to poison the Middle East into an \n     engine for change for the entire region, and we must not \n     let it slip away from us.\n  I could not agree more. We have a chance to cultivate an important \nfriendship in the Middle East. By helping Iraq, we send an important \nmessage not only to those who seek to undermine stability in Iraq but \nto the entire world. By extending support to help stabilize and \nstrengthen a new democratic Iraq, our actions will demonstrate more \nthan any rhetoric could that we are genuinely interested in supporting \nhumane reconstruction in Iraq as we did following World War II. It will \nshow that we will take the necessary steps and devote the resources \nrequired to secure a bright future for Iraq, especially for the young \npeople, and stabilize that part of the world.\n  Today we begin discussion of the President's critical request for an \nadditional $87 billion to support ongoing military operations and \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In testimony before \nboth Houses of Congress last week, the head of the coalition \nprovisional authority, Ambassador Bremer, outlined the resources that \nwill be required to enhance security and restore essential services in \nIraq, which total of $20.3 billion. Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld also testified regarding the funding that is required to \nsupport ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and other \nparts of the world, which totals roughly $66 billion, nearly two-thirds \nof the total request.\n  The funding is urgently needed, both for military operations and \nreconstruction. The portion to sustain military operations will support \nthe nearly 130,000 American soldiers on the ground, and it goes hand \nand glove with the $20.3 billion requested for reconstruction in Iraq. \nIt is imperative that we act now to restore essential services, build \ninfrastructure, and improve life for the Iraqi people.\n  As Ambassador Bremer remarked last week:\n\n       Early progress on restoring basic infrastructure gives us \n     an edge against the terrorists.\n\n  Ambassador Bremer also said if we fail to act soon, ``the \nconsequences for American troops and American interests will be \nsevere.''\n  What I am saying is that the $20.3 billion they are asking for \ninfrastructure is just as important to the safety of our men and women \nin harm's way as the $69 billion that has been called for in the rest \nof the request.\n  This investment will also support our troops. The sooner Iraq is up \nand running on its own, the sooner our troops will be able to come \nhome. United States-led coalition forces on the ground continue to \nencounter on a daily basis those who seek to undermine our efforts to \nensure a free and democratic future for Iraq. We saw this last weekend \nwhen facilities used by U.N. officials and other members of the \ninternational community came under attack. There are those who would \nlike to see us fail, and they are working to undermine our efforts with \nthe expectation that our resolve is weak and that with enough violence \nwe will leave. That is why we must act now.\n  This is a considerable sum of money, and Congress has an obligation \nto carefully consider this spending request in the broader context of \nother domestic needs. I understand while Iraq is in need of funding for \nsecurity and infrastructure projects, we also have urgent spending \nneeds here at home. Congress and the administration should address \nthese priorities for the State of Ohio, my State, and cities and towns \nacross America and make a renewed commitment to invest in our Nation's \ncritical infrastructure, including our highways, bridges, drinking \nwater, wastewater treatment facilities, and other water resources.\n  As a member of the Senate, I believe Congress should work to move \ncritical infrastructure bills such as reauthorization of the surface \ntransportation program, water infrastructure funding legislation, the \nWater Resources Development Act.\n  I have also urged the administration to create an emergency jobs bill \nmuch like the emergency jobs bill that President Reagan created in 1983 \nwhile I was mayor of the city of Cleveland and lobbying the Reagan \nadministration to help my city, county, and State.\n  But while action on these items is important, it should not keep us \nfrom doing what we need to do to finish the\n\n[[Page S12264]]\n\njob in Iraq. We must address the spending request before us today as a \nseparate issue. They are disconnected.\n\n  From the very beginning, it has been my belief that it will take a \nconsiderable amount of time, manpower, and money to do what must be \ndone to truly secure a better future for the Iraqi people.\n  Again, I just want to mention, the money we spent in Japan, the money \nwe spent in Germany after World War II, and the money that we spent \nduring the Cold War--we spent billions of dollars. These were grants; \nthese were not loans. We did it because we thought it was important to \nour national security. And we did it because we thought it was \nimportant for world peace.\n  Our military campaign to topple the Iraqi regime was accomplished \nswiftly and successfully. However, much of our work, as I said, has \njust begun, and it is not going to be done overnight, nor is it best \ndone alone.\n  In February, prior to the onset of military action to disarm Saddam \nHussein, I raised this point as a member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee with Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman and Under \nSecretary of Defense Doug Feith when they testified before our \ncommittee. I said then, and I believe now, if we are going to be \nsuccessful in our efforts in Iraq, it will require not only the long-\nterm commitment of the United States but our partners in the United \nNations and other members of the international community.\n  At that time, I underscored the importance of building the broadest \ninternational coalition possible, and I urged the administration to lay \nthe groundwork with the American people regarding the number of troops \nthat would be required to win the peace in the aftermath of a military \ncampaign, how long they might be needed, and what this would cost the \nU.S. taxpayers.\n  The answers to these questions are becoming even more critical as we \nfind ourselves assessing the resources that will be required now to \nfinish the job in Iraq. Our men and women in uniform are serving their \ncountry proudly, but they are spending increasing amounts of time away \nfrom their families. We must do everything we can to give them the \ntools they need to do what we have asked them to do, and then bring \nthem home as quickly as possible.\n  One of the ways we can do that is to improve the Iraqi civil defense \noperations themselves. We have some 55,000 people in place, and we are \ntrying to train another 20,000, I think, as Paul Wolfowitz said to us. \nThey are now taking over the border patrol and other civil and security \nfunctions in Iraq. We need to move on that. Part of the funding \nincluded in the $20.3 billion is to be used for that purpose.\n  I am pleased President Bush addressed the United Nations General \nAssembly last week, and it is my sincere hope Secretary of State Colin \nPowell will be successful in securing a U.N. resolution that will allow \nfor enhanced support from other countries, both in terms of military \nforces and financial resources to help build Iraq.\n  In order to achieve our goals in Iraq and take care of important \nneeds here at home, it is essential we do all we can to make our \nefforts in Iraq a shared responsibility, calling on other countries and \ninternational organizations to invest in a free and democratic future \nfor Iraq. Our human and financial resources will stretch further when \nthey are supplemented by funds from our friends and allies abroad.\n  This was evident during the Persian Gulf War in 1991, when other \ncountries made significant contributions to the war and the \nreconstruction effort. It has been estimated the Gulf War cost between \n$60 and $80 billion. Members of the international community contributed \napproximately $70 billion to aid in the gulf war. The largest donations \ncame from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Japan, Germany, and a smaller one from \nthe United Arab Emirates.\n  In all, approximately 40 countries contributed either financial or \nmilitary resources. In addition to the countries I have just listed, \nanother 35 countries together contributed an additional $10 billion to \nthe effort. We need a similar commitment right now.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I strongly believe we should provide the \nresources necessary to restore essential services in Iraq. The funding \nfor reconstruction requested by the President and reflected in this \nspending bill is an important part of the process. However, Ambassador \nBremer has indicated it will take considerably more than $20 billion, \nperhaps as much as $70 billion, to meet Iraq's infrastructure needs in \nthe years ahead. Therefore, I believe it is particularly important to \nstep up our efforts to secure contributions from our friends and allies \nand build the economy of Iraq as soon as possible so they can use their \nresources to rebuild their own country.\n\n  As we look to increase contributions from the international \ncommunity, I think this funding must be in the form of a grant and not \na loan. While I initially thought this should be a loan, after \ncarefully considering the situation and listening to the points raised \nby Ambassador Bremer and our colleagues, I have concluded this funding \nmust be in the form of a grant. It is important for several reasons.\n  No. 1, if we tell the American people we are going to loan this money \nand that it is going to be paid back somewhere down the road, many of \nthem will be very cynical about whether or not we will get the money \nback. I think we ought to level with them and say, this initial grant \nis a grant.\n  Second, it should be a grant in an effort to encourage other \ncountries to make financial commitments for the reconstruction of Iraq. \nHow can we ask them to come forward with money if we say that we are \ngoing to loan that $20.3 billion to Iraq? We will be going to the \nDonors' Conference in Madrid later this month. If we make U.S. funds \nfor infrastructure projects contingent upon a loan, I do not think they \nare going to be willing to come to the table and support money for \nIraq.\n  Third, Iraq's debt is already mountainous, totaling nearly $200 \nbillion in debts and reparations. As Ambassador Bremer has pointed out, \nIraq can hardly service its existing debt, let alone take on more. As a \nmatter of fact, as one member of the Iraqi Governing Council has said, \nin his opinion, those loans are morally repugnant to the Iraqi people \nbecause they were made to a dictator who killed thousands of their \nbrothers and sisters and who made them live under a 35-year reign of \nterror.\n  I would suggest to those who have made loans to the former regime in \nIraq that they step up quickly and waive those loans because I believe \nit would be the smartest thing for them to do in terms of reaching out \nrather than waiting until later on to have a new Iraq government say to \nthem: You know what, folks, we are not going to honor those loans you \nmade to Saddam Hussein.\n  Fourth, as we encourage other countries to eliminate their debt, we \nshould not saddle Iraq with any more loans. Countries that chose to do \nbusiness with Saddam should, as I said, eliminate that debt as a way to \nshare in the task of rebuilding a democratic Iraq.\n  In the past, the United States has also engaged in efforts to help \nease the debt burden incurred by rogue regimes. This was the case in \nthe former Yugoslavia, as the U.S. Government worked with the Paris \nClub to reduce the amount of debt the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \nnow Serbia and Montenegro, owed to its creditors after Slobodan \nMilosevic was removed from power. We did everything we could to work \nwith the World Bank, and with the IMF and the Paris Club, and we said: \nGet the debt off the back of Yugoslavia--Serbia and Montenegro--because \nwe want them to get back on their feet, and this debt is killing them. \nThis was an important and necessary step as the country attempted to \nmove forward with democratic reforms after years of authoritative rule.\n  Finally, providing assistance to Iraq at this time in the form of a \ngrant is the right thing to do. We must contribute all necessary \nresources to finish the job that has been started, while working \ntogether with our friends and allies.\n  I submit to the desk an amendment that would encourage the \nadministration to step up efforts to gain support from the \ninternational community, call on other countries to eliminate debt that \nwas incurred during Saddam Hussein's regime, and examine the \nfeasibility of repayment of funds spent on infrastructure projects. I \nsubmit the amendment and will call it up later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is submitted.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S12265]]\n\n  Specifically, this amendment would require the President to report to \nCongress within 4 months on the following items:\n  First, the amendment calls for an assessment of U.S. efforts to \nenhance financial contributions from other countries and international \norganizations to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq, including a list \nof those countries contributing and the amount of their \ncontribution. As we move forward with our efforts, additional support \nfrom other countries and organizations would be extremely helpful.\n\n  Second, the amendment requires an assessment of the impact that debt \nincurred by the regime of Saddam Hussein has on the country's ability \nto move forward with efforts to rebuild infrastructure and restore \nessential services such as health care and education. It also calls for \nan analysis of the impact that forgiveness of such debt would have on \nIraq's ability to move forward with reform, and it would require a \ndetailed list of countries that have eliminated their debt and the \namounts.\n  Finally, my amendment calls for an assessment of the feasibility of \nIraq's ability to repay the United States for a portion of American \nfunds spent on infrastructure projects in Iraq. Although I think we \nmust now provide funds in the form of a grant, we should look at the \npossibility of any further help in terms of possible repayment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment which \nunderscores the importance of working together with our friends and \nallies abroad to promote security and improve the quality of life for \nthe Iraqi people. While I believe we should encourage support from \nforeign countries and international organizations as we move forward in \nIraq, I support the funding requested by the President, both the \nmilitary portion and the funds for reconstruction in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  We have a golden opportunity to guarantee a new era of freedom and \ndemocracy for the people in Iraq. It is one we cannot afford to miss. \nThis is an investment in a better future for Iraq, the Middle East, and \nthe world at large. It is an investment for our children and our \ngrandchildren. I believe it is the right thing to do. I hope this body \nhas the courage to rise to the occasion and take advantage of this \nwonderful opportunity that could ensure that our children and \ngrandchildren are going to live in a peaceful world and not be \nthreatened by terrorism, the cancer that has newly appeared on the face \nof the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I spoke yesterday on the floor and also \nin the Appropriations Committee in support of having the $20 billion \nwhich the administration has asked for the reconstruction of Iraq to be \nin the form of loans or loan guarantees instead of grants. I have made \nthat suggestion in an effort to be helpful to the administration.\n  I analogize the situation in Iraq to a company, an enterprise, an \nentity in bankruptcy. Iraq is supposed to have some $200 billion in \nobligations. By analogy to a bankruptcy proceeding, those obligations \nare to be discharged. General creditors come last in line and, in the \nabsence of any assets, they receive nothing.\n  The situation for the United States in advancing funds for the \nreconstruction of Iraq, it seems to me, ought to be in loans or loan \nguarantees because Iraq has substantial potential for its oil revenues, \nsitting on the second largest pool of oil in the world. I reject the \ncontention that this would discourage other donor nations from helping \nIraq. It seems to me if the United States is to come in and make a \ngift, a grant, that just encourages other nations to say: Well, let's \nlet the United States do it.\n  If we at least refrain from taking a position until the donors \nconference on October 23 in Madrid, then we might use our situation to \nleverage funds from other countries.\n  The argument has also been advanced that if we make a loan or a loan \nguarantee, it will confirm to the Arab nations the contention that we \nare just there for Iraq oil. But that is a specious contention because \nwe are not taking the money for ourselves or our military operations \nbut using it only for the rebuilding of Iraq which is for the benefit \nof the people of Iraq.\n  Since I made the statements yesterday, a very able staff member, my \ngeneral counsel David Brog, has researched the subject and has found a \nSecurity Council resolution which is very relevant to this proposition, \na resolution which was enacted on May 21 of this year. The resolution \nis No. 1483, and it provides that there is to be a fund created. And \nthe fund, under the control of the United States and the United \nKingdom, may be used to pay for the rebuilding of Iraq. So that when we \nare searching for multilateralism and when we are searching for United \nNations approval, not just what the United States might want to do or \nthe United States and Great Britain might want to do, this U.N. \nResolution 1483 provides that authority.\n  It also is of substantial assistance in answering a legal question \nwhich I had raised yesterday, which posed some difficulty, and that is: \nTo whom would the United States loan the money? Who would be the \ncontract party when there is no government in Iraq at the present time?\n  The U.N. resolution which establishes this fund has a reference to \nU.N. participation, International Monetary Fund participation, World \nBank participation, and auditing which is to be done by many countries, \nincluding Arab countries, so that the fund, in and of itself, it seems \nto me, as a legal proposition, has sufficient status as an entity to be \na contracting party. So that when the revenues are realized from Iraqi \noil, or they go into the fund, the United States may deal with the \nfund, with the other parties present--as I say, the World Bank, \nInternational Monetary Fund, the U.N., and auditing countries--having \nsome status with the fund to give extra assurances of fairness that the \ncontract is really in the interest of the Iraqi people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of U.N. \nResolution 1483 be printed in the Congressional Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have further extracted an analysis of \nthis U.N. resolution, which is hard to follow if you just pick up the \nresolution and read it. The analysis establishes the approach I have \njust summarized. One clause, which is denominated Roman numeral I--\nfirst, I ask unanimous consent that this addendum be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Roman numeral I is the clause which recognizes the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom as the authority.\n  Roman numeral II establishes the Development Fund for Iraq, including \nestablishing the International Advisory and Monitoring Board to audit \nin the Development Fund.\n  Roman numeral III from the U.N. resolution gives the authority and \npower to disburse the funds in the Development Fund for Iraq.\n  Roman numeral IV establishes that the Development Fund for Iraq must \nbe used, among other things, for the economic reconstruction and repair \nof Iraq's infrastructure.\n  Roman numeral V mandates that 95 percent of the proceeds received \nfrom export sales of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas \nmust be deposited into the Development Fund for Iraq until an Iraqi \ngovernment is properly constituted. The other 5 percent is to be \ndeposited into the Compensation Fund, which was set up, per U.N. \nResolution 687 in 1991, to compensate those who suffered losses or \ndamages as a result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait.\n  In effect, this Security Council resolution anticipates the precise \nissue which the Congress is now facing. It is necessary to have these \nfunds for the rebuilding of Iraq, but there is no good reason it ought \nto be a grant or a gift. When Iraq has the resources--the oil--to pay \nfor the reconstruction of Iraq and to take care of the rebuilding of\n\n[[Page S12266]]\n\nIraq; and with the authority of the U.N. it eliminates any concern \nabout the United States acting unilaterally or in conjunction with the \nUnited Kingdom--acting with the two countries unilaterally--because \nthis has been sanctioned by the United Nations. Creating this fund, \nthere is an entity to look to, to provide the repayment, as the U.N. \nresolution calls for 95 percent of the fund to be used for the \nrebuilding of Iraq.\n  There is significant concern in the Congress--I have heard it among \nmy colleagues--as to how these funds are to be advanced. The \nadministration has taken the position that they want grants or gifts. \nFrom my soundings in Pennsylvania and from what I hear from my \ncolleagues in other States, the American people are very concerned \nabout what is going on in Iraq generally, they are very concerned about \nthe casualties and fatalities.\n  We honor and respect and praise the Armed Forces for the military \nvictory which has been achieved. We are concerned about our military \npersonnel there not really being police officials, hopeful that there \nwill be U.N. assistance on other forces being there, looking for an \nIraqi police force to be trained. But when it comes to the issue of the \nadvancement of funds, this Security Council resolution sets parameters, \nsets the procedures, which authorizes and authenticates the propriety \nof having the loans made or loan guarantees so that the United States \ncan be repaid.\n  I hear considerable concern among my constituents, and I hear it from \nmy colleagues in the Senate, about the tightness of our budget, the \ndifficulties of providing important discretionary funding. In \nSeptember, I managed the bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation. Notwithstanding that $136.6 billion is really insufficient \nfunds to take care of all of our educational, health, and worker safety \nneeds, I think it is appropriate and reassuring to the American people \nthat where we can avoid adding to the deficit and to the national debt, \nwe take steps to do just that.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Analysis of the UN Resolution 1484 as it pertains to the Development \n                             Fund for Iraq\n\n(adopted by the United Nations on May 21, 2003 by a vote of 14-0, with \n                        Syria not participating)\n\n\n  i. the following clause recognizes the united states and the united \n    kingdom as the ``authority'' (un resolution 1484, pg. 2 para. 3)\n\n       Noting the letter of 8 May 2003 from the Permanent \n     Representatives of the United States of America and the \n     United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the \n     President of the Security Council (S/2003/538) and \n     recognizing the specific authorities, responsibilities, and \n     obligations under applicable international law of these \n     states as occupying powers under unified command (the \n     ``Authority''),\n\n\n  ii. the following clause establishes the development fund for iraq, \nincluding establishing the international advisory and monitoring board \n  to audit the development fund. (un resolution 1484, pg. 4, para. 12)\n\n       12. Notes the establishment of a Development Fund for Iraq \n     to be held by the Central Bank of Iraq and to be audited by \n     independent public accountants approved by the International \n     Advisory and Monitoring Board of the Development Fund for \n     Iraq and looks forward to the early meeting of that \n     International Advisory and Monitoring Board, whose members \n     shall include duly qualified representatives of the \n     Secretary-General, of the Managing Director of the \n     International Monetary Fund, of the Director-General of the \n     Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development, and of the \n     President of the World Bank;\n\n\niii. the following clause gives the ``authority'' the power to disburse \nthe funds in the development fund for iraq. (un resolution 1484, pg. 4, \n                               para. 13)\n\n       13. Notes further that the funds in the Development Fund \n     for Iraq shall be disbursed at the direction of the \n     Authority, in consultation with the Iraqi interim \n     administration, for the purposes set out in paragraph 14 \n     below;\n\n\niv. the following clause establishes that the Development Fund for Iraq \n must be used, among other things, for the economic reconstruction and \nrepair of the Iraq's infrastructure. (un resolution 1484, pg. 4, para. \n                                  14)\n\n       14. Underlines that the Development Fund for Iraq shall be \n     used in a transparent manner to meet the humanitarian needs \n     of the Iraqi people, for the economic reconstruction and \n     repair of Iraq's infrastructure, for the continued \n     disarmament of Iraq, and for the costs of Iraqi civilian \n     administration, and for other purposes benefiting the people \n     of Iraq;\n\n\nv. the following clause mandates that 95% of the proceeds received from \nexport sales of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas must be \ndeposited into the development fund for iraq until an iraqi government \n   is properly constituted. (the other 5% will be deposited into the \n compensation fund, which was set up, per un resolution 687 (1991), to \n compensate those who suffered losses or damages as a result of iraq's \n invasion and occupation of kuwait). (un resolution 1484, pg. 6, para. \n                                  20)\n\n       20. Decides that all export sales of petroleum, petroleum \n     products, and natural gas from Iraq following the date of the \n     adoption of this resolution shall be made consistent with \n     prevailing international market best practices, to be audited \n     by independent public accountants reporting to the \n     International Advisory and Monitoring Board referred to in \n     paragraph 12 above in order to ensure transparency, and \n     decides further that, except as provided in paragraph 21 \n     below, all proceeds from such sales shall be deposited into \n     the Development Fund for Iraq until such time as an \n     internationally recognized, representative government of Iraq \n     is properly constituted;\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n        (From the United Nations Security Council, 21 May 2003.)\n\n\nspain, united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and united \n                  states of america: draft resolution\n\n       The Security Council,\n       Recalling all its previous relevant resolutions,\n       Reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \n     Iraq,\n       Reaffirming also the importance of the disarmament of Iraqi \n     weapons of mass destruction and of eventual confirmation of \n     the disarmament of Iraq,\n       Stressing the right of the Iraqi people freely to determine \n     their own political future and control their own natural \n     resources, welcoming the commitment of all parties concerned \n     to support the creation of an environment in which they may \n     do so as soon as possible, and expressing resolve that the \n     day when Iraqis govern themselves must come quickly,\n       Encouraging efforts by the people of Iraq to form a \n     representative government based on the rule of law that \n     affords equal rights and justice to all Iraqi citizens \n     without regard to ethnicity, religion, or gender, and, in \n     this connection, recalls resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October \n     2000,\n       Welcoming the first steps of the Iraqi people in this \n     regard, and noting in this connection the 15 April 2003 \n     Nasiriyah statement and the 28 April 2003 Baghdad statement,\n       Resolved that the United Nations should play a vital role \n     in humanitarian relief, the reconstruction of Iraq, and the \n     restoration and establishment of national and local \n     institutions for representative governance,\n       Noting the statement of 12 April 2003 by the Ministers of \n     Finance and Central Bank Governors of the Group of Seven \n     Industrialized Nations in which the members recognized the \n     need for a multilateral effort to help rebuild and develop \n     Iraq and for the need for assistance from the International \n     Monetary Fund and the World Bank in these efforts,\n       Welcoming also the resumption of humanitarian assistance \n     and the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General and the \n     specialized agencies to provide food and medicine to the \n     people of Iraq,\n       Welcoming the appointment by the Secretary-General of his \n     Special Adviser on Iraq,\n       Affirming the need for accountability for crimes and \n     atrocities committed by the previous Iraqi regime,\n       Stressing the need for respect for the archaelogical, \n     historical, cultural, and religious heritage of Iraq, and for \n     the continued protection of archaeological, historical, \n     cultural, and religious sites, museums, libraries, and \n     monuments.\n       Noting the letter of 8 May 2003 from the Permanent \n     Representatives of the United States of America and the \n     United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the \n     President of the Security Council (S/2003/538) and \n     recognizing the specific authorities, responsibilities, and \n     obligations under applicable international law of these \n     states as occupying powers under unified command (the \n     ``Authority''),\n       Noting further that other States are not occupying powers \n     are working now or in the future may work under the \n     Authority,\n       Welcoming further the willingness of Member States to \n     contribute to stability and security in Iraq by contributing \n     personnel, equipment, and other resources under the \n     Authority,\n       Concerned that many Kuwaitis and Third-State Nationals \n     still are not accounted for since 2 August 1990,\n       Determining that the situation in Iraq, although improved, \n     continues to constitute a threat to international peace and \n     security,\n       Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United \n     Nations,\n       1.

Calls upon the international financial institutions to \n     assist the people of Iraq in the reconstruction and \n     development of their economy and to facilitate assistance by \n     the broader donor community, and welcomes the readiness of \n     creditors, including those of the Paris Club, to seek a \n     solution to Iraq's sovereign debt problems;\n       16. Requests also that the Secretary-General, in \n     coordination with the Authority, continue the exercise of his \n     responsibilities under Security Council resolution 1472 \n     (2003) of 28 March 2003 and 1476 (2003) of 24 April 2003, for \n     a period of six months following the adoption of this \n     resolution, and terminate within this time period, in the \n     most cost effective manner, the ongoing operations of the \n     ``Oil-for-Food'' Programme (the ``Programme''), both at \n     headquarters level and in the field, transferring \n     responsibility for the administration of any remaining \n     activity under the Programme to the Authority, including by \n     taking the following necessary measures:\n       (a) to facilitate as soon as possible the shipment and \n     authenticated delivery of priority civilian goods as \n     identified by the Secretary-General and representatives \n     designated by him, in coordination with the Authority and the \n     Iraqi interim administration, under approved and funded \n     contracts previously concluded by the previous Government of \n     Iraq, for the humanitarian relief of the people of Iraq, \n     including, as necessary, negotiating adjustments in the terms \n     or conditions of these contracts and respective letters of \n     credit as set forth in paragraph 4(d) of resolution 1472 \n     (2003);\n       (b) to review, in light of changed circumstances, in \n     coordination with the Authority and the Iraqi interim \n     administration, the relative utility of each approved and \n     funded contract with a view to determining whether such \n     contracts contain items required to meet the needs of the \n     people of Iraq both now and during reconstruction, and to \n     postpone action on those contracts determined to be of \n     questionable utility and the respective letters of credit \n     until an internationally recognized, representative \n     government of Iraq is in a position to make its own \n     determination as to whether such contracts shall be \n     fulfilled;\n       (c) to provide the Security Council within 21 days \n     following the adoption of this resolution, for the Security \n     Council's review and consideration, an estimated operating \n     budget based on funds already set aside in the account \n     established pursuant to paragraph 8(d) of resolution 986 \n     (1995) of 14 April 1995, identifying:\n       (i) all known and projected costs to the United Nations \n     required to ensure the continued functioning of the \n     activities associated with implementation of the present \n     resolution, including operating and administrative expenses \n     associated with the relevant United Nations agencies and \n     programmes responsible for the implementation of the \n     Programme both at Headquarters and in the field;\n       (ii) all known and projected costs associated with \n     termination of the Programme;\n       (iii) all known and projected costs associated with \n     restoring Government of Iraq funds that were provided by \n     Member States to the Secretary-General as requested in \n     paragraph 1 of resolution 778 (1992); and\n       (iv) all known and projected costs associated with the \n     Special Representative and the qualified representative of \n     the Secretary-General identified to serve on the \n     International Advisory and Monitoring Board, for the six \n     month time period defined above, following which these costs \n     shall be borne by the United Nations;\n       (d) to consolidate into a single fund the accounts \n     established pursuant to paragraphs 8(a) and 8(b) of \n     resolution 986 (1995);\n       (e) to fulfill all remaining obligations related to the \n     termination of the Programme, including negotiating, in the \n     most cost effective manner, any necessary settlement \n     payments, which shall be made from the escrow\n\n[[Page S12268]]\n\n     accounts established pursuant to paragraphs 8(a) and 8(b) of \n     resolution 986 (1995), with those parties that previously \n     have entered into contractual obligations with the Secretary-\n     General under the Programme, and to determine, in \n     coordination with the Authority and the Iraqi interim \n     administration, the future status of contracts undertaken \n     by the United Nations and related United Nations agencies \n     under the accounts established pursuant to paragraphs 8 \n     (b) and 8 (d) of resolution 986 (1995);\n       (f) to provide the Security Council, 30 days prior to the \n     termination of the Programme, with a comprehensive strategy \n     developed in close coordination with the Authority and the \n     Iraqi interim administration that would lead to the delivery \n     of all relevant documentation and the transfer of all \n     operational responsibility of the Programme to the Authority;\n       17. Requests further that the Secretary-General transfer as \n     soon as possible to the Development Fund for Iraq 1 billion \n     United States dollars from unencumbered funds in the accounts \n     established pursuant to paragraphs 8 (a) and 8 (b) of \n     resolution 986 (1995), restore Government of Iraq funds that \n     were provided by Member States to the Secretary-General as \n     requested in paragraph 1 of resolution 778 (1992), and \n     decides that, after deducting all relevant United Nations \n     expenses associated with the shipment of authorized contracts \n     and costs to the Programme outlined in paragraph 16 (c) \n     above, including residual obligations, all surplus funds in \n     the escrow accounts established pursuant to paragraphs 8 (a), \n     8 (b), 8 (d), and 8 (f) of resolution 986 (1995) shall be \n     transferred at the earliest possible time to the Development \n     Fund for Iraq;\n       18. Decides to terminate effective on the adoption of this \n     resolution the functions related to the observation and \n     monitoring activities undertaken by the Secretary-General \n     under the Programme, including the monitoring of the export \n     of petroleum and petroleum products from Iraq;\n       19. Decides to terminate the Committee established pursuant \n     to paragraph 6 of resolution 661 (1990) at the conclusion of \n     the six month period called for in paragraph 16 above and \n     further decides that the Committee shall identify individuals \n     and entities referred to in paragraph 23 below;\n       20. Decides that all export sales of petroleum, petroleum \n     products, and natural gas from Iraq following the date of the \n     adoption of this resolution shall be made consistent with \n     prevailing international market best practices, to be audited \n     by independent public accountants reporting to the \n     International Advisory and Monitoring Board referred to in \n     paragraph 12 above in order to ensure transparency, and \n     decides further that, except as provided in paragraph 21 \n     below, all proceeds from such sales shall be deposited into \n     the Development Fund for Iraq until such time as an \n     internationally recognized, representative government of Iraq \n     is properly constituted;\n       21. Decides further that 5 percent of the proceeds referred \n     to in paragraph 20 above shall be deposited into the \n     Compensation Fund established in accordance with resolution \n     687 (1991) and subsequent relevant resolutions and that, \n     unless an internationally recognized, representative \n     government of Iraq and the Governing Council of the United \n     Nations Compensation Commission, in the exercise of its \n     authority over methods of ensuring that payments are made \n     into the Compensation Fund, decide otherwise, this \n     requirement shall be binding on a properly constituted, \n     internationally recognized, representative government of Iraq \n     and any successor thereto;\n       22. Noting the relevance of the establishment of an \n     internationally recognized, representative government of Iraq \n     and the desirability of prompt completion of the \n     restructuring of Iraq's debt as referred to in paragraph 15 \n     above, further decides that, until December 31, 2007, unless \n     the Council decides otherwise, petroleum products, and \n     natural gas originating in Iraq shall be immune, until title \n     passes to the initial purchaser from legal proceedings \n     against them and not be subject to any form of attachment, \n     garnishment, or execution, and that all States shall take any \n     steps that may be necessary under their respective domestic \n     legal systems to assure this protection, and that proceeds \n     and obligations arising from sales thereof, as well as the \n     Development Fund for Iraq, shall enjoy privileges and \n     immunities equivalent to those enjoyed by the United Nations \n     except that the above-mentioned privileges and immunities \n     will not apply with respect to any legal proceeding in which \n     recourse to such proceeds or obligations is necessary to \n     satisfy liability for damages assessed in connection with an \n     ecological accident, including an oil spill, that occurs \n     after the date of adoption of this resolution;\n       23. Decides that all Member States in which there are:\n       (a) funds or other financial assets or economic resources \n     of the previous Government of Iraq or its state bodies, \n     corporations, or agencies, located outside Iraq as of the \n     date of this resolution, or\n       (b) funds or other financial assets or economic resources \n     that have been removed from Iraq, or acquired, by Saddam \n     Hussein or other senior officials of the former Iraqi regime \n     and their immediate family members, including entities owned \n     or controlled, directly or indirectly, by them or by persons \n     acting on behalf or at their direction,\n\n     shall freeze without delay these funds or other financial \n     assets or economic resources and, unless these funds or other \n     financial assets or economic resources are themselves the \n     subject of a prior judicial, administrative, or arbitral lien \n     or judgment, immediately shall cause their transfer to the \n     Development Fund for Iraq, it being understood that, unless \n     otherwise addressed, claims made by private individuals or \n     non-government entities on those transferred funds or other \n     financial assets may be presented to the internationally \n     recognized, representative government of Iraq; and decides \n     further that all such funds or other financial assets or \n     economic resources shall enjoy the same privileges, \n     immunities, and protections as provided under paragraph 22;\n       24. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council \n     at regular intervals on the work of the Special \n     Representative with respect to the implementation of this \n     resolution and on the work of the International Advisory and \n     Monitoring Board and encourages, the United Kingdom of Great \n     Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America \n     to inform the Council at regular intervals of their efforts \n     under this resolution;\n       25. Decides to review the implementation of this resolution \n     within twelve months of adoption and to consider further \n     steps that might be necessary.\n       26. Calls upon Member States and international and regional \n     organizations to contribute to the implementation of this \n     resolution;\n       27. Decides to remain seized of this matter.\n\n\n                    Allegations of White House Leaks\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a considerable controversy has arisen as \nto the allegations of leaks from the White House with respect to the \nidentification of a CIA operative, or a CIA agent, and there have been \ncalls for special counsel to be appointed by the Attorney General.\n  The Attorney General has taken the position that the investigation \ncan be appropriately carried out by the professionals in the Department \nof Justice and the professionals in the FBI.\n  I think it is curious that the call for a special counsel has come \nonly after the issue has become a cause celebre with the publication by \nthe Washington Post of the front page story on Sunday. This \ninvestigation had been pending for a protracted period of time. It came \nto light in a newspaper column back in July. But until it had attained \nnotoriety and attracted public attention, nobody came forward to make a \nsuggestion that there ought to be special counsel.\n  The Congress of the United States decided to allow the independent \ncounsel statute to lapse. We considered it in 1999 in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. Legislation was introduced by Senator Collins and \nmyself on the Republican side, and Senators Levin and Lieberman on \nbehalf of the Democrats. But there was no interest in having the \nindependent counsel statute continued.\n  I favored the independent counsel because it established a specific \nprocedure as to when there ought to be independent counsel in the event \nof a prospective conflict of interest, or appearance of conflict; it \nprovided for judicial appointment of independent counsel. But that was \nrejected by the Congress. And it is interesting to know that of all \nthose on the other side of the aisle among the Democratic Senators, \nnone of them had cosponsored the legislation or, to my knowledge, had \nspoken in favor of the legislation--except, as I have noted, Senator \nLevin and Senator Lieberman.\n  In rejecting a call to renew independent counsel, what we had was the \njudgment of the Congress that the existing institutions were \nsufficient. That is having it in the Department of Justice and having \nthe procedures established by the Attorney General who was in office \nduring the Clinton administration.\n\n  I suggest having decided that, we ought to give the existing \ninstitutions an opportunity to function. I think it is important to \nnote that it wasn't the Attorney General who started the investigation, \nit was one of his subordinates. The matter is being handled by Mr. John \nDion, who is a career professional. I had considerable contact with Mr. \nDion during the course of the Judiciary Committee oversight when \nIndependent Counsel Starr was in operation.\n  The matter is being investigated by the FBI and is being kept at the \nheadquarters level to assure greater involvement and control by \nDirector Robert Mueller. It ought to be noted Director Mueller has a \n10-year term. His term will not expire for 2\\1/2\\ years after a \nprospective second term of President Bush. FBI Directors have\n\n[[Page S12269]]\n\nbeen known to be independent and professional. Former FBI Director \nLouis Freeh had considerable disagreements with President Clinton and \nrefused to give information to the White House at a time when Director \nFreeh concluded there was a criminal investigation which might involve \nPresident Clinton. So we have a standard for professionalism by the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and we have a standard of \nprofessionalism by the career people in the Department of Justice.\n  There is also the oversight by the Judiciary Committee. This is a \nmatter where we took considerable interest in what Independent Counsel \nKen Starr did. It is worth noting that there are many members of the \nJudiciary Committee who have experience as prosecuting attorneys with \nthe attendant responsibilities for investigation.\n  I was district attorney of Philadelphia for some 8 years. We have on \nthe committee staff other former DAs, attorneys general, U.S. \nattorneys, so that the Judiciary Committee is in a position to have \noversight, our constitutional responsibility, to see to it that the \ninvestigation is appropriately carried out.\n  There may come a time when special counsel would be warranted, but it \nseems to me that at this stage, there ought not to be politicization of \nthe matter, although I understand the ways of Washington, but it is \nanomalous that those who are now calling for special counsel had no \ninterest in institutionalizing the independent counsel except, as I \nsay, for Senator Lieberman and Senator Levin.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we know there is concern on the other side \nof the aisle, and certainly at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, regarding \nproblems with leaking information from the White House or someplace in \nthe administration to Robert Novak. We know that causes concern, as it \nshould. To try to cloud this with a lot of legal jargon that there are \nother lawyers looking at it, that Democrats didn't support this \nindependent counsel statute is evading the question.\n  We don't have to support an independent counsel statute to have the \nlaw as it now applies which allows the appointment of a special \ncounsel.\n  It seems to me common sense that if an independent counsel was \nselected to look at Secretary Espy, the Secretary of Agriculture, \nbecause he accepted tickets to a football game, which he was not \nsupposed to do, and President Clinton--by the way, an independent \ncounsel was not ordered; he agreed to an independent counsel to \ninvestigate his real estate transaction in Arkansas--it seems to me \ncertainly we should have a special counsel look at what has taken \nplace.\n  We know a crime has been committed by a person or persons. We know \nthat Robert Novak, who I think is an honorable person, identified from \nwhere that information came. So we know there are criminals there. We \nknow there are people there who have committed crimes. So it seems to \nme this is a much more direct case than some of the other issues that \nhave taken place in the past; namely, the issue with President Clinton \nand the situation with Secretary Espy.\n  The situation here is very clear: Someone leaked the name of a CIA \noperative, a Central Intelligence Agency operative, a spy, an American \nspy. They leaked the name of that person to the press by name.\n  Everyone--I agree--should take a deep breath and let this process go \nforward. The White House should want a special counsel. In Government, \nwe not only have to do away with what is bad but what looks bad. The \nAmerican people clearly know this.\n  ABC and the Washington Post are going to report a poll tomorrow. I \nwill not go into a lot of the details, but one question they asked is: \nDo you think this investigation should be handled by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, part of the Bush administration, or should it be \nhandled by an outside investigator or special counsel who is not part \nof the Bush administration?\n  About 70 percent of the people believe it should be handled outside \nthe White House, outside the Justice Department.\n  Another question: If the investigation finds that someone in the \nWhite House leaked classified information, do you think that person \nshould or should not lose his job?\n  Ninety-one percent of the people believe that person or those people \nshould lose their jobs--91 percent of the people.\n  Another question that will be reported by the American Broadcasting \nCompany in the morning: If the investigation finds that someone in the \nWhite House leaked classified information, do you think that person \nshould or should not face criminal charges?\n  About 85 percent of the people believe that person should face \ncriminal charges.\n  It is very clear to me this is an effort to cover up a problem. This \nis not something that I brought up just to be talking. If people are \ngoing to come here and try to cover this up, anytime anyone does that, \nand I am on the Senate floor, I am going to talk about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Nevada that \nthis is a serious matter. When he quotes the poll, I would say it would \ngo beyond losing jobs. If someone has violated the law, there is a very \nsubstantial jail sentence which is proposed. But my comments I do not \nthink constituted legal jargon at all. I think they were taking a look \nat the fact that the Congress has decided we would not have an \nindependent counsel procedure when we did not renew the law. I fought \nhard to have that done as a principal position, regardless of which \nparty is involved.\n  Now there is an immediate call for special counsel only after this \nmatter becomes highly publicized, only after it becomes an opportunity \nfor political gain--only then. This matter was pending since July when \nthe CIA and part of the administration asked the Department of Justice \nfor an investigation, and the investigation was going forward. Now it \nhas been the subject of a demand for a special prosecutor by people who \nwere indifferent to the institution of Government when independent \ncounsel was considered for renewal.\n  We have a Department of Justice with professionals. We have an FBI \nwith a Director who has a 10-year term. To repeat, his term will not \nexpire until 2\\1/2\\ years after the end of the prospective second term \nfor President Bush. So far, we have allegations, and they are serious \nallegations, and they ought to be investigated in due course without an \nimmediate attempt for politicization, once it becomes a matter of high \nvisibility as it has been since last Sunday. It only took until Monday \nto have a call for the independent counsel, and here we are on \nWednesday.\n  Mr. President, I have been asked to handle the wrapup material on \nbehalf of the majority leader as the sole remaining standing Republican \npresent on the Senate floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1795, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 1795 be modified with the language at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.    COMMENDING THE ARMED FORCES FOR EFFORTS IN OPERATION \n                   ENDURING FREEDOM AND OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--Recognizing and commending the members of the \n     United States Armed Forces and their leaders, and the allies \n     of the Untied States and their armed forces, who participated \n     in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and recognizing the continuing \n     dedication of military families and employers and defense \n     civilians and contractors and the countless communities and \n     patriotic organizations that lent their support to the Armed \n     Forces during those operations.\n       (b) The Senate finds\n       That the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the \n     United States, which killed thousands of people from the \n     United States and other countries in New York, Virginia, and \n     Pennsylvania, inaugurated the Global War on Terrorism;\n       That the intelligence community quickly identified Al Qaeda \n     as a terrorist organization with global reach and the \n     President determined that United States national security \n     required the elimination of the Al Qaeda terrorist \n     organization;\n       That the Taliban regime of Afghanistan had long harbored Al \n     Qaeda, providing members of that organization a safe haven \n     from\n\n[[Page S12270]]\n\n     which to attack the United States and its friends and allies, \n     and the refusal of that regime to discontinue its support for \n     international terrorism and surrender Al Qaeda's leaders to \n     the United States made it a threat to international peace and \n     security;\n       That Saddam Hussein and his regime's longstanding \n     sponsorship of international terrorism, active pursuit of \n     weapons of mass destruction, use of such weapons against \n     Iraq's own citizens and neighboring countries, aggression \n     against Iraq's neighbors, and brutal repression of Iraq's \n     population made Saddam Hussein and his regime a threat to \n     international peace and security;\n       That the United States pursued sustained diplomatic, \n     political, and economic efforts to remove those threats \n     peacefully;\n       That on October 7, 2001, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations \n     in Afghanistan, designated as Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     that quickly caused the collapse of the Taliban regime, the \n     elimination of Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure, and \n     the capture of significant and numerous members of Al Qaeda;\n       That on March 19, 2003, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations, \n     designated as Operation Iraqi Freedom, that quickly caused \n     the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, the elimination of \n     Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, the end of Iraq's illicit \n     and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \n     and the capture of significant international terrorists;\n       That in those two campaigns in the Global War on Terrorism, \n     as of September 27, 2003, nearly 165,000 members of the \n     United States Armed Forces, comprised of active, reserve, and \n     National Guard members and units, had mobilized for Operation \n     Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       That success in those two campaigns in the Global War on \n     Terrorism would not have been possible without the \n     dedication, courage, and service of the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and the military and irregular forces of \n     the friends and allies of the United States;\n       That the support, love, and commitment from the families of \n     United States service personnel participating in those two \n     operations, as well as that of the communities and patriotic \n     organizations which provided support through the United \n     Services Organization (USO), Operation Dear Abby, and \n     Operation UpLink, helped to sustain those service personnel \n     and enabled them to eliminate significant threats to United \n     States national security while liberating oppressed peoples \n     from dictatorial regimes;\n       That the civilian employees of the Department of Defense, \n     through their hard work and dedication, enabled United States \n     military forces to quickly and effectively achieve the United \n     States military missions in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       That the commitment of companies making their employees \n     available for military service, the creativity and initiative \n     of contractors equipping the Nation's Armed Forces with the \n     best and most modern equipment, and the ingenuity of service \n     companies assisting with the global overseas deployment of \n     the Armed Forces demonstrates that the entrepreneurial \n     spirit of the United States is an extraordinarily valuable \n     defense asset; and\n       That the Nation should pause to recognize with appropriate \n     tributes and days of remembrance the sacrifice of those \n     members of the Armed Forces who died or were wounded in \n     Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, as \n     well as all who served in or supported either of those \n     operations: Now, therefore, be it (c) It is the Sense of the \n     Senate that the Senate\n       (1) conveys its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     families and friends of the members of United States and \n     coalition forces who have been injured, wounded, or killed \n     during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       (2) commends President George W. Bush, Secretary of Defense \n     Donald H.

Agreed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today for the second in a series \nof statements that I plan to deliver about the hemorrhaging of American \nmanufacturing jobs and the steps that I think that we ought to take to \nstem the flow of manufacturing jobs abroad and to strengthen our \ndeteriorating manufacturing base.\n  Recently, I talked about how tax policy can help to strengthen \nAmerican manufacturing. Today, I want to discuss the role of Federal \nprocurement policy in supporting American businesses and American jobs.\n  The Buy American Act of 1933 is the primary statute that governs \nprocurement by the Federal Government. The name of the act accurately \nand succinctly describes its purpose: to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment supports domestic companies and domestic workers by buying \nAmerican-made goods.\n  It only makes sense for the Federal Government to make every effort \nto purchase goods that are made in America. A law requiring this \ncommonsense approach should not be necessary. Unfortunately, this law \nis necessary and, even more unfortunately, the law contains a number of \nloopholes that make it too easy for government agencies to buy foreign-\nmade goods.\n  I have often heard my colleagues say on this floor that American-made \ngoods are the best in the world. I could not agree more. For \ngenerations, Wisconsin has had an economy dominated by manufacturing, \nand Wisconsinites have proudly made goods under name brands that are \nknown around the country and even around the world brands such as \nOshkosh B'Gosh, Harley-Davidson, Snap-On Tools, Masterlock, and S.C. \nJohnson. Many Wisconsin factories have churned out products for the \nFederal Government, including for the Department of Defense.\n  Regrettably, thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs have left my \nState--77,000 jobs of this kind in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. Those \ncompanies that remain in my State often struggle to compete with \ncheaper foreign goods that flood into U.S. markets--even when they may \nbe competing for contracts to supply our own Federal Government.\n  This Congress should do more to ensure that the Federal Government \nmakes every effort to buy American-made goods by strengthening the \nprovisions of the Buy American Act.\n  Some argue that the Buy American Act has outlived its usefulness in \ntoday's global economy. I could not disagree more. I strongly disagree. \nThe act is as relevant today as it was when it was enacted in 1933. The \npassage of 70 years has not diminished the importance of this act for \nAmerican manufacturing companies or for those who are employed in this \ncrucial sector of our economy.\n  In fact, a strong argument can be made that this act is even more \nnecessary today than it was 70 years ago. With American jobs heading \noverseas\n\n[[Page S12271]]\n\nat an alarming rate, the Government should be doing all it can to make \nsure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent to support American jobs.\n  Some argue that the Buy American Act is protectionist and anti-free \ntrade. I disagree. Supporting American industry is not protectionist; \nit is just common sense. The erosion of our manufacturing base needs to \nbe stopped, and Congress should support procurement and trade policies \nthat help to ensure that we do not continue to lose jobs in this vital \nsegment of our economy.\n  Recently I introduced the Buy American Improvement Act, which would \nstrengthen the existing act by tightening its waiver provisions. \nCurrently, the heads of Federal Departments and Agencies are given \nbroad discretion to waive the act and to buy foreign goods. We should \nensure that American companies are given a fair chance to compete for \nFederal contracts.\n  Companies in Wisconsin tell me that they do not mind having to \ncompete for Federal and other contracts. In fact, they welcome the \nchance to compete and to put their high-quality products up against the \nbest that the United States and the world has to offer. What they are \nconcerned about is an uneven playing field that tilts in favor of \nforeign companies, which enjoy advantages including government \nsubsidies, lower labor costs, little environmental regulation, and \ndevalued currencies.\n  My constituents are also concerned about the prospect of certain \ntypes of industries leaving the United States completely, thus making \nthe Federal Government dependent on foreign sources for goods, such as \nplane or ship parts, that our military may need to acquire on short \nnotice.\n  In order to get a better picture of how often the Federal Government \nbuys foreign goods, my bill also would expand annual reporting \nrequirements regarding the use of Buy American Act waivers that \ncurrently apply only to the Department of Defense to include all \nFederal Departments and Agencies. I am pleased that the Senate has \nadopted amendments based on this provision that I have offered to a \nnumber of appropriations bills, thus putting the Senate on record in \nsupport of increased public disclosure regarding the use of Buy \nAmerican Act waivers.\n  I am also pleased that my legislation is supported by a broad array \nof business and labor groups including: Save American Manufacturing, \nthe U.S. Business and Industry Council, the International Association \nof Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the national and Wisconsin AFL-\nCIO, and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers.\n  In addition, I believe that the Senate itself should lead by example \nand make every effort to purchase American-made goods. For that reason, \nI recently sent a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Committee on Rules and Administration asking them to support \nstrengthening current law governing Senate procurement to clarify that \nthe Senate should comply with Buy American requirements.\n  My letter also asks that the Rules Committee direct the Secretary of \nthe Senate and the Sergeant at Arms to provide to the Senate an annual \nreport, beginning at the end of the current fiscal year, describing the \ndollar value of any articles, materials, or supplies purchased that are \nmanufactured outside of the United States, outlining the reasons for \nsuch foreign purchases, and providing a summary of total procurement \nfunds spent on goods manufactured in the United States versus funds \nspent on goods manufactured outside of the United States. This report \nis consistent with the annual report already required of the Pentagon. \nI think we in the Senate ourselves should comply with the same \nrequirement we impose on the Pentagon.\n  As I have repeatedly noted, Congress cannot simply stand on the \nsidelines while all these American jobs continue to be shipped \noverseas. While there may be no single solution to this problem, I \nbelieve that one way in which Congress should act is by strengthening \nthe Buy American Act. I will continue to come to the floor to discuss \nother ways in which we can work to strengthen this crucial segment of \nour economy in the coming weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12270-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12270-S12271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUPPORTING AMERICAN JOBS & THE BUY AMERICAN ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Madam President, last night the Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nCraig, and I were pleased to host, as cochairs of the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption--with two of our colleagues from the House, \nCongressman Oberstar and Congressman Camp, and with the help of over 70 \ncongressional offices--a celebration of the fifth annual Angels in \nAdoption Campaign.\n  I wanted to take a few minutes to speak about what a wonderful \nevening it was. Last night there were angels surrounded by stars on \nPennsylvania Avenue as we celebrated and honored 165 individuals from \n48 States for their work on behalf of children. Seventy Members of \nCongress and a total of almost 1,000 individuals were there as we \nawarded the national awards to Mohammad and Lanni Ali, who appeared in \nperson. He is challenged with his physical abilities right now so we \nwere so pleased to have him. Bruce Willis, who is the national \nspokesperson for foster care children, as asked by President Bush, was \nalso with us.\n  The Angels in Adoption Campaign is a very powerful way of celebrating \nthe miracle of adoption. We do work right on the Senate floor, through \nall of our work individually and collectively, to make the dream of \nadoption possible for so many children in the United States, as well as \ninternationally.\n  From Louisiana we were pleased to be joined by Beverly Lewis of \nAlexandria. She was nominated and received an award because she, as a \nsingle mother but with a wonderful career, adopted three children from \nRussia and is now fostering an 8-year-old girl. Pam Bolke of Baker was \nnominated by my colleague, Senator Breaux. After reading a newspaper \narticle about two young girls who had been abused, she and her husband \nstepped up and adopted the two little girls. Although they were filled \nwith rage, they are now growing to be beautiful, loving little girls \nbecause they have unconditional love.\n  Louise Bourne of Lafayette was nominated by Chris John from our \nState. And I will submit the details of that for the Record. And Karen \nCaldwell of New Orleans, who was nominated by Congressman David Vitter, \njoined us last night.\n  As you can see, we had from the State of Maine many individuals, and \nfrom almost every State in the Union, because the Senators in this \nChamber took it upon themselves--the Senator from Nevada joined us; \nSenator Bill Frist from Tennessee was with us--to seek out someone in \ntheir State, ordinary individuals but doing extraordinary work. Truly \nit was a wonderful evening to celebrate.\n  I will submit for the Record all of the angels, 165 individuals from \n48 States, who were honored. They all received, besides a standing \novation from all of us, the beautiful angels pin I am wearing today and \nwent home inspired and encouraged to do more for adoption.\n  It is an area on which we can agree, Democrats and Republicans. There \nis little disagreement among us on this issue. We have thousands of \nchildren in the United States waiting to be adopted, children whose \nrights have been terminated or the parental rights have been \nterminated. We have waiting in the United States over 100,000 children \nof all ages. I will submit those numbers for the Record.\n  I see my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig. I thank him publicly \nfor all of his leadership and the great work he did to make last night \nand the work that our coalition does truly bipartisan and truly \neffective.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank my colleague from Louisiana. She and I have \nworked so very closely together over the last several years to move the \nissue of adoption and the development of the congressional coalition \nand now the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. All that she \nsays about last evening is so true. It was a gala event, well beyond \nour expectations, when we started this whole effort a good number of \nyears ago. Tonight, let me challenge every Senator who has not yet \nparticipated with us in the congressional coalition itself and in the \ninstitute to come on board and to be a part of what is truly a \nwonderful and worthwhile activity. Both Mary and I are adoptive \nparents, and we know what that has meant in our lives.\n  Now to facilitate the smoothing out of public policy, to make \nadoption\n\n[[Page S12272]]\n\ntruly an option of the right form in taking children into loving and \ncaring and safe environments to grow and to mature into sound adults is \na role all of us ought to be a part of. If you cannot do it as actively \nas both Mary and I do, then you should be with us in spirit and \nlegislation and participation but help us to grow this marvelous \nmovement.\n  Last night, with nearly 1,000 people and with the Alis and with Bruce \nWillis and a good many others, we were very pleased to honor these \nangels from across the country who Mary has so aptly described as \ncaring, giving, and loving people.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding and for her great work in this area.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We look forward to a great year.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nfollowing information which I referenced in my remarks.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                        Angels in Adoption 2003\n\n       Alabama: LaGretta Ratliff, Philip and Gina Richards.\n       Arizona: Joanne Karolzak, Peter and Pat Likens, David and \n     Diana Lucas, Lance and Barb Trella.\n       Arkansas: Jan Scholl, Lisenne Rockefeller.\n       California: Jesse and Linda Barela, Cecil and Pamela Ellis, \n     Audrey Foster, Reverend Paul and Linda Hoyt, Karen Lane, \n     Susan Lobo, Dave and Debbe Magnusen, Dr. David Sanders, \n     Shasta County Adoptions Program, Ed and Judy Shrader, Sierra \n     Adoptions Services, Karen Ullman.\n       Kim Matsunaga, Joshua and Lily Nie.\n       Connecticut: Anthony and Jacquelyn Barrows, Angel Torres.\n       District of Columbia: Linda Clausen.\n       Florida: Susana Huaman Dragosavac, Family Services of \n     Central Florida, Foster Children's Project Legal Aid Society \n     of PBC, Inc., A.J. and Susan Fremer, Marilys Llanos, Bill and \n     Patricia Manning, James and Betsy Seifert.\n       Georgia: Truett Cathy, Amanda Davis, James Outman, Joe \n     Woods.\n       Hawaii: Steven and Renee Saito.\n       Idaho: Meri Brennan, Jay and Sally Hilderbrandt, John and \n     Denise Martin.\n       Illinois: Adoption Information Center of Illinois, Dan and \n     Lynn Dempsey, Ben and Sherna Jennings, Sherri Nestmann, Cyndi \n     Norton, Gary and Marla Ringger.\n       Indiana: Loving Shepherd International, Owino Wodomony and \n     Dalia Owino, James and Verdell Releford.\n       Iowa: Dr. Rebecca Brandt, Ken and Char Kuhns, Terri and \n     Bruce Lippert.\n       Kansas: Allan Hazlett, Chuck and Ann Vanasse.\n       Kentucky: James and Judith Green, Saint Joseph Children's \n     Home.\n       Luoisiana: Pam Bolke, Louise Bourne, Karen Caldwell, \n     Beverly Lewis.\n       Maine: Jennifer Sylvester.\n       Maryland: Kim and Carol Cormany, Barbara Ann Dorsey, Susan \n     Faro, Mark McDermott.\n       Massachsetts: Loretta Cahill in memoriam, Nancy Hendrie, \n     Margaret O'Grady, Craig and Jane Pixley, Robert and Shirley \n     Siff, Carolyn Smith, Kathleen Teahan.\n       Michigan: Charlie and Jerry Brown, Jaclyn Hope Champnella, \n     Linda Cromartie, Sandra Jones, Kevin and Mary Julien, Paul \n     and Sherry Petroelje, Alan and Kristine Yeadon.\n       Minnesota: Becky and Gladys Abbott, Susan Freivalds, Larry \n     and Arlyce Morrell, North American Council on Adoptable \n     Children, Brad and Sandy Powers.\n       Mississippi: Nancy and Drew McDowell.\n       Missouri: George and Cyrilla Bender, Joan Bystrom, Dean and \n     Sheila Dutton, Randy and Linda Koenig, Laurie Murphy.\n       Montana: Claire and Patty Walker.\n       Nebraska: Dr. Edward and Sandy Kolb, Patrick and Patrice \n     Lappert, Patrick and Cindy Seitz, Eugene and Cindy Ulmer.\n       Nevada: Letha Davies, Steve and Kayleen Fotheringham, Rene \n     Phillips.\n       New Jersey: Eileen Crummy, Janet Farrand, Pamela Hasegawa, \n     Monsignor James J.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in New Haven, \nCT. On May 9, 2003, Jessica Mercado, a transgender Latina, was brutally \nmurdered. She was stabbed multiple times and then her body was burned. \nHer murder is believed to be a hate crime and her murder a result of \nthe homophobia of her attackers.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12272-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12272-S12273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHARLES TAYLOR AND LIBERIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \na provision included by Senator Gregg in the Commerce-Justice-State \nportion of the emergency supplemental which provides $2 million for \nrewards to anyone who brings Charles Taylor before the Special Court \nfor Sierra Leone.\n  I commend the senior Senator from New Hampshire for his strong \nleadership on this issue. Just a few months ago, when the Special \nProsecutor for Special Court unsealed his indictment against Charles \nTaylor, he and I came to the Senate floor together to commend this \nstrong and decisive action.\n  In that colloquy and in other floor statements, I described why it is \nso important for West Africa, as well as the cause of international \njustice, to bring Charles Taylor before the Special Court, I will not \nrepeat all of that here today, but I just want to make a couple of \nadditional points. Since his exile to Nigeria, press reports have \nrevealed that Charles Taylor continues to try to foment chaos and \ninstability in Liberia. There is no doubt that he wants to return, and \nwill do so if given the opportunity.\n  Charles Taylor needs to come before the Special Court. This needs to \nhappen immediately. Allowing him to remain in Nigeria is wrong. It is \nimpeding peace and prosperity in a region that has endured tremendous \nsuffering over the past decade.\n  The provision included in the supplemental can help get him before \nthe Special Court. I look forward to working with Senators Gregg and \nHollings\n\n[[Page S12273]]\n\nto keep this provision in the final version of the supplemental \nconference report.\n  I also want to point out that a humanitarian disaster continues to \nexist in Liberia, where thousands are without food, shelter, or basic \nmedical care. Even after emergency needs are addressed, Liberia will \nrequire substantial amounts of additional assistance, as three-fourths \nof its citizens are impoverished, the unemployment rate is 85 percent, \nand seven out of ten of combatants involved in recent fighting in \nLiberia are child soldiers.\n  I am worried that the world's attention is focused elsewhere and we \nwill simply forget about the plight of Liberia's people. In the coming \nweeks, I hope that we can find some money in this supplemental to \naddress these critical needs. Even a tiny percentage of the more than \n$87 billion in this bill would save many lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12273-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MOTHER TERESA\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Mother Teresa will soon be beatified by \nPope John Paul II in Rome, and I would like to take this opportunity to \nhonor the model that she was for the world by promoting love and \nrespect for all.\n  We in Congress often get overwhelmed with the amount of work and \nissues that we are faced with each day, but Mother Teresa put into \nperspective our mission when she said, ``We ourselves feel that what we \nare doing is just a drop in the ocean, but the ocean would be less \nbecause of that missing drop.''\n  Mother Teresa embodied the ultimate spirit of public service by \ngiving a 100 percent of herself to her constituents: the poor, the \nhungry, the homeless and, most of all, the unloved. Her determination \nto make the world a better place has left its mark on history and \nhumanity.\n  ``It is not how much we do, but how much love we put into doing. It \nis not how much we give, but how much love we put into giving,'' said \nMother Teresa. Let us not forget this valuable wisdom as the world \nhonors Mother Teresa next month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12273-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        75TH ANNIVERSARY OF NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate \nNewark Liberty International Airport's 75th Anniversary. On October 1, \n1928, the New York metropolitan region's first major airport was built \nby the great city of Newark on 68 acres of marshland just 16 miles from \nmidtown Manhattan. Soon those 68 acres became the world's busiest \ncommercial airport. The U.S. Army Air Corps operated the Airport during \nWWII, and in 1948, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey \nassumed control of it. The Port Authority has operated this airport \never since.\n  Today, some 30 million passengers use the airport annually. And \ninternational airlines offer direct service to many destinations around \nthe world from Newark Liberty. It is also one of only two truly \nintermodal air-rail connections in the country. Passengers can take a \ntrain from any city on the Northeast corridor and transfer at the \nairport for a flight. In some cases, they can even book the entire air/\nrail trip all at once. This should serve as a shinning example of how \nour national transportation system can work.\n  Over 24,000 people are employed at the Newark Liberty International \nAirport. The airport contributes $11.3 billion in economic activity to \nthe New York/New Jersey metropolitan region, including $3.3 billion in \nwages for some 110,000 jobs resulting from airport activity. In \naddition, the original 68 acres of marshland has grown to more than \n2,000 acres.\n  Newark Liberty International Airport's 75th birthday deserves more \nthan just a brief nod. As a former Port Authority Commissioner, I am \npleased to point out that the airport has been a leader in aviation \ntechnology. Newark, for instance, was the site of our great Nation's \nfirst air traffic control tower. The very same airport had the first \npaved runway, the first runway with lighting, which permitted nighttime \noperations, and the Nation's first airport weather station.\n  So, today I congratulate the Port Authority of New York and New \nJersey, Chairman Anthony Coscia, Executive Director Joseph Seymour, \nMayor of Newark Sharpe James, Aviation Director Bill DeCota, Airport \nGeneral Manager Susan Baer, her staff, and all others who have made \nNewark Liberty International Airport the world class facility it is \ntoday, and I look forward to celebrating 75 more years of safe, \nefficient operations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12273-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING RED PURSLEY\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise today to note with deep \nregret the passing of a true American hero, entrepreneur, and fellow \nserviceman, Lewis ``Red'' Pursley.\n  Red Pursley's journey through life came to a quiet and peaceful end \non September 30, 2003, at a hospice facility near his home in \nDouglasville, GA. A veteran of World War II and of the battlefields of \ncorporate commerce, as well as a loving father and pillar of his local \ncommunity, Mr. Pursley embodied the virtues that define the term \nAmerican citizen.\n  As a young man in Clover, SC, Red Pursley heeded his country's call \nwhen he was needed most, like so many others of what history would \nlater call the ``greatest generation.'' Entering into active service in \nlate 1942, Mr. Pursley and his comrades knew the dangerous nature of \ntheir duty, but attacked it with the confidence that their services \nwere necessary to the allied effort and conducted in the name of a \nrighteous cause.\n  A flight engineer and top turret gunner on a B-17 bomber crew based \nin England with the 8th Army Air Corps, Sergeant Pursley and the other \n9 members of his crew flew 14 successful missions over Northern Europe \nbefore being shot down while on a mission over Frankfurt on January 29, \n1944. Of the 10 crewmembers onboard, four died in the air and two \nescaped capture, but Sergeant Pursley and three others were taken \nprisoner by the Germans.\n  For the next 16 months, Sergeant Pursley, along with thousands of his \nfellow servicemembers, endured long marches, malnutrition, and despair \nin a number of Nazi prison camps, before he was liberated on May 6, \n1945, just four days shy of the end of the European Campaign. Though \nhis health suffered throughout the heroing ordeal, Sergeant Pursley's \nsense of pride in his service and faith in his cause never wavered.\n  For his service, Mr. Pursley earned numerous decorations including \nthe Silver Star and the Purple Heart. Upon his return from Europe and \nseparation from the Army Air Corps, Mr. Pursley moved to Georgia and, \nin 1957, started Redrock Carpet, a commercial carpet company that he \nhas run ever since with his son. Mr. Pursley excelled as a businessman \nand the products that he manufactured have been used to carpet such \nnotable locales as Air Force One and the private residence quarters in \nthe White House.\n  Red Pursley was a man we all should admire, as it was efforts of men \nlike him that helped forge our present greatness. He took an active \npart in the last half century as a solider and a citizen, as a \ncommunity leader and a businessman, and as a living link to our past. \nHis distinguished career, both in the service of his country and in the \nprivate sector, is a demonstration of the highest standards of \nintegrity, professionalism, and patriotism.\n  Red died on the morning of September 30, 2003, at the age of 82 after \nsuccumbing to a long bout with cancer. He leaves behind his loving wife \nand partner of nearly 61 years, Catherine Robinson Pursley, two \nchildren, three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Red also \nleaves behind an indelible mark on his Douglasville, GA community and \non the lives of all of those that he touched. He will be missed, but as \nlong as the legacy of the greatest generation lives on, so too will \nhe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12273-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12273-S12274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MID-MISSOURI ENERGY\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nupcoming groundbreaking on Saturday, October 4, 2003, for construction \nof Missouri's third farmer-owned ethanol plant, Mid-Missouri Energy \nEthanol Plant, which will be located in Malta Bend, MO.\n  Mid-Missouri Energy, the farmer-owned cooperative that is building \nthe\n\n[[Page S12274]]\n\nplant, began its grassroots efforts in early 2002 and has since added \nover 720 farmer-investors. This plant will process 15 million bushels \nof corn each year, producing 40 million gallons of ethanol annually, \ncreating more than 35 new jobs in Saline County. It will boost the \nvalue of locally grown corn and generate revenue for the farmers who \nhave invested in the cooperative. In addition, the site preparation and \nconstruction of the plant will provide a boost to the area's economy. \nThis plant is being built at a cost of $60 million, and it is expected \nto be in operation by Spring 2005.\n  The technology for ethanol-blended fuel will only get better as the \ndistribution network continues to grow. Ethanol is already marketed in \na number of places at the same price as gasoline, and its increased use \nwill reduce our dependence on foreign oil and help agricultural \nproducers. There are currently 73 ethanol plants in the country, with \nthe capacity to produce 2.9 billion gallons annually. The Malta Bend \nplant is one of 13 new plants under construction, which represent more \nthan 400 million gallons per year of new ethanol production. I am \nconfident the energy bill that emerges from the Congress will retain \nthe Renewable Fuels Standard, which will double the production and use \nof ethanol over the next ten years.\n  I am proud of the hard work and commitment that the farmers of Mid-\nMissouri Energy have shown in getting this plant built. Their efforts \nare crucial to helping our agricultural industry in Missouri and \nproviding jobs and growth for the Missouri economy. I am pleased to \ncongratulate them, as well as the farmer-investors of Missouri's two \noperative ethanol plants, Northeast Missouri Grain, LLC and General \nTriangle Energy Cooperative, for all that they have done to support \nMissouri job creation and economic growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12274-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12274-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12274-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of September 30, 2003, the Secretary \nof the Senate, on September 30, 2003, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3146.

A bill to establish commissions to review the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding injustices suffered by European Americans, \nEuropean Latin Americans, and Jewish refugees during World War II; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Wartime Treatment \nStudy Act. This bill would create two fact-finding commissions: one \ncommission to review the U.S. Government's treatment of German \nAmericans, Italian Americans, and European Latin Americans during World \nWar II and another commission to review the U.S. Government's treatment \nof Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution during World War II. This \nbill is long overdue.\n  I am very pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nGrassley, Kennedy, and Lieberman, have joined me as cosponsors of this \nimportant bill. I thank them for their support.\n  The Allied victory in the Second World War was an American triumph, a \ntriumph for freedom, justice, and human rights. The courage displayed \nby so many Americans, of all ethnic origins, should be a source of \ngreat pride for all Americans.\n  But, as so many brave Americans fought against enemies in Europe and \nthe Pacific, here, at home, the U.S. Government was curtailing the \nfreedom of some of its own people. While, it is, of course, the right \nof every nation to protect itself during wartime, the U.S. Government \nmust respect the basic freedoms for which so many Americans have given \ntheir lives to defend. War tests our principles and our values. And as \nour Nation's recent experience has shown, it is during times of war and \nconflict, when our fears are high and our principles are tested most, \nthat we must be even more vigilant to guard against violations of the \nConstitution.\n  Many Americans are aware of the fact that, during World War II, under \nthe authority of Executive Order 9066, our Government forced more than \n100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes into internment camps. \nJapanese Americans were forced to leave their homes, their livelihoods, \nand their communities and were held behind barbed wire and military \nguard by their own government. Through the work of the Commission on \nWartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians created by Congress in \n1980, this shameful event finally received the official acknowledgement \nand condemnation it deserved. Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, \npeople of Japanese ancestry who were subjected to relocation or \ninternment later received an apology and reparations on behalf of the \npeople of the United States.\n  While I commend our Government for finally recognizing and \napologizing for the mistreatment of Japanese Americans during World War \nII, I believe that it is time that the government also acknowledge the \nmistreatment experienced by many German Americans,\n\n[[Page S12279]]\n\nItalian Americans, and European Latin Americans, as well as Jewish \nrefugees.\n  The Wartime Treatment Study Act would create two independent, fact-\nfinding commissions to review this unfortunate history, so that \nAmericans can understand why it happened and work to ensure that it \nnever happens again. One commission will review the treatment by the \nU.S. Government of German Americans, Italian Americans, and other \nEuropean Americans, as well as European Latin Americans, during World \nWar II.\n  I believe that most Americans are unaware that, as was the case with \nJapanese Americans, approximately 11,000 ethnic Germans, 3,200 ethnic \nItalians, and scores of Bulgarians, Hungarians, Romanians or other \nEuropean Americans living in America were taken from their homes and \nplaced in internment camps during World War II. We must learn from our \nhistory and explore why we turned on our fellow Americans and failed to \nprotect basic freedoms.\n  A second commission created by this bill will review the treatment by \nthe U.S. Government of Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi \npersecution and genocide. We must review the facts and determine how \nour restrictive immigration policies failed to provide adequate safe \nharbor to Jewish refugees fleeing the persecution of Nazi Germany. The \nUnited States turned away thousands of refugees, delivering many \nrefugees to their deaths at the hands of the Nazi regime.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there has been a measure of justice for \nJapanese Americans who were denied their liberty and property. It is \nnow time for the U.S. Government to complete an accounting of this \nperiod in our Nation's history. It is time to create independent, fact-\nfinding commissions to conduct a full and through review of the \ntreatment of all European Americans, European Latin Americans, and \nJewish refugees during World War II.\n  Up to this point, there has been no justice for the thousands of \nGerman Americans, Italian Americans, and other European Americans who \nwere branded ``enemy aliens'' and then taken from their homes, \nsubjected to curfews, limited in their travel, deprived of their \npersonal property, and, in the worst cases, placed in internment camps.\n  There has been no justice for European Latin Americans who were \nshipped to the United States and sometimes repatriated or deported to \nhostile, war-torn European Axis powers, often in exchange for Americans \nbeing held in those countries.\n  Finally, there has been no justice for the thousands of Jews, like \nthose aboard the German vessel the St Louis, who sought refuge from \nhostile Nazi treatment but were callously turned away at America's \nshores.\n  Although the injustices to European Americans, European Latin \nAmericans, and Jewish refugees occurred fifty years ago, it is never \ntoo late for Americans to learn from these tragedies. We should never \nallow this part of our nation's history to repeat itself. And, while we \nshould be proud of our Nation's triumph in World War II, we should not \nlet that justifiable pride blind us to the treatment of some Americans \nby their own government.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Wartime Treatment \nstudy Act. It is time for a full accounting of this tragic chapter in \nour Nation's history.\n  I ask that the text of the Wartime Treatment Study Act be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1691\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States successfully \n     fought the spread of Nazism and fascism by Germany, Italy, \n     and Japan.\n       (2) Nazi Germany persecuted and engaged in genocide against \n     Jews and certain other groups. By the end of the war, \n     6,000,000 Jews had perished at the hands of Nazi Germany. \n     United States Government policies, however, restricted entry \n     to the United States to Jewish and other refugees who sought \n     safety from Nazi persecution.\n       (3) While we were at war, the United States treated the \n     Japanese American, German American, and Italian American \n     communities as suspect.\n       (4) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to assess fully and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (5) During World War II, the United States Government \n     branded as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born \n     and 300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and \n     their families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification, limited their travel, and seized their \n     personal property. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (6) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations, many to be exchanged for Americans held in those \n     nations.\n       (7) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American countries, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were captured, shipped to \n     the United States and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated or deported to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations during World War II, most to be exchanged for \n     Americans and Latin Americans held in those nations.\n       (8) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (9) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian Americans and German American \n     communities, individuals and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (10) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution and sought safety in the United States. During \n     the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, immigration \n     regulations, visa requirements, and the time required to \n     process visa applications affected the number of Jewish \n     refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, who \n     could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (11) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend section 35 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to allow individuals receiving unemployment compensation to be \neligible for a refundable, advanceable credit for health insurance \ncosts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along \nwith Senator Baucus, an extension of a bipartisan policy to help reduce \nthe number of people living without health insurance today.\n  In simplist terms, our bill extends the 65 percent credit offered to \npeople eligible for trade adjustment assistance, and to certain PBGC \nbeneficiaries, to those workers eligible for unemployment insurance.\n  Is it perfect policy? No. Does it ``solve'' the problem of the \nuninsured? it does not.\n  But it's an important step in the right direction. I do not subscribe \nto the view that ``incrementalism'' when it comes to covering the \nuninsured, is dead.\n  With census figures showing the number of Americans living without \nhealth insurance increasing, even small steps are steps in the right \ndirection.\n  Incrementalism has made a difference. For example, the few million \npeople we covered with this tax credit in last year's trade promotion \nauthority bill made a difference. The S-CHIP program made a difference. \nI believe Medical Savings Accounts and the small group market reforms \nwe made in HIPAA all have made a difference in controlling what would \notherwise be a much larger number of people without health insurance.\n  This year, Congress, in a bipartisan way, put $50 billion into a \nreserve fund to address the rising number of uninsured. The year is \nmore than almost over, and nothing has been done, or even discussed.\n  I will not let a bipartisan consensus to spend $50 billion on \nimproving access to health insurance lay there on the table. Iowans \nexpect us to do get things done.\n  And to get anything, even something small, done on a problem this \nbig, it's got to be bipartisan. That's why I am glad to be building on \nmy work with Senator Baucus and making this important, novel program \navailable to more Americans.\n  I am looking forward to exploring still more options in the Finance \nCommittee on reducing the uninsured in the weeks and months ahead.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health Care \nTax Credit Expansion Act of 2003.\n  According to the most recent census figures, more than 41 million \nAmericans lack health insurance coverage. More than the population of \n23 States, plus the District of Columbia. As premiums sky rocket and \nthe unemployment rate remains high--despite signs of economic \nrecovery--I worry that this number may grow even higher.\n  For America's uninsured, the consequences of going without health \ncoverage can be devastating.\n  Put plainly, uninsured Americans are less healthy than those with \nhealth insurance. They delay seeking medical care or go without \ntreatment altogether that could prevent and detect crippling illnesses. \nIllnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The uninsured are \nfar less likely to receive health services if they are injured or \nbecome ill. They don't fill prescriptions that their doctors recommend.\n  These factors take an enormous personal toll on the lives of the \nuninsured. They are sicker and less productive. Their children are less \nlikely to survive past infancy. And they must struggle with the \nknowledge that a serious injury or illness in their family might push \nthem to the brink of financial ruin.\n  And there is also the impact on the rest of the U.S. economy that \nmust be taken into account. Because when the uninsured become so sick \nthat they must finally seek emergency treatment, there is often no one \nto pay for it. No insurance company. No government program.\n  So who absorbs the cost of uncompensated medical care? We all do. In \nthe form of higher health care costs. Higher and higher premiums at a \ntime when the cost of health care is already rising out of control.\n\n[[Page S12282]]\n\n  The situation is becoming critical. And I believe the time for \ntalking has ended. It is time for us to examine solutions instead of \ntalking about the problem.\n  That is why I have joined with my colleague, chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, to introduce this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Our bill would provide health care assistance to the unemployed--one \nspecific category of those without health insurance. And one where we \nbelieve there is agreement to move forward.\n  More specifically, this bill would expand the 65 percent refundable, \nadvanceable tax credit that is currently provided under the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance program to workers receiving unemployment \nbenefits.\n  By building on the structure that Congress put in place last year \nunder the Trade Act, we make it more likely that unemployed workers can \nreceive benefits in a timely manner. Without significant implementation \nand start-up time.\n  And by building on the historic agreement that we reached last year, \nwe are more likely to have support for the structure and approach.\n  Let me be clear. This bill is not a major overhaul of the U.S. health \ncare system that several Democratic Presidential candidates have \noutlined. It was not intended and does not seek to cover everyone in \nthis country without health insurance.\n  Rather the proposal would use the money set aside in this year's \nbudget for the uninsured--$50 billion--on a targeted policy that I \nbelieve both sides can agree on. It is a practical, principled, \nincremental solution.\n\n\n                          Why the unemployed?\n\n  According to the Labor Department, since February 2001, 2.6 million \njobs have been lost. And with those jobs, an awful lot of health \ninsurance has been lost, too.\n  Despite assertions by economists that the recession has ended and the \neconomy is experiencing signs of improvement, the unemployment rate has \nremained stubbornly high--6.4 percent in June. In fact, we are hearing \nmore and more talk of the same ``jobless recovery'' that we heard about \nfollowing the recession in the early 1990s.\n  It is true that employment does not immediately improve when an \neconomy emerges from recession. We read repeatedly that even if growth \nsurges and business investment begins to take off tomorrow, the ranks \nof the unemployed may not thin for months.\n  Unfortunately, for many, many families, this means more weeks, if not \nmonths, of endless job searches. And a longer period of time without \nhealth coverage.\n  An estimated 46 percent of unemployed adults lack health insurance, \nor about 4 million unemployed workers. Less than one in three \nunemployed adults receives health coverage through their spouse or \nother family member.\n  And while 65 percent may qualify for COBRA continuation coverage, \nonly 7 percent can afford to enroll. That is not surprising. Premiums \nfor this coverage average almost $700 a month for family coverage and \n$250 for individual coverage. A very high price, given the average \n$1,100 monthly UI check.\n  Last year, when we debated the economic recovery package, both \nRepublicans and Democrats proposed to expand health coverage for \nunemployed workers. There was almost universal agreement that this \npopulation deserved help and attention. So I think it's a good place \nfor us to start from this year.\n\n\n                           Why a tax credit?\n\n  There's been a lot of debate about the best way to expand health \ninsurance coverage to the uninsured. Most Democrats favor expanding \npublic programs like Medicaid and CHIP, and harnessing the power of the \ngroup insurance market to provide affordable coverage options.\n  Most Republicans, however, favor a more market-based approach that \ngives the uninsured tax breaks and allows them to use the individual \ninsurance market.\n  But, after years of logjams and disagreements, we were able to come \ntogether last year when we created the TAA tax credit. The TAA tax \ncredit merges a market-based tax credit with the affordability of the \ngroup insurance market. This proposal simply builds on that progress. \nWith the structures now in place to implement the TAA credit, a new tax \ncredit for the unemployed can easily be incorporated into the new \nsystem.\n\n\n                                Caveats\n\n  I realize that the TAA tax credit is not a perfect model. And we may \nneed to make some adjustments as full implementation kicks in this \nsummer. For example, we need to ensure that the groups we intended to \ncover actually have access to coverage.\n  In particular, all workers who had health insurance coverage for 3 \nmonths before they lost their jobs should be assured of coverage they \nqualify for under TAA. I support making the technical change that would \nprovide that assurance.\n  I am also willing to consider other improvements, like additional \nhelp for low income workers.\n  But I do not think these adjustments should deter us from moving \nforward with an expansion of the tax credit. Millions of unemployed \nworkers and their families need our help. And they need it now.\n  All told, expanding the TAA tax credit to the unemployed would \nprovide health insurance coverage for 1.4 million Americans a month who \nare currently unemployed and uninsured. It's not a panacea. But it's a \nstart.\n  I hope my colleagues will join this fight by helping us pass this \nlegislation, and taking a solid step toward providing quality, \naffordable health insurance to all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK:\n  S. 1694. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide veterans who participated \nin certain Department of Defense chemical and biological warfare \ntesting to be provided health care for illness without requirement for \nproof of service-connection; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Health \nCare for Veterans of Project 112/Project SHAD Act of 2003. This bill \nwill authorize health care assistance for veterans who participated in \nspecific Department of Defense chemical and biological warfare testing \nwithout any requirements related to proof of service-connection for \ntheir illness.\n  Project 112 consisted of a series of cold war chemical, nuclear, and \nbiological tests conducted both at sea and over land from 1962 to 1973. \nThis project was one of 150 military initiatives designed to identify \nU.S. military personnel and warship vulnerabilities to chemical, \nnuclear, and biological attacks. Some of the tests that were part of \nProject 112/Operation Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD) involved the \nuse of dangerous agents such as sarin, VX, tularemia, and anthrax. The \nDefense Department has recognized that it does not have adequate \ndocumentation to prove that test participants were informed of the \npotential risks, or that personnel received adequate protective gear \nduring testing.\n  After an extensive search for records to identify all tests conducted \nand link the dates of specific tests to the personnel on-board at the \ntime, the DOD produced a comprehensive list of all tests conducted and \neach veteran involved in this project. In response to a VA request, DOD \nreviewed and declassified information concerning the exact agents used \nand other details of the Project 112 tests. This information was \nsubsequently turned over to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the \nVA began the process of contacting the veterans identified as \nparticipants.\n  A total of 5,842 persons were identified as having been present in \none or more of the tests. All veterans who believe they were involved \nin tests and have medical concerns have been encouraged to contact VA \nto receive medical evaluations. Although Project 112 veterans suffer \nfrom a broad range of ailments from cancer to hypertension, a causal \nlink between the tests and their current ailments has not been \nestablished. Due to the amount of time that has passed and the \nrelatively small number of people involved in any specific test, it is \nhighly unlikely that we will ever be able to fully determine the health \neffects from the tests.\n  It would be unconscionable to require Project 112 veterans to prove a \nconnection between their involvement in these tests and their current \nhealth problems. If we cannot disprove a service connection, then we \nshould assume\n\n[[Page S12283]]\n\nresponsibility for their health care. This Health Care for Veterans of \nProject 112/Project SHAD Act of 2003 would provide priority access to \nVA hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for veterans \nidentified as participants in these tests, and not require medical \nevidence that any illnesses are attributable to such testing. This is \nan important step in bringing some finality to this issue and living up \nto our commitment to this group of veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE TO VETERANS WHO PARTICIPATED \n                   IN CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CHEMICAL AND \n                   BIOLOGICAL WARFARE TESTING.\n\n       Section 1710(e) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by adding at the end the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(E) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a veteran who \n     participated in a test conducted by the Department of Defense \n     Deseret Test Center as part of a program for chemical and \n     biological warfare testing from 1962 through 1973 (including \n     the program designated as `Project Shipboard Hazard and \n     Defense (SHAD)' and related land-based tests) is eligible for \n     hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care under \n     subsection (a)(2)(F) for any illness, notwithstanding that \n     there is insufficient medical evidence to conclude that such \n     illness is attributable to such testing.'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2)(B), by striking ``paragraph (1)(C) or \n     (1)(D)'' and inserting ``subparagraph (C), (D), or (E) of \n     paragraph (1)''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (3)--\n       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (B);\n       (B) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (C) \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) in the case of care for a veteran described in \n     paragraph (1)(E), after December 31, 2005.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Sununu, and \n        Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1695. A bill to provide greater oversight over the USA PATRIOT \nAct; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senators Craig, \nSununu, Durbin, and Reid, my distinguished colleagues from Idaho, New \nHampshire, Illinois, and Nevada, the Patriot Oversight Restoration Act \nof 2003, a short bill whose singular but important purpose is to \nprovide Congress the opportunity to take a hard look at the USA PATRIOT \nAct, which we passed in the anxious weeks following the devastating \nattacks of September 11, 2001. This bipartisan bill is moderate in \nscope; it would simply expand the sunset provision already enacted in \nthe PATRIOT Act, to cover a number of additional provisions. The \nensuing debate, however, should be considerable. My hope is that, \nbefore the sunset expires in December 2005, Congress will methodically \nrevisit PATRIOT, with an eye toward achieving a suitable balance \nbetween the need to address the threat of terrorism and the need to \nprotect our constitutional freedoms--and with the lessons of the past \nfew years to guide us.\n  We recently marked the second anniversary of the September 11 \nattacks. As we reflect on that terrible day, and honor those who were \nlost, I strongly believe we should take stock of where we stand in our \nfight against terrorism. In the aftermath of the attacks, Congress and \nthe administration did forge a constructive partnership to write the \nUSA PATRIOT Act, which was meant to help our law enforcement and \nintelligence communities prevent future attacks from occurring. The \nPATRIOT Act represented our best efforts, under difficult \ncircumstances, to balance the rights and liberties of the American \npeople with the very urgent need to confront a threat to our Nation.\n  Even in balancing this tension, we granted the executive branch an \nunprecedented, vast new array of powers. We did so because we believed \nthe administration's claim that it needed these powers to protect us, \nand because we trusted the administration's promise that it would use \nthese powers appropriately. I noted at the time that PATRIOT was not \nthe bill that I, or any of the sponsors, would have written if \ncompromise were unnecessary. But I believed in the bill's purpose, and \nI gave it my vote and support. I worked hard to add checks and balances \nto many of its provisions, and did so.\n  Unfortunately, like many Members who supported the act--and like many \nAmericans nationwide--I have come to feel disappointed. Since we passed \nthe PATRIOT Act in October 2001, it has grown increasingly apparent \nthat the trust and cooperation Congress provided to the executive \nbranch has proved to be a one-way street. In the quarter-century that I \nhave served in the Senate, no administration has been more secretive, \nmore resistant to congressional oversight, and more disposed to acting \nunilaterally, without the approval of the American people or their \ndemocratically elected representatives. Despite the administration's \nunprecedented public relations campaign to promote the PATRIOT Act--\nincluding a 16-State, 18-city tour by the Attorney General himself--the \nadministration has yet to show that it is using its PATRIOT powers \nwisely. Instead, it has been secretly drafting a sequel to PATRIOT that \nwould grant it even more far-reaching powers.\n  I would never oppose an open discussion of any legislative tool that \nwould help in the fight against terrorism. But for such a debate to be \nfruitful, we need to know more about the tools that are already \navailable, including those created by the PATRIOT Act. Which are \nworking, and how well? Which are not working, and why? Which, if any, \nstruck the wrong balance, threatening the civil liberties of our \ncitizens while doing little or nothing to keep our Nation secure?\n  Immediately after the PATRIOT Act passed, the administration draped a \ncloak of secrecy around its use. When lawmakers and citizens have \nattempted to start a dialogue on PATRIOT-related issues, the response \nhas been to ignore, insult or derisively dismiss them.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft has repeatedly declined to appear before \nthe Judiciary Committee to answer questions, and his Department is \npainfully slow to respond to written requests for information. To quote \nmy friend Senator Grassley, ``getting information from the Justice \nDepartment under Ashcroft is like pulling teeth.'' By ignoring \noversight requests until answers are moot or outdated, and responding \nin only vague and conclusory fashion, if at all, the Justice Department \nfrustrates our constitutional system of checks and balances, and sows \nthe sort of public distrust that now accompanies the PATRIOT Act.\n  Just recently, in July, the Department dumped on committee members \nliterally hundreds of pages of answers to questions that had been \nsubmitted to Attorney General Ashcroft and other senior Department \nofficials following their testimony before the committee more than a \nyear earlier. To give just one example of what a travesty it is when \noversight questions remain unanswered for a year or more, the \nDepartment's responses dated July 17, 2003, devoted fully 15 pages to \nanswering questions about Operation TIPS--an ill-conceived program that \nCongress had already terminated more than 8 months earlier.\n  Is the Department incapable of responding to congressional inquiries \nin a timely fashion? Is it deliberately stonewalling? Or does it simply \nbelieve that oversight is a game that it need not play?\n  Even more troubling, high-level administration officials have rashly \nsuggested that anyone who dares to voice their concerns as unpatriotic, \nanti-American and pro-terrorist. In one of his rare appearances before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Ashcroft charged that \n``fear mongers''--those who were raising concern about the loss of \ncivil liberties--were only aiding the terrorists. More recently, a \nJustice Department official dismissed the many local government \nresolutions condemning the PATRIOT Act by saying ``half are either in \ncities in Vermont, very small population, or in college towns in \nCalifornia. It's in a lot of the usual enclaves where you might see \nnuclear free zones, or they\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\nprobably passed resolutions against the war in Iraq.''\n  It is unfortunate that the Justice Department felt it appropriate to \nridicule these grass-roots efforts to participate in an important \nnational dialogue. The opportunity to engage in public discourse is one \nof the hallmark benefits of being an American, and I am proud that \nVermont towns are among those dedicated to thinking about and acting on \nthese important issues. But more importantly, the concerns expressed in \nmy home State are being echoed by Americans nationwide. To date, anti-\nPATRIOT resolutions have been passed by 178 communities in 32 States \nincluding Idaho, New Hampshire, and Illinois. These communities \nrepresent millions upon millions of Americans, not just a few free-\nspirited Vermonters, as the Justice Department has insinuated.\n  Concerns about the administration's antiterror tactics are also \nshared by Members on both sides of aisle, many of whom supported the \nPATRIOT Act as well as the war in Iraq, but who now know that the \nadministration has been less than forthright about what it has been \ndoing in the name of the American people. In July, the House voted to \nnullify section 213 of the PATRIOT Act, which allows law enforcement to \nask a court to delay notice of a search warrant where it could have \ncertain adverse results. And several bills have been introduced in both \nHouses to roll back another PATRIOT Act provision, section 215, which \ngives federal agents new power to obtain records from libraries and \nbookstores. Remarkably, in response, the Justice Department then \ndeclassified information summarily reflecting that it has never used \nthe Section 215 powers--despite expressing urgent ``need'' during pre-\nPATRIOT Act debate. And almost simultaneous to this announcement, the \nPresident urged support for an alternative record gathering power when \nSection 215 is still on the books. One has to question the \ninconsistencies in these two positions and whether Congress should \nblindly confer data gathering powers on an administration that does not \nprovide a hint of factual support for such requests. There is overall a \ngrowing sense in the nation that Congress moved too fast in enacting \nthe PATRIOT Act, and that the Justice Department moved too slowly in \nexplaining its use of this sweeping legislation.\n  When we passed the PATRIOT Act in October 2001, I noted that Congress \nneeded to exercise careful oversight of how the Justice Department, the \nFBI and other executive branch agencies used the newly expanded powers \nthat the act provided. The need for oversight and accountability is the \nreason that former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I insisted on a \nsunset provision for several key provisions in PATRIOT--provisions that \nblurred the lines between criminal investigation and intelligence \ngathering. We succeeded, but only in part; several PATRIOT provisions \nthat should have been subject to the sunset--including a few that were \nsunset or even cut in the version of the bill reported by the House \nJudiciary Committee--were omitted from the sunset. As enacted, the \nsunset applies only to certain enhanced surveillance authorities in \ntitle II of the act.\n  The PATRIOT Oversight Restoration Act would extend PATRIOT's sunset \nprovision to other enhanced surveillance provisions in title II of the \nact. These include subsections (a) and (c) of section 203, which \nauthorize the disclosure of grand jury information to foreign \nenforcement, intelligence and immigration officials; sections 210 and \n211, which broaden the types of information that law enforcement may \nobtain, upon request, from electronic communication service providers \nand cable service operators; section 213, which authorizes so-called \n``sneak and peak''--delayed notification--search warrants; sections 216 \nand 222, which significantly expand when, where, and how law \nenforcement can obtain a pen register or trap and trace order; and \nsection 219, which authorizes judges to sign search warrants for \nproperties located outside their districts.\n  In addition to these title II provisions, the PATRIOT Oversight \nRestoration Act would also extend the sunset to a handful of provisions \nin titles IV, V, VIII and X of the PATRIOT Act. These provisions \ninclude sections 411 and 1006, which expand the Government's authority \nto declare certain persons inadmissible to the United States; section \n412, which grants the Attorney General authority to ``certify'' that an \nalien is engaged in activity that endangers the national security, and \nto take such an alien into custody; section 505, which gives law \nenforcement greater authority to access telephone, bank, and credit \nrecords through the issuance of so-called ``National Security \nLetters,'' even if no criminal investigation is pending and without \ncourt review; sections 507 and 508, which remove certain privacy \nprotections for educational records and surveys--called ``obstacles'' \nto investigating terrorism in the PATRIOT Act; section 802, which \ndefines ``domestic terrorism'' in a way that could be read to include \npolitical protesters engaged in civil disobedience; section 806, which \nuses the aforementioned definition of ``domestic terrorism'' to expand \nthe government's civil forfeiture authority; and section 1003, which \nreferences another section of PATRIOT that is already covered by the \nsunset.\n  With the PATRIOT Act, Congress provided government investigators with \na virtual smorgasbord of new powers from which to choose. Is the \nGovernment gorging itself on the secretive powers allowed for ``foreign \nintelligence'' gathering, with their less onerous procedural \nrequirements, rather than relying on bedrock criminal investigatory \ntechniques that are subject to more rigorous review by the Federal \ncourts? Have we provided too many choices and too much power to a \nlimited few? These are questions that require answers before the more \nfar-reaching provisions of PATRIOT are etched into stone.\n  The events of September 11, 2001, resound in our hearts and in our \nmemories. We owe it to the American people to be circumspect in the \npowers and authorities we grant, even in the name of national security. \nOur country was attacked on September 11 because of the democratic \nprinciples that this country stands for and that we love. It would be a \ncruel twist of irony to abandon those principles in the guise of a law \nnamed ``PATRIOT'' that might prove to be anything but a defender or \nprotector of those cherished rights and freedoms.\n  The PATRIOT Oversight Restoration Act offers a cautious and sensible \nsolution to evolving fears about the PATRIOT Act. It will allow \nCongress to re-examine some of the important legal issues that abruptly \nconfronted us in the weeks following September 11, and to re-assess our \nefforts with the benefit of hindsight and the luxury of time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             The PATRIOT Oversight Restoration Act of 2003\n\n       Extends the current sunset provision in section 224 of the \n     USA PATRIOT Act (Pub. L. 107-56) to the following additional \n     sections of that law.:\n       203(a) and (c), which authorize the disclosure of grand \n     jury information to foreign enforcement, intelligence and \n     immigration officials;\n       210 and 211, which broaden the types of information that \n     law enforcement may obtain, upon request, from electronic \n     communication service providers and cable service operators;\n       213, which authorizes so-called ``sneak and peak'' (delayed \n     notification) search warrants;\n       216 and 222, which expand when, where, and how law \n     enforcement can obtain a pen register or trap and trace \n     order;\n       219, which authorizes judges to sign search warrants for \n     properties located outside their districts;\n       358, which establishes greater reporting requirements by \n     financial institutions for bank records and removes privacy \n     protections under the law for the same records;\n       411 and 1006, which expand the government's authority to \n     declare certain persons inadmissible to the United States;\n       412, which grants the Attorney General authority to \n     ``certify'' that an alien is engaged in activity that \n     endangers the national security, and to take such an alien \n     into custody;\n       505, which gives law enforcement greater authority to \n     access telephone, bank, and credit records through the \n     issuance of so-called ``National Security Letters'';\n       507 and 508, which remove certain privacy protections for \n     educational records and surveys;\n       802, which defines ``domestic terrorism'' in a way that \n     could be read to include political protesters engaged in \n     civil disobedience.\n       806, which uses the aforementioned definition of ``domestic \n     terrorism'' to expand the government's civil forfeiture \n     authority; and\n\n[[Page S12285]]\n\n       1003, which references another section of PATRIOT (section \n     217, ``Interception of computer trespasser communications'') \n     that is already covered by the sunset.\n       Clarifies that after these provisions sunset on December \n     31, 2005, the law shall revert to what it was before the USA \n     PATRIOT Act was enacted.\n\n                                S. 1695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXTENSION AND CLARIFICATION OF PATRIOT SUNSET \n                   PROVISION.\n\n       The USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107-56) is amended by--\n       (1) striking section 224;\n       (2) adding at the end of title X the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1017.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, and our other colleagues in \nintroducing the PATRIOT Oversight Restoration Act of 2003.\n  I am one of those who voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act to \nrespond to the unprecedented, tragic attacks of September 11, 2001. \nHowever, even at the time of that vote, I raised my reservations about \nthe new authorities being granted under the act, and pledged that there \nwould be aggressive oversight by the legislative branch to make sure \nPATRIOTS implementation did not compromise civil liberties.\n  Since that time, this lengthy and complex law has been subjected to \nconsiderable dissection and discussion both inside and outside of \nCongress, and concerns have been raised about many of its provisions. \nThe low boil of discontent around the Nation exploded in the other \nChamber some weeks ago with a strong vote to prohibit the use of \nappropriated funds for requesting delayed notice of a search warrant \nunder the act.\n  To its credit, the Bush administration has lately worked to address \ncriticism of the law and demonstrate there have been no abuses by \nFederal law enforcement. I greatly appreciate those efforts and believe \nit is vitally important to continue that dialog with the Congress and \nthe American people.\n  At the same time, in light of the serious concerns that have been \nraised, I think it is appropriate for us to add some triggers to the \nlaw that will force Congress to review and affirmatively renew these \nauthorities. That is what the PATRIOT Oversight Restoration Act would \naccomplish, by sunsetting additional provisions that are not currently \nset to expire. I do not think this will create a burden for law \nenforcement; on the contrary, if these authorities are indeed critical \nto the protection of our Nation, it should not be difficult to convince \nCongress to renew them. Furthermore, the knowledge that such a case \nmust be made at a time certain in the future will serve as an \nadditional immediate check against potential abuses.\n  The security of our Nation is the first responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment. Our bill will ensure that responsibility is carried out \nthoughtfully and in our country's great tradition of balance and \nrestraint in the enforcement of our laws. I urge all our colleagues to \njoin us in supporting the PATRIOT Oversight Restoration Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Inouye)\n  S. 1696. A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act to provide further self-governance by Indian tribes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye in introducing the Department of Health and Human \nServices Tribal Self Governance Amendments of 2003, a bill that will \nusher in the next phase in Indian Self Governance in health and health-\nrelated programs.\n  Up to 1970 the U.S. Government was the sole provider of all or nearly \nall services to Indian tribes and their members.\n  For many it is hard to recall that little more than 30 years ago the \nFederal bureaucracy and its employees provided all police, fire, \nresource husbandry, education, and health care services in Indian \ncommunities.\n  The effects on tribal governments were negative and, by crowding out \nthe tribes, undermined tribal efforts at self-government.\n  The Federal monopoly in services was ended in 1970 when President \nNixon issued his now-famous Special Message to Congress on Indian \nAffairs that called for a greater tribal role in designing and \nimplementing Federal services and programs and in re-building tribal \ngovernments.\n  Nixon's Message led to the enactment of the Indian Self Determination \nand Education Assistance Act of 1975, Pub. L. 93-638.\n  Since then Congress has systematically devolved to Indian tribes the \nauthority and responsibility to manage Federal programs and assume \ncontrol over their own affairs.\n  Tribal Self Governance aims to foster strong tribal governments and \nhealthy reservation economies as mechanisms to further tribal self-\ngovernment. Self Governance has resulted in a reduction in the Federal \nbureaucracy and an improvement in the quality of services delivered to \ntribal members.\n  Instead of Federal micro-management, the Indian tribes can tailor the \nprograms to unique local conditions and better serve their members.\n  For good reason, Tribal Self Governance has been embraced and \nexpanded by Congress and the executive repeatedly with amendments \nenacted in 1984, 1988, 1994, and 2000.\n  Building on the solid successes of the early years, the amendments \nmade permanent Self Governance in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \nlaunched additional demonstrations in the Indian Health Service. In \n2000, I introduced a bill that was enacted to make Self Governance in \nHealth Care permanent at the IHS.\n  The bill I am introducing today will create a demonstration project \nfor non-Indian Health Service programs in the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the elderly housing plus health support \ndemonstration program to modernize public housing for elderly and \ndisabled persons; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nhelp address a growing problem in America--our ability to provide safe \nand affordable housing that meets the needs of older Americans. \nCurrently there are 35 million Americans over 65 years old. That number \nwill double within the next 30 years. By 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. \npopulation will be over 65 years old.\n  Nearly one third of all public housing units are occupied by senior \ncitizens. This figure has been steadily growing in recent years and \nwill undoubtedly continue to grow in the future. It is critically \nimportant that we remain committed to providing low-income seniors with \nsafe and affordable housing.\n  The bill I am introducing will promote the development of assisted \nliving programs to provide a wide range of services, including medical \nassistance, housekeeping services, hygiene and grooming, and meals \npreparation. Providing these services will in turn give older Americans \ngreater opportunities to decide for themselves where they live and how \nthey exercise their independence.\n  The Elderly Housing Plus Supportive Health Support Demonstration Act, \nwill provide Federal grants to allow public housing authorities around \nthe country to develop new strategies for providing better housing for \nsenior citizens. The bill will give public housing authorities the \ntools they need to improve our public housing stock so our seniors will \nnot be prematurely forced out of their homes. The bill authorizes \ncompetitive grants through the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to upgrade and reconfigure elderly buildings, and buildings \nwith elderly and non-elderly disabled residents. The bill will also \nprovide funding for service coordinators and/or congregate services \nprograms.\n  Unfortunately, as we examine the public housing stock across the \ncountry from the perspective of older Americans, we find a bleak \nsituation. Over 66 percent of existing public housing units are more \nthan 30 years old and most are not designed to meet the needs of older \nAmericans. For example, too few of our housing units are equipped to \nfacilitate mobility for those in wheelchairs. Even such simple things \nas having a kitchen counter top that can be reached from a wheelchair \nmay make the difference between a senior being able to stay in his or \nher home or having to leave, often to be sent to an institution where \nseniors have less independence and control over their lives.\n  Because most public housing seniors are Medicaid-eligible, the bill \nwill also open a path to reducing Medicaid costs, 42 percent of which \ngoes to housing elders in costly nursing homes. The cost to the \nMedicaid program of a beneficiary living in public housing converted to \nassisted living has been shown to be as much as one-third that paid to \na nursing home on a long-term per capita basis.\n\n[[Page S12288]]\n\n  The scarceness of affordable assisted living units has other social \ncosts that we must consider as we set national housing policies for the \nfuture. Often, the cost of taking care of an aging family member can be \ndevastating to American families. Too often, working men and women are \ntorn between the need to maintain their jobs and the desire to provide \nthe best possible care to their aging family members.\n  Advances in medicine are allowing us to live longer, healthier lives. \nLongevity is a great blessing, but it also poses significant challenges \nfor individuals, families, and society as whole. One of the greatest \nchallenges we will face in the decades ahead is the challenge of \ndeveloping new kinds of housing that respond to the needs of our \ngrowing elderly population.\n  It is my hope that this bill will generate earnest discussion on \nthese important matters and will ultimately lead to action to ensure \nthat every American senior can live in security and dignity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Elderly Housing Plus \nHealth Support Demonstration Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Elderly Housing Plus Health \n     Support Demonstration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are at least 34,100,000 Americans who are 65 \n     years of age and older, and persons who are 85 years of age \n     or older comprise almost one-quarter of that population;\n       (2) the Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce \n     estimates that, by 2030, the elderly population will double \n     to 70,000,000 persons;\n       (3) according to the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development report ``Housing Our Elders--A Report Card on the \n     Housing Conditions and Needs of Older Americans'', the \n     largest and fastest growing segments of the older population \n     include many people who have historically been vulnerable \n     economically and in the housing market--women, minorities, \n     and people over the age of 85;\n       (4) many elderly persons are at significant risk with \n     respect to the availability, stability, and accessibility of \n     affordable housing;\n       (5) one-third of public housing residents are approximately \n     62 years of age or older, making public housing the largest \n     Federal housing program for senior citizens;\n       (6) the elderly population residing in public housing is \n     older, poorer, frailer, and more racially diverse than the \n     elderly population residing in other assisted housing;\n       (7) two-thirds of the public housing developments for the \n     elderly, including those that also serve the disabled, were \n     constructed before 1970 and are in dire need of major \n     rehabilitation and configuration, such as rehabilitation to \n     provide new roofs, energy-efficient heating, cooling, utility \n     systems, accessible units, and up-to-date safety features;\n       (8) many of the dwelling units in public housing \n     developments for elderly and disabled persons are undersized, \n     are inaccessible to residents with physical limitations, do \n     not comply with the requirements under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990, or lack railings, grab bars, \n     emergency call buttons, and wheelchair accessible ramps;\n       (9) a study conducted for the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development found that the cost of the basic \n     modernization needs for public housing for elderly and \n     disabled persons exceeds $5,700,000,000;\n       (10) a growing number of elderly and disabled persons face \n     unnecessary institutionalization because of the absence of \n     appropriate supportive services and assisted living \n     facilities in their residences;\n       (11) for many elderly and disabled persons, independent \n     living in a non-institutionalization setting is a preferable \n     housing alternative to costly institutionalization, and would \n     allow public monies to be more effectively used to provide \n     necessary services for such persons;\n       (12) congregate housing and supportive services coordinated \n     by service coordinators is a proven and cost-effective means \n     of enabling elderly and disabled persons to remain in place \n     with dignity and independence;\n       (13) the effective provision of congregate services and \n     assisted living in public housing developments requires the \n     redesign of units and buildings to accommodate independent \n     living;\n       (14) most of the elderly who reside in public housing are \n     eligible for Medicaid to pay for the cost of their being \n     institutionalized in nursing homes;\n       (15) nursing home costs now exceed 42 percent of the entire \n     Medicaid program; and\n       (16) by providing a nursing home resident the choice of \n     assisted living in public housing instead, the Federal \n     Government can save as much as three-quarters of the long \n     term per capita Medicaid costs and at the same time allow a \n     frail senior to age in place.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a demonstration program to make \n     competitive grants to provide state-of-the-art, health-\n     supportive housing with assisted living opportunities for \n     elderly and disabled persons;\n       (2) to provide funding to enhance, make safe and \n     accessible, and extend the useful life of public housing \n     developments for the elderly and disabled and to increase \n     their accessibility to supportive services;\n       (3) to provide elderly and disabled public housing \n     residents a readily available choice in living arrangements \n     by utilizing the services of service coordinators and \n     providing a continuum of care that allows such residents to \n     age in place;\n       (4) to incorporate congregate housing service programs more \n     fully into public housing operations; and\n       (5) to accomplish such purposes and provide such funding \n     under existing provisions of law that currently authorize all \n     activities to be conducted under the program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote \nthe provision of retirement investment advice to workers managing their \nretirement income assets; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, with the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, \nCongress acted swiftly and surely to restore investor confidence in our \ncapital markets. Something needed to be done to assure people that it \nwas OK for them to start investing in and relying on the market again. \nPeople wanted to feel certain that the rules had been fixed and the \nmarket was fair for all.\n  Although I am proud we were able to do that, we all knew that there \nwas still more that needed to be done to help the millions of American \nworkers whose retirement savings are fueled by the financial markets.\n  There's a gap that still threatens the retirement security of the 42 \nmillion Americans who participate in defined contribution plans, like \n401(k) plans. In defined contribution plans, the employee--not the \nemployer--decides how much and how to invest retirement assets. As \nanyone who has been investing their hard earned dollars through their \nemployer provided plans knows, there are quite a few choices out there. \nThey each have their own risks and rewards, but they have one thing in \ncommon--they require an employee who is investing his or her pay to \nhave a good sense of the market. Employees find themselves having to \nnavigate bull and bear markets, weather changes in personal and \nprofessional circumstances, and use long-term planning to set a course \nthat leads to retirement security.\n  401(k) plans provide great opportunity as well as risk. The \ndifference between the employee who can maximize opportunity and \nminimize risk and the employee who cannot is sound investment advice. \nUnfortunately, only 16 percent of plan participants have an investment \nadvisory service available to them through their retirement plans. This \nsurvey by the Spectrum Group confirms the existence of an advice gap \nthat must be addressed. The legislation I am introducing today is \nintended to close the advice gap and help workers choose wisely and \nchart their course to retirement security.\n  Both workers and employers are acutely aware of the advice gap. \nAccording to the 2002 Transamerica Small Business Retirement Survey, 76 \npercent of employees felt they don't know as much about retirement \ninvesting as they should--up from 65 percent in 2001. This view is held \neven more strongly by employers, with 91 percent believing their \nworkers don't know enough about retirement investing.\n  There is another gap that exists with respect to retirement \ninvestment advice. Wealthier individuals or high-level executives are \nmore likely to have access to quality investment advice than rank-and-\nfile workers. The Retirement Security Advice Act of 2003 will bring \naccess to quality investment advice, and thereby retirement security, \nto rank-and-file workers who need it most, particularly those employed \nat small businesses.\n\n  Access to investment advice has not kept pace with either the \nincreasing number of workers participating in 401(k) plans or the \nincreasing complexity of investment options. What accounts for the gulf \nbetween the need for and the supply of investment advice?\n  The 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) imposes \noutdated barriers to the provision of investment advice to workers \nparticipating in 401(k) plans. ERISA prevents investment advisors who \nhave an affiliation with the investment options available under the \nplan from providing investment advice to plan participants. This \nrestriction might have\n\n[[Page S12290]]\n\nseemed reasonable in 1974 when retirement plans were dominated by \ntraditional defined benefit pension plans. However, the explosion in \n401(k) plans--and thus the need to provide workers with investment \nadvice services--was not imagined in 1974.\n  This bill will allow employers to provide their employees with access \nto quality investment advice so long as the advisors fully and clearly \ndisclose their fees and any potential conflicts of interest. \nFurthermore, investment advisors are subject to ERISA's stringent \nfiduciary obligations, which requires them to act solely in the best \ninterest of plan participants. Investment advisors who breach this \nfiduciary duty are subject to a lawsuit by the worker, another plan \nfiduciary, the plan itself, or the Department of Labor. Employers also \nhave the fiduciary obligation of prudently selecting and periodically \nreviewing advice providers.\n  Let us remember that workers are not required to either seek or \nfollow the investment advice. All advice given is strictly voluntary. \nWith clear and full disclosure of fee arrangements and potential \nconflicts of interest, plan participants can decide for themselves \nwhether or not to act on it.\n  Some of my colleagues might argue that only independent investment \nadvisors should be allowed to provide investment advice to plan \nparticipants. This ignores both the realities of the marketplace for \ninvestment advice and the needs of employees and employers. Excluding \nmany of the most qualified financial services companies from offering \ninvestment advice to plan participants will leave a large void in the \n401(k) advice marketplace. Conversely, increasing competition in this \nmarketplace will promote better quality and lower costs--both to the \nbenefit of plan participants.\n  Restricting the provision of investment advice services to \nindependent advisors ensures that the advice gap will remain wide--\nparticularly at small businesses. Employers would be required to look \noutside of their plan's current administrative arrangement and hire \nanother financial institution to provide investment advice services to \nemployees. For small companies like those in Wyoming, meeting this \ncriteria would be almost impossible. Small employers face unique \nresource and personnel limitations. The cost of researching, selecting, \nand paying for the services of an independent advice provider will \ndeter small employers from providing this valued benefit to employees.\n  The key to retirement security for 401(k) participants is quality \ninvestment advice, tailored to the needs of each worker. The key to \nexpanding the number of workers getting such advice is increasing \ncompetition in the marketplace for investment advice while providing \nmeaningful protection and disclosure to workers. The Retirement \nSecurity Advice Act will open the door to both.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1698\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Retirement \nSecurity Advice Act of 2003, introduced by my good friend from Wyoming, \nSenator Mike Enzi. I do so because this bill holds important \nimplications for small businesses in this county and for the millions \nof Americans they employ.\n  In 1996, we created the Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees \n(SIMPLE) as a pension-plan option for small firms in this country. The \ngoal was a simple one: provide a pension plan with low administrative \ncosts for employers so they can offer pension benefits to encourage \nemployees to save for their retirement. I am pleased that these plans \nhave become quite popular, and together with the other pension \nsimplifications and improvements enacted since then, they have \ncontributed to better access to pension benefits by small businesses \nand their employees.\n  Greater retirement savings, however, have raised new and complex \nissues for many employees who have seen their pension accounts grow \nsubstantially. As a member of both the Senate Small Business Committee \nand the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee, I have heard \nmany constitents raise difficult questions in this area: What are \nappropriate investments for my personal circumstances and risk \ntolerance? Should I buy stocks, bonds, annuities, or something else? \nHow should I diversify my investments? When should I modify my \ninvestment mix? And so on.\n  The importance of these questions has increased substantially in \nlight of recent high-profile business failures and economic downtown. \nGone are the days of the momentum market where any dollar invested \nseemed to grow with little effort or no risk.\n  The return to more cautious investing has left employees who \nparticipate in employer-sponsored pension plans in a real dilemma--hire \nan outside investment advisor or go it alone in most cases. Why? \nCurrent pension rules effectively preclude most employers from offering \ninvestment advice to their employees. In fact, recent estimates are \nthat only about 16 percent of participants have access to investment \nadvice through their pension plan. In today's complex investment \nenvironment that is simply too little help for employees who are trying \nto manage their retirement security.\n  Senator Enzi's bill addresses this situation in a responsible way. \nFor most businesses, and particularly small firms, the logical place to \nlook for an investment advisor would be the company that manage's the \nplan's investment options or an affiliated firm. Under Senator Enzi's \nbill that option would now be available, opening the door for countless \nbusinesses to offer this important benefit at a low cost to their \nemployees who participate in the company's pension plan. In addition, \nby allowing more businesses to offer investment-advice benefits, the \nbill creates an opportunity for increased competition among investment \nadvisors, which can lead to better advice products and lower costs \noverall.\n  Senator Enzi's bill, however, does not simply change the rules to \nhelp the business community. It also includes critical protections for \nthe plan participants. Investment advisors must satisfy strict \nrequirements concerning their qualifications, and they must disclose on \na regular basis all their business relationships, fees, and potential \nconflicts of interest directly to the participants. In addition, and \narguably most importantly, the investment advisor must assume fiduciary \nliability for the investment advice it renders to the employee \nparticipants in the plan. In short, if the investment advisor does not \nact solely in the interest of the participant, it will be liable for \ndamages resulting from the breach of its fidicuary duty. Together, the \nbill's provisions provide substantive safeguards to protect the \ninterests of the plan participants who take advantage of the new \ninvestment-advice benefit.\n  Some have contended that a better alternative is to force small \nbusinesses to engage an independent third party to provide investment \nadvice. I disagree. The result would simply be the same as under \ncurrent law. Cost is a real issue for small businesses seeking to offer \nbenefits like pension plans and related investment advice--hence, the \ngenesis of the SIMPLE pension plan. As under the current rules, if the \nonly option is a costly outside advisor, the small firm will not offer \nthe investment-advise benefit. As a result, we would not move the ball \neven a yard further--employers would still be left to their own devices \nto figure out the complex world of investing or they would have to seek \nout and hire their own advisor, which few have the wherewithal to do.\n  More to the point, nothing under the Enzi bill prevents a business \nfrom engaging an independent advisor if the employer deems that the \nbest alternative. The standard under the Enzi bill for selecting the \ninvestment advisor is prudence; the same criteria that the employer \nmust exercise under current law when selecting the company\n\n[[Page S12293]]\n\nthat manages the pension plan and its investment options. If a prudent \nperson would not hire or retain the investment advisor, then under the \nEnzi bill, the employer should not do so either or face liability for \nbreach of fiduciary duty. Again, additional protection for the plan \nparticipants.\n  In my assessment, investment advice is an increasingly important \nbenefit that employers want and need. Morover, small businesses in \nparticular need the flexibility to offer benefits that keep them \ncompetitive with big companies as they seek to hire and retain the very \nbest employees possible. And when we talk about small businesses, we \nare not dealing with an insignificant employer in this country. In \nfact, according to Small Business Administration data, small businesses \nrepresent 99 percent of all employers and provide 60 to 80 percent of \nthe net new jobs annually in this country.\n  The Retirement Security Advice Act provides a carefully balanced and \nresponsible solution to this situation. Most importantly, it provides a \nsolution that employers will actually use to offer the investment \nadvice sought by their employers who struggle to put money aside in the \nhopes of having a nest egg that someday will provide them with a \ncomfortable retirement. I am pleased to co-sponsor this bill and look \nforward to working with my colleague from Wyoming to see it enacted \ninto law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1699. A bill to amend the Head Start Act to require parental \nconsent for nonemergency intrusive physical examinations; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrequire parental consent for intrusive physical exams, genital exams, \nadministered under the Head Start program.\n  Young children attending Head Start programs should not be subjected \nto these invasive exams without the prior knowledge or consent of their \nparents. While the Department of Health and Human Services has \nadministered general exam guidelines to agencies, the U.S. Code is not \nclear about prohibiting them without parental consent. My bill will \nclarify the Code by not allowing any non-emergency invasive genital \nexam by a Head Start agency without parental consent.\n  As a father and grandfather, I believe it is vital for parents to be \ninformed about what is happening to their children in the classroom. I \nhope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Specter, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Smith, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Warner, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Kohl, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1700. A bill to eliminate the substantial backlog of DNA samples \ncollected from crime scenes and convicted offenders, to improve and \nexpand the DNA testing capacity of Federal, State, and local crime \nlaboratories, to increase research and development of new DNA testing \ntechnologies, to develop new training programs regarding the collection \nand use of DNA evidence, to provide post-conviction testing of DNA \nevidence to exonerate the innocent, to improve the performance of \ncounsel in State capital cases, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a comprehensive \nbipartisan bill which will ensure the full use and availability of DNA \ntechnology in our criminal justice system. This bill, which enacts the \nPresident's DNA technology initiative, announced by Attorney General \nAshcroft on March 11, 2003, will provide over $1 billion in funding and \nassistance over the next 5 years to the criminal justice system in \norder to realize the full potential of DNA technology to solve crimes, \nprotect the public and exonerate the innocent.\n  The legislation I am introducing today represents a bipartisan \ncompromise which was reached through extensive negotiations among \nSenators on the Judiciary Committee and members from the House \nCommittee on the Judiciary. I want to first commend my counterpart, \nChairman Sensenbrenner, for his steady leadership on this issue and his \ncommitment to reaching an agreement, and note the commitment and \ndedication of Representatives Conyers, Coble, LaHood, and Delahunt to \nthis important initiative.\n  I also want to commend my colleagues here in the Senate: Senators \nBiden, Specter, Leahy, DeWine, and Feinstein--who each have a long-\nstanding commitment to issues included in this comprehensive DNA bill. \nWe have worked together on DNA issues for many years, and thanks to \neach of their efforts we now are in the position to enact bipartisan \nlegislation that enhances the use of DNA technology in our criminal \njustice system. I want to express my personal thanks to all of them for \ntheir leadership and contributions to this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Also, I want to highlight specifically the accomplishment today of \nthe ranking member of our Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. For \nseveral years, Senator Leahy has dedicated himself to the issue of DNA \ntechnology and ensuring that such technology is used to protect the \nintegrity of our criminal justice system by exonerating the innocent \nwhile punishing the guilty. He has worked tirelessly in this area as \nthe sponsor of the Innocence Protection Act. While we both shared a \ncommon goal of protecting the integrity of our criminal justice system, \nwe differed on the means to accomplish that end.\n  Today, I am proud to support the compromise proposal we have \nnegotiated, and join together with my friend, Senator Leahy, to \nintroduce the Innocence Protection Act of 2003 as part of this \nlegislative package. I want to specifically congratulate Senator Leahy \nfor his accomplishment and for his dedication to this important issue.\n  It is perhaps fitting that 50 years after the discovery of DNA by Dr. \nJames Watson in 1953, we are now proposing to enact the most far-\nreaching and comprehensive expansion of DNA technology to promote \npublic safety, to bring to justice violent criminals who can be \nidentified through DNA technology, and to ensure the accuracy of our \ncriminal justice system.\n  Let me take a moment to highlight the important provisions of this \nbill.\n  The bill enacts the President's comprehensive DNA initiative, \n``Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology,'' and will authorize \nfunding of $755 million for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program \nin order to eliminate the current backlog of unanalyzed DNA samples in \nour Nation's crime labs. It is critical that such funding be \nappropriated to ensure that unanalyzed evidence from violent crime \nscenes, such as rape and murder, are compared against known DNA samples \nto solve these terrible crimes and apprehend the perpetrators.\n  As many of you know, Debbie Smith is the courageous survivor of \na horrific sexual assault, and has become a leading spokesperson for \nwomen and crime victims across the country. Debbie Smith waited 6 years \nbefore Norman Jimmerson, a current inmate in a Virginia prison, was \nidentified as her attacker through DNA. Debbie testified against \nJimmerson, who is now serving two life sentences plus 25 years with no \nchance of parole.\n\n  Debbie Smith has dedicated herself to the elimination of the backlog \nin the processing of DNA evidence and samples. By eliminating the \nsubstantial backlog of DNA samples for the most serious violent \noffenses, we can solve more crimes, protect the public and apprehend \nmore violent criminals. The National Institute of Justice estimates \nthat the current backlog of rape and homicide cases is at least 350,000 \ncases. NIJ also estimates that there are between 300,000 and 500,000 \ncollected, but untested convicted offender samples. In addition, the \nJustice Department estimates that there are between 500,000 and \n1,000,000 convicted offender samples which have not yet been collected \nas required by law.\n  The President has directed the Justice Department to eliminate these \nbacklogs completely within 5 years, and I am committed to doing \neverything in my power to make that a reality to ensure that the \nevidence is analyzed, the crimes solved and the criminals punished to \nthe fullest extent of the law.\n\n[[Page S12294]]\n\n  The proposed legislation also will solve more crimes by expanding \nState and local crime lab capacity to test DNA. Crime laboratories face \nincreasing workloads and increased DNA analysis demands. Only 10 \npercent of public crime labs have automated facilities needed to \nprocess DNA testing, and help is needed in this area. We must expand \nthe capacity of these laboratories to meet current demand and build for \nfuture needs. That is what the bill will do.\n  The bill also will increase research and development of new \ntechnologies to test DNA; provides training of criminal justice \nprofessionals to enhance collection and understanding of DNA evidence; \nand expands existing programs to train medical personnel who typically \nare the first to have contact with sexual assault victims so that they \ncan collect and preserve critical biological evidence for DNA testing \nand comparison purposes.\n  Some have suggested that focusing exclusively on DNA technology \nignores the significant need for funding and assistance to State and \nlocal crime labs for non-DNA forensic analyses. The proposed bill \nexpands the Paul Coverdell Grant Program to provide assistance to the \nStates to eliminate non-DNA forensic evidence backlogs. I recognize \nthat forensic examination of ballistics evidence, fingerprints, \nsuspected illegal drugs, and other evidence is critical to our criminal \njustice system. I am committed to addressing these needs as well in \norder to protect the public.\n  The legislation will not only speed the apprehension and prosecution \nof the guilty, but will protect the innocent from wrongful prosecution. \nDNA technology allows us to exclude innocent people as suspects early \nin an investigation, and allows law enforcement to focus on finding the \ntrue perpetrator.\n  The Innocence Protection Act of 2003, developed under the leadership \nof Senator Leahy, which is included as Title III of this bill, creates \na federal post-conviction DNA testing scheme which authorizes DNA \ntesting and relief for a convicted defendant, where the defendant \nclaims he is ``actually innocent'' of the crime, and demonstrates that \nsuch testing shows that they did not commit the crime. DNA testing will \nnot be permitted where such a test would only muddy the waters and be \nused by the defendant to fuel a new and frivolous series of appeals. \nUnder the Act, DNA testing in capital cases will be prioritized and \nconducted on a ``fast track,'' so that these important cases are \nhandled quickly.\n\n  In order to discourage a flood of baseless claims, the act authorizes \nthe prosecution of defendants who make false claims of innocence in \nsupport of a DNA testing request. Each defendant will be required to \nassert under penalty of perjury that they are, in fact, innocent of the \ncrime. When DNA testing reveals that the defendant's claim of innocence \nwas actually false, the defendant can then be prosecuted and, if \nconvicted, will be subject to a consecutive term of imprisonment of 3 \nyears. Further, the act allows DNA test results to be entered into the \nCODIS database and compared against unsolved crimes. If the test result \nshows that the defendant committed another crime, the defendant may \nthen be prosecuted for the other crime.\n  With respect to the States, the act encourages States to create \nsimilar DNA testing procedures, and provides funding assistance to \nthose States that have existing DNA testing programs or that implement \nsuch DNA testing programs after enactment of this act. In honor of Kirk \nBloodsworth, a death row inmate, who was eventually freed through post-\nconviction DNA testing, the bill creates and names a grant program \nafter Mr. Bloodsworth to help the States conduct appropriate post-\nconviction DNA testing. With the new source of funding, more States \nwill enact DNA testing programs, and will provide such testing on an \nexpedited basis.\n  While DNA testing is now standard in pretrial criminal investigations \ntoday, the integrity of our criminal justice system and in particular, \nour death penalty system, can be enhanced with the appropriate use of \nDNA testing. No one disagrees with the fact that post-conviction DNA \ntesting should be made available to defendants when it serves the ends \nof justice. I am convinced that the proposed legislation does so fairly \nand effectively with proper regard for the rights of the defendant and \nthe interests of victims and their families.\n  Finally, Title III of the bill creates a new grant program to improve \nthe performance of counsel--prosecutors and defense counsel--handling \nState capital cases. The issue of the death penalty in our country \ncontinues to spark significant debate. The recent Supreme Court \ndecisions addressing capital punishment underscore the importance of \nthis issue to the American people. It is an issue that engenders great \npassion, both among its supporters and among its opponents. A large \nmajority of the American people believe in the death penalty, \nespecially for terrorists who have killed thousands of Americans. And \nall of us agree that the death penalty must be imposed fairly and \naccurately.\n  I have stated on numerous occasions my views on the death penalty. It \nis the ultimate punishment and it should be reserved only for those \ndefendants who commit the most heinous of crimes. I am firmly convinced \nthat we must be vigilant in ensuring that capital punishment is meted \nout fairly against those truly guilty criminals. We cannot and should \nnot tolerate defects in the capital punishment system. No one can \ndisagree with this ultimate and solemn responsibility.\n  I have disagreed with others on the committee as to the state of our \nNation's capital punishment system, the quality of representation in \nState capital cases, and whether such sentences are meted out fairly. I \nam proud, however, to support this proposal where we can all agree--we \ncan improve the performance of counsel on both sides by awarding grants \nto States. These funds will be equally divided between prosecutors and \ndefense counsel, and are designed to reduce to the maximum extent \npossible the occurrence of error in the conduct of capital trials in \nour States. We all agree that reducing trial error is a laudable goal. \nBy doing so, we enhance the fairness of our capital punishment system.\n  Every defendant in our criminal justice system is afforded the \nguarantee by the sixth amendment of our Constitution of competent and \neffective counsel. The Supreme Court has enforced this right in \nnumerous decisions in order to ensure that all defendants are afforded \nthe constitutional protections guaranteed to them.\n  At the same time, the public is entitled to quality representation by \nprosecutors who handle capital cases. Training and monitoring the \nperformance of prosecutors who handle these important cases will ensure \nthat States and the public are fully and effectively served in the \ntrial of capital cases.\n  Contrary to the view of some, I do not believe that our capital \npunishment is broken. However, I do believe that our justice system can \nalways be improved. The grants proposed under the act will enable \nstates to improve the performance of prosecutors and defense counsel to \nensure that capital cases are handled more efficiently and effectively, \nand that every capital defendant will receive a fair trial under our \njustice system.\n  DNA technology has the power to convict the guilty and protect the \ninnocent and will move our criminal justice system into a new era that \nis both fair and efficient. The President's DNA initiative is a \nforward-looking measure, which will improve significant aspects of \nfederal, state and local criminal justice systems. We are poised to \nenter that new era. With this comprehensive proposal, we will ensure \nthe use of DNA technology and protect the public safety.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me in promptly passing \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nsection-by-section analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003\n\n\n                      section-by-section analysis\n\n     Overview\n       The Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act increases \n     Federal resources available to State and local governments to \n     combat crimes with DNA technology, and provides safeguards to \n     prevent wrongful convictions and executions. The bill enacts \n     the President's DNA Initiative, which provides\n\n[[Page S12295]]\n\n     over $1 billion in the next five years to assist Federal and \n     State authorities to realize the full potential of DNA \n     technology to solve crimes and protect the innocent.\n       Title I and II, the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act and the \n     Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog Elimination Act, [of the \n     bill] authorize the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, \n     which provides $755 million over five years to address the \n     DNA Backlog crisis in the nation's crime labs. The bill also \n     establishes over $500 million in new grant programs [together \n     with grant programs] to reduce other forensic science \n     backlogs, train criminal justice and medical personnel in the \n     use of DNA evidence, and promote the use of DNA technology to \n     identify missing persons.\n       Title III of the bill, the Innocence Protection Act, \n     provides access to post-conviction DNA testing in federal \n     cases, helps States improve the quality of legal \n     representation in capital cases, and increases compensation \n     in Federal cases of wrongful conviction. In addition, Title \n     III authorizes the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA \n     Testing Program and provides $25 million over five years to \n     defray the costs of post-conviction DNA testing.\n\n\n  TITLE I--RAPE KITS AND DNA EVIDENCE BACKLOG ELIMINATION ACT OF 2003\n\n       Sec. 101. Short Title. This title may be cited as the \n     ``Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog Elimination Act of \n     2003.''\n       Sec. 102 [The]Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program. \n     Reauthorizes and expands the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination \n     Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135), increasing the authorized \n     funding levels for the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination \n     program to $151 million annually for the next five years, as \n     proposed in the President's DNA initiative.\n       Subsection (a) names the Backlog Elimination Act grant \n     program in honor of Debbie Smith, a rape survivor and leader \n     in promoting the use of the DNA technology to solve crimes. \n     In addition, subsection (a) amends he eligibility provisions \n     to add ``units of local government'' as [a] potential \n     grantees, so that Federal resources can meet local needs more \n     quickly.\n       Subsection (b)(1) provides a single annual authorization \n     for the program, and modifies existing program objectives by: \n     (1) adding the collection of DNA samples from convicted \n     offenders as a specific program purpose (proposed 42 U.S.C. \n     14135(a)(4)); (2) ensuring that DNA testing and analysis of \n     samples from crime scenes (such as rape kits and biological \n     material found at homicide scenes), including sexual assault \n     and other serious violent crimes, are carried out in a timely \n     manner (proposed 42 U.S.C. 14135(a)(5)); and (3) revising the \n     existing objective in 41 U.S.C. 14135(a)(3), to clarify that \n     funds can be used to increase the capacity of public \n     laboratories to carry out analysis of DNA samples.\n       Subsection (c) modifies 42 U.S.C. 14135(c) to provide for \n     the disbursement of grant funds by the Attorney General in \n     conformity with a formula that maximizes the effective use of \n     DNA technology to solve crimes and protect public safety, and \n     addresses areas where significant backlogs exist. A minimum \n     grant amount of 0.50 percent is to be awarded to each State, \n     and a specified percentage of remaining funds will be awarded \n     to conduct DNA analyses of samples from casework [or victims \n     of crime].\n       Conversion of the Backlog Elimination Act grant program \n     into a formula grant program will ensure that funds will be \n     fairly distributed among all eligible jurisdictions. It is \n     expected that the factors given weight in the formula will \n     include the magnitude and nature of the DNA backlogs and \n     current DNA work demands in the jurisdictions that seek \n     funding; deficits in public laboratory capacity for the \n     timely and efficient analysis of DNA samples in these \n     jurisdictions, and cost requirements for remedying these \n     deficits; and the ability of these jurisdictions to use the \n     funds to increase DNA analysis and public laboratory capacity \n     for such analysis. It is further expected that the formula \n     will target funding on the use of DNA analysis to solve the \n     most serious violent crimes, including rapes and murders, \n     whose solution through DNA testing promises the greatest \n     return in promoting public safety.\n       Subsection (k) reserves no more than 1 percent of the grant \n     amounts to assist State and local crime labs to become \n     accredited, and to undergo regular external audits, in order \n     to ensure that such labs fully comply with Federal quality \n     assurance standards.\n       Sec. 103. Expansion of Combined DNA Index System. Amends \n     the statute governing the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) \n     to allow States to include in the DNA index the DNA profiles \n     of all persons whose DNA samples have been collected under \n     applicable legal authorities, including those authorized by \n     State law, all felons convicted of Federal crimes, and \n     qualifying military offenses.\n        Sec. 104. Tolling of State of Limitations [Limitation \n     Period for Prosecution in Cases Involving DNA \n     Identification]. Provides that, in a case where DNA testing \n     implicates an identified person in the commission of a \n     felony, except for a felony offense under chapter 109A, no \n     statute of limitations would preclude prosecution of the \n     offense until a time period equal to the statute of \n     limitations has elapsed from the date of identification of \n     the perpetrator.\n       Sec. 105. Legal Assistance for Victims of Dating Violence. \n     Amends the Violence Against Women Act to include legal \n     assistance for victims of ``dating violence,'' defined as \n     violence committed by a person: (1) who is or has been in a \n     romantic or intimate relationship with the victim; and (2) \n     where the existence of such relationship is determined based \n     upon consideration of its length and its type, and upon the \n     frequency of interaction between the persons involved.\n       Sec. 106. Ensuring Private Laboratory Assistance in \n     Eliminating DNA Backlog. Clarifies that grants may be made \n     through vouchers and contracts to private for-profit \n     laboratories to assist in collection of DNA samples from \n     offenders and processing of crime scene DNA evidence.\n\n\n            title ii--dna sexual assault justice act of 2003\n\n       Sec. 201. Short Title. This title may be cited as the ``DNA \n     Sexual Justice Act of 2003.''\n       Sec. 202. Ensuring Public Crime Laboratory Compliance with \n     Federal Standards. Requires that eligible State and local \n     government public crime labs are accredited and undergo \n     external audits, not less than once every 2 years, to \n     demonstrate compliance with Federal standards established by \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       Sec. 203. DNA Training and Education for Law Enforcement, \n     Correctional Personnel, and Court Officers. Authorizes grants \n     to provide training, technical assistance, educational and \n     information relating to the identification, collection, \n     preservation, analysis and use of DNA samples and DNA \n     evidence by law enforcement personnel and other first \n     responders who collect or examine crime scene evidence; court \n     officers, including prosecutors, defense lawyers and judges; \n     forensic science professionals; and corrections personnel. \n     The grant program is authorized through 2009 at $12.5 million \n     per year.\n       Sec. 204. Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Program Grants. \n     Authorizes grants to provide training, technical assistance, \n     education and information relating to the identification, \n     collection, preservation, analysis and use of DNA samples and \n     DNA evidence by medical personnel and other personnel, \n     including doctors, medical examiners, coroners, nurses, \n     victim service providers, and other medical professionals, \n     including existing sexual assault and sexual assault \n     examination programs (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE), \n     Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner (SAFE), and Sexual Assault \n     Response Team (SART)). The grant program is authorized \n     through 2009 at $30 million per year.\n       Sec. 205. DNA Research and Development. Authorizes grants \n     for research and development to improve forensic DNA \n     technology, including funding of demonstration projects \n     involving law enforcement agencies and criminal justice \n     participants to evaluate the use of forensic DNA technology. \n     Also authorizes the Attorney General to establish a new \n     Forensic Science Commission, composed of members from the \n     forensic science and criminal justice communities, which will \n     be responsible for examining various issues, including: \n     (1) maximizing the use of forensic sciences to solve \n     crimes and protect public safety; (2) increasing the \n     number of qualified forensic scientists; (3) disseminating \n     best practices concerning the collection and analyses of \n     forensic evidence; and (4) assessing Federal, State and \n     local privacy protection statutes, regulations and \n     practices relating to DNA samples and DNA analyses. \n     Programs are authorized through 2009 at $15 million per \n     year.\n       Sec. 206. FBI DNA Programs. Authorizes $42.1 million per \n     year through 2009 for FBI DNA programs and activities, \n     including (1) nuclear DNA analysis; (2) mitochondrial DNA \n     analysis; (3) regional mitochondrial DNA laboratories; (4) \n     the Combined DNA Index System; (5) the Federal Convicted \n     Offender DNA Program; and (6) DNA research and development.\n       Sec. 207. DNA Identification of Missing Persons. Authorizes \n     $2 million per year through 2009 for grants to promote the \n     use of forensic DNA technology to identify missing persons \n     and unidentified human remains.\n       Sec. 208. Enhanced Criminal Penalties for Unauthorized \n     Disclosure or Use of DNA Information. Modifies the existing \n     criminal provision for unauthorized disclosure of DNA \n     information to include unauthorized ``use'' of such \n     information, and increases the potential fine to $100,000 for \n     each criminal offense.\n       Sec. 209. Tribal Coalition Grants. Amends the eligibility \n     criteria for discretionary grants under the Violence Against \n     Women Act to include tribal coalitions, and thereby directly \n     support nonprofit, nongovernmental tribal domestic violence \n     and sexual assault coalitions [in Indian country.]\n       Sec. 210. Expansion of the Paul Coverdell Forensic Sciences \n     Improvement Grant Program. Expands existing grant program to \n     permit funds to be used to eliminate a backlog in the \n     analysis of forensic science evidence, and extends \n     authorization of appropriations through 2009, at $20 million \n     a year. Current authorizations are $128,067,000 for 2004, \n     $56,733,000 for 2005, and $42,067,000 for 2006. [Sec. 210. \n     Forensic Backlog Elimination Grant Program. Authorizes $10 \n     million a year through 2009 for grants to States, units of \n     local government, and tribal governments, to eliminate the \n     backlog in the analysis of any area of forensic science, \n     including firearms examination, latent prints, toxicology, \n     and controlled substances.]\n       Sec. 211. Report to Congress. Requires the Attorney General \n     to submit a report, not later than 3 years after enactment, \n     relating to implementation of titles I and II of this Act.\n\n[[Page S12296]]\n\n              title iii--innocence protection act of 2003\n\n       Sec. 301. Short Title. This title may be cited as the \n     ``Innocence Protection Act of 2003.''\n\n        Subtitle 1--Exonerating the Innocent Through DNA Testing\n\n       Sec. 311. Federal Post-Conviction DNA Testing. Establishes \n     rules and procedures governing applications for DNA testing \n     by inmates in the Federal system. A court shall order DNA \n     testing if the applicant asserts under penalty of perjury \n     that he or she is actually innocent of a qualifying offense, \n     and the proposed DNA testing would produce new material \n     evidence that supports such assertion and raises a reasonable \n     probability that the applicant did not commit the offense. \n     Limitations on access to testing are imposed where the \n     applicant seeks to interfere with the administration of \n     justice rather than to support a valid claim. Penalties are \n     established in the event that testing inculpates the \n     applicant. Where test results are exculpatory, the court \n     shall grant the applicant's motion for a new trial or \n     resentencing if the test results and other evidence establish \n     by a preponderance of the evidence that a new trial would \n     result in an acquittal of the offense at issue.\n       This section also prohibits the destruction of biological \n     evidence in a federal criminal case while a defendant remains \n     incarcerated, absent a knowing and voluntary waiver by the \n     defendant or prior notification to the defendant that the \n     evidence may be destroyed. Nothing in this section supersedes \n     any statute, regulation, court order, or other provision of \n     law requiring that evidence, including biological evidence, \n     be preserved. Intentional violations of this preservation \n     provision to prevent evidence from being tested or used in \n     court are punishable by a term of imprisonment.\n       Sec. 312. Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing \n     Grant Program. Authorizes $5 million a year in grants through \n     2009 to help States to defray the costs of post-conviction \n     DNA testing. This program is named in honor of Kirk \n     Bloodsworth, the first death row inmate to be exonerated by \n     DNA testing.\n       Sec. 313. Incentive Grants to States to Ensure \n     Consideration of Claims of Actual Innocence. Reserves the \n     total amount of funds appropriated to carry out sections 203, \n     205, 207, and 312 of this Act for states that have adopted \n     adequate procedures for providing post-conviction DNA testing \n     and preserving biological evidence for this purpose.\n\n Subtitle 2--Improving the Quality of Representation in State Capital \n                                 Cases\n\n       Sec. 321. Capital Representation Improvement Grants. \n     Authorizes a grant program, to be administered by the \n     Attorney General, to improve the quality of legal \n     representation provided to indigent defendants in State \n     capital cases. Grants shall be used to establish, implement, \n     or improve an effective system for providing competent legal \n     representation in capital cases, but may not be used to fund \n     representation in specific cases. An effective system is \n     one in which a public defender program or other entity \n     establishes qualifications for attorneys who may be \n     appointed to represent indigents in capital cases; \n     establishes and maintains a roster of qualified attorneys \n     and assigns attorneys from the roster (or provides the \n     trial judge with a choice of attorneys from the roster); \n     trains and monitors the performance of such attorneys; and \n     ensures funding for the full cost of competent legal \n     representation by the defense team and any outside \n     experts.\n       Sec. 322. Capital Prosecution Improvement Grants. As part \n     of the same program established in section 321, authorizes \n     grants to improve the representation of the public in State \n     capital cases. Grants shall be used to design and implement \n     training programs for capital prosecutors; develop, \n     implement, and enforce appropriate standards and \n     qualifications for such prosecutors and assess their \n     performance; establish programs under which prosecutors \n     conduct a systematic review of cases in which a defendant is \n     sentenced to death in order to identify cases in which post-\n     conviction DNA testing is appropriate; and assist the \n     families of murder victims.\n       Sec. 323. Applications. Establishes requirements for States \n     applying for grants under this subtitle, including a long-\n     term strategy and detailed implementation plan that reflects \n     consultation with the judiciary, the organized bar, and State \n     and local prosecutor and defender organizations, and \n     establishes as a priority improvement in the quality of \n     trial-level representation of indigents charged with capital \n     crimes and trial-level prosecution of capital crimes in order \n     to enhance the reliability of capital trial verdicts. Funds \n     received under this subtitle shall be allocated equally \n     between the programs established in sections 321 and 322.\n       Sec. 324. State Reports. Requires States receiving funds \n     under this subtitle to submit an annual report to the \n     Attorney General identifying the activities carried out with \n     the funds and explaining how each activity complies with the \n     terms and conditions of the grant.\n       Sec. 325. Evaluations by Inspector General and \n     Administrative Remedies. Directs the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Justice to submit periodic reports to the \n     Attorney General evaluating the compliance of each State \n     receiving funds under this subtitle with the terms and \n     conditions of the grant. In conducting such evaluations, the \n     Inspector General shall give priority to States at the \n     highest risk of noncompliance. If, after receiving a report \n     from the Inspector General, the Attorney General finds that a \n     State is not in compliance, the Attorney General shall take a \n     series of steps to bring the State into compliance and report \n     to Congress on the results.\n       Sec. 326. Authorization of Appropriations. Authorizes $100 \n     million a year for five years to carry out this subtitle.\n\n          Subtitle 3--Compensation of the Wrongfully Convicted\n\n       Sec. 331. Increased Compensation in Federal Cases. \n     Increases the maximum amount of damages that the U.S. Court \n     of Federal Claims may award against the United States in \n     cases of unjust imprisonment from a flat $5,000 to $50,000 \n     per year in non-capital cases, and $100,000 per year in \n     capital cases.\n       Sec. 332. Sense of Congress Regarding Compensation in State \n     Death Penalty Cases. This section expresses the sense of \n     Congress that States should provide reasonable compensation \n     to any person found to have been unjustly convicted of an \n     offense against the State and sentenced to death.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise along with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Utah, Senator Hatch and several others of my colleagues, \nSenators Spector, Leahy, DeWine, and Feinstein, to introduce the \nAdvancing Justice Through DNA Act, a bill that harnesses the power of \nDNA to give prompt justice to victims of sexual assault crimes and to \nfree the wrongly convicted. This bill takes every component of DNA \ntechnology and makes it accessible and more useful to Federal, State \nand local law enforcement, to prosecutors and defense attorneys, to \nmedical personnel and to victims of crime.\n  Promoting and supporting DNA technology as a crime-fighting tool is \nnot a new endeavor for me. A provision of my 1994 crime bill created \nthe Combined DNA Index System, called ``CODIS'', which is an electronic \ndatabase of DNA profiles, much like the FBI's fingerprint database. \nCODIS includes two kinds of DNA information--convicted offender DNA \nsamples and DNA from crime scenes. CODIS uses the two indexes to \ngenerate investigative leads in crimes where biological evidence is \nrecovered from the scene. In essence, CODIS facilitates the DNA match. \nAnd once that match is made, a crime is solved because of the \nincredible accuracy and durability of DNA evidence.\n  Ninety-nine.nine percent--that is how accurate DNA evidence is. One \nin 30 billion--those are the odds someone else committed a crime if a \nsuspect's DNA matches evidence at the crime scene. Twenty or 30 years--\nthat is how long DNA evidence from a crime scene lasts.\n  Just 10 years ago DNA analysis of evidence could have cost thousands \nof dollars and taken months, now testing one sample costs $40 and can \ntake days. Ten years ago forensic scientists needed blood the size of a \nbottle cap, now DNA testing can be done on a sample the size of a \npinhead. The changes in DNA technology are remarkable, and mark a sea \nchange in how we can fight crime, particularly sexual assault crimes.\n  The FBI reports that since 1998 the national DNA database has helped \nput away violent criminals in over 9,000 investigations in 50 States. \nHow? By matching the DNA crime evidence to the DNA profiles of \noffenders. Individual success stories of DNA cold hits in sexual \nassault cases make these numbers all too real.\n  Just last year, Alabama authorities charged a man in the rape of an \n85-year-old woman almost 10 years ago after he was linked to the case \nby a DNA sample he was compelled to submit while in prison on unrelated \ncharges.\n  In Colorado, prosecutors brought to trial a case against a man \naccused of at least 14 rapes and sexual assaults. Due to the national \nDNA database, prosecutors were able to trace the defendant to rapes and \nassaults that occurred in Colorado, California, Arizona, Nevada and \nOklahoma between 1999 and 2002.\n  Or take for example a 1996 case in St. Louis were two young girls \nwere abducted from bus stops and raped at opposite ends of the city. \nThe police were unable to identify a suspect. In 1999, the police \ndecided to re-run the DNA testing to develop new leads. In January \n2000, the DNA database matched the case to a 1999 rape case, and police \nwere able to identify the perpetrator.\n  Last spring, the New York Police Department arrested a man linked to \nthe rape of a woman years ago. In 1997, a woman was horribly beaten, \nrobbed and raped--there were no suspects. Five years later, the \nperpetrator submitted\n\n[[Page S12297]]\n\na DNA sample as a condition of probation after serving time for \nburglary. The DNA sample matched the DNA from the 1997 rape. Crime \nsolved, streets safer.\n  Undoubtedly, DNA matching by comparing evidence gathered at the crime \nscene with offender samples entered on the national DNA database has \nproven to be the deciding factor in solving stranger sexual assault \ncases--it has revolutionized the criminal justice system, and brought \nclosure and justice for victims. A laboratory expert testified that \nVirginia has a 48 percent hit rate because the State collects samples \nfrom all convicted felons and aggressively analyzes crime scene \nevidence with no backlog. This means that almost 1 out of every 2 \nviolent crimes could be solved by the national DNA database.\n  In light of the past successes and the future potential of DNA \nevidence, the reported number of untested rape kits and other crime \nscene evidence waiting in police warehouses is simply shocking--300,000 \nto 500,000. It is a national problem, plaguing both urban and rural \nareas, that deserves national attention and solutions. Last year, a \nMichigan newspaper reported that its State police forensic unit is \nexpected to have a 10-year backlog of items in need of DNA testing. The \nFlorida crime lab system is facing a backlog of more than 2,400 rape, \nmurder and assault and burglary cases waiting for DNA testing. South \nCarolina has 10,000 untested samples from convicted offenders. In June \n2003, the New Jersey police department reported that over 1,200 \ncriminal cases--most of them sexual assault cases--were waiting for DNA \nanalysis. Behind every single one of those rape kits is a victim who \ndeserves recognition and justice.\n  One woman in particular has reminded State and Federal lawmakers that \nwe cannot ignore even one rape kit sitting on a shelf gathering dust. \nThat woman is Debbie Smith. In 1989, Mrs. Smith was taken from her home \nand brutally raped. There were no known suspects, and Mrs. Smith lived \nin fear of her attacker's return. Six years later, the Virginia crime \nlaboratory discovered a DNA match between the rape scene evidence and a \nState prisoner's DNA sample. That cold hit gave Mrs. Smith her first \nmoment of real security and closure, and since then she has traveled \nthe country to advocate on behalf of assault victims and champion the \nuse of DNA to fight sexual assault.\n  Today's bill provides over $755 five years to eliminate the backlog \nin rape kits and other crime scene evidence, eliminate the backlog of \nconvicted offender samples awaiting DNA testing, and improve State \nlaboratory capacity to conduct DNA testing. I am pleased that the \nbacklog elimination grant program in the Advancing Justice Through DNA \nTechnology Act is entitled, ``The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grants.'' It \nis a fitting tribute. I also want to take a moment to thank my \ncolleagues Senators Kohl and DeWine who began this effort with the DNA \nBacklog Elimination Act of 2000, and acknowledge their ongoing \ncommitment.\n  But the DNA testing is only useful if the crime scene evidence is \ncarefully collected and preserved. Towards that end, the Advancing \nJustice through DNA Technology Act creates two important grant \nprograms: 1. a $62.5 million DNA training and education grant program \nfor law enforcement, correctional personnel and court officers; and 2. \na $50 million grant program to provide training, education and \nassistance to sexual assault forensic examiner programs, often known as \nSANE or SART programs.\n  The Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act is a natural \nextension to the Violence Against Women Act, which requires the \nAttorney General to evaluate and recommend standards for training and \npractice for licensed health care professionals performing sexual \nassault forensic exams. So I knew that any DNA bill aimed at ending \nsexual assault must include resources for sexual forensic examiners. \nThis bill ensures that sexual forensic nurses, doctors, and response \nteams are all eligible for assistance. These program should be in each \nand every emergency room to bridge the gap between the law and the \nmedicine.\n  Today's bill also makes two small, but important, amendments to the \nViolence Against Women Act. First, it amends the law to include legal \nassistance for victims of dating violence, and it amends the \neligibility criteria for discretionary programs so that tribal domestic \nviolence and sexual assault coalitions can directly receiving grants \nfunds, including those funds unreleased from past fiscal years.\n  I started looking at the issue of improved prosecution of sexual \nassault crimes almost two decades ago when I began drafting the \nViolence Against Women Act. The DNA Sexual Justice Act of 2003 is the \nnext step, a way to connect the dots between the extraordinary strides \nin DNA technology and my commitment to ending violence against women. \nWe must ensure that justice delayed is not justice denied.\n  I am also gratified that this legislation includes the Innocence \nProtection Act, which I cosponsored last year, and which passed the \nJudiciary Committee. I have long advocated in this Committee for the \nchanges that it will implement.\n  The Innocence Protection Act will immeasurably improve the \nadministration of justice in our legal system, particularly where \njustice is most important, and where we can least afford to make \nmistakes--imposition of the death penalty.\n  I advocate for this bill not as an opponent of the death penalty \nlooking to curtail it, but as a supporter of the death penalty who \nauthored the first constitutional federal death penalty law after the \nSupreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional.\n  But we who support the death penalty also have a duty to ensure that \nit is fairly administered. The advent of DNA testing has provided us \nwith a wealth of opportunities to make certain that we are prosecuting \nthe right people. Just as we use DNA to help prosecutions, we must make \ntesting available to those who can use it to prove their innocence. \nThis legislation makes post-conviction testing to federal inmates who \nassert that they did not commit the crime for which they have been \nimprisoned. It also incentivizes States to take similar measures to \nensure that individuals have a proper opportunity to prove their \ninnocence. It also mandates proper preservation of DNA evidence so that \nthe DNA can be tested if appropriate.\n  As for competent counsel in death penalty cases, nobody can look me \nin the eye and tell me that our system for representation in capital \ncases works as it should. This bill will take a big step toward fixing \nthat by providing money for grants to States to improve their systems \nof representation, on both the prosecution and defense side, in capital \ncases.\n  Our goal must be an error-free system of criminal justice. To err is \nhuman, but it should never be acceptable. Our job is to do all we can \nto eliminate errors in the criminal justice system and to see to it \nthat a lack of resources does not delay bringing rapists and murderers \nto justice. This bill means we are doing our job.\n  I would be remiss if I did not pause to thank some of the many people \nwho have helped bring about the introduction of this bill. In \nparticular, I wish to thank Senators Hatch and Leahy, the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for devoting so much \nof their time and effort to developing this legislation. Similarly, \nChairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers have worked with us \nevery step of the way to get this bill done. In addition, Senators \nSpecter, DeWine and Feinstein, and Congressmen Delahunt and Coble, \namong others, have spent countless hours contributing their ideas to \nthis bill. I wish to thank all of these members for their leadership on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator from Delaware yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Of course.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this \nlegislation makes certain of its grants contingent on States providing \na process for post-conviction testing available. For those States that \nalready have enacted a statute providing such testing, that statute \nmust ensure a meaningful process for resolving a claim of actual \ninnocence. As I understand it, almost all of the State statutes already \nin existence, including those of Ohio, Utah, Delaware and Pennsylvania, \nwould pass\n\n[[Page S12298]]\n\nmuster and would qualify for the grants at issue. Is that the \nunderstanding of the Senator from Delaware?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, I thank the Senator from Utah for his question, and \nwholeheartedly agree with his understanding of this provision. I \nbelieve all of the drafters of this legislation are in agreement that \nmost of the States that already have passed statutes, except for the \nfew that limit post-conviction DNA testing to capital crimes, would \npass muster. For example, even if a State's statute differs from the \nFederal law by imposing a meaningful time limit for filing of \napplications for testing, or excluding guilty pleas from eligibility, \nit would qualify. Specifically, Utah, Delaware, Ohio and Pennsylvania, \namong others, under their statutes, or the re-enactment of those \nstatutes where they have expired, would be eligible for such grants. \nHowever, States that have not yet enacted a statute would be required \nto enact a statute, or follow a rule, regulation or practice, that met \na higher standard--the statute, rule, regulation or practice would need \nto be ``comparable'' to the Federal law in order for the State to \nqualify for the grants. I see the Senator from Pennsylvania on the \nFloor. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator to hear \nhis thoughts on this matter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator for yielding time. I would just say \nthat I completely agree with the understanding of the Senators from \nDelaware and Utah on this.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. It would be my pleasure.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would just like to make clear that the understanding of \nthe Senator from Delaware comports completely with mine.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Of course.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As the Senator knows, a second requirement for States to \nqualify for these grants is that--whether by State statute, State or \nlocal rule, regulation or practice--they preserve biological evidence \nin a reasonable way. Do the Senators from Delaware and Utah agree with \nme that States would qualify so long as they preserve evidence in a way \nsufficient to permit the testing provided for in their State statutes? \nFor example, if a State law provides a three year time limit on post-\nconviction DNA testing, a practice of preserving evidence throughout \nthose three years would qualify as ``reasonable'' under this \nlegislation. Thus, for example, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio and Utah \nwould qualify.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, that has been, and remains, my understanding.\n  Mr. HATCH. And mine as well.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, three years ago, Senator Smith, Senator \nCollins and I joined together to introduce the Innocence Protection \nAct, a modest and practical package of reforms aimed at reducing the \nrisk of error in capital cases. The reforms we proposed were designed \nto create a fairer system of justice, where the problems that have sent \ninnocent people to death row would not occur, and where victims and \ntheir families could be more certain of the accuracy, and finality, of \nthe results.\n  During the last Congress, the Innocence Protection Act gained \nenormous momentum, with 32 Senators and 250 Representatives--well over \nhalf the House--signed on in support. Hearings were held in each House, \nand a version of the bill was reported out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee by a bipartisan vote of 12 to 7. Now is the time to finish \nthe job and enact this important legislation.\n  I am pleased, today, to introduce the Innocence Protection Act of \n2003. This legislation is a piece of a larger bill called the Advancing \nJustice through DNA Technology Act of 2003, which provides an infusion \nof Federal funds to eliminate the current backlog of unanalyzed DNA \nsamples in the Nation's crime labs and to improve the capacity of \nFederal, State and local crime labs to conduct DNA analyses.\n  The Innocence Protection Act of 2003 proposes two critical reforms. \nFirst, it provides greater access to post-conviction DNA testing in \nappropriate cases, where it can help expose wrongful convictions, and \nauthorizes $25 million in grants over 5 years to help defray the costs \nof such testing. Second, the bill addresses what all the statistics and \nevidence show is the single most frequent cause of wrongful \nconvictions--inadequate defense representation at trial. By far the \nmost important reform we can undertake is to help States establish \nminimum standards of competency and funding for capital defense.\n  Other provisions of the Innocence Protection Act establish standards \nfor preserving biological evidence in criminal cases, and substantially \nincrease the maximum amount of compensation that may be awarded in \nFederal cases of wrongful conviction.\n  Today's Innocence Protection Act is a modified version of the bill \nthat the Senate Judiciary Committee approved last year. These \nmodifications follow many months of negotiation and deliberation, and \nwere made to build further on the groundswell of support for the bill, \nboth here on Capitol Hill and across America. More than ever, the bill \nis a collaborative product of which we all can be proud--an exercise of \nbipartisanship that is in the best tradition of the United States \nCongress.\n  I want to thank and commend the Senators and Representatives who \nworked so hard this summer and fall to come to agreement on a bill that \nwe can all strongly support.\n  First and foremost, I want to thank my partner in this endeavor, \nRepresentative Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts, who has worked \ntirelessly over many years to achieve this goal. I also want to thank \nour lead Republican sponsors in both houses, Senators Gordon Smith and \nSusan Collins, and Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois, all of whom \nhave been steadfast in their commitment to this effort.\n  The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin Hatch, deserves \nhigh praise for his leadership in our recent negotiations, as does the \nChairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Sensenbrenner, and I \nthank them both. Senator Hatch and I have debated these issues for \nyears. I have always appreciated his thoughtful approach and serious \ncommitment to improving the criminal justice system. Representative \nSensenbrenner played an instrumental role in this process and I do not \nbelieve we could have come so far without his dedication. In addition, \nI want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Senator Feinstein, who has \ndevoted countless hours over the years to reconciling the policy \ndifferences that prevented this legislation from moving forward.\n  I am sorry that Senator DeWine could not be with us earlier today to \nannounce the introduction of the bill, and appreciate his willingness \nto allow us to proceed. I have long worked with Senator DeWine on \nfunding important forensic science tools for law enforcement, and we \nare currently working on a proposal with regard to how the mentally \nretarded are treated by the criminal justice system. His leadership on \nthese issues is important and greatly appreciated.\n  Thanks, too, to the many members on both sides of the aisle, in the \nSenate and in the House, who have supported this legislation over the \nyears. Working together, we can finally begin to address the many \nproblems facing our capital punishment system.\n  Capital Representation Improvement Grants: I would like to take a \nmoment now to elaborate on the capital defense representation \nprovisions of the bill, both because they are the more important \nprovisions and because they have been the principal subject of the \nrecent revisions to the bill.\n  The new version of the Innocence Protection Act establishes a grant \nprogram for States to improve the systems by which they appoint and \ncompensate lawyers in death cases. States that authorize capital \npunishment may apply for these grants or not, as they wish. However, if \na State chooses to accept the money, it must open itself up to a set of \nrequirements designed to ensure that its system truly meets basic \nstandards. After all, the point of the bill is not to throw money at \nthe problem of inadequate representation; the point is to fix it.\n  Earlier versions of the Innocence Protection Act took more of a \n``carrot and stick'' approach to the counsel issue. The ``carrot'' was \nthe same as in the current version: millions of dollars in Federal \ngrants to help achieve adequate representation in capital cases. The \n``stick''--which is no longer in the bill--has evolved over the years. \nAt one\n\n[[Page S12299]]\n\ntime, we proposed that States that failed to meet basic competent \ncounsel standards would have their death sentences given less deference \nand subjected to more rigorous Federal court review. In some versions \nof the bill, non-complying States would also have forfeited some \nFederal prison grant funding over time. In the version that the \nJudiciary Committee approved last year, if a State chose not to \nparticipate in the new Federal grant program, the Attorney General \nwould award the money to one or more defender organizations within the \nState, to be used for capital defense work.\n\n  Each of these various mechanisms would have helped ensure cooperation \non the part of the States, and I am disappointed that I was unable to \nprevail upon my colleagues to include any one of them. Still, I believe \nthat the current formulation is a good first step and will make a \ndifference, provided that the grant program is fully funded and that \nthe States which are most in need of reform elect to participate.\n  As reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, the bill \naimed to ensure full funding of the counsel program by providing that, \nif Congress failed to appropriate sufficient funding for the program, \nup to 10 percent of the Byrne block grant would be used for this \npurpose. I regret that this provision has been dropped from the bill; \nit seemed to me a good way to express our commitment to ensuring that \nthe program is funded. However, given the tremendous support for this \nlegislation in both houses, and on both sides of the aisle, I am \nconfident that Congress will speak with one voice in ensuring that our \nyears of effort are not undermined by a failure to appropriate the \nmoney needed to make this legislation effective.\n  Getting States to participate in the program may be more difficult. \nIndeed, the States that are in most need of reform may be the least \ninclined to participate, given that they will have the most to do to \nbring their indigent defense systems into compliance with the terms and \nconditions of the grant. While I am hopeful that States will want to \nimprove their systems, and will welcome the infusion of Federal funds \nfor this purpose, Congress will need to monitor this program carefully \nto ensure that it is meeting its stated objective of improving the \nquality of legal representation provided to indigent defendants in \nState capital cases and, if it is not, to take additional remedial \naction.\n  Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program: We have \nalso established a $25 million grant program to help defray the costs \nof post-conviction DNA testing. This program is named in honor of Kirk \nBloodsworth, the first death row inmate to be exonerated by DNA \ntesting.\n  I first met Kirk in February 2000, when he came to me as a man who \nhad been exonerated after almost nine years of wrongful imprisonment. I \nam proud to say that we have become close friends and partners in the \nfight to reform capital punishment in America. I am also delighted that \nKirk can finally feel truly free. Just a few weeks ago, the State of \nMaryland charged another man with the crime for which Kirk was \nconvicted and sentenced to death, after prosecutors finally ran the DNA \nevidence in the case through the DNA database. The prosecutor who sent \nKirk to death row, and who had previously refused to acknowledge his \ninnocence, went to his home to apologize to him.\n  Kirk Bloodsworth's battle to prove his own innocence has been won. \nBut his nightmare of wrongful conviction has been repeated again and \nagain across the country. Since the reinstatement of capital punishment \nin the 1970s, more than 110 individuals who were convicted and \nsentenced to death have been released from death row with evidence of \ntheir innocence, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. In \naddition, since the introduction of forensic DNA typing into the legal \nsystem in the early 1990s, many more individuals who were sentenced to \nlong terms of imprisonment have been exonerated by post-conviction DNA \ntesting. The Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program \nwill help assist others who have experienced wrongful conviction.\n  Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program: As I noted earlier, this \nversion of the Innocence Protection Act is being introduced as part of \na larger package of criminal justice reforms, titled the Advancing \nJustice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003, which will substantially \nincrease Federal resources available to State and local governments to \ncombat crimes with DNA technology. Among other things, this legislation \ncreates the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, which authorizes \n$755 million over the next five years to reduce the current backlog of \nunanalyzed DNA samples in the Nation's crime labs.\n  I have worked with the proponents of this program to revise the \nallocation formula, so that each State is guaranteed a minimum \nallocation of .50 percent of the total amount appropriated in a fiscal \nyear. This will make the program fair for all States, including smaller \nStates like Vermont.\n  As DNA testing has moved to the front lines of the war on crime, \nforensic laboratories nationwide have experienced a significant \nincrease in their caseloads, both in number and complexity. Funding has \nsimply not kept pace with this increasing demand, and forensic labs \nnationwide are now seriously bottlenecked.\n  Backlogs have seriously impeded the use of DNA testing in solving \ncases without suspects--and reexamining cases in which there are strong \nclaims of innocence--as labs are required to give priority status to \nthose cases in which a suspect is known. Solely for lack of funding, \ncritical evidence remains untested while rapists and killers remain at \nlarge. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program will give States the \nhelp they desperately need to carry out DNA analyses of backlogged \nevidence, and I strongly support its passage and full funding.\n  Expansion of the Paul Coverdell Forensic Sciences Improvement Grant \nProgram: The bill also expands and extends for another three years an \nexisting grant program, named after our late colleague, Senator Paul \nCoverdell. Congress passed the Paul Coverdell National Forensic \nSciences Improvement Act three years ago, with the goal of improving \nthe quality and timeliness of State and local forensic science \nservices. I was proud to cosponsor that legislation, and have worked \nsince its passage to secure full funding for the grant program it \nestablishes. Unfortunately, despite my efforts and those of other \nMembers, and notwithstanding the urgent pleas of lab directors \nnationwide, the President has never requested funding for Paul \nCoverdell grants, and Congress has never appropriated sufficient funds \nto make the program effective. The legislation we introduce today \nrenews our commitment to this important initiative.\n  Our bill also expands the purposes for which Paul Coverdell grants \nmay be used, to include the elimination of a non-DNA forensic evidence \nbacklog. The need for this measure was highlighted earlier this year at \na subcommittee hearing on funding forensic sciences. Witness after \nwitness testified that DNA evidence is not the only evidence that is \ngoing untested for lack of resources. Crime labs are also facing \nsubstantial backlogs with respect to other types of forensic science \nevidence, including firearms, latent prints, controlled substances, \ntoxicology, trace evidence, questionable documents, and forensic \npathology. We need to ensure that our labs are equipped to address the \nfull range of issues that they are called upon to handle.\n  We have had a constructive debate. We have shown that the death \npenalty system is broken, and we have built a bipartisan coalition \nsupporting reforms. It is now time to act. Our bill reflects a \nprincipled consensus on the most basic and essential reforms; it raises \nno serious constitutional or law enforcement concerns; it will improve \ncriminal justice in America considerably; and it may well save innocent \nlives. I am therefore proud to sponsor it, and I urge its speedy \npassage into law.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/01/senate-section/article/S12300-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12300]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 237--WELCOMING THE PUBLIC APOLOGIES ISSUED BY THE \nPRESIDENT OF SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF \n   CROATIA AND URGING OTHER LEADERS IN THE REGION TO PERFORM SIMILAR \n                    CONCRETE ACTS OF RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Biden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n                              S.

Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Alexander) proposed an \namendment to the bill S. 1689, making emergency supplemental \nappropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan security and reconstruction for \nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.    COMMENDING THE ARMED FORCES FOR EFFORTS IN OPERATION \n                   ENDURING FREEDOM AND OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.\n\n       Recognizing and commending the members of the United States \n     Armed Forces and their leaders, and the allies of the United \n     States and their armed forces, who participated in Operation \n     Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom \n     in Iraq and recognizing the continuing dedication of military \n     families and employers and defense civilians and contractors \n     and the countless communities and patriotic organizations \n     that lent their support to the Armed Forces during those \n     operations.\n       Whereas the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the \n     United States, which killed thousands of people from the \n     United States and other countries in New York, Virginia, and \n     Pennsylvania, inaugurated the Global War on Terrorism;\n       Whereas the intelligence community quickly identified Al \n     Qaeda as a terrorist organization with global reach and the \n     President determined that United States national security \n     required the elimination of the Al Qaeda terrorist \n     organization;\n       Whereas the Taliban regime of Afghanistan had long harbored \n     Al Qaeda, providing members of that organization a safe haven \n     from which to attack the United States and its friends and \n     allies, and the refusal of that regime to discontinue its \n     support for international terrorism and surrender Al Qaeda's \n     leaders to the United States made it a threat to \n     international peace and security;\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein and his regime's longstanding \n     sponsorship of international terrorism, active pursuit of \n     weapons of mass destruction, use of such weapons against \n     Iraq's own citizens and neighboring countries, aggression \n     against Iraq's neighbors, and brutal repression of Iraq's \n     population made Saddam Hussein and his regime a threat to \n     international peace and security;\n       Whereas the United States pursued sustained diplomatic, \n     political, and economic efforts to remove those threats \n     peacefully;\n       Whereas on October 7, 2001, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations \n     in Afghanistan, designated as Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     that quickly caused the collapse of the Taliban regime, the \n     elimination of Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure, and \n     the capture of significant and numerous members of Al Qaeda;\n       Whereas on March 19, 2003, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations, \n     designated as Operation Iraqi Freedom, that quickly caused \n     the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, the elimination of \n     Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, the end of Iraq's illicit \n     and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass \n     destruction, and the capture of significant international \n     terrorists;\n       Whereas in those campaigns in the Global War on Terrorism, \n     as of September 27, 2003, nearly 165,000 members of the \n     United States Armed Forces, comprised of active, reserve, and \n     National Guard members and units, had mobilized for Operation \n     Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       Whereas success in those two campaigns in the Global War on \n     Terrorism would not have been possible without the \n     dedication, courage, and service of the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and the military and irregular forces of \n     the friends and allies of the United States;\n       Whereas the support, love, and commitment from the families \n     of United States service personnel participating in those two \n     operations as well as that of the communities and patriotic \n     organizations which provided support through the United \n     Services Organization (USO), Operation Dear Abby, and \n     Operation UpLink, helped to sustain those service personnel \n     and enabled them to eliminate significant threats to United \n     States national security while liberating oppressed peoples \n     from dictatorial regimes;\n       Whereas the civilian employees of the Department of \n     Defense, through their hard work an dedication, enabled \n     United States military forces to quickly and effectively \n     achieve the United States military missions in Afghanistan \n     and Iraq;\n       Whereas the commitment of companies making their employees \n     available for military service, the creativity and initiative \n     of contractors equipping the Nation's Armed Forces with the \n     best and most modern equipment, and the ingenuity of service \n     companies assisting with the global overseas deployment of \n     the Armed Forces demonstrates that the entrepreneurial spirit \n     of the United States is an extraordinarily valuable defense \n     asset; and\n       Whereas the Nation should pause to recognize with \n     appropriate tributes and days of remembrance the sacrifice of \n     those members of the Armed Forces who died or were wounded in \n     Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, as \n     well as all who served in or supported either of those \n     operations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Therefore, the Senate\n       (1) conveys its deepest sympathy and condolences to the \n     families and friends of the members of United States and \n     coalition forces who have been injured, wounded, or killed \n     during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       (2) commends President George W. Bush, Secretary of Defense \n     Donald H. Rumsfeld, and United States Central Command \n     Commander General Tommy Franks, Unites\n\n[[Page S12301]]\n\n     States Army, for their planning and execution of enormously \n     successful military campaigns in Operation Enduring Freedom \n     and Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       (3) expresses its highest commendation and most sincere \n     appreciation to the members of the United States Armed Forces \n     who participated in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom;\n       (4) commends the Department of Defense civilian employees \n     and the defense contractor personnel whose skills made \n     possible the equipping of the greatest Armed Force in the \n     annals of modern military endeavor;\n       (5) supports the efforts of communities across the Nation--\n       (A) to prepare appropriate homecoming ceremonies to honor \n     and welcome home the members of the Armed Forces \n     participating in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and to recognize their contributions to United \n     States homeland security and to the Global War on Terrorism; \n     and\n       (B) to prepare appropriate ceremonies to commemorate with \n     tributes and days of remembrance the service and sacrifice of \n     those service members killed or wounded during those \n     operations;\n       (6) expresses the deep gratitude of the Nation to the 21 \n     steadfast allies in Operation Enduring Freedom and to the 49 \n     coalition members in Operation Iraqi Freedom, especially the \n     United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, whose forces, support, \n     and contributions were invaluable and unforgettable; and\n       (7) recommits the United States to ensuring the safety of \n     the United States homeland, to preventing weapons of mass \n     destruction from reaching the hands of terrorists, and to \n     helping the people of Iraq and Afghanistan build free and \n     vibrant democratic societies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1796.
