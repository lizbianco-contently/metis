Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 2 p.m. At this juncture, I ask unanimous consent \nthat we extend morning business, with the time equally divided, until 3 \np.m. today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. At 3 p.m. the Senate will resume consideration of the \nmotion to proceed to S. 1072, the highway funding bill. Last week we \nattempted to reach a consent agreement to begin consideration of the \nhighway bill today. Unfortunately, there was an objection to \nproceeding; therefore, I filed cloture on the motion to proceed. That \ncloture vote will occur at 5:45 p.m. today. I hope cloture will be \ninvoked and the Senate will be able to begin consideration of this \nimportant bill this evening. This is a major piece of legislation which \nwill not only secure America's infrastructure but also create jobs. \nThere will be a lot of discussion and debate. I anticipate that this \nbill will take both this week and next week--that is the next 2 weeks--\nto complete.\n  Having said that, we need to begin the debate and allow the Senate to \nwork its will on the amendments offered. Several of the committees are \ncontinuing their efforts on their respective pieces of this highway \nbill today and tomorrow, but that should not delay us from beginning to \nconsider this important measure. As I have said, there will be adequate \ntime to consider this bill on the floor, and Members will have the \nopportunity to offer amendments.\n  On another subject, last week the Senate passed the pension rate \nreform bill by a large bipartisan vote of 86 to 9. The vote in the \nHouse on their version of the bill was 397 to 2. Now it is time for us \nto appoint conferees and to go to conference to reconcile the \ndifferences. The Senate bill has been passed. The House bill has been \npassed.\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\nNow we want to appoint conferees so we can go to conference and \nreconcile those differences.\n  Unfortunately, there has been an objection on the other side of the \naisle to proceeding. I again urge the Democratic leadership to allow us \nto appoint conferees so we can begin the process. The large bipartisan \nvote on passage of this legislation in this body as well as in the \nHouse indicates we are all willing to work together, and I hope we can \ncontinue and progress toward a conference of agreement.\n  On another note, I remind my colleagues that on Wednesday of this \nweek, President Aznar of Spain will address a joint meeting of \nCongress. President Aznar will begin his speech at 11 a.m. Therefore, \nMembers are asked to gather in the Senate Chamber at 10:40 so that we \nmay leave as a body for the House Chamber to hear that address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S336-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IMPORTANCE OF S. 1072\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ncomment on the importance of proceeding to the highway bill which will \nbe the focus of this institution over the next 2 weeks. At 5:45 today \nwe will have the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the highway \nbill. I do hope cloture will be invoked and we will be able to begin \nconsideration of this vitally important bill.\n  In the next few moments, I want to share why I believe this bill is \nso important to us, to the American people and, thus, we need to invoke \ncloture. There is broad support for this legislation here in the Senate \nas well as all across America. We will spend the next couple of weeks \nconsidering it on the Senate floor. A number of Senate committees are \ninvolved in this important bill, including the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, the Commerce Committee, the Banking Committee, the \nFinance Committee--all have vital and critical pieces of this bill. We \nwill work through their various committee amendments over the next 2 \nweeks.\n  It is key that we focus our full attention on this legislation. \nAmerica's transportation infrastructure is crucial to our vibrant \neconomy, to our growing economy today. America is interlaced with over \n4 million miles of roads and highways. Our transportation \ninfrastructure is estimated to be worth more than $1.75 trillion. The \ninterstate highway system has often been called the greatest public \nworks project in history. Every $1 billion we invest in transportation \ninfrastructure generates more than $2 billion in economic activity and \ncreates more than 47,000 new jobs.\n  Our roads, our ports, our railroads are vital to America's economic \nsuccess. We know this well in my home State of Tennessee where \ncompanies such as Federal Express, Averitt Express, and U.S. Express \nare located. The success of these companies is dependent on the quality \nof our Nation's infrastructure.\n  Around the Nation, America's transportation infrastructure is \ndeteriorating badly and becoming painfully overcrowded. America's roads \nespecially are not keeping up. You can ask any American commuter. There \nis bumper-to-bumper traffic, not just during rush hour but all day \nlong. Indeed, in our Nation's urban areas, traffic delays have more \nthan tripled over the past 20 years. That is not just in the larger \ncities--New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles. In Raleigh-Durham, commuting \ntime has gone up nearly 25 percent in 10 years. In Charlotte, traffic \ncongestion has added 39 additional commuting hours per year, the \nequivalent of nearly an entire week stuck in traffic.\n  In Tennessee, traffic congestion has increased in all our major \nmetropolitan areas. In my hometown of Nashville, commuters drive an \naverage of 32 miles per day. Metropolitan planning organizations are \nstruggling to meet demand.\n  It is estimated that Americans suffer through more than 3.6 billion \nhours in delays and waste over 5.7 billion gallons of fuel per year \njust sitting in traffic. These transportation delays ripple through our \nNation's economic sector and result in lost productivity, lost wages, \nand lost jobs.\n  We cannot ask our fellow citizens to join the great American \nworkforce and then stand idly by while our roads decay and that daily \ncommute to work stretches from minutes into hours. It is a jobs issue. \nThis bill is a quality-of-life issue, and it is a serious safety issue \nas well. More time on the road translates into more accidents; 41,000 \ntravelers are killed each year on our worsening roads, and over 3 \nmillion people are injured.\n  As our highways become more and more congested, drivers begin to take \nalternate routes on town streets, which we know exposes them to even \ngreater danger. Passing the highway bill is lifesaving. It will save an \nestimated 4,000 lives each year by simply improving our roads and \neducating the public about road safety. In Tennessee, our State highway \ndepartment is investing in measures to reduce traffic-related \nfatalities. States across the country will need additional resources to \nmake similar improvements.\n  Passing the highway bill will also improve the mass transit system \nthat is so vital to our thriving urban centers. With new and modernized \nvehicles and facilities, mass transit is gaining in popularity. The \nDepartment of Transportation reports that from 1997 to 2000, passenger \nmileage on mass transit increased by 125 percent. More people are using \ntrains more frequently not just to get to work but to run errands and \nto travel. Passenger mileage on trains has gone up 16 percent. But like \nour roads, our transit system is not keeping up. Average rail operating \nspeeds have actually declined since 1997 as trains are older and we are \nusing slower rail systems. As daily commuters can testify, trains are \ngetting more and more crowded as well.\n  The Department of Transportation warns that as the Nation's \npopulation continues to increase and more people live in urban areas, \nthe need for investment in transit infrastructure will continue to \ngrow.\n  Finally, the bill we have before us that we will begin to consider is \nthe result of a long bipartisan process. It is based on more than 2 \nyears of work, including 13 hearings and testimony from over 100 \nwitnesses. The highway bill is a fair and comprehensive package that \nwill benefit the entire Nation. From highways and bridges to bike \npaths, this bill will make our transportation safer, more efficient, \nand will stimulate job creation. Indeed, it is estimated that the \nhighway bill under consideration will add a whopping 2 million jobs to \nthe economy.\n  Our vast and interconnecting highways are emblematic of our great \nAmerican spirit, our love of adventure, and our drive toward the \nunknown. Our highways, our bridges, our roads, our ports, and our \ntrains are in fact very much the physical expression of the very name \nwe bear, uniting the States of America. I urge my colleagues to take \nswift action to pass this legislation. We must work together to \ncontinue to move America forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S336-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

But I hope that in spite of the differences \nthere may be with regard to allocation, priorities, and policy, we can \nfind a way to work together on this bill and complete our work perhaps \nas early as a week from this coming Friday. I think it is doable.\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\n  I have pledged to the distinguished majority leader that we are going \nto do all we can to complete our work in that timeframe.

Mr. President, I congratulate a South Dakota native, \nAdam Vinatieri, on yet another Super Bowl-winning field goal.\n  These are the kinds of heroics South Dakotans and New England Patriot \nfans have come to expect from Adam. Growing up in Rapid City, Adam \nlettered in football, soccer, track, and wrestling for the Central High \nSchool Cobblers. He was a 4-year letterman as a place-kicker at my alma \nmater, the South Dakota State University Jackrabbits.

Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence during most of the 107th Congress, I \nworked with colleagues from the House and Senate to accept the \nresponsibility of reviewing the horrific events that struck our \nNation's symbols of commerce and security on September 11, 2001, \nclaiming the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans. From New York City and \nthe Pentagon to a field in rural Pennsylvania, 9-11 demonstrated the \nvulnerabilities of our free society.\n  But in my view, and after the careful review of the Intelligence \nCommittees, the most tragic aspect of this day never to be forgotten is \nthat it could have been prevented. Had our intelligence agencies been \nbetter organized and more focused on the problem of international \nterrorism--particularly Osama bin Laden--September 11th would have been \nprevented.\n  I also have concluded that, had the President and the Congress \ninitiated the reforms that our joint inquiry recommended, we might well \nhave avoided the embarrassment of the flawed intelligence on weapons of \nmass destruction--or the misleading use of that intelligence--which \nformed the basis of our war against Iraq.\n  Surely, the people of America would be safer today had these reforms \nbeen undertaken.\n  So today, and in remarks in the next 2 days, I would like to review \nwith my colleagues the conclusions of the House-Senate joint inquiry.\n  We have learned that intelligence failures played a central role in \nthe events of 9-11. Let me illustrate some of those failures:\n  The Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, was tracking two of the \nhijackers and knew that they had been to a summit meeting of terrorists \nin Malaysia in early January of 2000. However, the CIA failed to inform \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, FAA, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, \nor Customs officials that these individuals were on their way to the \nUnited States. The result is that when they arrived on a commercial \nairliner in the United States in order to execute their dastardly plan, \nthey were welcomed into our country by unwitting entry agents.\n  These same two hijackers were living with an FBI asset, but the \ninformant failed to ask basic questions. Others in the FBI recognized \nthe danger of Islamic extremists using airplanes as weapons of mass \ndestruction, but their warnings were ignored by superiors. Still others \nfailed to understand the legal avenues available to them that may have \nallowed available investigative techniques to be used to avert the 9-11 \nplot.\n  Current national security strategy demands more accurate intelligence \nthan ever before:\n\n       Terrorists must be found before their strikes. This will \n     require intelligence agents capable of penetrating their \n     cells to provide intelligence early enough to frustrate the \n     terrorists' intentions;\n       If preventive or pre-emptive military actions are to be a \n     central part of our national security strategy, to maintain \n     its credibility of those actions with the American people and \n     the world, will require the support of the most credible \n     intelligence;\n       If we are to frustrate the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, America must provide an intelligence capability \n     for all of those regions of the world which are suspect.\n\n  Now, as never before, intelligence matters.\n  In responding to the events of 9-11, Congress created a joint \ncommittee consisting of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. A \nbipartisan, bicameral panel of this type had never before been formed \nin the 213 years of the U.S. Congress. Our effort reflected the unique \ncircumstances and the national unity we all felt in the immediate \naftermath of 9-11.\n  One of the principal reasons for conducting the inquiry in this way \nwas to give our recommendations the maximum credibility, above the \nusual cries of partisanship that frequently taint the work of \ncongressional committees. The importance of our task cannot be \nunderstated. We sought to identify the problems in the intelligence \ncommunity that allowed the 9-11 attacks to go undetected and propose \nsolutions to those problems.\n  In the end, we were successful in identifying the problems because we \nall understood how much was at stake and that our enemy would not rest \nwhile we attempted to fix our problems. We were less successful in \nsecuring consideration of the solutions from the intelligence agencies, \nthe White House, and the Congress.\n  The fact that we conducted this bipartisan, bicameral inquiry and \nsubmitted recommendations creates a new heightened level of \ncongressional responsibility. If the terrorists are successful in \nanother attack in the United States, the American people will demand to \nknow what the institutions of government learned from 9-11, and how the \nintelligence agencies, the White House, and the Congress used that \nknowledge to harden the United States against future terrorist attacks. \nCongress was largely able to avoid accountability for 9-11. Mark my \nwords: There will be no avoidance of responsibility for the next \nattack.\n  There will be no avoiding responsibility for the President. September \n11, 2001, was a wake up call--it told us we had severe deficiencies in \nour intelligence community. If 9-11 was a wake up call, the failure to \nfind weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a report card on how far \nwe have come since 9-11 in correcting the problems in our intelligence \ncommunity. The grade we received on that report card is F. The \nPresident and Congress have failed to initiate the reforms recommended \nby a series of review panels and our bipartisan, bicameral joint \ncommittee of inquiry.\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\n  This failure of the President and the Congress has contributed to yet \nanother intelligence failure.\n  What troubles me more than the President's unwillingness to make the \nnecessary changes is his unwillingness to even admit that our Nation \nhas a problem. Just last week, the President responded to questions \nabout the inaccuracies of his statements about Iraq's WMD capability by \nsaying he has ``great confidence in our intelligence community.'' How \ncan he have great confidence in our intelligence community after it has \nbeen proven confused before September 11 and completely wrong on the \nthreat posed by Iraq?\n  The expected appointment by the President of a commission to review \nthe intelligence on which the war in Iraq was predicated is not an \nexcuse to delay reform of America's intelligence community. Rather, I \nam concerned that it appears as though the goal is simply to avoid \npolitical accountability and embarrassment. America continues to be in \na state of denial. A White House aide was quoted over the weekend as \nsaying, ``We cannot afford another one of those''--referring to the \npublic outcry after the misstatement of intelligence in the 2003 State \nof the Union speech.\n  It has now been more than a year since the joint inquiry made its \nrecommendations. This is a good time to review the progress made in \nimplementing those recommendations and to identify critical areas of \nreform that have not yet been addressed. Unfortunately, this is not \ngoing to be a report card that we would like to show to our parents--or \nto our voters. There has been little accomplished with regard to most \nof the recommendations.\n  The joint inquiry report made nineteen recommendations for reform. \nToday I would like to discuss those recommendations that fall into the \ncategory of specific actions to combat terrorism.\n  In speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday, I will deal with those that \ninvolve intelligence community reform and those that deal with the FBI \nand the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act process.\n  Of the nineteen recommendations, there are six that contain specific \nactions to combat terrorism. Recommendation No. 2 directs ``the \nNational Security Council to expedite their efforts to examine and \nrevamp existing intelligence priorities.'' It further directs the \nPresident to ``take action to ensure that clear, consistent, and \ncurrent priorities are established and enforced throughout the \nIntelligence Community. Once established, these priorities should be \nreviewed and updated on at least an annual basis to ensure that the \nallocation of Intelligence Community resources reflects and effectively \naddresses the continually evolving threat environment. Finally, the \nestablishment of Intelligence Community priorities, and the \njustification for such priorities, should be reported to the House and \nSenate Intelligence Committees on an annual basis.''\n  It was very clear from the work of the joint inquiry that the \nintelligence community had not adapted or changed its intelligence \npriorities to reflect the changing nature of the world. While some \nmodifications had been made since the end of the Cold War, our \nintelligence priorities remained states like Russia, China, Iran and \nIraq. In spite of the fact that George Tenet, the Director of Central \nIntelligence, had declared war on al-Qaida in 1998, al-Qaida was not at \nor even near the top of the intelligence priority list on September 11, \n2001. Only on September 12, 2001, did al-Qaida become priority number \none.\n  It was also clear from our investigation that there was no formal \nprocess for regularly updating and reviewing intelligence priorities to \nensure that they reflected changes in the security environment. \nBureaucratic inertia worked to keep old priorities on the list long \nafter they should have dropped down in favor of emerging threats. While \nGeorge Tenet may have recognized that non-state actors like al-Qaida \nneeded more attention, this was not widely known or accepted throughout \nthe Intelligence Community that he heads. When asked if he was aware \nthat George Tenet had declared war on al-Qaida in 1998, a former \ndirector of the National Security Agency, NSA, our Nation's electronic \neavesdropping agency, responded that yes, he was aware that George \nTenet had said that, but he did not think it applied to him or his \norganization.\n  A formal process that was clearly understood throughout our \ngovernment would have prevented some of the problems we identified. One \nexample involves the Predator unmanned aerial vehicle, a pilotless \ndrone capable of long-duration flight and armed with high resolution \ncameras and an ability to fire missiles at targets on the ground. The \nPredator has proven to be one of the most effective intelligence \ncollection assets we have in the war on terror. Unfortunately, it took \nfar too long to build the Predator because of internal disputes in the \nadministration. This type of aircraft was not a priority for the Air \nForce and its production was therefore delayed several months. The lack \nof established and accepted intelligence priorities was a major cause \nof the delay in fielding the Predator.\n  This issue of setting new priorities was also raised by the National \nCommission on National Security in the 21st Century, also known as the \nHart-Rudman Commission. This Commission, which issued its final report \nin February of 2001, included a recommendation that ``the President \norder the setting of national intelligence priorities through National \nSecurity Council guidance to the Director of Central Intelligence.''\n  Unfortunately, at the time the Joint Inquiry issued its report almost \n2 full years after the Hart-Rudman Commission had made its \nrecommendation sufficient progress had not been made in setting \nnational intelligence priorities. Therefore, we included a \nrecommendation on this point. Our investigation determined that the \nfailure to have clear, consistent and current intelligence priorities \nthat were understood by the entire intelligence community was a \nsignificant contributing factor to the failure of intelligence on 9-11.\n  Since the joint inquiry issued its report, some progress has been \nmade in establishing a systematic process for establishing intelligence \npriorities. However, it is not clear that these priorities are being \ncommunicated to the domestic intelligence agencies responsible for our \nsecurity here at home.\n  Recommendation No. 3 focuses its directive on the counter terrorism \ncomponents of the intelligence, military, law enforcement, and homeland \nsecurity agencies, which will be key in counter terrorism. This \nrecommendation directs the National Security Council to ``prepare, for \nthe President's approval, a U.S. government-wide strategy for combating \nterrorism, both at home and abroad, including the growing terrorism \nthreat posed by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nassociated technologies.''\n  There should be an intelligence component of this strategy that \nidentifies domestic and foreign based threat levels, programs, plans \nand budgets to address the threat posed by Osama bin Laden and al-\nQaida, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other international terrorist groups. The \nstrategy should include specific efforts to improve human intelligence, \nbetter utilize technology to analyze and share data, enhance domestic \nintelligence, maximize the effective use of covert action, which is \naction taken by the United States Government where the role of the \nUnited States is hidden, develop programs to deal with terrorist \nfinancing, and facilitate the ability of CIA and military special \noperations forces to conduct joint operations against terrorist \ntargets.\n  The joint inquiry found that there was no commonly agreed-upon \napproach among the federal agencies for dealing with terrorism. Each \nagency or department seemed to have its own ideas about fighting \nterrorism, and they were all independent actors. Success in the war on \nterror will require a coherent, coordinated effort that can only be \naccomplished by having everyone work toward a common goal outlined in a \nnational strategy. Prior to 9-11, the CIA was trying, albeit \nunsuccessfully, to penetrate foreign terrorist organizations and \ndisrupt their operations. Unfortunately at the FBI, fighting the war on \nterror meant calculating the threat by counting the number of known \nterrorists, not how many were estimated to have been placed in American \ncommunities. The FBI was waiting for acts of terror to occur and then \ntrying to arrest and convict the guilty party.\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\n  The need for a national strategy to combat terrorism has been the \nsubject of several other commission reports. The Gilmore Commission, \nalso known as the Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response \nCapabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, in \nits second report in December of 2000, recommended that ``the next \nPresident should develop and present to the Congress a national \nstrategy for combating terrorism within one year of assuming office.''\n  The broad recommendation to develop a national strategy, as well as \nwhat should be included as specific components of that strategy, is \nbroadly supported by virtually everyone who has analyzed our \nintelligence capabilities.\n  In addition to the recommendation of the Gilmore Commission calling \nfor a national strategy to combat terrorism, other commissions have \nmade recommendations that are consistent with the full joint inquiry \nrecommendation on developing a national strategy. For instance, the \nHart-Rudman Commission, the Gilmore Commission, and the Bremer \nCommission, also known as the National Commission on Terrorism, in its \nreport of June 2000, all made recommendations calling for improving and \nintensifying our human intelligence efforts with respect to terrorism.\n  We should remember that until the hijackers stood up on those four \nairplanes and took control, it was as if their plot had been \nundetected. It was as if their conspiracy represented no violations of \nAmerican laws or regulations. Good intelligence is our principle line \nof defense against these types of terrorist plots. Only by penetrating \nthese organizations and by bringing together all available raw \nintelligence into cohesive analytical products will we ever be able to \nfeel confident that we can avoid future tragedies. That is the only way \nwe will get the timely, accurate intelligence that is required to \ndisrupt sophisticated modern terrorist organizations like al-Qaida. \nImproving our human intelligence capability must be Job Number One in \nresponding to global terrorists.\n  Penetrating these organizations will require a new, more aggressive \nhuman intelligence capability. Osama and his cohorts are unlikely to \nturn up at an embassy cocktail party. We must be capable of getting \nhuman sources close to the leaders of these organizations. John Walker \nLindh was a misguided California college student who became a member of \nal-Qaida and even met Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, John Walker Lindh \ndid not work for the CIA.\n  The Bremer Commission includes a recommendation to increase funding \nfor technology development to exploit terrorist communications, and \ndevotes an entire section to improving efforts to attack terrorist \nfinancing. The Gilmore Commission recommends improving technological \napplications to enhance analysis and dissemination, as well as \nimproving domestic intelligence collection.\n  In response to the good work done by the Gilmore Commission and the \nrecommendation of our Joint Inquiry, a national strategy to combat \nterrorism was issued by the Bush Administration in February of 2003. It \nis difficult to understand how a President who claims that defeating \nterrorism is the principle mission of his presidency took 17 months to \nproduce a strategy to accomplish that mission. And even the strategy \nthat was produced is inadequate when it comes to defining the \nintelligence components of that strategy. Instead, it calls on the \nintelligence community to review its capabilities and make \nrecommendations for improvement. Why would it take 17 months to task \nthe intelligence community to do such an assessment?\n\n  The strategy that was produced after this long delay does not meet \nthe requirements published in the recommendation of the joint inquiry. \nThe Bush administration's strategy is not so much a strategy as a list \nof objectives. What is lacking is clear guidance on how we can achieve \nthese objectives. What is also lacking is a level of specificity that \nwill allow all agencies in our government to work towards this common \nset of priorities and goals through the common strategy.\n  Recommendation No. 4 calls for the establishment of a National \nIntelligence Officer for Terrorism on the National Intelligence \nCouncil. The National Intelligence Council works directly for the \nDirector of Central Intelligence and is responsible for providing \ncoordinated analysis of foreign policy issues for the President and \nother senior policymakers. To date, no such position has been \nestablished. The lack of a central coordinator for terrorism analysis \nhas been a continuing shortcoming in the Intelligence Community. While \nthere are some outstanding individuals doing analysis on terrorism in \nseveral of the intelligence community's component organizations, there \nis no single focal point for policymakers to direct analytical requests \non terrorism.\n  A more recent example of the need for an NIO for Terrorism is the \ndebate over Iraq's connection to al-Qaida. While the CIA consistently \nreported that they had uncovered no reliable evidence of any links \nbetween Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida, others in the government--\nparticularly at the Defense Department and the White House--made \nrepeated statements about a solid link. Implementing this \nrecommendation would give us a point of ultimate accountability.\n  The joint inquiry found that there was some confusion as to who to go \nto with intelligence queries on terrorism, and there was no arbiter \nwithin the community to help reconcile various approaches or \nconflicting analyses of terrorism. We found too much mis-communication \nand an inability to identify who was responsible with regard to \nterrorism analysis. There was no individual who could coordinate a \nNational Intelligence Estimate on terrorism, something that may have \nhelped bring the seriousness of the threat posed by al-Qaida to members \nof the intelligence community outside of CIA. A National Intelligence \nEstimate is the highest level of intelligence analysis produced by the \nintelligence community and represents the best estimate of the entire \nintelligence community.\n  Without the establishment of this position, there is also a lack of \noutreach to academia and the private sector on terrorism issues, \nsomething that is needed in this critical fight. We have national \nintelligence officers for each geographic region as well as several \ncrosscutting issues, such as conventional military issues, strategic \nand nuclear programs, and economics and global issues. It is a sign of \nthe continuing lack of organizational restructuring to deal with the \nterrorist threat that we still have no national intelligence officer \nfor terrorism, yet we have one for economics. This should not be very \nhard to do, yet one full year after issuing our recommendations it has \nnot been done.\n  Recommendation No. 18 of the joint inquiry report calls on Congress \nand the administration to ensure the full development within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security of an effective all-source terrorism \ninformation fusion center. This center should have full access to all \nterrorism related intelligence and data, participate in the \nintelligence requirements process, and ``integrate intelligence \ninformation to identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist \nthreats to the United States in light of actual and potential \nvulnerabilities.''\n  One example of an intelligence fusion center that functions \neffectively is the Joint Interagency Task Force South in Key West, \nFlorida. This organization fuses intelligence information from a wide \nvariety of sources in a single facility which is jointly manned by \nmilitary, law enforcement, intelligence and foreign government \nofficials. What makes this organization particularly effective is that \nit is able to directly control operational activity to respond \nimmediately to the intelligence it gathers. If it identifies a ship \ntraveling toward the United States that it believes is carrying illegal \nnarcotics, it can direct a Coast Guard vessel to intercept and search \nthat ship.\n  The failure to bring together all the available intelligence on \nterrorism and to analyze it in a way that is most useful in preventing \nattacks was most evident in our inquiry. The FBI had smart agents \nworking in field offices throughout the country who identified \ntroubling trends, such as an unusual interest in flight training among \nsome foreign visitors. Unfortunately, the FBI was not organized in a \nway that allowed all intelligence on terrorism to go to a central \nlocation so that it could\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\nbe analyzed as a whole. That problem was compounded by the fact that \nthere was little to no information sharing between the FBI, responsible \nfor counter-terrorism within the United States, and the CIA, \nresponsible for foreign intelligence collection outside the United \nStates of America. Too much fell through the cracks.\n  This recommendation was directly supported by the legislation, passed \nby Congress and signed by the President, that established the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. That legislation authorized an \nintelligence component in the new Department to do exactly as was \nrecommended by the joint inquiry, including the requirement that this \nnew intelligence component have full access to available intelligence \ninformation. Senators Shelby, Lieberman, and Thompson deserve \nparticular credit for their efforts to ensure that the new Department \nof Homeland Security have a robust intelligence organization. The \nintelligence component of the Department of Homeland Security was \nenvisioned to be the one place where our domestic vulnerabilities are \nevaluated and mapped against all threats to the homeland. The idea was \nthat the threats could come from a variety of sources, not just \nterrorists, and one agency needed to be responsible for having the \nentire picture on its radar screen.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has chosen to gut the intelligence \nfunction at the Department of Homeland Security. The position of \ndirector of intelligence for the new department has been vacant for \nmuch of the time the department has been in existence. This is \nindicative of the lack of attention and significance it is given. The \nstaff is totally inadequate for the mission outlined in the legislation \nthat established the department.\n  Instead, the administration has chosen to create a new organization \nat the CIA called the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, TTIC. While \nthis new organization may address some of the problems that we have \nidentified, it does not meet the requirements set out in the \nlegislative authorization, nor does it meet the criteria set out in the \nJoint Inquiry recommendation.\n  Finally, I would like to address Recommendation No. 19 of the joint \ninquiry report. This recommendation calls on ``the intelligence \ncommunity, and particularly the FBI and CIA, to aggressively address \nthe possibility that foreign governments are providing support to or \nare involved in terrorist activity targeting the United States and U.S. \ninterests. The FBI and CIA should aggressively and thoroughly pursue \nrelated matters developed through this Joint Inquiry that have been \nreferred to them for further investigation.''\n  Mr. President, this may be the most important--and at the same time, \nthe most troubling recommendation. Significant evidence of foreign \ngovernment involvement in the 9-11 attacks was uncovered by the joint \ninquiry.\n  It is incomprehensible why this administration has refused to \naggressively pursue the leads that our inquiry developed. One example \nof the failure to pursue leads that point to foreign government \ninvolvement is the refusal of the FBI to aggressively follow the money \ntrail that flowed from officials of a foreign government to at least \nsome of the terrorists. In spite of being provided evidence by our \ncommittee, the FBI and the administration refused to use all the law \nenforcement tools at their disposal to follow the money trail. Why \nwould the administration not use all of its available powers to track \nthis money? In addition, the question of whether other terrorists were \ngetting similar support was not pursued. Therefore the extent of the \ninvolvement of the foreign government has never been fully \ninvestigated. Recent press reports indicate that there is even more \nsuspicious activity than was known at the time we issued our report.\n  Another example of the failure to aggressively pursue the sources of \nforeign support of terrorism is reported on Page A14 of today's \nWashington Post. A panel which was established by the United Nations to \npursue sources of support of al-Qaida has been disbanded. Our \ngovernment joined with Russia and Chile to sponsor a resolution at the \nUnited Nations that disbanded the panel investigating al-Qaida's \nfinancing.\n  We are talking about the possible involvement of foreign governments \nin the 9-11 attacks. If a government was involved in those attacks, we \nshould leave no stone unturned to identify the extent of that \ninvolvement and hold those responsible accountable. There should be no \nsanctuary from justice for those involved with terrorists, no matter \nwho might be embarrassed by such revelations.\n  I wish I could be more specific in discussing the involvement of \nforeign governments in the 9-11 plot. Unfortunately, the administration \nwill not allow me to do so. After 7 months of effort to de-classify the \nreport that we filed on December 20, 2002, the CIA, the FBI and other \nagencies decided to keep significant portions secret. In particular, \nthere are 27 pages that were virtually completely censored. These are \npages 396 through 422 from Part Four of the report, which is entitled, \n``Finding, Discussion and Narrative Regarding Certain Sensitive \nNational Security Matters.''\n  This censorship is troubling for a number of reasons. First, it \nreduces the information available to the public about some of the most \nimportant government actions--or to be more accurate, inactions--prior \nto September 11. Second, it precludes the American people from asking \ntheir government legitimate questions, such as:\n\n       Was there a reason that some, but not all, of the \n     terrorists were receiving foreign support while they were in \n     the United States?\n       Or is it not more likely that they were all receiving \n     similar support?\n       What evidence do we have that the infrastructure of support \n     that existed prior to 9-11 has been dismantled?\n       Or is it not more likely that such an infrastructure is \n     still in place for the next generation of terrorists?\n       How many trained operatives of al-Qaida, Hezbollah, and \n     other international terrorist organizations are there inside \n     the United States of America?\n       What are the skills and capabilities of these operatives?\n       What was the scale and skills of Iraqi operatives inside \n     the United States prior to the war in Iraq and at the current \n     date?\n       What was the comparative threat to the people of the United \n     States of Iraq and the trained agents of international \n     terrorists placed inside our country?\n       Has the number, skill set, funding or ability to avoid \n     disclosure of international terrorist operatives within the \n     United States of America been enhanced by support from \n     foreign governments?\n       How professional and aggressive have been the efforts of \n     agencies such as the FBI and the CIA in answering those \n     questions?\n       And, how was the information that our government might have \n     had prior to September 11th utilized after September 11th to \n     enhance the security of our homeland and American interests \n     abroad?\n\n  Unfortunately, almost 2\\1/2\\ years after the tragedy, the \nadministration and the Congress--in the main--have not initiated the \nreforms necessary to reduce the chances of another 9-11. Given the \nseriousness of that situation, some of what was withheld from this \nreport bordered on the absurd. For examples of the absurdity, some of \nthe information censored from these pages actually appears in other \nparts of the report. Let me cite three examples.\n  First, much of the censored information about Omar al-Bayoumi is \navailable on pages 173-175. Mr. Bayoumi was an employee of the Saudi \nCivil Aviation Authority and a suspected Saudi intelligence agent based \nin California. He had extensive contacts with two of the Saudi \nhijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. The same day that \nBayoumi picked up the hijackers at a restaurant in Los Angeles, he had \nattended a prior meeting at the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles. Bayoumi \nco-signed a lease for the two hijackers, paid their first month's rent, \nhosted a welcome party for them, helped them get driver's licenses and \nflight school applications. He also introduced them to others who \nserved as their translator and in other support roles.\n  Second, much of the censored information about Osama Bassnan, another \nSaudi national who was a neighbor of the two hijackers in San Diego, \nwhich appears on pages 175 through 177.\n  Third, much of the information about a San Diego business manager \nwhich was censored also appears on pages 179 and 180.\n  I would note that the declassified sections of the report point out \nthat, despite public assurances from U.S. officials that Saudi Arabia \nhas cooperated in counter terrorism efforts, the Joint Inquiry received \ntestimony that Saudi officials in fact ``had been uncooperative and \noften did not act on information implicating Saudi nationals.''\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\n  What this indicates is that in the months following the release of \nour recommendation that the administration ``aggressively'' address the \nforeign government involvement in 9-11, the Bush administration not \nonly failed to pursue and investigate foreign government involvement, \nthe administration misused the classification process to protect the \nforeign governments that may have been involved in 9-11. There is no \nreason for the Bush administration to continue to shield make-believe \nallies who are supporting, either directly or indirectly, terrorists \nwho want to kill Americans.\n  The recommendations we have made here are consistent with \nrecommendations made by other bodies that have been formed to analyze \nour intelligence structure over the last decade. The political reality \nis that there is a broad agreement that these reforms need to be made, \nyet there is institutional resistance that has been too great to \novercome.\n  Congress has assumed responsibility for reform of the intelligence \ncommunity. Now is the time to act so that we might receive the \nappreciation of the American people for reducing the likelihood of \nanother tragedy like 9-11. The consequence of inaction will be \nlegitimate, strong and unavoidable criticism should we be struck again.\n  If 9-11 was not a big enough shock wave to overcome the resistance to \nchange, what will it take?\n  I ask unanimous consent that The Washington Post article ``U.N. \nDissolves Panel Monitoring Al Qaeda'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                U.N. Dissolves Panel Monitoring Al Qaeda\n\n                 group had criticized security council\n\n                            (By Colum Lynch)\n\n        United Nations.--The U.N. Security Council quietly \n     dissolved a high-profile independent U.N. panel last month \n     that was established more than 2\\1/2\\ years ago to prevent \n     the al Qaeda terrorist network from financing its war against \n     the United States and its allies, U.S. and U.N. officials \n     said.\n        The move comes six weeks after the panel, headed by \n     Michael Chandler of Britain, concluded in a stinging report \n     that a number of Security Council sanctions against al Qaeda \n     had failed to constrain the terrorist network.\n        But Security Council members have denied the move was \n     retribution for the panel's conclusions, saying that the \n     quality of the group's work was uneven and that the group had \n     outlived its usefulness.\n        The 15-nation council on Friday adopted a new resolution \n     sponsored by the United States, Russia and Chile that would \n     replace Chandler's panel with what they say will be a more \n     professional body. The new panel is expected to keep \n     monitoring the global war against terrorism but would be \n     subject to closer Security Council coordination and \n     oversight.\n       The dispute underscores the challenge of managing an \n     international counterterrorism operation through an \n     organization whose 191 members are frequently criticized for \n     failing to cooperate. It also reflects growing frustration \n     among members that sanctions have done little to interrupt \n     the flow of money and arms to al Qaeda.\n       Chandler criticized the decision, saying it would undercut \n     the United Nations' capacity to combat al Qaeda. He suggested \n     that his panel's demise was a result of pressure from \n     influential U.N. members who had been singled out in his \n     reports for failing to take adequate measures to combat al \n     Qaeda.\n       ``A number of people were uncomfortable with our last \n     report,'' Chandler said. He said that the Security Council \n     was sending the wrong message and that one of the ``key \n     elements'' of a successful counterterrorism strategy is ``a \n     strong independent monitoring group.''\n       Chandler's five-member panel--the monitoring group on al \n     Qaeda--was established in July 2001 to ensure compliance with \n     an arms embargo against the Taliban and a freeze on its \n     financial assets for harboring Osma bin Laden. The mission's \n     mandate was expanded after the Taliban fell in January 2002, \n     granting it broad powers to monitor international compliance \n     with a U.N. financial, travel and arms ban.\n       Chandler's reports have provided periodic snapshots of the \n     international campaign against terrorism, often highlighting \n     failings in governments' responses to the al Qaeda threat. In \n     August 2002, after a lull in al Qaeda activities, Chandler \n     provided a prescient forecast of the network's resurgence. \n     ``Al Qaeda is by all accounts `fit and well' and poised to \n     strike,'' the report warned. It was followed by deadly \n     strikes in Bali, Indonesia; Casablanca, Morroco; and Saudi \n     Arabia.\n       ``The group functioned very well, providing hard-hitting \n     reports to the Security Council which painted a picture of \n     what was really going on,'' said Victor Comras, a former \n     State Department official who helped write the Dec. 2 report.\n       ``I am at a loss to understand why the United States is one \n     of the main players in redrafting the new resolution and \n     allowing the monitoring group to lapse,'' he added. ``The \n     United States was the greatest beneficiary of the monitoring \n     group because it gave them a lever to name and shame'' \n     countries that failed to combat terrorists.\n       One U.S. official said that last thing the United States \n     wants is to ``muzzle'' the United Nations. But he said that \n     although Chandler's panel was effective ``at getting \n     headlines,'' his propensity for antagonizing member states \n     could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to harness the United \n     Nation's support in its anti-terror campaign. Chandler's \n     group ``did a good job,'' said James B. Cunningham, the \n     deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ``But we are \n     trying to make the committee more effective.''\n       Some U.S. and U.N. diplomats said Chandler needlessly \n     alienated potential allies and constituents at the United \n     Nations, including some in the United States. Chandler's 2002 \n     report irked Bush administration officials by casting doubt \n     on the success of the U.S.-led effort to block al Qaeda \n     financing. The Bush administration also challenged the \n     veracity of Chandler's assertion in an earlier report that \n     the Treasury Department had ignored warnings from SunTrust \n     Banks that a key plotter in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks had previously transferred large sums of money to an \n     account at a Florida bank branch.\n       Chandler infuriated officials from Liechtenstein, Italy and \n     Switzerland with the Dec. 2 report that illustrated how two \n     U.N.-designated terrorist financiers. Youssef Nada and Ahmed \n     Idris Nasreddin, lived, traveled and operated multimillion-\n     dollar businesses in their countries in violation of U.N. \n     sanctions.\n       Liechtenstein's U.N. ambassador, Christian Wenaweser, one \n     of Chandler's sharpest critics, complained that the Chandler \n     investigation was shoddy and that he failed to adequately \n     acknowledge his government's role in helping build the case \n     against two alleged terrorist financiers. ``We don't question \n     the usefulness of the monitoring group. Quite the contrary. \n     But they have to have a clear mandate and guidelines on how \n     they should and shouldn't do their work,'' Wenaweser said. \n     ``They didn't bother to verify basic facts; they got some \n     things wrong. Travel dates. Spelling of names. Some of the \n     stuff was silly.''\n       Chile's U.N. ambassador, Heraldo Munoz, the U.N. terrorism \n     committee's chairman, said the new eight-member panel--called \n     the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team--would \n     give ``more teeth'' to U.N. anti-terror efforts by \n     strengthening the committee's expertise in finance and border \n     controls, and improving its capacity to analyze terrorist \n     trends.\n       ``I would like a monitoring team that is efficient, that is \n     independent and that can closely collaborate with the \n     committee,'' Munoz said.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida.

Mr. President, we are about to take up a new spending bill \nin the Senate involving transportation funding for the United States. \nThis bill, which is an important bill, comes to the Senate in a \nfiscally unsound condition. That is regrettable. What is even more \nregrettable is that this is the continuation of an unfortunate line of \nlegislation which has come to the Senate and which has been passed by \nthe Senate and passed by the House. In some cases, not passed by the \nSenate but at least passed by the House, and has significantly expanded \nspending at the Federal level, which has in turn dramatically \naggravated the national deficit. This is unfortunate.\n  To recap some of the bills, we had, for example, the agriculture \nauthorization bill, which included basically a conversion to an \nentitlement scheme of most of the agricultural programs and \ndramatically increased spending in those accounts well above what we \nwould have budgeted on the discretionary side.\n  That was followed, of course, by the most significant piece of \nspending legislation in my career in Government, the most significant \npiece of legislation from an entitlement standpoint since the Medicare \nbill was originally\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\npassed back in the late 1960s, early 1970s period, and that was the \nMedicare prescription drug bill. That bill included $400 billion--as \nrepresented, at least--of new spending over 10 years, which was unpaid \nfor, and which had, after it is outside the 10-year budgeting window \nand got into the real terms of how that bill was going to affect \nnational spending, had a price tag of somewhere between $6 and $8 \ntrillion of unpaid-for spending.\n  I did not support the Medicare prescription drug bill because I felt \nit was the largest generational tax increase in history, basically \nraising significantly the benefits for one generation which will have \nto be paid by a younger generation. That means the younger generation \nis going to have to increase their taxes significantly to support the \nolder generation, my generation, the baby boom generation, by the tune \nof $6 to $8 trillion. Thus, I did not support that bill because I did \nnot think it was fair to the younger generation to put this tax bill on \nthem without substantive reform in the bill which would control the \ncosts of Medicare. We passed this bill only 2 or 3 months ago.\n\n  Now we learn the original estimates of the bill, which were $400 \nbillion over 10 years, were misstated. It now appears the bill is going \nto be projected at costing $500-plus billion. That amount also is \nprobably misstated. That is probably a conservative number. At the time \nthe Medicare bill was debated in the Senate, there were some Members \nwho said the accurate reflection for the 10-year period was closer to \n$700 billion, but the debt was not being correctly stated and, scoring \nbeing scoring, the bill came in at $395 billion. Ironically, if it came \nin at $401 billion, it would have been out of order, but it came in at \n$395 billion so it was in order.\n  Now we learn 3 months later it really was $500-plus billion. That is \njust in 3 months. Imagine, if it jumped $100 billion, or 25 percent in \n3 months, at the end of a year, if you project that number out, it will \njump--that is a progressive geometric number--somewhere around 200 \npercent by the end of this year. Hopefully not.\n  In any event, the fact that we were misled, the fact that this number \nis so high is unfortunate. The problem is, it puts in place structural \nspending which is out of control and which has to be paid for by one \ngeneration in order to support the next generation, which is unfair for \nour generation to do to our children unless we put in place reform. And \nthere was no significant reform. That was the most egregious act I have \nseen in my career in Congress or in Government in the area of fiscal \nresponsibility, because of the inappropriateness of one generation \npassing a tax increase on to another generation.\n  That bill, which was a huge bill, was then followed by the Energy \nbill. The President of the United States asked for an $8 billion Energy \nbill. I supported an energy bill. We need an energy bill. It should be \nbased on expanding conservation. It should be based on expanding \nrenewables. It should be based on expanding supply. I am one of the few \nSenators from the Northeast who aggressively voted for all three of \nthose areas. However, when the President asked for $8 billion, I \nthought that was reasonable and it was a budgeted figure.\n  What happened? The Energy bill came back in the Senate at $24 billion \nwhich was $16 billion over what the President asked for. Due to a group \nof Members, fiscal conservatives and people concerned about some of the \ntechnical aspects of this bill, it did not make it through a filibuster \nissue.\n  Now it is up to $31 billion. It just keeps going up and up and up. \nThose costs have to be passed on, once again, to our children, because \nwe are basically financing the cost of that Energy bill on our \nchildren's backs through deficit spending. It is totally inappropriate \nthat a bill that was supposed to be $8 billion ends up at $31 billion.\n  Those bills are three egregious examples in the area of spending \ncontrol, now to be followed by a fourth, it appears. Presently, we have \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, known as TEA-21, \nwhich basically funds the construction of highways, rail, and \nintermodal transportation in this country. This area of activity for \ngovernance is generally accepted to be an important part of our job as \nstewards of our country. We must maintain a strong infrastructure. I \ncertainly believe that. So to accomplish that when TEA-21 was passed a \nfew years ago, there was a 40 percent increase in funding over the \nprevious funding bill, ISTEA.\n  The theory was that we would take the money from the trust fund, \nwhich was paid in through the gas tax and other related taxes, and fund \ntransportation in this country to the full extent of the amount of \nmoney we were taking in from the users of the highways and the users of \nthe transportation system. That was a reasonable approach.\n  There is no reason we should be taking money from the gas tax and \nusing it for other exercises in Government, other needs in Government, \nwhether they are justified or not, such as investments in agriculture \nor investments in small business or investments in education. It is \nappropriate that we should use the user fee, which is the gas tax, to \nsupport the construction of highways.\n  The whole concept of the transportation bill was: We would pass a \ntransportation bill which funded the construction of highways in this \ncountry and intermodal transportation at the level that the \ntransportation system was supporting itself, basically through the gas \ntax and other revenue sources.\n  We budgeted for that as a Congress, and then it was sent to \ncommittee. Regrettably, what we have seen come out of committee is \nsomething entirely different. What the budget suggested we spend in \nthis area--depending on how you account for this--is either $221 \nbillion or $255 billion. Mr. President, $221 billion is basically what \nthe revenues are coming in from the highway fund, but we could have \ngone up to $255 billion if the total spending could be paid for by \nlegitimate sources of income into the trust fund. Unfortunately, what \nhappened when this bill came back was we ended up with a $318 billion \nbill. This represents a $93 billion increase over present funding under \nTEA-21. In fact, the Senate position is conservative compared to the \nHouse's position because the House is looking to pass a bill which \nrepresents something like $375 billion for this six year period of \nspending.\n  These numbers are staggering. There are going to be a lot of numbers \nthrown around this body in the next few days on this bill, but no \nmatter how you account for it, it is fairly clear this bill is over the \nbudget by somewhere between $30 and $70 billion, depending on where it \nends up, maybe even more. That is inexcusable.\n  There will be an attempt to mask this. In fact, the Finance Committee \nwill report out language which tries to accomplish that. They took a \nwhole series of different taxes which are now flowing into the general \nfund, and they moved those taxes over to the trust fund, thus claiming \nthe trust fund had revenues. They do not mention the fact, of course, \nthat aggravates the general fund because if the money is not going to \ngo into the general fund, then that becomes a deficit event.\n  Again, it is not absolutely clear, because we have not gotten all the \nnumbers yet, which is one of the reasons we should not be bringing this \nbill up yet, but it appears we are talking somewhere in the vicinity of \n$20 to $40 billion of gamesmanship here by moving revenues out of the \ngeneral fund into the highway fund, and by claiming revenues from \nsources which do not pay revenues in. It appears that is a game that is \nbeing played.\n  It is staggering when you think about it that we would have the \nchutzpah as a Congress to call up a bill that is $30 to $70 billion \nover the budget and in deficit when the deficit was just reported as \nbeing $520 billion--or projected to be that much for next year--and \n$477 billion for this year. It is as if there are blinders on in this \ninstitution on the issue of spending.\n  Unfortunately, it is a bipartisan problem. That is why I guess it is \nhappening so often. The Agriculture bill was a bipartisan bill. The \nMedicare bill was a bipartisan bill. The Energy bill was a bipartisan \nbill, and it appears that this highway fund has enough of a bipartisan \nmajority to ram it right through this Senate, as fiscally irresponsible \nas it is.\n  The problem is this: We can build all the roads in the world, but if \nwe do not do them in a fiscally responsible way,\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\nthen our children are not going to be able to afford cars to drive on \nthose roads. Their quality of life is going to be reduced because we \nare adding to the deficit, and that means we are adding to their tax \nburden every time we do this. That debt burden translates into a \nreduced quality of life for future generations.\n\n  We have put forward as a Congress a legitimate benchmark for \nlegitimate spending in the area of TEA-21. The budget had in it a \nproposal to significantly increase TEA-21 spending, I think by \nsomething like 30 or 40 percent. But that has been ignored. It has been \nclaimed that that amount is not enough. No. We have to go ramming past \nthat and propose a bill on the floor of the Senate that is $93 billion \nover last year's spending and $30 to $70 billion over what the budget \ncalled for. And that is just the start.\n  There is a game being played here besides the fact that most of the \nrevenues for the additional funds which are claimed to be offset here \nare illusory, which is so outrageous that it gives smoke and mirrors a \nbad name. That is just the start because we all know what is going on. \nThere is an agreement, a sub rosa agreement, if you wish, between the \npeople who are supportive of this bill in this body and the people who \nwant more spending in the other body that this figure that comes out of \nthe Senate is irrelevant, that the final number is going to be a lot \nhigher than the Senate number. As I mentioned, the House is already \ntalking about numbers in the high 300s, and the representation we hear \nis we will be closer to the House number coming out of conference than \nthe Senate number, which is already grossly inflated as far as cost.\n  So I just simply lay this marker down. We are going to have to start \ngetting serious about this deficit. We have not so far as a Congress, \nbut we are going to have to because it is our job. It is our job to be \nstewards not only of today but of what we pass on to tomorrow.\n  If we are going to be good stewards, then we have to be fiscally \nresponsible. I hope others will take a serious look at this bill before \nthey vote for it. Before they even vote to go to it, it would be nice \nif we actually knew what was going on and how many more games are going \nto be played before we go to the bill in its substantive form. We \nshould certainly be willing to ask that much before we have cloture on \nthe motion to proceed.\n  But, in any event, as we debate the language of this bill and the \npurposes of this bill--which are well intentioned, and which can be \npaid for at a reasonable price--we need to keep in mind that this is \none part of a series of bills that have not been fiscally responsible, \nand we have to start someplace in being responsible in managing the \ndollars of this country effectively. The other horses are out the barn \ndoor, with the exception of energy, although there is some talk that \nthey are going to attach energy to this bill.\n  This is the only item that is before us so far, but it is a big one. \nTherefore, we should take a hard look at it. Before we move it out of \nthis body, we should try to bring it back in line with our budget and \nwith the realities we face as a country, which is that we are spending \na lot more money than we can afford as a Government.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Under the previous order, the hour of 3 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1072.\n  Madam President, we are about to begin discussion on the cloture \nmotion we will be voting on this afternoon. It could be considered by \nmany people as the most significant piece of legislation we will be \ndealing with this year or maybe even in a 6-year period. The current \nextension of TEA-21, passed in 1998, expires on February 29. We have to \nact. We have no other option. Some might argue that we can do another \nextension, but another extension without Senate action on a 6-year bill \nsets us up for not doing a reauthorization bill this year at all. That \nis just not acceptable.\n  The President has released his fiscal year 2005 budget, and I believe \nit misses the mark with transportation funding. He proposes funding \n$256 billion on highways and transit, approximately $55 billion under \nthe Bond-Reid amendment that we agreed to with a plurality of 79 votes.\n  Earlier today we heard from Senators who believe that S. 1072 \nproposes a level of spending that is too high, that we need to bring it \ninto line with the President's numbers. I disagree. I strongly support \nthe President on virtually everything he is doing, but in this case I \ndo not agree. We have a crisis in the country in terms of our \ninfrastructure and we must meet this crisis. We need to stick with the \nBond-Reid level and need to get the bill done now.\n  For those who want to wait to do a bill, we caution you that putting \nthis off only makes it harder. The current extension is spending down \nthe trust fund balance. If we do another extension, the balance will be \nspent down even further, which means we will have little choice at that \npoint but to increase fuel taxes. In my mind, indexing fuel taxes was \nprobably a fiscally responsible position at one time because it does \npreserve the purchasing power of our transportation dollars. But I also \nunderstand the political realities. I know it is not a viable option at \nthis time.\n  This bill does not assume an increase in fuel taxes. Due to the good \nwork of Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus, both of whom I met \nwith this morning--and both have been real champions in working \ndiligently to make this happen--the deficit is neutral in this bill.\n  Don't fool yourselves into believing that delaying action on this \nbill is saving money. The exact opposite is true. For instance, our \ntransportation infrastructure will continue to deteriorate. Thirty-two \npercent of our major roads are in poor or mediocre condition. Thirty-\nnine percent of our bridges are structurally deficient or functionally \nobsolete. As much as I hate to admit it, my State of Oklahoma ranks \nlast of all 50 States, which is not too complimentary to the idea that \nI am the chairman of this committee. The cost to address these issues \nonly increases the longer we wait.\n  In addition, the economic consequences escalate because poor \ninfrastructure contributes to congestion, which means lost productivity \nto the tune of $76 billion.\n  Additionally, another delay to enacting a 6-year comprehensive bill \nwill frustrate our State departments of transportation in their own \nprograms. They need the assurance and security of a stable Federal \nprogram in order to make their individual programs work. As you well \nknow, they have worked on these programs now for not just months but \nwell over a year anticipating that we would have this reauthorization \nunderway.\n  Finally, we are missing an opportunity to create jobs. For every $1 \nbillion invested in Federal highway transit spending, 47,500 jobs are \ncreated. We estimate that S. 1072 will impact the overall job growth by \n700,000 jobs. To the construction worker, our bill would generate over \n2 million opportunities for employment. In other words, when one job \nends, there will be another opportunity available so the construction \nworker can move from one job to another thereby avoiding unemployment. \nI think that is a good thing and one each of us in this Chamber should \nbe willing to roll up our sleeves and work to get done. I anticipate \nthat is exactly what we are going to do.\n  In addition to a job creator, spending on transportation makes good \neconomic sense. For every $1 billion in transportation expenditures, \nthe gross domestic product increases by $1.75 billion. Furthermore, \ntransportation investments improve freight mobility which in a ``just \nin time'' delivery business model is critical to growth.\n  I recognize for those who believe this bill should be stopped for \nbudgetary reasons that my arguments may not\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\nmeet with a receptive ear, but I do want you to understand that voting \nno on cloture means you are voting no on addressing the repair and \nrehabilitation needs of our 50-year interstate system which is at the \nheart of the economic engine of the Nation. Voting no on the cloture \nmotion would be voting no on the creation of over 2 million employment \nopportunities and no to 700,000 new jobs. It would be voting no on \naddressing congestion problems which cost the economy $76 billion \nannually and voting no on increases to gross domestic product.\n  Finally, if we are able to proceed to S. 1072, I will be asked by \nmany of you to help you with individual needs in your States. I am \nhappy to do that. I want to do that. But before I can help you, you \nneed to help me.\n  I ask you to vote yes on the cloture motion so that when the need \ncomes up in your State and you have a need to meet a crisis, or you \nhave special project needs, we will be helping each other. I think we \nall understand that.\n  Some people who have actually read the legislation we are going to be \nconsidering are still saying that perhaps it is not meeting the \nenvironmental goals or it is not meeting the public participation. I \nthink this is one of the major strong points of this legislation. We \nhave spent a lot of time--and I have to tell you that the ranking \nmember, Jim Jeffords, along with Kitt Bond, and of course Harry Reid, \nthe Senator from Nevada, have all been very cooperative--in working out \nthings. There are some things in this bill that I don't like, but \ncompromise has been the name of it.\n  For example, on the environmental issues, it requires metropolitan \nplanning organizations and State transportation planners to consult \nduring regional planning with agencies responsible for land use \nmanagement, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, \nand historic preservation.\n\n  It expands the number and types of environmental and resource \nagencies participating in the environmental review.\n  It provides a new opportunity for environmental and resource agencies \nto participate in the development of the environmental review schedule.\n  It establishes a new obligation for the lead agency to consider the \nneeds of environmental and resource agencies when developing the review \nschedule, including the responsibilities of resource agencies under \napplicable laws, resources available to environmental and resource \nagencies to conduct the review, and the sensitivity of the national and \nhistoric resources that could be affected by the projects.\n  It provides a new opportunity for environmental and resource agencies \nto participate in the development of a project's purpose and needs \nstatement.\n  It provides a new opportunity for environmental and resource agencies \nto participate in development of the project alternatives to be \nreviewed.\n  It provides new opportunities for transportation planners to consider \ntransportation land use and environmental plans when conducting the \nenvironmental review.\n  It creates a new obligation by the lead agency to make available \npromptly to environmental and resource agencies information useful to \nan environmental review.\n  I was around back in 1991 serving in the other body when we put \ntogether ISTEA. It is a very comprehensive bill. I was also involved on \nthis committee in 1998 when we were putting together TEA-21. But in \nnone of those efforts and in none of that legislation were the \nenvironmental concerns met as well as we are meeting them here.\n  The same is true with public participation. Those of us who serve in \nthe Senate are constantly inundated at our townhall meetings by people \nsaying they do not have the opportunity to participate in these things. \nWe are correcting that. We think that people and other governmental \nagencies should be a part of it.\n  There is a specific new section devoted to improving public \ninvolvement in transportation planning and projects, directing State \nand metropolitan transportation planners to hold public meetings at \nconvenient and acceptable locations and times, to employ visualization \ntechniques to describe plans, and to make public information available \nelectronically such as the World Wide Web.\n  There are new opportunities for public comment on specific \nenvironmental factors considered by metropolitan planning organizations \nand States during the transportation planning. We know this is true \nwhen we go back to our States. They tell us that in their department of \ntransportation--I am sure in North Carolina, in Nevada, in Oklahoma--if \nthey have the chance to plan in advance to have this comprehensive bill \nin front of them--not just another extension--they then can make their \nlong-term plans get much more from the construction dollars.\n  I reemphasize that there is nothing we are going to do in this \nChamber which is going to provide more jobs than will be provided by \nthis bill. That is why it is so important that we defeat cloture and \nget on with this and get it done in the next 10 days or so.\n  I compliment the leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side, \nand particularly Senator Reid, the assistant minority leader, for his \ncooperation in helping us to make this a truly nonpartisan and \nbipartisan effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is with a certain amount of sadness \nthat I worked on this matter this weekend and looked over all the past \nhistory of the surface transportation legislation. The sadness comes \nbecause Pat Moynihan is not here. When we started working this bill \nlast year, I asked Senator Moynihan to come visit with me and my staff. \nHe did. He came with that smile. I always had the feeling with Senator \nMoynihan that no matter the subject he always knew more than I did. He \nhad a lot of humility. Even though he knew that he knew more than most \nanyone he dealt with, he never flaunted that great mind that he had.\n  The legislation we have before us today is basically what Pat \nMoynihan envisioned for our country. Serving with him on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee--which I did for my tenure in \nthe Senate--was like going to school and not having to take the test. \nSenator Moynihan was wonderful. He would talk about the great Robert \nMoses of New York and the planning that he did.\n  I hope that all of us as we proceed through this bill will understand \nthe greatness of Pat Moynihan, and what he has done for our country.\n\n  Everywhere in the Nation's Capital there is evidence of Pat Moynihan. \nI worked in Washington, DC, as a Capitol policeman, going to law \nschool. And when I worked here as a Capitol policeman, Pennsylvania \nAvenue was a slum. During the Kennedy inauguration, Pat Moynihan \nrecognized that and said we should do something about it. He was just a \nbureaucrat at the time. But he proceeded from that time to help develop \nthe Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation. Now you can go up \nPennsylvania Avenue to the White House and it is one of the most \nbeautiful streets in the world because of Pat Moynihan.\n  I hope we proceed through this legislation recognizing what a \nwonderful man Pat Moynihan was. One cannot stop but think of the things \nhe did, including the Ronald Reagan Building. For 50 years that was a \nbig hole in the ground. In the Nation's Capital we had this big \nnothing. Pat Moynihan said: We cannot spend enough money on that; we \nwill build a building there. That is a building that Ronald Reagan, I \nam sure, in his own way, is proud of. There is not a more beautiful \nbuilding in the Nation's Capital, with the exception of maybe the \nLibrary of Congress, than the Ronald Reagan Building. That is Pat \nMoynihan's. It is his.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is the Senator aware that Patrick Moynihan was born and \nraised in my city of Tulsa? He was the first one when I came here--not \nto the Senate but to the other body--to whom I came over to talk. We \ndeveloped a very close relationship. Someone could wonder, how could \nthis be--you have one who is a dedicated liberal, one who is a \ndedicated conservative, having that affection.\n  When I was elected to this body in 1994, his office was next door to \nme. I confess right now before all these people, when the bells rang \nfor a vote, I would go and look down the hall and wait until Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\nwas coming up so I could walk and talk with him on the way over. He was \njust a remarkable person. There is a lot of dedication to him in what \nwe are doing today.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator from Oklahoma \nrecognizing the goodness of this man. He is absolutely right. I am sure \nthe Senator learned a great deal in those walks from the Russell \nBuilding over here.\n  I remember Senator Moynihan and I sat together on a bus going from \nthe airport to the funeral of the great John Chafee. During the entire \ntrip, he pointed out, as we traveled to Rhode Island--Providence, I \nthink is where the funeral was--all the architecture, the history of \nthe buildings, as we drove up to the beautiful church. And when we got \nto the church, he told me all about that church.\n  I wish I had the recall of Pat Moynihan. I wish I had 20 percent of \nthe recall ability of Senator Moynihan. He had such an ability to \ncommunicate. As Senator Bumpers said, upon the publication of Senator \nMoynihan's 15th book--or whatever it was--you have written more books \nthan I have read.\n  He was a great man. I have my heart full. Part of it is gratitude for \nknowing a man such as that, that there are great ones on this Earth. \nPat Moynihan was a great one.\n  About 50 years ago, one of the really fine Presidents we have had, a \nRepublican, President Dwight David Eisenhower, presided over the \ncreation of the Interstate Highway System. On that occasion, he said:\n\n       The Nation badly needs new highways. The good of our \n     people, of our economy and of our defense, require that \n     construction of these highways be undertaken at once.\n\n  President Eisenhower continued:\n\n       We have fallen far behind in this task. . . . Today there \n     is hardly a city of any size without almost hopeless \n     congestion within its boundaries and stalled traffic blocking \n     roads leading beyond these boundaries.\n\n  President Eisenhower said what we needed to do in this legislation: \nIf there was ever a time in the recent history of this body when we had \nto do something on a bipartisan basis, it is this bill. People stuck in \ntraffic are Democrats and Republicans. It is equal opportunity, whether \nyou are stuck in traffic in Las Vegas, Phoenix, St. Louis. There are \npeople of both parties stuck in that traffic, losing valuable time. If \nthey were not stuck in that traffic, they would make our country more \nproductive.\n  Why did President Eisenhower feel so strongly about an interstate \nhighway system? He felt that way because, as a young major, he was \nasked in the 1930s to bring a convoy of military vehicles across the \ncountry. It was at that time he realized there was no easy way to do \nit. The roads were hopeless. There was no way you could travel this \ncountry, even for military purposes, easily. At that time he realized \nsomething needed to be done, and when he became President, that was one \nof the first things he pushed.\n  People who are complaining about the cost of this bill, Republicans \nand Democrats, should understand that the highway bill President \nEisenhower originally sponsored was also criticized as being too \ncostly. This bill is not too costly. One of the compromises the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma worked out with Senator Jeffords and me is that it is as \nsmall as it is. If it were up to Senator Jeffords and this committee, \nit would be bigger. It is because of the chairman of the committee that \nit is as small as it is. I hope everyone who criticizes the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, understands he did yeoman's work.\n  As we speak, the House is talking about a bill bigger than ours. They \ncriticized President Eisenhower for a bill being too big and they \ncriticize us for a bill being too big. In my opinion, the bill is too \nsmall.\n  Part of the reason for President Eisenhower's bill, the Interstate \nHighway System, has been completed. We have many more different \nresponsibilities now than we had then. In recent years, we have done \nsome very good work with highway transportation.\n  Going back to 1982 when I first came to Washington, we had the \nSurface Transportation Assistance Act. This bill established the mass \ntransit account, the highway trust fund. The reason that became \nimportant was, people came to the realization that for every vehicle we \nkeep off our highway system, it saves money. It was determined that it \nwould be good if we became partners with the mass transit folks and \nworked together on legislation. That was what we did in 1982 and that \nis what we are doing now. That is why it is such good news that the \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, that handles mass \ntransit, has agreed on a proposal.\n  Senator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords, and I met today with the chairman \nof the Finance Committee and the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senators Grassley and Baucus, and they have agreed to that. \nThat is really important. That started back in 1982. At that time, \nthere was an 85 percent minimum return provision. That means for every \ndollar put into the highway trust fund in a State such as North \nCarolina, there was a guarantee they would get at least 85 percent of \nthe money they put in. Some States got more than that, but 1982 was the \nfirst time there was a minimum return provision. One of the \ncontroversies in that bill was an increase in the Federal gas tax from \n4 to 9 cents per gallon. It was a good bill and passed.\n  In 1987, 5 years later, we had a bill called the Surface \nTransportation and Uniform Reallocation Assistance Act. It was not a \nvery sexy name but it got the point across. It increased the speed \nlimit, which was so important for States such as Nevada, from 55 miles \nper hour to a higher speed. It worked out well and we hope that \ncontinues to be OK. In a State such as Nevada--800 miles from the top \nto bottom, 500 miles across--you need to be able to travel in a safe \nmanner on an interstate highway system faster than 55 miles per hour.\n  It also included a provision requiring States to spend a specified \nminimum amount for environmental purposes. That was the first time the \nhighway bill had really taken that into consideration. So that was \nimportant.\n  Congress felt so strongly about this that President Reagan vetoed \nthis bill. It was overridden by the House and the Senate. That does not \nhappen very often, but the Presiding Officer, who was part of the \nadministration during that time, recalls that.\n  In 1991, we had the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, \nISTEA. That is where the name comes from--ISTEA. This created the \nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality, CMAQ, program, which has been a \nprogram that the environmentalists love, and some who are not as \nenvironmentally sensitive do not like it. But these programs were \nestablished then and dealt with air quality.\n  With the interstate system largely complete, as I indicated earlier, \nISTEA shifted the Federal program from capital construction to focus on \npeople and the movement of goods. This is where Senator Moynihan was so \ngood. It also expanded the transportation decisionmaking process to \ninclude local officials, stakeholders, and citizens. And that passed.\n  It seems as if it was just a short time ago when, in June of 1988, we \npassed TEA-21, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. This \ncontinued the basic policy structure established in ISTEA. It \ndramatically increased funding of the Federal Surface Transportation \nProgram and established important budgetary protections or firewalls to \nguarantee highway and transportation spending. And, for the first time \nsince 1982, we increased the minimum return to 90.5 percent, which was \nvery important.\n  I also want to make sure the record is clear from this Senator's \nperspective of the contributions to highways and transit, and basically \ngood government, that came from John Chafee. I have been so fortunate. \nI worked through all these bills that I have talked about, and I have \nhad the very good fortune to work with Senator Stafford, as chairman of \nthe committee, the great Senator from Vermont; Senator Moynihan for a \nshort time; Senator Baucus; Senator Chafee; and these men set a high \nlevel that we who are now trying to move this bill must meet.\n  But Senator Chafee was such a good friend to me personally. He did so \nmany things to help me in my political career. Even though he was a \nmember of the other party, he went out of his way to always try to make \nme look good. I will always be indebted to him and his family, and that \nincludes Lincoln, for all the good things that Senator Chafee did for \nme. Even though I\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\nwas closer to Senator Moynihan than I was to Senator Chafee, I felt \nsuch a kinship to Senator Chafee and cared a good deal about him, and \nhis imprint is also on this legislation. Senator Moynihan could not \nhave done much of what he did without Senator Chafee working with him.\n  This bill we have before the Senate is good legislation. It is \nimperfect. This legislation that is before this body is imperfect \nlegislation, but it is the best we could do. For 50 States, having a \nformula that you put into a computer and do your computer run which \ncomes out as good as this one says a lot for the great work of our \nstaffs.\n  As Senator Inhofe has said, I would like to do different things in \nthis bill. If I had been the person dictating what was in this bill, it \nwould be different than what we have in it. But, frankly, I am down the \ntotem pole. You have the chairman and ranking member and the \nsubcommittee chairman and then me, but I did have some input in this \nmeasure. I think what we have come up with, as I indicated, is far from \nbeing perfect, but I think it is good legislation. And that is what \nlegislation is all about.\n\n  Legislation is the art of compromise. I have been fortunate that a \nnumber of measures I have introduced are now law in this great country. \nI have never ever gotten everything I wanted. Everything that is now \nlaw that I introduced had to be changed. Anyone who is of the mind that \nthey are going to get what they introduced is wrong because it just \ndoes not happen. I have never known it to happen.\n  This legislation we have been given by the two leaders we have 2 \nweeks to finish. If we do not finish it in 2 weeks, I am sorry to say \nwhat might happen. What might happen is this bill will be pulled, and \nwe will have to extend the highway program for a year. That does not \nhelp any State. No State is helped with that program. Every State gets \nhurt. So we have to move and move quickly on this bill.\n  At the birth of the interstate system, safety and the efficient \nmovement of people and goods framed the national transportation debate. \nFifty years later, as President Eisenhower indicated, that is still the \ntalk, the same speech. You could give the Eisenhower speech today on \nthe floor of the Senate, and if we did not tell you it was 50 years \nold, you would think it was being given by someone who wrote it today. \nFifty years after President Eisenhower's interstate highway system, \nsafety and efficiency remain our foremost objectives.\n  This year, traffic congestion will cost Americans more than $67 \nbillion in lost time and productivity--$67 billion in lost time and \nproductivity--and it will waste almost 6 billion gallons of fuel. I \ncannot imagine 6 billion gallons of fuel. I do not know where you would \nput all that, but that is how much is wasted, which only increases our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  As for safety, traffic accidents last year killed 42,000 people. We \ncan reduce the toll of traffic congestion. We can save lives by making \nour highways safer. We have a responsibility to keep working on these \nproblems and to find meaningful solutions.\n  The bill currently before this body represents a major commitment to \nmaintain and improve our national transportation infrastructure. It \nalso creates jobs.\n  Again, there has been controversy over there not being enough jobs \ncreated during the 3 years that President Bush has been President. \nThose people who are trying to damage this bill should understand this \nlegislation will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, some say as many \nas 2 million jobs.\n  The majority leader of the Senate was here today, and he said for \nevery $1 billion we spend in this highway bill, $2 billion will be \ncreated by other things, the offshoot of this legislation. We know for \nevery $1 billion we spend on infrastructure development, 47,000 high-\npaying jobs are created. We know that. And these are well paid, skilled \njobs for Americans.\n  This bill is also a referendum on improving our quality of life. No \nother measure will we debate in this Congress that has the potential to \nso dramatically impact every facet of our everyday lives.\n  I thank my colleagues, the entire committee, but especially Senator \nJeffords, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Bond for working to craft a \nbipartisan package that continues the intermodal legacy of its \npredecessors, ISTEA and TEA-21.\n  Our proposal does not make dramatic changes to the core program \nstructure because it does not need to. The groundwork has already been \nlaid. During a year's worth of reauthorization hearings, the committee \nlearned that the basic structure does work.\n  This package refines and improves the current program to ensure that \nour investments have the maximum impact on improving our surface \ntransportation system.\n  Nevada is the fastest growing State in the Union and has been for \nmore than a decade. Clark County--that is where Las Vegas is located--\nhas experienced the bulk of that growth. This growth represents unique \nchallenges but also opportunities.\n  The bill before the Senate provides resources and programs that \nencourage the effective management and operation of our Nation's \ntransportation system. The continued success of that system is \nessential to fast growing metropolitan areas such as Clark County, \nwhere traffic congestion and air quality are serious issues.\n  This legislation also places a renewed emphasis on safety by \nconsolidating the various safety initiatives spread through the Federal \nhighway program into new core safety programs. One of the aspects we \nhave worked on includes something called the Safe Routes to School \nInitiative. It was felt that we wanted to do everything we could to \nhave kids walk to school, ride bicycles to school. Why do they have to \nhave a bus pick them up and drop them off at their door? One of the \nthings we are doing is creating safer routes for children. If they want \nto use a bike or walk, we have bike paths and sidewalks.\n  This is important because, for example, in Clark County, we have \nopened, in the last 2 years, 18 schools a year, a total of 36 schools. \nBy opening one new school a month we can't keep up with the growth in \nClark County. We have high schools that are approaching 5,000 kids. So \nthe safer routes to school program will help promote healthy living by \nmaking it safer for children to walk or ride to school on bikes, not \ncars and buses. I am pleased this package moves the Nation's surface \ntransportation program forward without jeopardizing our natural \nenvironment.\n  One of the things we did in this bill, which was difficult, States \nhave complained about. Originally back before 1982, some States were \nbarely getting 80 percent of what they put into these trust funds. We \nmoved it to 85, 90.5. And now with this bill, the formula now before \nthe Senate, every State, by the end of this legislation, will get 95 \npercent of what they put in. That is very difficult. It goes without \nsaying that some of the States who were getting more than a dollar in \nyears past, a lot of them continue to get more than a dollar, but some \nof them don't. The State of Nevada, under this formula, gets less than \na dollar. But in fairness, the formula is a formula. It wouldn't have \nbeen right for the formula to be any different for me than it is for \nothers. So this is fair. We have made it so every State at the end of \nthis bill will get at least 95 percent.\n  In this legislation every State will get a percentage increase. This \nlegislation is not perfect, but it is about as fair as we could do. I \nhave worked with my staff the last 4 or 5 days to say, could you come \nup with something. I had a few problems with the legislation. Come up \nwith something. I will talk to Senator Inhofe because we might have a \nformula that may be better. We couldn't come up with one. I wish we \ncould have, but we couldn't. But what we have done here is the best we \ncould do. The vast majority of the States will do extremely well \ncompared to what they did in the past.\n  As with any compromise, this is not perfect. It is inevitable that \nsome States will not be completely satisfied with the results, but it \nis important to note every State benefits from the growth in this \nprogram.\n  We worked hard to create a funding mechanism that allows all 50 \nStates plus the District of Columbia to benefit from program growth \nwhile addressing several competing fundraising priorities: Donor versus \ndonee, old versus new, urban versus rural. These have all been put in \nthis formula, and we have\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\ncome up with what is as fair as we think we can do. The bill before us \naccomplishes that goal.\n  Once more, let me emphasize, every State benefits from the growth in \nthe program. So again, I extend my appreciation to my colleagues--the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the chairman of the full committee, and \nSenator Jeffords, the ranking member--for the good work they have done. \nWe are all going to have to be vigilant. I hope those who want to \nchange the bill come here and offer amendments. I hope they do it as \nsoon as possible. We hope to get to this bill tomorrow. We are hopeful \nand confident the motion to proceed should be overwhelmingly approved. \nI can't imagine anyone voting against this.\n\n  I was told by the person who asked me to object on their behalf on \nthe motion to proceed that that Senator was concerned about the transit \nportion of the bill. That has been taken care of. The chairmen of the \ntwo committees have signed off on this. I hope we can move forward on \nthis very quickly.\n  Again, I am glad we are here. What we do on this legislation will set \na tone for the rest of this legislative year. I hope we can permit it. \nI should be more confident, like the players in the Super Bowl and the \ncoaches: We are going to finish this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I reextend my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Nevada for all the help he has been. His expertise is well known \nin this Chamber, and he has been on the opposite side of me probably \nmore than on my side. I like it this way better.\n  I would like to amplify a couple things Senator Reid talked about. I \nthink it is significant, when you talk about where we are now relative \nto where we were in TEA-21, the last 6-year reauthorization. Our \naverage is 35.6 percent higher. The average State is higher than it was \nin TEA-21.\n  In the comments he made about a computer run, I know this is kind of \ncomplicated to explain to people because it is the only way I think you \ncan come up with something that is very fair. Prior to this, in \nprevious years under TEA-21, we had the 1104 table which was a minimum \nguarantee. That was a percentage that each State had that was a \npercentage of the total growth. It was purely politically driven.\n  I don't like the way some of these things come out of the computer. \nBut when this came out, I agreed with Senator Reid, there is not a \nbetter way of doing it. I will give an example. I was talking to one of \nthe Senators from Pennsylvania who was complaining about perhaps not \ngetting the share they should have gotten. So I did a comparison.\n  My State of Oklahoma--I hope no one from Oklahoma is listening right \nnow--is 70,000 square miles. Pennsylvania is 46,000 square miles. My \nState of Oklahoma has a population of 3.5 million. They have 12.2 \nmillion. The historic rate of return since we came in to the first \nbill, through Senator Moynihan, has been .87 percent. Pennsylvania has \nbeen 1.16 percent. This is the key: the total miles. Unfortunately, I \ndon't have this less toll roads, but I will explain the difference.\n\n  If you take the total amount of miles in my State of Oklahoma, it is \n112,000 miles. The total number of miles in Pennsylvania is 119,500 \nmiles, but that includes toll roads. We all know Pennsylvania has a lot \nof toll roads. So when you take them out, I am quite sure the number of \nmiles we refer to in this legislation would be more than Pennsylvania. \nAnd yet if you look back historically, in 1998, Oklahoma received $351 \nmillion; Pennsylvania $1.16 billion. In 1999, Oklahoma received $413 \nmillion; $1.3 billion for Pennsylvania. It goes on consistent with \nthat.\n  What I am saying is, even under the formula we are looking at right \nnow, Pennsylvania is getting back about three times the amount. Again, \nthere are other factors. I am sure we will be talking about those from \nState to State. But it shows it is very difficult to come up with \nsomething that is fair. There is not one State that will not be able to \ngo back to their people and say how well their State is doing under \nthis.\n  I don't sound like a conservative Republican when I am talking this \nway, but this is one area where conservatives believe Government has a \nfunction, a strong role, and that is to build infrastructure. We have \nnot been doing a good job of it. I know this because I spent 8 years in \nthe other body. During that time, I was on the committee called Public \nWorks and Transportation. It is strictly transportation, not like EPW, \nwhich is environment, all the regulatory agencies, and transportation. \nSo it is just about half the jurisdiction. But during that time, we \nwatched what was going on, and I was right on top of it.\n  When I came over to this body in 1994, I became chairman of the Clean \nAir Subcommittee. I kind of left the transportation part. When we came \nback and I became chairman of the Transportation Infrastructure \nSubcommittee, all of a sudden I realized what had happened in the 4 \nyears I had been detached from transportation.\n  When you talk about the number of vehicles that are traveling, the \nnumber of trucks, the number of congestive stops, where you have to sit \nand idle your engine--we are handling all of these things in this bill. \nI think during that 4-year period we did a bad job. We didn't do what \nwe should have done. Quite frankly, in 1998, I wasn't real happy that \nwe weren't really meeting the problem. A computer run is tough. You \nhave to consider that some States are fast growing States, such as \nNevada, big States such as California, Florida, Texas, and some of them \nwould be complaining that they are not doing too well. It is because \nyou have to have a ceiling, a growth ceiling. If you have a growth \nceiling and they are getting back an inordinate amount of money, it \nbumps into that ceiling. At the same time, you have donor and donee \nStates. If you take Texas and Pennsylvania, both of which might argue \nthey are not treated fairly, if you make a change in one, it is making \nan adverse change in the other. I think we have to say we have done a \ngood job when you look at this.\n  One thing I think is important to talk about is the public views. I \nthink the general feeling is that we spend too much money in \nWashington, and I think we do. But when it comes to their views on \ntransportation investment, it is totally different. In January, last \nmonth of this year, Zogby International conducted interviews of a \nthousand likely voters chosen at random nationwide. That is a pretty \nbig sampling, as those of us know who read these polls. It is about \ntwice the size of the average poll.\n  Eighty-seven percent of those interviewed said the Nation's highway \nand public transit network is very important to the Nation's economy; \n83 percent agreed that President Bush and Congress should do more to \nhelp create jobs for those Americans who want to work, even though the \nlatest Government statistics suggest that the U.S. economy is \nrebounding; 69 percent favored boosting Federal spending on \ntransportation projects during 2004, and that is significant--69 \npercent of the Americans favor boosting the amount of money of Federal \nspending on transportation projects during 2004 as part of the \ntransportation or jobs creation initiative, as well as part of the \ntransportation needs and infrastructure needs. I think that is very \nsignificant. According to the same pollster, that is how nearly 70 \npercent of American voters responded.\n  In a survey they conducted a year before, they said they believe \nAmerica is facing a transportation capacity crisis. That is what I was \nsaying we were observing a year ago--that our Nation's roads, airports, \nand mass transit systems are struggling to handle a growing population \neconomy. Fifty-six percent overall, and 79 percent of young women with \nchildren, said traffic congestion is depriving them of more time with \ntheir families or for leisure activities than it did just 5 years ago. \nThat is significant.\n  These are social problems that exist because we are not doing an \nadequate job. These answers should not surprise anyone. It says that, \nsince 1982, the U.S. population has grown almost 19 percent, the number \nof registered motor vehicles has increased by 36 percent, and vehicle \nmiles traveled has ballooned 72 percent. Surprise, over the past 20 \nyears, we have added less than 5 percent to road capacity and even less \nthan that to public transit. So we added even 5 percent less to road \ncapacity in spite of the fact that the population has grown 19 percent \nand the\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\nmotor vehicles have increased by 36 percent.\n\n  Just take that as one statement, one statistic, and that justifies \neverything we are doing in trying to beef this up. It proves that what \nwe are doing now is inadequate, but it is the best we can do under the \ncircumstances.\n  Forty-eight percent of those surveyed by Zogby described the \ncondition of the roads in their local communities as either fair or \npoor. That was the assessment of 75 percent of Hispanic Americans.\n  The survey polled a random sample of a thousand likely voters \nnationwide--the margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent--and \nhighways and public transit are consistently important to Americans. \nThey said in a commentary accompanying the survey that highway safety \nand efficient public transit are also high priorities. Overcrowded \nroads are not only a concern for commuters but also for Americans who \nare nervous about another terrorist attack.\n  Other key findings: 80 percent think the Nation's highways and public \ntransit network is extremely important or very important to the U.S. \neconomy. The fact is, I commented in my opening remarks that this is by \nfar the biggest jobs bill that we can be considering at any time. That \nis what 80 percent of Americans say.\n  Nearly 8 in 10 also agree that an investment in highways, bridges, \nand public transit should be considered an important element in \nhomeland security and national defense. We know this administration is \nvery concerned about national security and homeland defense. I am glad \nthey are. We are overdue in addressing these issues. The people agree \nwith that, also.\n  Nearly 90 percent feel it is important that their representatives in \nCongress fight to ensure sufficient Federal funding for transportation \nimprovement projects in their local areas. That is interesting because \nthis is at a time when people are complaining about the amount of money \nwe are spending.\n  Two-thirds of Americans say roads and public transit systems play a \nhighly important role in their everyday lives. We are concerned about \ncongestion. I am in my State of Oklahoma. I am sure it is the same \nproblem in North Carolina and virtually in every State.\n  One of the foremost authorities in putting together, consolidating \nthe concerns has been the Texas Transport International; that is the \nTexas Aggies' group that put together something that they conduct \nannually--not just in Texas but throughout the country--as to what we \nare going to do about congestion. They said, less than a year ago, that \n59 percent of the Nation's roadways today are experiencing significant \ntraffic congestion compared to only 34 percent in 1982.\n  Fully two-thirds of the major roads in the 75 U.S. urban areas are \ncongested during peak travel periods, compared to only one-third in \n1982. That is double. Both figures will increase without additional \ninvestment. The average number of hours per day with congestion that \nmight be encountered on urban roads has risen from 4.5 hours in 1982 to \nabout 7 hours in 2001.\n  The average annual delays per peak road traveled in 75 urban areas is \n60 hours. That is significant because, when you have delays, you are \nalso talking about pollution and about leaving cars running and trucks \nrunning, polluting the air, using up the fuel. We have an energy crisis \nin this country to start with.\n  Traffic congestion is now responsible for 5.7 billion gallons of \nwasted motor fuel. The total cost of traffic congestion to the U.S. \neconomy and lost productivity and wasted motor fuel in 2001 was almost \n$69.5 billion, or putting it down so we understand it, that is $528 per \nperson. I think sometimes we throw around figures of billions and \ntrillions and it is difficult to understand, certainly, for people who \nare not spending this much time studying these things in Washington. \nThat $69 billion equals $528 per person.\n  Shortly, I am going to talk about some of the other areas of the bill \nspecifically, section by section. At this point, I will yield the floor \nbecause I understand the senior Senator from Texas has comments she \nwould like to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the chairman for allowing me \nto speak on this legislation because let me say that I hope in the end \nI will be able to support the bill.\n  At this point, I could not possibly do that because of the inequity \nto Texas. Let me say that I know the chairman is working with other \nMembers to try to come up with solutions, and I hope I will be able to \nsupport the bill in the end.\n  Most of the goods that drive our economy ride on our Nation's \nhighways in large part because over the past 50 years the Federal Aid \nHighway Program has assisted the States in producing one of the world's \nfinest highway and mass transit networks.\n  The majority of that system was designed in the 1950s to meet the \nneeds of a rapidly growing nation to connect to new population centers \nin the West. Today, there are other critical needs to be addressed \ndifferent from those in the 1950s, particularly the amount of trade \nthat is stemming from NAFTA and the increased burden on our \ninfrastructure that NAFTA produces.\n  Although strong trade partnerships with our neighbors--Mexico and \nCanada--have provided substantial national benefits, the resultant \ntraffic is devastating to our Nation's infrastructure.\n  Back in the 1950s, our smaller States and Western States needed the \nextra help at the expense of States such as Texas. But now, I think, \nevery State has more of an ability to contribute to its own \ninfrastructure. The ability to contribute is much more equal today than \nit was in the fifties when there were huge inequities in the amount of \nnational infrastructure.\n  The State that has borne the greatest burden in the entire life of \nthe Federal Aid Highway Program has been my home State of Texas. We are \nthe single largest donor State. Since 1956, Texas has contributed over \n$5 billion more to the program than the State has received in funds to \nbuild its own highways. In fact, there has never been a year that Texas \nreceived more in highway funding than it sent to Washington.\n  Texas has the most highway miles of any State in our Nation. \nTherefore, the people of Texas, obviously, buy more gasoline and, \ntherefore, contribute more to the tax. Over the past 12 years, Texas \nand other donor States have made good progress. In 1998, Texas received \nonly a 76-cent return on every dollar sent to Washington, a loss of \n$1.7 billion. Current law guarantees us 90.5 cents on the dollar, but \nthis is still very inequitable.\n  Though we expected to equalize more this year, hoping to get up to 95 \ncents at least, that has not happened. I cannot possibly support the \nhighway funding formula in this bill. I am concerned that in an effort \nto limit costs, the committee created a new class of superdonor States.\n  It appears that Texas, California, and Florida have been designated \nto shoulder the burden of the Nation's transportation network at the \nexpense of their own. I have to object to this new superdonor category.\n  The bill before us distributes $227 billion in highway funds using a \nformula that will hold six States--Texas, California, Arizona, \nColorado, Florida, and Maryland--at a 90.5 cent rate of return for 5 \nyears. So for every dollar our constituents send to Washington, they \nget 90.5 cents back. Only in the final year, the sixth year, does that \nincrease to the level of 95 cents. If Texas were to receive 95 cents \nfor all 6 years, the formula would provide Texas an additional $700 \nmillion over this period.\n  These superdonor States have one aspect in common: They are the \nfastest growing States in America. Ironically, the formula in the bill \noffers the least relief to States whose needs are most pronounced, \nStates whose cities and populations are developing most rapidly. Three \nof these six also are on the Southwest border, so we have the added \nburden of infrastructure needs from NAFTA in addition to being high \ngrowth states.\n  The committee thinks we should like this legislation because while \nthe total spending grows 36 percent, Texas will see a 42 percent dollar \nincrease compared to 6 years ago. However, our increase has little to \ndo with the formula but is caused by Texas buying more gas and paying \nmore taxes into the highway trust fund.\n\n[[Page S349]]\n\n  In 2002, Texas contributed 9.11 percent of the total dollars in the \ntrust fund, up from 8.27 percent 4 years earlier. Buying more gas \nallows us to contribute more funds. We do grow in dollars returning to \nthe state, but we don't grow as much as we are putting in. We keep the \nsame rate of return, 90.5 cents on the dollar, until the sixth year.\n  Ever since the 1993 passage of NAFTA, it is these fast-growing \nsuperdonor States that are the major trade gateways to the United \nStates. Eighty percent of NAFTA traffic travels through my home State \nof Texas. But while the entire Nation benefits from that resulting \ncommerce, Texas bears the brunt of maintenance and upkeep on our \nhighways, and those costs are not insignificant.\n  To its credit, the committee did, for the first time, create a border \nand a corridor fund that represents some of that added burden on the \nStates on our northern border with Canada and our southern border with \nMexico. I commend the chairman and thank him for adding those funds.\n  However, the $1 billion for each of those funds which, by the time \nTexas gets its fair share, will still not bring us up anywhere close to \nthe $700 million we are losing by not being treated like other donor \nStates.\n  In 2002, over 4 million trucks hauling 18 billion pounds of cargo \nentered from Mexico through 24 commercial border crossing facilities. \nOver 3 million of those trucks, or 68 percent, entered through Texas.\n  In addition to commercial traffic, 90 million personal vehicles from \nMexico also traveled through the Southwest border States. So Texas now \nwith a bigger infrastructure burden is getting less percentage of what \nit sends to Washington than almost all of the other States.\n  I am just hoping the chairman will work with us, not to create a new \nsuperdonor State category. I hope we don't break precedent and create \nthis new sort of stepchild in donor States that will also be used for \nother formulas for other kinds of State aid.\n  I understand small States have the ability to have more votes in the \nSenate. I understand small States may believe they should have more of \na piece of the pie than the larger States. However, representing a \nlarge State as I do, I just have to say I think we are all much more \nequal in capacity now than States have ever been before, and the \nconcept that there should be donor and donee States should be going by \nthe wayside.\n  I am not saying we would want to do something that cuts people off \nprecipitously or hurts people immediately, but I think we ought to be \nin a phasedown of the entire donor-donee State strategy or attitude \nbecause I think every State should be able to decide, getting 100 \npercent of what it sends to Washington, what it wants the money spent \nfor. If we are going to have a Federal highway system, we all want it \nto be a good system, and perhaps there should be some donor capacity. \nBut a 10-cent-on-the-dollar donation seems to me to be too high. I hope \nthe chairman will work with us to create all donor States equal, to \ncreate everyone at least at a 95-percent rate of return. The House bill \ntreats all of the donor States the same. Donee States do vary all \nacross the board. But we have never made a new class of donor States, \nand I hope we will not do it in this bill.\n  I hope the chairman will work with those of us who believe there \nshould be a much more equitable funding formula so that I can support \nthe good provisions in this bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. As we talked about before, there are always problems in \nformulas. There are so many things to consider, as we outlined, such as \nfast-growing States, large States, small States. I would have to say to \nthe senior Senator from Texas, we in Oklahoma are kind of in the same \nsituation as Texas. We have always been a donor State. We are just \ndelighted to look down the road and see that there is a light at the \nend of the tunnel and that we are getting to the point where we will \nall have a minimum of 95 percent. I can remember when that number was \nat 77 percent and then 80 percent and then 90.5 percent and now up to \n95 percent.\n  This is one of the difficulties. The Senator from Texas is from one \nof the three largest States and it is a fast-growing State. In my \nopening remarks, I mentioned that to come up with a formula, as the \nSenator from Nevada has said, it is a very difficult thing, because \nthere are fast-growing States. There has to be a ceiling but there also \nhas to be a floor. There has to be consideration for donee and donor.\n  I thought it was kind of interesting, during the remarks of the \nSenator from Texas, that the Senator from Nevada came over and said, I \nwish we were doing as well as Texas on percentages.\n  Later on we are going to have full-size charts.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, could I offer to make that trade to \nthe Senator from Nevada on a percentage basis? I will trade him right \nnow.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Later on we are hoping we are going to have larger charts \nto be able to show one for every State, but this one which I will hold \nup--I hope everyone will be able to see it--if we take under TEA-21 the \naverage in the State of Texas was $2.1 billion. That is the average of \neach year for a 6-year period. Starting in 2004, they would go up to \n$2.6 billion; 2005, $2.8 billion; 2006, $2.9 billion; and going on up \nat the end of 2009, it would be $3.6 billion, almost $3.7 billion, \nwhich is a huge increase, of course, over previous years.\n  I recognize there will be a lot of States that are not going to be \nhappy with their formulas. It is those people who try to find a better \nformula, after we put all of our resources together and spent a year \ndoing this, who have had a very difficult time coming up with something \nthat is going to be any better.\n  Quite frankly, I spent some time in Texas. I held a field hearing in \nTexas. I talked to them and hopefully they are going to be very pleased \nwith the massive increases, the percentage increase. For the State of \nTexas under this bill over TEA-21, the previous 6-year authorization \nbill, is 42 percent. Now the average increase is 35.6 percent. So Texas \nis way above the average increase and way above the average amount of \nthe average States.\n  I recognize there are problems with any formula, but those are some \nfacts we are dealing with and things we had to consider. It is always \ndifficult when representing 50 States, as we were in the committee. I \nwould like to have done a lot better for my State of Oklahoma. I know \nSenator Santorum talked to me about some of the problems in his State. \nWhen we look at the State of Texas and the State of Pennsylvania, where \nthere is a donee State that is dissatisfied, the only way that can be \nimproved would be to do something to lower the ceiling in the other \nStates. So it is a difficult thing to deal with.\n\n  I certainly will yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I do understand the difficulty of \ndealing with these formulas, and I am sure the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member tried in every way to please as many \npeople as they possibly could. It just seems wrong to create a new \nlevel of super donor State. Yes, we have increased to 42 percent \ninstead of the average 36 percent, but that is because our people are \nputting more in the highway fund because we are buying more gasoline. \nTherefore, of course, our rate of increase would go up. We are still in \nthe same position of sending a dollar to Washington and getting 90.5 \ncents back until year 6. It is just hard to see that a donee State has \nmore infrastructure burden than a State like Texas which not only has \nthe most highway miles but has 80 percent of the traffic from NAFTA.\n  I would love to take the chairman of the committee to I-35 where it \nis a parking lot from Austin to Dallas. It takes more time to drive \nfrom Austin to Dallas than it does to fly from Austin to Washington. It \nis just ridiculous. It is a parking lot, and that is because it comes \nfrom Mexico through Texas and we do not have the capability to expand \nat the rate the traffic is expanding on that NAFTA corridor.\n  As I said in my statement, the chairman did create a real border \ncorridor fund that will be helpful, but it still does not nearly make \nup for the deficit we are sending in this new super donor\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nState capacity to Washington. It is $700 million we could be spending \non our own infrastructure trying to meet these needs if we could get 95 \ncents on the dollar back so every donor State would be equal.\n  I know it was hard. I absolutely appreciate that. Unfortunately, \nrepresenting Texas for 10 years, I have been in a lot of the formula \nfights, and small States tend to win. I know the Senator from Oklahoma \nhas been a donor State and knows how it feels, so he probably \nunderstands how I feel right now. I just hope in the end we can see \nthat we will get to 95 cents either through the help of the border \ncorridors or in the formula in some way to acknowledge we should not be \na super donor State with all of the problems we have.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reclaiming my time, there is a lot of truth to what the \nSenator says. One thing that needs to be clarified, and we have asked \nthe staff to do it because it has not been done before, is to see--I \nmean, we are in the same situation. The State of Texas today is getting \nback 90.5 percent. We are getting back 90.5 percent. It is kind of an \ninteresting study that is being conducted right now to determine how \nmuch of the money--when the Senator says Texans pay in so much and get \nback so much, a lot of the fuel that is being purchased, subject to \nexcise tax, is not purchased by citizens of Texas, particularly talking \nabout a corridor going through. I know when I am down there, I purchase \na lot of fuel. That same I-35 goes through my State of Oklahoma. A lot \nof the NAFTA traffic is traffic that is not Texas traffic, but they are \npurchasing fuel there. It would be interesting to know whether or not \nthe citizens of my State of Oklahoma or the citizens of State of Texas \nare actually getting back perhaps more than they are paying in in fuel \nrevenues.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That would certainly be an interesting study to have. \nI would also point out that part of the purpose of the gasoline tax is \nto maintain highways for use, and even if it is someone like the \nSenator or someone using the highway for NAFTA purposes, they are using \nthe highway and it is the wear and tear that must be maintained.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  I do not see others waiting to be heard. As we all know, tonight, in \nabout an hour and 25 minutes from now, we will be having a cloture \nvote. Is that correct, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Between now and then, we will have a chance to hear from \na lot of people, and as they come in I would be glad to have them heard \non this subject. In the meantime, I will make a statement that I would \notherwise be making after the cloture vote. I am hoping the cloture \nvote will be successful and we can move right on to this very \nsignificant vote. In the meantime, I am inclined to want to share a few \nthings that are in this bill, which I would be glad to do at this time, \nand then yield to any Senator who comes in who may want to be heard.\n  I ask the Chair to go ahead and recognize the Senator from \nMassachusetts now, if he wishes to be recognized. Mine is going to be a \nrather long statement. We will go ahead and move to that when the \nSenator from Massachusetts is through.\n\n\n                Congratulating the New England Patriots\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, the matters before us are of enormous importance to \nthis country, and certainly to my State. These issues dealing with road \ntransportation and mass transit are basic, fundamental to our Nation's \ninfrastructure and our economy. We are going to be focusing on this \nover the next several days. We are very much looking forward to it. \nThere is an incredible need for attention to these important \ninvestments.\n  But I welcome the opportunity to take just a moment or two at this \ntime to recognize the extraordinary success last evening, when the New \nEngland Patriots played the Carolina Panthers. Some 80 million \nAmericans watched that extraordinary game.\n  I have a resolution which will give me a great deal of pleasure to \noffer in behalf of myself and my colleague and friend, Senator Kerry, \nwho is not here physically but joins with his enthusiasm to urge \nfavorable consideration of this resolution which is meant to \ncongratulate the New England Patriots for their dramatic victory in \nyesterday's Super Bowl. It could not have been more exciting.\n  With 7 seconds remaining in the game, the score tied, Adam Vinatieri \nkicked a 41-yard field goal to clinch the Patriot's second Super Bowl \nsuccess in the past 3 years. Mr. Vinatieri is making a trademark of \nkicking the winning field goals in Super Bowls. Two years ago, his 48-\nyard field goal won the game as time expired.\n  I also congratulate Tom Brady, the youngest quarterback in National \nFootball League history to win two Super Bowls. He had another \noutstanding day with 350 yards passing and had 3 touchdown passes. Mr. \nBrady's performance gave him his second Super Bowl Most Valuable Player \ntrophy in 3 years.\n  The Patriots had a remarkable season. They tied the Miami Dolphins' \nrecord in 1972, winning 15 straight games. Much of the credit goes to \nthe man named Coach of the Year, Bill Belichick, and his two \noutstanding assistant coaches, Romeo Crennel, who produced the No. 1 \ndefense in the National Football League, and Charlie Weiss, who \nproduced the team's outstanding offense.\n  Among the Patriots' heroes of last night's game, and for the entire \nseason as well, was the offensive line. They did an outstanding job of \nprotecting quarterback Tom Brady. In fact, they allowed no sacks of the \nquarterback in the Super Bowl or in any of the other games in the post-\nseason playoffs. Truly a remarkable record.\n  I want the Senate to adopt the pending resolution commending the \nPatriots on their dramatic victory in a game that will surely rank as \none of the most exciting Super Bowls ever.\n  I notice in the chair the wonderful Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. \nDole. I commend, certainly, her enthusiasm for her team. She has \nreminded me of that enthusiasm and her very strong support. I commend \nthe Carolina team for showing extraordinary sportsmanship and \ncompetitiveness and just a superb performance by that team.\n  If it is agreeable, I believe the resolution is at the desk. I \nbelieve it has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We do not have the resolution at the desk.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will call for consideration of the \nresolution at a later time. We will do that, under prior agreement, at \na time, as I understand it, that will be later in the afternoon.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another subject, I want to address the \nSenate for just a few moments on one of the important aspects of the \nPresident's budget. The President's budget should be looked at, not \nonly for what it contains, but also for what is not included in the \nbudget.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield so I can make a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am very interested in hearing the \nremarks of the senior Senator from Massachusetts. However, we are right \nnow debating the cloture motion. While I think it is perfectly \nappropriate to talk about the game last night, I hate to get into \nanother subject when we only have an hour and 20 minutes to be talking \nabout our cloture motion.\n  I, first of all, ask the Senator if this is something that could be \npostponed until after that motion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know we just heard my good friend from Texas talk \nabout the Border Patrol and the commission that has been established.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Which is on this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is on this bill. I am conscious of that. I will not \ntake a great deal of time, but I am not familiar with restrictions. I \ninquired of the Chair to be able to work out a suitable time to be able \nto speak. I don't intend to take much time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate has to be relevant to the pending \nmeasure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I will make it to be.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the quorum call \nbe vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Under the rules, it is my wish, as the chairman of the \ncommittee, that we get to this very important bill. The Senator from \nMassachusetts has agreed, if he could be recognized, he would keep it \ndown to 10 minutes. That would be acceptable to me, if it is \nacceptable?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That will be fine. I ask to be notified when I have 30 \nseconds left.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Madam President, the President's budget that was submitted today, \nwhich is really the declaration by the administration with regards to \ndefense and national security, but also is extraordinarily important in \nterms of health policy and education. There is probably not a more \nimportant document that is submitted by any President than the budget \nitem indicating a nation's priorities. So that is why I wanted to be \nable to just take a few moments on one particular aspect of it, and \nthat is the state of our economy and how this budget addresses the \nstate of that economy or how it failed to do so.\n  I just wanted to share with the Senate the strong sense that we are \nin a jobless recovery. This economy may be fine for Wall Street, but it \nis bad for Main Street. I have certainly seen that in the last weeks or \nmonths that I have had a chance to get around this country. I saw it up \nin the State of New Hampshire, where every new job is paying 35 percent \nless than the jobs that had disappeared. I saw that down in New Mexico, \nwhere you still have 78,000 workers who are waiting for an increase in \nthe minimum wage and the new jobs are paying 23 percent less.\n  It is the same in Arizona, in Michigan, in South Carolina, and across \nthe country. South Carolina has lost tens of thousands of jobs. So I \nwas interested about what is in this budget, or what would fail to be \nin this budget, with regard to American workers.\n  One of the principal concerns that I find from families while \ntraveling across this country is the failure of the Senate to respond \nto the problems of those who are unemployed with the extension of the \nunemployment insurance. There are 90,000 workers a week who are losing \ntheir unemployment compensation. There is virtually nothing in this \nlegislation that deals with that. The unemployment compensation fund \nhas nearly $20 billion.\n  The proposal that has been offered by Senator Cantwell and others \nwould provide for some 13 weeks of unemployment compensation. It has \nbeen rejected by the other side more than 12 different times.\n  Look at this chart. It shows the average number of out-of-work \nAmericans who are running out of unemployment benefits and not finding \njobs. The average monthly rate from 1973 to 2003 was 150,000. The \nestimate for January 2004 is 375,000. And there is not one word in here \nto recommend that we have a temporary extension of unemployment \ncompensation.\n  These are all hard-working Americans. They are not eligible for the \nunemployment compensation fund unless they have paid into it. They have \npaid into it. And we are finding objection from the other side to \nproviding some relief for these workers. I can't believe that.\n  Second, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a New \nYork Times editorial from Friday that makes this very point I have just \nmade. I will quote part of it.\n\n       The pernicious joblessness bedeviling the nation is \n     spawning a new category of Americans dubbed ``exhaustees''; \n     the hundreds of thousands of hard-core unemployed who have \n     run through State and Federal unemployment aid. According to \n     the latest estimates, close to 2 million Americans, futilely \n     hunting for work while scrambling for economic sustenance, \n     will join the ranks of exhaustees in the next six months. \n     They represent a record flood of unemployed individuals with \n     expired benefits--the highest in 30 years--who are plainly \n     desperate for help.\n       The emergency program cries out for immediate renewal.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that full editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 2004]\n\n                     Exhausting Federal Compassion\n\n       The pernicious joblessness bedeviling the nation is \n     spawning a new category of Americans dubbed ``exhaustees'': \n     the hundreds of thousands of hard-core unemployed who have \n     run through state and federal unemployment aid. According to \n     the latest estimates, close to two million Americans, \n     futilely hunting for work while scrambling for economic \n     sustenance, will join the ranks of exhaustees in the next six \n     months. They represent a record flood of unemployed \n     individuals with expired benefits--the highest in 30 years--\n     who are plainly desperate for help.\n       President Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress are \n     doing nothing to help these people. Washington showed no \n     qualms last month in allowing the expiration of the emergency \n     federal program that had offered an extra 13 weeks of help to \n     those who exhausted state benefits. Historically, such help \n     has been continued in periods of continuing job shortages.\n       A year ago, the aid was extended an extra year by \n     Republican leaders. But now, the G.O.P.'s election-year talk \n     is of a recovery rooted in the tax cuts weighted for affluent \n     America. Tending to the exhaustees clearly mars that message.\n       The emergency program cries out for immediate renewal. It \n     costs $1 billion a month, money that is available from the \n     federal unemployment fund.\n       In January alone, 375,000 unemployed people are running out \n     of state benefits with nothing to help them through to \n     spring, according to estimates of new federal data by the \n     Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a capital watchdog \n     group. Without action, the exhaustee toll will mount.\n       Many will slip into the limbo of the more than 1.5 million \n     Americans who have given up looking for work in the inert \n     employment market. These amount to the flatliners, \n     industrious people overlooked on the administration's screen \n     of spiking recovery indexes.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I also want to mention one other item \nthat is included by reference. That is the item of the President \ntalking about his overtime provisions.\n  Again, he has indicated his support on the overtime provisions that \nwill effectively eliminate overtime coverage for 8 million Americans--\nprimarily firefighters, policemen, and nurses, who are the backbone for \nhomeland security.\n  I have said here a number of times that I was not only strongly \nobjecting to the administration's proposal but I particularly object to \nthe inclusion in the administration's proposal that talked about \ntraining in the Armed Forces which can make a worker overtime \nineligible. That, I thought, was the cruelest part of the proposal.\n  We have American service men and women who are in Iraq, in combat, or \nin the National Guard and Reserve. Many of them will be coming right \nback and will return to the civilian job market. Yet if they are going \nto have the training in the Armed Forces, they could be ineligible for \novertime. I have said that before on the floor of the Senate.\n  My good friend Secretary Chao--and I see the former Secretary of \nLabor presiding over the Senate--wrote a letter to Speaker Dennis \nHastert. She pointed out we shouldn't worry about the fact of the \nmilitary.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Secretary of Labor,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 2004.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I write to provide you with the facts to \n     correct the record following last week's Senate floor debate \n     on the Consolidated Appropriations Act with regard to the \n     Department of Labor's proposed revision of the Fair Labor \n     Standard Act's overtime exemption regulations. I also would \n     like to thank you for your support and leadership on the \n     important issue.\n       The recent allegations that military personnel and veterans \n     will lose overtime pay, because of proposed clarifications of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) ``white-collar'' \n     exemption regulations, are incorrect and harmful to the \n     morale of veterans and of American servicemen and women. I \n     want to assure you that military personnel and veterans are \n     not affected by these proposed rules by virtue of their \n     military duties or training.\n       First, the Part 541 ``white collar exemptions'' do not \n     apply to the military. They cover only the civilian \n     workforce.\n       Second, nothing in the current or proposed regulation makes \n     any mention of veteran status. Despite claims that military \n     training would make veterans ineligible for overtime pay, \n     members of Congress should be clear that the Department of \n     Labor's proposed rules will not strip any veteran of overtime \n     eligibility.\n       This has been one of many criticisms intended to confuse \n     and frighten workers\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\n     about our proposal to revise the badly outdated regulations \n     under the FLSA ``white collar'' exemption regulations. It is \n     disheartening that the debate over modernizing these \n     regulations to meet the needs of the 21st Century workforce \n     has largely ignored the broad consensus that this rule needs \n     substantial revision to strengthen overtime protections.\n       The growing ambiguities caused by time and workplace \n     advancements have made both employers' compliance with this \n     rule and employees' understanding of their rights \n     increasingly difficult. More and more, employees must resort \n     to class action lawsuits to recover their overtime pay. These \n     workers must wait several years to have their cases \n     adjudicated in order to get the overtime they have already \n     earned. In fact, litigation over these rules drains nearly $2 \n     billion a year from the economy, costing jobs and better pay.\n       I hope that this latest concern will be put to rest \n     immediately. Once again, I assure you that military duties \n     and training or veteran status have no bearing on overtime \n     eligibility. We hope that future debate on this important \n     provision is more constructive. If we can provide further \n     assistance in setting the record straight, we would be \n     pleased to do so. The Office of Management and Budget has \n     advised that there is no objection from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program to the presentation of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elaine L. Chao.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, let me quote a couple of parts of it. \nThis is the letter to the Speaker by Secretary Chao stating ``that \nmilitary personnel and veterans are not affected by these proposed \nrules by virtue of their military duties or training.''\n  That is what she says.\n  However:\n\n       Proposed section 541.301(d) states that ``training in the \n     armed forces'' can make a worker an overtime ineligible.\n\n  This is new language. It is not in the current regulations. The only \npurpose is to take away overtime for veterans. Either it is in there or \nit is not in there. It happens to be in the regulation.\n  She states:\n\n       First, Part 541 ``white collar exemptions'' do not apply to \n     the military. They cover only the civilian workforce.\n\n  No one is claiming that the rule affects the military force. The \nissue is the veterans who leave the military to work in the civilian \nworkforce would lose overtime protections because they have had \ntraining in the Armed Forces. Then it goes on:\n\n       Second, nothing in the current or proposed regulation makes \n     any mention of veterans status.\n\n  No. But the proposed regulation, for the first time, addresses \n``training in the armed forces.'' Veterans who work in the civilian \nworkforce who typically have received such training.\n  It isn't the people who are in the military. We agree with that. It \nis after they get out that they are going to be subject to this. If \nthey don't want it in, they ought to have another rule that eliminates \nthat.\n  I want to bring to the Senate's attention the understanding of the \nNational Association of Manufacturers.\n\n       Bush overtime proposal denies overtime to veterans.\n       The overtime proposal explicitly states that training in \n     the armed forces can disqualify workers from overtime \n     protection. Many employer groups encourage the Bush \n     administration to deny overtime protection to more categories \n     of work, such as veterans.\n\n  Look at these comments from the National Association of \nManufacturers.\n\n       NAM applauds the department for including this alternative \n     means of establishing that an employee has the knowledge \n     required for the exemption from overtime protection to apply. \n     For example, many people who come out of the military have \n     the significant knowledge based on work experience.\n\n  There it is. Veterans who go in and have that specialized training \nwhich is so necessary not only for their security but the security of \ntheir squad members or their company members, their platoon, or \nwhatever it might be, they get that. When they come back as a member of \nthe National Guard and return to the civilian workforce, bang, zippo, \ntheir employer comes up and says, This is what the rule is. This is \nwhat the regulation is, the letter from the Secretary notwithstanding.\n  We are going to make an effort to eliminate that whole overtime rule \nbecause we do not believe the men and women who are the heart and soul \nof homeland security, who are the firefighters, police, nurses, and \nothers ought to be carved out from overtime protections. There are many \nproblems with our economy today, but one of them is not that our \nfirefighters and policemen and nurses are getting paid too much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend. I will take time at another time to \ngo through the various provisions of the budget dealing with education \nand health. I think it is important that the American people understand \nexactly what those provisions do and don't do for the American people.\n  I thank the floor manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from \nMassachusetts using the time. He has a concern about the extension of \nunemployment benefits, and we are all concerned about that. A lot of \nthat would be alleviated with the passage of the transportation bill. \nThis is the largest jobs bill we will be considering this year, or \nperhaps in a 6-year period. It is very significant.\n  Madam President, one of the goals for reauthorization of TEA-21 has \nbeen to increase the rate of return to donor States. We have talked \nabout that. We have had several bills in the past in which we wanted to \nachieve that. In this particular one, we achieved it to a smaller \ndegree in TEA-21. But in this reauthorization, we want to further \nincrease the return to donor States without negatively impacting the \ngrowth of donee States. That is where we get into the problem with the \nState of Texas and the State of Pennsylvania. If we do one, we will \nnegatively impact the other. Our goal has been to streamline the \nproject delivery process to create greater flexibility for States to \nspend their highway safety dollars in the areas of greatest need.\n\n  Most Members agree that in Washington we do not have all the answers. \nThe Presiding Officer would admit readily that people in North Carolina \nknow about the needs in North Carolina greater than we do. That is one \ngood thing about this program; we do leave a lot of it to the States. \nWe do more than that in this reauthorization. I have talked to people \nin a number of States, including people in the State of Texas, who are \nvery pleased with the idea that they are getting more flexibility. This \nbill recognizes they have a better idea of the needs of their State. I \ncertainly know that to be true in the State of Oklahoma.\n  Finally, the goals were to focus attention on freight movement. This \nhas not been considered. Freight movement is the responsible party for \na lot of the congestion referred to by several speakers so far, causing \ntrucks to idle, cars to idle, time wasted when pollution carries on \nwhere we are paying for additional gasoline but nothing is moving.\n  Although the proposed bill before the Senate addresses each of these \nareas, it has not covered all the reforms I would like to cover. \nHowever, it is a good start. We made a good start. It has been in the \nspirit of cooperation. Historically, when we reauthorize a highway \nbill, it is not partisan. As we worked together, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Reid, Senator Bond, and myself, in many hours of putting \ntogether our best ideas, there were things I would have preferred to \nhave in here that are not here. This is a good start.\n  The Federal aid highway system is a key component to America's \ncontinued economic growth. The free flow and movement of goods, safety \nfor travelers, advancement and use of technology, and security of our \nborders and freight corridors are essential to our economic stability. \nOur investment in this critical infrastructure is not only required for \npeople in goods movement but almost the foremost link in creation of \njobs and opportunities for all Americans and represents the largest \ninvesting in discretionary programs.\n  I remember seeing that familiar square-shaped sign ``Men Working'' \nand someone very creatively inserted ``Not''--``Men Not Working.'' It \nis clear, each day we fail to enact a comprehensive 6-year \nreauthorization of the highway program, we continue to erode the \nability of our economy to grow.\n  Many colleagues share my strong desire to get this bill passed and \nsent to the President by February 29. On February 29, the extension we \nhave on TEA-21 expires. No State benefits by\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\nprolonging the process through temporary extensions of the current \nprogram. It disrupts planning; it disrupts the ability to plan ahead on \nthe availability of workers to get the very most out of it. It is very \nimportant we do that. The proposal before the Senate provides the \nframework for transportation investments needed to accomplish our \nshared goal of creating new and better economic opportunities.\n  The centerpiece of our bill is the new Equity Bonus Program which \nreplaces the Minimum Guarantee Program. The Equity Bonus Program \nincreases the minimum rate of return for donor States while ensuring \nfair treatment to donee States, about which we have been talking.\n\n  All donor States reach 95 percent return on highway trust funds by \n2009. That is a huge increase. We remember when it used to be 77 \npercent and 80 percent. In addition to the fact that we are going to \nget everyone up to 95 percent return in this bill, all States take home \nmore money than they did under TEA-21. Unlike the current Minimum \nGuarantee Program, which is in place right now, where the table in \nsection 1104 governed what your State received each year in Federal \nhighway dollars, under the Equity Bonus Program the formulas are the \ndriving force, not the politics.\n  The 1104 section approach, or minimum guarantee, is an approach that \nwas purely politically driven. A lot of people were outraged about it. \nBut they sat down and said we will put some percentages here until we \nreach 60 votes and we can pass a bill. But that is not fair. Certainly, \nwe correct that situation in this bill.\n  We allow the formulas to work. We recognized there would be some \ninequities if we allowed the formulas to be the sole factor in \ndistributing dollars to the States. Therefore, we subjected States to \ngrowth ceilings in each year; that is, there is a ceiling. So we get \nthe fast-growing States that will not have more than they would be \nentitled to at the expense of those that are currently donee States. \nThis accomplishes the two goals and keeps the costs of the Equity Bonus \nProgram affordable and ensures that donee States are still able to \ngrow.\n  We also recognized that States with lower tax bases have an added \nchallenge to adequate funding of their transportation system. We define \nthese States as States with low population or low population densities \nand low income. We guaranteed these States at least their TEA-21 rate \nof return.\n  Finally, large donor States do not reach 95 percent until 2009. This \nis a concern for some of the Senators from Florida, California, and \nTexas. This is because the growth ceilings prevent them from growing \ntoo fast at the expense of large donee States. This means they bump \ninto the ceiling. For instance, if we were to increase the growth \nceiling in any year to move the large donor States to 95 percent \nsooner, the increased costs would be at the expense of the large donee \nStates such as New York and Pennsylvania.\n  Since releasing this plan on January 21, I have heard from both large \ndonor State members who are concerned their States do not reach 95 \npercent until 2009 and donee State Senators who believe their States do \nnot grow as much as they would like. Both sides raise valid concerns. \nBut the cold reality is, in order to get the bill through the Senate--\nwe are talking about S. 1072, on which there will be a cloture vote an \nhour from now--it has to take care of both donor and donee States.\n  So there have to be compromises. We have made compromises. As the \nSenator from Nevada said, there are a lot of things he believed he \ncannot get for his State that he believed he should have, and the same \nis true for my State of Oklahoma.\n  After working on this for over a year, Jim Jeffords, Kit Bond, Harry \nReid, and I decided the most fair, reasonable, and logical way to \nbalance donor and donee needs was by creating ceilings and floors. Both \nbenefit but both have to give up some growth in order to help others \ngrow.\n  In order to get this bill off the floor, we have to have 60 votes, \nwhich means a balance between the donor and donee States. This proposal \nachieves that.\n  Another new initiative is establishment of a new core funding \ncategory for safety. With highway fatalities approaching an \nunacceptable 43,000 a year, Congress has the responsibility to make the \nroads safer. That is why we call this SAFETEA. The purpose of the new \nhighway safety improvement program is to increase the visibility and \neffectiveness in funding for safety projects in such a way as to \nproduce a dramatic reduction of highway fatalities and injury.\n  SAFETEA also addresses the significant challenges involved in \nintermodal connectivity by creating a set-aside from the National \nHighway System Program for the completion of ``last mile'' connections. \nOne of the frustrating aspects of freight congestion is the need to \ncomplete the last connection between port terminals and highways or the \nconnection between freight rail and highways. This has never been \naddressed in the previous authorization bills. This proposal not only \nidentifies a funding source for intermodal connectors but also creates \nroom at the planning table for freight interests and concerns.\n  Additionally, this bill lowers the threshold level for assistance \nunder the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, \nTIFIA, from $100 million to $50 million, which I think all four Members \nthought was a dramatic improvement, to make some structural changes to \nthe program designed to make this financial tool more usable to States.\n  Freight congestion is not the only mobility issue. Personal mobility \nis also a problem in both urban and rural areas. Reports indicate that \non a nationwide scale, road congestion costs the U.S. economy about $67 \nbillion annually, including 3.6 billion hours of delay and 5.7 billion \ngallons of gasoline that is wasted. Here we are with a fuel crisis, an \nenergy crisis in this country, and we are wasting 5.7 billion gallons \nof fuel.\n  The committee bill also proposes to give States and localities \nincreased ``tools'' to deal with this problem, by permitting and \nencouraging the use of innovative techniques such as ``hot'' lanes for \nsingle occupants who pay a toll to ride in high-occupancy lanes as well \nas variable toll pricing, which uses varying peak-hour pricing to \ncontrol congestion during regular high-volume periods. We have tried to \ndo this in the past. We are just being more innovative in carrying this \nfurther.\n  SAFETEA establishes the Intermodal Passenger Facilities Program, \nwhich provides grants for making necessary connections between various \nmodes of transportation. Current surface transportation programs fail \nto address the importance of intercity bus services. In my State of \nOklahoma, many people are using the intercity bus services to travel \nbetween our two largest cities, Tulsa and Oklahoma City, and our rural \nareas.\n  In many cases, this type of service is the only link rural \ncommunities have to larger urban areas where connections can then be \nmade to both national and international destinations. Specifically, \nthis provision would encourage the development of an integrated system \nof public transportation facilities through intercity bus facility \ngrants.\n  I see that the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Jeffords, is in the Chamber. I am sure he has a few \nremarks to make. If I could finish with this before I get into the \nsection-by-section analysis, would that be acceptable with the Senator.\n  Thank you. I will go ahead and do that at this time.\n  During the 107th Congress, we all experienced a cold dose of reality \nwhen the revenue aligned budget authority--that is, RABA--was negative \nfor the first time. Hysteria hit. We were all concerned at that time. \nThe principle that dollars into the trust fund should equal dollars out \nis fiscally sound and responsible and something I strongly support. \nHowever, to maintain consistency in the program, we need to even out \nthe swings in revenue projections.\n  Last year, we learned that unless the mechanism to predict future \nrevenues is more realistic, the potential consequences can be \ndisastrous. Some will argue that we should not allow negative RABAs. I \ndisagree. As I stated earlier, I strongly support the principle of \n``dollars in equals dollars out.'' If we continue to rely on the system \nof revenue projections, we must accept the negatives along with the \npositives. While the pay-as-you-go system of\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\nfunding highways may be cumbersome, it is also an important fiscal \nprinciple we should retain.\n  At the same time, we can and need to make improvements to RABA to \nmake it more reliable in the future. This bill does that by modifying \nthe RABA calculation so that annual funding level adjustments are less \ndependent on future anticipated receipts and more dependent on the \nlevels of actual receipts to the highway trust fund.\n  We strengthen stewardship of highway trust fund dollars by requiring \nproject management plans and annual financial plans to be submitted for \nall Federal aid projects above $1 billion or more and requiring annual \nfinancial plans for all projects receiving $100 million or more in \nFederal aid funding. Both of these items were raised in last year's \nhearings on reauthorization as areas needing additional oversight. I \nmight add that even the States came in and were supportive of this \nidea.\n\n  As our system ages and becomes functionally obsolete, extensive \nreconstruction will need to occur. Typically, these projects are very \nlarge in scope and I believe require careful oversight to ensure proper \nmanagement of funds and fewer opportunities for surprises in the \nconstruction process. These changes are designed to give us the \ninformation needed to accomplish critical oversight.\n  Colleagues, the bill in front of you represents the culmination of \nSenate efforts for reauthorizing critical transportation infrastructure \nneeds across America. This bill aims at funding all States equitably \nand generously, increasing the safety of drivers and pedestrians on our \nroads, streamlining environmental review processes while protecting \ncritical natural resources, improving program effectiveness and \nefficiency, and preparing for the transportation needs of the future.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the significant level of effort put \ninto the preparation of this bill by the several committees involved, \nthe administration's recommendations, and stakeholder input. I believe \nthis bill does that.\n  I would like to make one comment. We do have a vote coming up in 50 \nminutes from now, and we have several people who want to be heard. I \nwould only say we have been talking a lot about formulas. As most of us \nknow--but sometimes it does not come out forcefully--there are other \nfunds that are going to be available. About 7 percent of the amount \nthat would be in formulas would be found in projects. Anyone who wants \nthis bill should consider voting for cloture so we can get on the bill. \nWe would expect them to certainly support this motion if they have an \ninterest in projects for their States.\n  At this time I will just repeat one thing I said earlier when the \nSenator, Mr. Jeffords, was not in the Chamber. We have been talking \nabout how Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond, and, of course, Senator Reid \nand I have been working very closely, together with our staffs, to get \nto the point where we are now. So I publicly thank the Senator from \nVermont for all the hard work he has put into this bill and for the \ncooperative method of how we have come to some compromises. Perhaps \nneither one of us is really excited about it, but we know that is the \nart of compromise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his very kind \nwords. I certainly reciprocate and acknowledge the amount of \ncooperation we have had, especially that our staffs have had working \ntogether, which has greatly stimulated all of us to recognize we have a \ngood bill and we are going to get it done.\n  I would also like to announce to the Senator that I just left the \nFinance Committee, and we voted out--as was expected--favorably the \nmoney to get it done. So we are ready now to proceed to it tonight, and \nhopefully we will.\n  Chairman Inhofe and I are urging a ``yes'' vote, of course, to move \nthe transportation bill to the Senate floor where it can be fully \ndebated and amended. This bill will strengthen our Nation's \ntransportation system, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and \nimprove the safety of our transportation system.\n  Our Nation's roads and bridges and transit systems need immediate \nattention. Passage of the bill will provide essential Federal funding \nto the States so they have the resources needed to maintain and improve \nour transportation infrastructure. We cannot afford to wait any longer \nto make much-needed investments in our transportation infrastructure.\n  Fortunately, unlike many other bills, our transportation bill will be \nfully offset and paid for. The Finance Committee did a tremendous job \nworking this out. As I said just a moment ago, they passed it.\n  Let us not forget that each time you go to the gas pump, you are \npaying for this bill. Our transportation bill better spends the gas \ntaxes you are currently paying. We do not increase the Federal gas tax; \nwe better spend that tax to help States, counties, and cities address \ntheir transportation needs.\n  A 6-year bill will allow us to better spend the gas taxes and fund \nState efforts to reduce congestion, improve transit programs, repair \ndangerous bridges, and improve freight mobility. A 6-year bill will \ncreate over 2 million new, high-paying jobs. That is 2 million high-\npaying jobs.\n  Chairman Inhofe is absolutely correct; since the bill is deficit \nneutral, putting off our bill until next year will only make matters \nworse. So let's do it now.\n  An extension simply means that urgent highway and bridge repair costs \nwill be more heavily borne by States and local governments than by the \nFederal Government. A simple extension means commuters will spend more \ntime stuck in traffic. A simple extension means visits to the grocery \nstore or the doctor's office or the drugstore or the restaurant will \ntake longer.\n  Thirty-two percent of our major roads are in poor or mediocre \ncondition. Almost 30 percent of our bridges are in bad shape. We have \nto address these problems, and our transportation bill will help get \nthat job done.\n  We are asking for a ``yes'' vote to move this bill to the Senate \nfloor for a full debate on its merits, and we hope to do it soon. It \nwill be open for amendment, and the chairman and I will work with all \nSenators in this effort. Do not forget, the EPW bill increases the \namount of funding for each and every State. And every State gets more \nthan they did last time. I think that is correct.\n  Chairman Inhofe has been a very forceful leader in this massive \nundertaking to reauthorize our Nation's transportation laws. He has \nthoughtfully devised an innovative plan that balances the interests of \nthe great majority of donor and donee States.\n  That is a tough one. Chairman Inhofe is to be commended for his \ncreativity and energy in crafting major aspects of the bill, which the \nEPW Committee is putting before the Senate.\n  As head of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Senator Bond has \nworked closely with Senator Inhofe and led the charge to obtain a \nstrong level of funding for this effort.\n  Senator Harry Reid, the ranking member of the subcommittee, and I \nhave worked together with Senators Inhofe and Bond throughout the \nCommittee process and stuck together at the Committee markup to protect \nand enhance the passage of the bill.\n  History should also record that many fine staff worked long hours and \nproposed some excellent approaches for our consideration. They have \ndone a tremendous job.\n  Before I conclude I would like to mention my old friend John Chafee. \nSix years ago, Senator Chafee was the Chairman of the EPW Committee. He \nmoved this massive bill with the grace and the tenacity that was his \ntrade-mark.\n  John Chafee was a giant in this body, and he is missed very much \ntoday by all those who had the wonderful opportunity to work with him \nand shared his expertise.\n  I can only hope that we all draw on the lessons of bipartisanship, of \ncooperation and of consensus that John taught us.\n  To sum up, we are asking for a yes vote to get this bill to the \nSenate floor for a full debate on its merits.\n  Our Nation needs this bill and needs it now.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments to raise some questions about\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\nthe wisdom of invoking cloture on this bill at this time. I am \nconcerned that this is a deficient bill in a very fundamental sense.\n  One, it is deficient because one of the key parts of this bill, \npublic transit, has not yet been voted out of the committee of \njurisdiction. So we are dealing with a bird which is missing its right \nwing and a significant number of tail feathers. I believe we ought to \nwait until we can see the full program before we vote cloture on \nproceeding on this bill.\n  Second, the Finance Committee has just voted on the legislation \nrelative to how to finance this bill. I will have to say, I am very \nconcerned about the approach we are taking. Essentially the approach \nis, by whatever words you wish to use to describe it, to take money \nfrom the general revenue fund and use it to replace funds which \nhistorically have come from the users of the transportation system.\n  At a time when we just received a budget from the President that is \nover $500 billion in deficit--I repeat, $500 billion in deficit for \nthis next year--to be further adding to the deficit by stripping out \nfunds which would otherwise have gone to general revenue seems to me to \nbe more than reckless.\n  Even if you accepted the proposition that it was all right to use \ngeneral revenue to finance highway and transit purposes, the key \nportions of these funds come from what I would call, charitably, \n``funny money sources.'' As an example, we use the closure of certain \ntax loopholes, which even have names such as the Enron tax loophole. \nThat is probably a very good thing to do. The problem is, we have \nalready done it twice before. We used the same set of tax closures of \nloopholes to finance the jobs bill. That is the bill that relates to \ninternational taxation and has been precipitated by the fact that the \nEuropean Union declared--supported by the World Trade Organization--a \nportion of our taxation of international transactions to be illegal. \nAnd if we don't provide an acceptable alternative, we face the prospect \nof very significant retaliatory tariffs against our products. So there \nis going to be a lot of impetus to get that bill passed.\n  The second bill which uses these same items is the CARE bill which is \nthe charitable giving legislation that I know has a significant amount \nof support. Since we can't use the tax loophole closures more than \nonce, are we making the decision that we are going to do it for the \nhighway bill and, therefore, have it unavailable for the jobs bill and \nthe CARE bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I yield, yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Has the Senator seen the size of this bill?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Yes, I have observed it. And I might say, it \nwill be somewhat larger when the public transit section and the \nfinancing section are added.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Has the Senator seen the first bill that we passed in \n1956? This is the bill that was passed in 1956. This is the bill in \n2004. How far we have come.\n  How far and disgraceful a path we have tread with this porkbarrel-\nladen piece of overspending at a time when we have all-time deficits.\n\n  I urge my colleagues--in fact, I urge the managers of the bill--to \nlook at what they did in 1956 to fund the highways in the United States \nand what they are trying to do now which is wasteful and disgraceful. I \nwonder if my colleague would have a look at that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I look forward to doing so.\n  Let me make my last point with which you might not agree. I think we \nneed to establish what are we trying to do with this legislation. We \nare not just passing a piece of legislation in order to shove money out \nthe door. When we passed TEA-21 5 years ago, I made on this floor a \nprediction which saddened me but has come to pass; that is, that as a \nresult of TEA-21, our highways, our bridges, and our public transit \nsystems are in worse shape with greater congestion than they were the \nday we passed TEA-21.\n  Why is that? It is because we have either inadequately funded those \nbasic parts of our American infrastructure or, if we did adequately \nfund them, the resources were not distributed to where the needs were \nthe greatest.\n  Let me cite a few examples. According to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation's conditions and performance report, which is prepared \nevery other year to measure the needs of the Nation's highways and \ntransit system, let me quote from that report:\n\n       Capital investments by all levels of government between \n     1997 and 2000 remain below the ``cost to maintain'' level. \n     Consequently, overall performance of the system has declined.\n\n  That same report estimates that over the 6 years of TEA-21, the \nquality of the highway system has degraded by 6 percent and that 29 \npercent of America's bridges are considered structurally deficient.\n  On the issue of congestion, there is a study which was done by the \nTexas Transportation Institute, I believe, at Texas A University. \nThis was what they had to say about congestion:\n\n       In 2001, 5.7 billion gallons of fuel were wasted as a \n     result of congestion; 3.5 billion hours of lost productivity \n     resulting from traffic congestion.\n\n  Those hours and gallons lost cost the Nation $69.5 billion, a $4.5 \nbillion increase from the year 2000. The estimate is that if we \nappropriate the funds that are currently being suggested, that loss in \ngallons of gasoline and productivity will rise to $90 billion by the \nyear 2009.\n  Mr. President, we have lots of deficits in this country. We are \ntalking today about the deficits in our budget. We talk regularly about \nthe deficits in our trade balance. But we have another deficit, and \nthat is the deficit in our basic infrastructure. While it is not as \ngraphic and we do not get a report on it as frequently as we do on the \ntrade deficit or the fiscal deficit, it is just as pernicious and maybe \neven more so.\n  If you ask yourself the question, how is the United States of America \ngoing to compete in a global economy which worships at the altar of \nlowest unit cost of production and be able to maintain American living \nstandards, that will be a major challenge for the next generation of \nthe American public and their political representatives.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I will conclude first and then I will take a \nquestion. I believe two of the fundamental parts of being able to \nanswer that question are that the United States needs to have the best \neducated population on earth so that we can continue to generate the \ninnovative ideas and the efficiency in production that has hallmarked \nour economy.\n  Second, the key responsibility of the public sector is to maintain an \ninfrastructure that will be as efficient as possible. Those are two of \nthe keys to American productivity which will allow us to compete in the \nglobal economy and maintain an average income and standard of living \nthat is dramatic and above the rest of the world. In my judgment, this \nlegislation will not achieve that objective, while at the same time \nadding to our national deficit.\n  For those reasons, I believe we should take more time with this \nlegislation, see what comes out of the Banking Committee for public \ntransit, be able to understand the implications of the financing \nprogram that was just reported by the Finance Committee, and what is \ngoing to be required in order to avoid another 6 years of degradation \nof our basic public surface transportation system.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the Senator from Florida is \nconcerned about, for example, the bridges. Of all the bridges we have \nin America, about a third of them are in disrepair. The Senator is \naware that some of these bridges are in such bad condition that school \nbuses won't drive over them. They stop the bus and have the kids walk \nacross and the bus comes across and they load it up again. The Senator, \nfrom the statements I have heard him make before the committee on which \nwe serve together, statements I have heard him making over the years, \nand in his experience as the Governor of Florida, indicates to me that \nhe thinks we should do something about these bridges, as an example.\n  The Senator may be aware that prior to 9/11, I introduced legislation \ncalled the American Marshall Plan. The resolution has been passed by \nthe National Council of Mayors and other organizations in the States \nsaying we need to\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\ndo something with our infrastructure separate and apart from the \nregular highway bill we do every 5 or 6 years.\n  Is the Senator in a position to say in addition to the work being \ndone on this highway bill, we need to look at other parts of the \ninfrastructure, including water, sewer, and bridges? Does the Senator \nacknowledge that?\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Absolutely. I am privileged to serve on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee with our distinguished colleague \nfrom Nevada, and we both know the state of our water and sewer systems \nare even worse than our transportation system, in terms of their \ndegradation and inadequacy, and with every year that passes, that \ndegree of decline further accelerates. So we have many needs in America \nto reverse the decline of our infrastructure so that we cannot only \nhave a quality of life today--water systems that will serve our \npeople's needs, highways that are not excessively congested and are \nsafe to drive on but also are absolutely fundamental to our economic \nwell-being.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask this question to my friend. The Senator is aware \nthat my legislation--after 9/11, other things got in the way and \nnothing happened with that. Is the Senator aware that the Banking \nCommittee, which does mass transit--they have agreed on a mass transit \nbill. Is the Senator also aware that the Finance Committee has agreed--\nin fact, they have probably done that by now because they were meeting \nthis afternoon--to make sure that bill is funded properly, as is our \nhighway bill? Is the Senator aware that that has taken place?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. As a member of the Finance Committee, I can \nsay that the Finance Committee has just voted out a financing program \nto support this legislation. We were not informed as to what the \nBanking Committee's number would be for public transit. It was \nestimated that it would be $36.6 billion over 6 years. I don't know if \nthat is the final number that the committee recommended.\n  Mr. REID. Let me ask a final question. The Senator is aware that the \nState of Florida, for example, in this highway bill, will wind up \ngetting $3,138,589,000, which is a growth rate of some 40 percent, and \nthat the fiscal year 2003 number the people of Florida got for a return \non the dollar they put in was the minimum, 90.5 cents. At the end of \nthis bill, Florida will go to 95 percent; that is, they will get 95 \ncents back for every dollar. I think the Senator would acknowledge that \nis an improvement over the last bill for the State of Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I don't deny that this legislation is better \nthan it has been. I make two points: One, it is not enough to keep pace \nwith the annual demands on the system, both for maintenance and to \navoid increasing congestion. Every survey I have seen, including those \nI just cited, give statistical validation to that.\n  The second concern is that we are going to be adding to one of the \nother deficits in this country, which is our fiscal deficit, by \ndiverting money which otherwise would have gone into general revenue in \norder to pay the cost of both the highway and the public transit \nsystem.\n  Finally, the specific elements of that transfer from general revenue \nto the transportation fund are extremely questionable. I mentioned one \nset of so-called tax loophole closers that we have already spent \nbefore. How much confidence can we have that this bill is going to get \nto the finish line before the jobs bill or the charitable giving bill, \nso that this essential part of the financing package is still \navailable? I think it is a high risk. I say that to someone who knows \nsomething about high risk. I think it is an unstable platform on which \nto place our Nation's transportation funding.\n  Mr. REID. What I hear the Senator saying is that the Senator has no \nquestion with the amount of money being spent in this bill, the Senator \nhas some question how it is being financed?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. No. Even if we provide adequate financing to \nassure that this level will be allocated, I think we are doing as we \ndid 6 years ago with TEA-21, assuring that whoever is here in 2009 is \ngoing to be facing a transportation system that has been further \ndegraded.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do say this to my friend, and I ask that \nhe respond: We have programs that are funded in this bill that were the \nproperty of Senator Pat Moynihan, principally, that I think are \ncertainly far from being perfect, but they are the best programs we \nhave had during the lifetime of this legislation.\n  I say to my friend, with the fact that we have 2 weeks to complete \nthis legislation--we bring it up now or the majority leader said we \nwouldn't be able to do it--I would think doing this highway bill is so \nmuch more important than not doing it, that it is easier to weigh that \non the scale of legislative necessity.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I think that self-imposed standard that we \nhave to do this in the next 2 weeks is unacceptable. This has to be \ndone, yes, but it ought to be done when we have had an opportunity to \nview all the pieces and understand the implications of all the pieces. \nBy trying to do this between now and what happens to be President's Day \nis arbitrary and does not serve the interests of our public and does \nnot serve our ability to represent our constituents.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire, those of us who would love to \nbe heard on this----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield? Mr. President, we have a vote \nscheduled at a quarter to 6. There are Senators who want to speak \nbefore the vote. I apologize to everyone for having taken the time with \nSenator Graham. We have 25 minutes remaining. I wonder if Senator Dodd \ncan indicate how much time he wants.\n  Mr. DODD. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest, we have 24 minutes and we have three people to \nbe heard, including the Senator from Connecticut. That is 8 minutes \napiece. Does the Senator object to speaking for 8 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. No.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Dodd, \nBond, and Thomas be recognized for 8 minutes in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend all of my colleagues who worked on \nthis legislation. This is a difficult bill. I have been around this \ninstitution long enough to know that when you have highway bills and \nformulas, it is always complicated. We are seeking perfection, and we \nare never going to achieve it. I admire those who serve on these \ncommittees and have to work on these issues to try to put these bills \ntogether. I begin on that note.\n  I also thank my colleague from Florida who knows a lot about \ntransportation issues and has worked on these issues a long time. I \nassociate myself with his remarks.\n  I am concerned about this bill. I have talked with my colleagues \nabout it. I wish to say publicly that I am grateful to the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Nevada, and others \nwho spent some time talking with me about this bill and what happens to \nmy State.\n  Obviously, we all begin by looking at what happens to our States in a \nbill such as this. Connecticut receives, under the present version of \nthis legislation, the smallest increase of all of the 50 States, a 10-\npercent increase. I am deeply worried that we are no longer discussing \na bill that was once rooted primarily in the notion of need and are now \nmoving into a different consideration for how these dollars will be \nspent.\n  My State is a donor State. It contributes more each year in tax \nrevenues to the United States than we receive back in funding.\n  As a small State, we do not contribute more than we get back in terms \nof gasoline tax revenues. My State is 100 miles long. The average \nvehicle can cross my State with about 3 gallons of gasoline.\n  Yet I think everyone is aware geographically where my State is \nlocated. It is a thoroughfare. Millions of vehicles literally every \nyear pass on the Northeast corridor through my State.\n  So with the wear and tear on our highways, the tremendous congestion, \nthe huge volume of transportation that occurs, it is unfair to make \nallocations solely based on gas tax revenues.\n  I particularly note, as I look at the managers' amendment, that there \nis a\n\n[[Page S357]]\n\nprovision that provides for a floor of a 35-percent increase for States \nwith a total population density of less than 20 persons per square \nmile, a total population of less than 1 million people, as reported in \nthe decennial census conducted by the Federal Government 2000, or a \nmedian household income of $35,000.\n  There are seven States that fall into that category. Where is the \nneed? Those States receive a 35-percent increase in funding, regardless \nof whether there is any traffic, or whether there has been any \ndeterioration in road conditions at all. Here we are taking seven \nStates which have fewer than 20 people per square mile, a population of \nless than 1 million people, or a median income of less than $35,000, \nand yet they get a 35-percent increase. But a State such as mine that \nhas cars and trucks passing through all night long and all day long \nbelieves that these highways are critically important to our economy \nand well-being. I am troubled by how this formulation is being \nconsidered.\n  It is worthy of note that when we first wrote the highway bill, to \nwhich Senator McCain referred, back in the 1950s, it was called the \nNational Defense Interstate Highway System. Few people today would deny \nthe indispensable role that the Nation's highways, as well as mass \ntransit systems, play in homeland security.\n  I can say to my colleagues, I am sure they are aware of this, that on \nSeptember 11, 2001, one of the reasons my State was able to contribute \nas much as it did to the devastation in New York is because of that \nNational Defense Highway System that Dwight Eisenhower authored back in \nthe 1950s. It allowed for our first responders to get into New York \nCity, as well as for people to flee that city, which is exactly what \nDwight Eisenhower had in mind when we created the National Defense \nHighway System.\n  Today, as we talk about the needs of my State and others--by the way, \nthere are a variety of States throughout the Northeast and Midwest that \nI don't think do as well as they should be doing under these \nformulations. I know this is a work in progress, and I know we are not \ndone yet. I say that with the full knowledge of those who helped us \nwork on it.\n\n  I felt it necessary this evening, as we prepare to vote on cloture, \nknowing these formulas can get locked in and once they are locked in, \nit is awfully difficult to change them. Trying to add discretionary \nfunding here and there may be satisfactory to some, but we are looking \nat a 6-year bill where economic development and congestion is so \nincredible.\n  Tonight, one could go on Route 95 in my State and see that it is a \nparking lot. It isn't just between peak hours; it is getting that way \nall day long every day because of the tremendous congestion.\n  As the Senator from Florida pointed out, we need to know what the \nmass transit piece of this legislation is going to be. I am pleased \nthings seem to be moving in the right direction, but it is going to be \nawfully difficult to try to explain to people why certain States are \njust so limited in their ability to get the resources necessary to see \nto it that they can replace the older infrastructure to accommodate the \ntremendous demand that is building up in our region of the country.\n  I hope we will take a look at some of these formulations. I say with \nall due respect to the seven States that are going to automatically get \n35 percent, show me your need. If you have a need, I will listen, but \nif you are merely going to get a 35-percent increase because you have \nless than 20 people per square mile, population of less than 1 million, \nor median income of less than $35,000, how do you justify getting a 35-\npercent increase when the need doesn't exist? When there are other \nparts of the country that have tremendous need, how can you justify \nthat we are only getting a fraction of that increase over the next 6 \nyears?\n  That is not how this ought to work. If we are going to start making \ndecisions in this country on these kinds of formulations, then those of \nus who come from donor States, who contribute far more than we get \nback, are going to have to start making that kind of calculation on \nevery issue that comes along.\n  It strikes me that in too many cases the States getting the most out \nof this bill as presently crafted are the ones that contribute the \nleast when it comes to Federal dollars, and those that contribute the \nmost get back the least. We need to consider that as we move forward.\n  Again, I appreciate immensely the work my colleagues have done in \nwriting this legislation. It is not easy, I know that. I am grateful to \nthem for giving me an ear when I talk about these issues and share my \nconcerns that come from not only my State but a region of a country \nthat runs as a belt across the Midwest and Northeast.\n  I know my colleagues are cognizant of that. I am not telling them \nsomething of which they are unaware.\n  Certainly, as we talk about a highway bill for the next 6 years, as \nwell as transit when it comes along, we need to have formulations that \nare, as they historically have been, based on need, and not on a \nformulation that is going to disregard it.\n  Whatever time I may have remaining, I yield it to my colleague from \nMissouri who, if I have another minute or so, I will give him those \nminutes to use as he sees fit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his \nunderstanding. He and I have worked together on many issues, and it is \nnot easy. Certainly, this one is not easy. There is no question that we \nare not seeking perfection. We understand the problems that all States \nface. Over the 6 years, this bill actually winds up giving, as best I \ncan figure, the State of Connecticut 20 cents more on every dollar they \nput in than the money we get back in the State of Missouri. So we have \ngiven at the office, and we are attempting to achieve equity.\n  Nobody is going to be 100 percent happy, but this is one where there \nhas been tremendous cooperation, over better than a year, among \nChairman Inhofe, Ranking Member Jeffords, my colleague, the \nsubcommittee chairman, and Senator Reid, trying to listen and develop a \nframework that is fair and that deals with the pressing needs that this \nNation faces.\n  I commend the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Jim Inhofe, along with Senators Reid and Jeffords, for a job \nwell done.\n  The Finance Committee has been working hard. I gather they have done \na good job to come up to the level that was originally contained in the \nBond-Reid amendment in the Budget Act. We thought this was the minimum \nwe needed because there are such pressing needs for highways. \nObviously, everybody knows good highways lessen congestion. Everybody \nknows that they are the guidelines to economic development. If we do \nnot have good highways, we cannot keep and grow good jobs. So it is \nvitally important for the long-term future of the State.\n  In my State, it is really a safety issue. We are a very wide, broad, \nand tall State with lots of traffic through it. In many of these areas, \nthe two-lane highways are carrying traffic that is designed for at \nleast four lanes nowadays. Safety in this authorization is for the \nfirst time given a prominent position, being elevated to a core \nprogram.\n  We have more than three deaths a day on Missouri's highways, and at \nleast one and maybe more than those are attributable to the conditions \nof our highways. I know this happens in other States. That is why I am \ndelighted that the administration, in laying out the title SAFETEA, the \nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act, \nhas emphasized safety because good roads and highways are a matter of \nsafety.\n  I think this bill does mirror the administration's proposal \ncontinuing our commitment to the motoring public's safety. This is \naccomplished by providing much needed funding to reduce highway \ninjuries and fatalities, all without the use of mandates. Funding for \ngood highways and bridges is absolutely essential and a key component \nof our bill will go a long way toward saving lives by providing funds \nto States to address safety needs at hazardous locations, sections, and \nelements. These include roadside obstacles and unmarked or poorly \nmarked roads that may constitute a danger to motorists, bicyclists, \npedestrians, and other highway users.\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\n  We know in Missouri that inadequate roads not only lead to \ncongestion, therefore more pollution, they delay, deny, and derail \neconomic development opportunities, but they also kill people. When you \nhave traffic--10,000, 15,000, 20,000 cars a day--on a narrow, two-lane \nroad, you are going to have people passing when they should not and \nthey run into other people head on.\n  We heard testimony from the administration that nearly 42,000 people \nare killed on our roads and highways each year. We need to make an \ninvestment to reduce that loss. I am glad that the bill reflects the \ncontinued commitment to making not only investments in our \ninfrastructure but also to the general safety and welfare of our \nconstituents.\n  On the question of equity, our bill is the best we can come up with \nin the real world to achieve equity among all of the States. Some of us \nhave been donor States for a very long time, getting back far less than \nthe dollar we put in. There are other States that have consistently \nreceived more. As a result, this bill tries to achieve some equity by \ngetting all States to a 95-cent rate of return, at least by the end of \nthe authorization.\n  There are 24 States; Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, \nIllinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, \nMississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, \nSouth Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. At \nthe same time, we wanted to make sure that every State got an increase. \nSo every State gets at least a 10-percent increase over the amount of \nfunds that they were getting in TEA-21, and we put a lid on so that \nsome States would not take an undue share. I think the top rate is \nabout a 42-percent increase. So in that framework, we have come up with \nwhat we think is equity.\n  My home State of Missouri, as many of the donor States mentioned, has \nsome of the worst roads in the Nation. It has about the third worst \nroads in the Nation, with 59 percent of its major roads in either poor \nor mediocre condition, requiring immediate repair or reconstruction. We \nalso have the second worst bridges in the Nation.\n  I take my hat off to the chairman of the committee because I \nunderstand his State may be the one State that ranks in worse shape \nthan Missouri does on both of these. As my colleagues will notice, \nMissouri is very much in the middle ranks of those getting an increase.\n  During the reauthorization of TEA-21, donor States did not think it \nwas feasible to achieve the 95 percent rate of return. Under our \nproposal, we are able to get them there. However, I am aware that some \nof the donor States are concerned they hit our growth caps and do not \nachieve a 95 percent return in 2004.\n  We were unable to bring donor States up as early as we might have \nwished due to our budgetary constraints, and balancing the needs of the \ndonor States with the needs of the donee States. But as donor States \ngrow, the donee States see a gradual decline. To bring greater equity \nbetween the States, I am proud to announce that all States will grow \nnot less than 10 percent over TEA-21.\n  This bill also addresses important environmental issues that were \npart of a compromise, worked out with great input from all sides. To \nease the transition to new air quality standards, the conformity \nprocess is better aligned with air quality planning, as well as \nstreamlining the project delivery process by providing the necessary \ntools to reduce or eliminate unnecessary delays during the \nenvironmental review stage. We think that is very important.\n\n  We know there are lots of different ideas on this bill. We tried to \naccommodate all of those ideas. We had ideas and requests coming in \nover the transom, through the window. We met people on the floor. Our \nstaffs worked together to try to balance all of these needs. Clearly, \nthere are going to be a number of amendments. I hope our colleagues \nwill work with us because there is a real desire, on the part of the \nchair and the ranking member of both the full committee and the \nsubcommittee, to give a hearing to these. If there are important issues \nthat need to be dealt with, we want to get the votes and move forward \nso we can, we hope, get the bill signed before the current \nauthorization expires at the end of February.\n  Regarding a sufficient level of growth, the administration proposed, \nin my view, an insufficient level of growth for our Nation's aging \ninfrastructure. The reason for offering the Bond-Reid amendment was \nbecause the administration's SAFETEA proposal came in at a mere $200 \nbillion for highways.\n  During last year's budget debate, I, along with Senator Reid, offered \nan amendment to fund highways at $255 billion over 6 years, which was \nsupported by a vote of 79 to 21. I am pleased to report that the bill \nwe have before us follows the Bond-Reid amendment providing a 31-\npercent increase in funding over TEA-21. While this is not as high as \nsome might have wanted, we are able to achieve this goal without \nraising fuel taxes.\n  In this bill, I think all of us are concerned about jobs as well as \nthe benefits that good highways and bridges bring if we are to get \npeople to work this summer, which I think is very important because we \nstill do not have enough people working. We need to get the \nauthorization so it can get out to the highway departments so they can \nmake their contracts for the coming year.\n  I do not need to tell my colleagues, because I think everybody has \nheard it too many times, that the Department of Transportation \nestimates that for every billion dollars in new Federal investment, \nthere are 47,000 jobs created. We want to see those jobs created this \nyear. Accordingly, in 2009 our comprehensive 6-year bill at $255 \nbillion will sustain over 2 million new jobs.\n  According to the Associated General Contractors, the same $1 billion \ninvestment yields $500 million in new orders from manufacturing and \n$500 million spread through other sectors of the economy. Construction \npay averages at $19 per hour, 23 percent higher than the private sector \naverage. Failure to enact a 6-year bill yields the loss of 90,000 jobs.\n  Another accomplishment of our package will ensure transportation \nprojects are built more quickly because environmental stakeholders will \nbe brought to the table sooner. Environmental issues will be raised \nearlier and the public will have better opportunities to shape \nprojects. Projects more sensitive to environmental concerns will move \nthrough a more structured environmental review process more efficiently \nand with fewer delays.\n  The bill also ensures that transportation projects will not make air \nworse in areas with poor air quality, while giving local transportation \nplanners more tools and elbow room to meet their Federal air-quality \nresponsibilities. The bill will put transportation planning on a \nregular 4-year cycle, require air quality checks for projects large \nenough to be regionally significant and reduce current barriers local \nofficials face in adopting projects that improve air quality.\n  This comprehensive package is a good step forward to addressing our \nNation's needs in infrastructure development and improvement.\n  I thank my colleagues from the Finance Committee, and others. I urge \neverybody to work with us. The managers of the bill will be doing their \nbest to expedite it. I appreciate the time. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the motion for cloture and to move to the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think this is one of the most important \nissues we have had before us. As we look to a year with relatively \nshort time to work on issues, with a large number of issues out there, \nI think it is important for us to deal with this and to deal with it \npromptly. I am delighted that we are going to have it up to date and be \nable to work on it over the next week or so.\n  I have not heard all of the discussions. I am sure I understand what \nmost of them have been because I have been on the Finance Committee. We \nhave finally come to an agreement as to what the funding level will be \nand what the sources of funding will be. It follows very closely what \nwe came out with in the Environment and Public Works Committee, of \nwhich I am also a member. So I am very pleased with what we are doing.\n\n  Does it suit everybody? Of course not. There are all kinds of \ndiscussions\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\nabout funding source. The funding source is not entirely the gas tax. \nBut the way we work it out, all that additional funding does come from \nsomething related to transportation, so I think it is a justifiable way \nto put this in a spending arena that will help accomplish the things we \nneed to do. I cannot think of anything more important.\n  We have been in a CR since September. I don't know what you heard \nfrom your transportation departments at home, but they feel as if they \ncan't move forward, can't do contracting, can't plan on what they need \nto be doing in the future until they get more assurance of where we \nare. So it is imperative that we do something here.\n  I can't think of anything more important to our lives, unless it is \nenergy, than transportation. To be able to go with our families, do our \nwork, protect our country--all these things are related, of course, to \ntravel and the highway bill.\n  The interstate system is 50 years old. The Senator from Arizona was \ntalking about the little bill that passed 50 years ago. Times have \nchanged substantially and I believe there is a more comprehensive \napproach to travel that combines the spending of all levels of \nGovernment, which amounts to over $100 billion annually, when you talk \nabout all of them put together. So our share is not the largest, but it \nis more than we have had in the past.\n  It is a critical time. It is a critical situation. We need to move. \nAs I said, I know there are different views and I understand that. \nThere are decisions that have to be made in this bill in terms of \ndistribution of funding, not only among States, but what is used for \nmass transit, what is used for pathways, and a number of other safety \nprojects and things of that kind.\n  But, really, our responsibility is to come to an agreement and move \nforward here and then bring it to the House and get this done. I think, \nof course, it is also one of the big economic features before us. It \ncreates lots of jobs immediately. But more importantly, it strengthens \nthe whole economic structure so we can develop with other kinds of \njobs.\n  I know there is the case about there being donors. Let me talk about \na larger State that does pretty well. We have thousands of miles of \nroads, 27,000 miles of roads, and relatively few people. But lots of \npeople who do not live with us are going through. This is a Federal \nhighway system and it has to move throughout the country. So the \ndecision as to appropriating and adjusting the money among the States \nis not an easy one. Certainly not everybody agrees with how we are \ngoing to do it.\n  In any event, I am not going to take more time. We have learned a \ngreat deal about it. Again, one of the most important aspects we have \nto deal with is the funding that is related to the tax that is assessed \non gas. We made some changes on some of the others.\n  I urge Senators to pass this bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? I understand the Senator, in \naddition to being on the committee I chair, is also on the Finance \nCommittee. Would he care to report on what has just transpired in the \nlast hour or so?\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. We have passed a bill there to bring it to the floor. The \nfunding is very close to what the chairman used in our Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n  As we said, the direct amount from gas funding was somewhat short, \nbut we used some other things, dollars that were related, and scooted \nthem over from other expenditures into this bill so we are offsetting \nthe costs. We find ourselves with the amount of money pretty much as \nlaid out by the chairman and the chairman's committee. I appreciate \nvery much what he has done and certainly hope we can move forward.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I further ask, since I am chairman of the committee, if \nthe Senator who has the floor now will yield to me for a few comments.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I see Senator Thomas, from a State such as Wyoming, falls \ninto a category we are taking care of in the formulas. That is low-\nyield or low-population States. They have to be looked after. As he \npoints out, people are driving through, yet they don't have the \npopulation base to be supporting large amounts of revenue to pay for \nthe roads.\n  On the other hand, we see Senators such as the Presiding Officer now, \nfrom the State of Texas, one of the fastest growing, largest States. He \ncertainly has problems. So being very careful to try to take care of \nall these diverse needs in establishing a formula to put together \nsomething that would take care of the large States, we put in a ceiling \nand we put in a floor. We put something in there for donee and donor \nStates. It is a very difficult formula.\n  I remind my colleagues who might not feel this is a fair approach to \nit, to remember, to recall when we tried to do this before under TEA-\n21, we had a purely political system. Everybody got a percentage of the \namount of money that was there and it was all driven by politics. Once \nthey received 60 votes, they didn't care what happened. We are not \ndoing that. We have a formula that takes care of all these needs.\n  I saw the senior Senator from Pennsylvania coming through just a \nmoment ago and there have been some complaints from that State. I \ncompare that to my State. My State is 20 percent larger than the State \nof Pennsylvania, yet we have roughly the same number of miles of roads. \nYet under this formula, he is receiving some $3 for every $1 we \nreceive. That doesn't look like I do a very good job for my State of \nOklahoma. Nevertheless, it is a reality that we have to consider all \nthese things.\n  If you look at some of the compromises we have made, we had four \nprincipals who spent more time than anyone else drafting this bill. \nThey were, of course, myself as chairman, Senator Jeffords as the \nranking member, Senator Reid as the ranking member on the subcommittee, \nand Senator Bond on the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, \nsubcommittee chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will conclude by urging my colleagues not to waste any \nmore time. We need to get to this. We should have done this back on \nSeptember 30. I urge colleagues that we invoke cloture and get right to \nthe bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, it is with great disappointment that I rise \ntoday to express my objection to moving forward on the bill before us, \nSAFETEA. The cloture vote that we will have in the next few hours is \nthe first step towards debating a bill with which few in this body are \ncompletely familiar. Essential elements of the bill came out of the \nFinance Committee today, and Senators have clearly not had enough time \nto review these proposals and to assess the effect on their States. I \nbelieve that debating and voting on this legislation this week would be \nirresponsible, and potentially damaging to many States, including the \nState of Wisconsin.\n  The leadership has made it clear that they intend to push this \nmeasure through under artificial time constraints. Yet, members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee were not given essential \ninformation before the transportation bill was brought for a vote on \nNovember 12, 2003, and now Members of the Senate will be debating a \nformula we haven't seen and are told we can't change. The unknowns, at \nthis point, outnumber the areas of understanding. Many Senators still \nhaven't seen crucial information from the Finance and Banking \nCommittees. Questions of how to pay for this bill and how transit \nfunding will be distributed among the States were debated in Committee \nas recently as today. I fail to see how we are acting responsibly to \nvote on legislation the same day it comes out of Committee.\n  I want to make my self clear. I support a 6-year authorization of \ntransportation dollars. And I support a bill that would be funded at \nthe levels the Senate supported in last year's budget resolution, and \nthat is fiscally responsible. During every previous authorization, I \nhave fought to give my State equitable--equitable, not favorable--\ntreatement under the various formulas. I could not, in good conscience, \nmove forward with a bill that would be a step backwards for my State.\n  I understand that moving forward today does not eliminate all the \nopportunities to alter this bill and make it better. However, the \ncomplexities of the formulas that the Senate will be dealing with \nrequire additional time for review. I am particularly troubled by \npossible effects on Wisconsin of the\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nproposed amendment dealing with the distribution of highway funds among \nthe States. This formula was not released until just over a week ago, \nand yet this is what determines every State's level of transportation \nfunding for the next 6 years. This amendment contains the new ``equity \nbonus'' program, dictating the State's percentages of formula funding. \nThe State of Wisconsin is a loser under this formula. According to \ncharts from the Federal Highway Administration, Wisconsin's rate of \nreturn will drop to $.95 by the second year of the bill, and remain \nthere for 4 years. I understand that the formulas involved are \ncomplicated and difficult to alter. In my mind, this provides all the \nmore reason granting Senators additional time to review and amend them.\n  A 6-year authorization bill should not move forward under an \narbitrary time limit. As a Senator whose State could be harmed by this \nlegislation, I will use all the procedural tools at my disposal to give \nmyself more time to understand and amend the bill. In addition, I will \nuse any legislative means to fix the inequities that exist in the \nproposed formula amendment. I am hopeful that the leadership will work \nwith me in the coming weeks to protect my State and advance the best \npossible reauthorization bill.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to propose that we turn the \nPresidential nominating process over to the National Football League, \nexcept for Super Bowl half-time shows. Then maybe we can have a second \nSuper Bowl, where anything is possible and everyone can participate.\n  Take the example of our colleague Senator Kerry's team--I am sure the \nSenator from Vermont will be quick to point out it is the team of many \nSenators from New England--the New England Patriots. Last night, they \nbecame the Super Bowl champions.\n  On September 12, in the season's first game, the Buffalo Bills \ntrounced the Patriots 31 to 0. If this had been the first-in-the-Nation \nPresidential nominating caucus, the Patriots would have been toast. You \nknow the pundits' rule: Only three tickets out of Iowa. The Patriots \ncertainly didn't look like one of the three best professional football \nteams. Then, the Washington Redskins defeated the Patriots, as unlikely \nas it would have been for Dennis Kucinich to upend Senator Kerry in New \nHampshire. But in the National Football League, upsets don't end the \nseason. The Patriots played 14 more games. They won them all. \nYesterday, they beat the Carolina Panthers in the Super Bowl for their \n15th consecutive win.\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\n  The National Football League schedules 20 weeks of contests over 5 \nmonths to determine its champion. The Presidential nominating process, \non the other hand, uses the equivalent of two preseason games in Iowa \nand New Hampshire to narrow the field to two or three--and sometimes \nthey effectively pick the winner.\n  The NFL wasn't always so wise. In the 1930s, league owners rearranged \nschedules after the first few games so that teams that were doing well \ncould play one another. This was good for the Chicago Bears, for \nexample, but not for the league. Fans in other cities quit going to the \ngames--just as voters in most States have quit voting in Presidential \nprimaries.\n  Bears owner George Halas and others created today's competitive \nsystem in which almost any one of 32 teams can hope to make the \nplayoffs. Green Bay can make it because the league makes sure that even \nsmalltown teams have enough revenue. Prime-time television \nopportunities are rotated. Each Monday, senior officials in the \nleague's New York office grade every call and no call to second-guess \neven the instant replays.\n  Professional football has become America's game because it symbolizes \nthe most important aspect of the American character: If you work hard \nand play by the rules, anything is possible. As a result, 8 of 10 of \nthe most watched network television shows have been Super Bowls; 98 of \nthe 100 best watched cable television games have been NFL games.\n  Every September, the NFL fields 32 teams, almost all with a shot at \nthe playoffs. Every 4 years, the Presidential nominating process does \nwell to attract a half dozen credible candidates for the biggest job in \nthe world. All but half are effectively eliminated after two contests. \nIf professional football were Presidential politics, Sportscenter would \npick the Super Bowl teams after 3 or 4 preseason games.\n  These two steps would fix the Presidential nominating process:\n  No. 1, spread out the primaries. Twenty-eight primaries are crammed \ninto 5 weeks after New Hampshire. Congress should assume the role of \nPaul Tagliabue. Create a window between February and May during which \nprimaries may be held every 2 weeks. Iowa and New Hampshire could still \ncome first, but they would become off-Broadway warmups and not the \nwhole show.\n  The second step that would fix the process would be to allow more \nmoney--to raise their first $10 million, let candidates collect \nindividual ``start-up contributions'' of up to $10,000. Today's $2,000 \nlimit makes it impossible for most potential candidates to imagine how \nto raise, say, $40 million. During 1995, when I was a candidate and the \nindividual limit on contributions was $1,000, I fattened 250 \nfundraisers in that 1 year to collect $10 million. The combination of \nthe new $2,000 limit, the increased coverage of new cable channels, and \nthe growth of the Internet have made it easier to raise money.\n  Still all but Senator Kerry was short of cash after New Hampshire. \nPut it this way: The Packers would never make it to the playoffs under \nthe revenue rules of Presidential primaries.\n  Mr. President, 45,000 Iowans voted for John Kerry in the first \ncaucus. About 83,000 New Hampshirites voted for him in the first \nprimary. More Americans actually attended last night's Super Bowl game \nin Houston, TX, than voted in either Iowa or New Hampshire. Ninety \nmillion others watched the Super Bowl game on television.\n  Perhaps we should learn something from America's game about how to \npick a President. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SMITH). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a recent article in the January 26, 2004 \nedition of TIME Magazine entitled ``A Trust Betrayed'' has again \nreminded the Nation of the shameful and illegal manner in which the \nUnited States treats Native Americans.\n  A pending class action lawsuit alleges that the United States owes \nover $100 billion to some 500,000 Native Americans. For over 100 years, \nthe Department of Interior has served as the trustee for the proceeds \nfrom the leasing of oil, gas, land and mineral rights on Indian land, \nyet the Department cannot tell us how much is owed or to whom it is \nowed. This money is desperately needed to address basic human needs and \nstimulate economic development.\n  There are important legal issues at stake. The concepts of \nsovereignty, treaty rights, and government-to-government relations all \ncome into play.\n  Indian trust reform is also a civil rights issue. We are becoming a \nmuch more diverse country. How can Hispanic Americans, or African \nAmericans, or anyone else, trust the United States if we are still \nbreaking our legal obligations to our first Americans?\n  I commend this article to the attention of my colleagues, and once \nagain urge the Department of Interior to provide the accounting \nrequired to all Native Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Time Magazine, Jan. 26, 2004]\n\n                           A Trust Betrayed?\n\n\n Native Americans claim the U.S. mismanaged their oil and gas legacies \n                         it promised to protect\n\n                    (By Marguerite Michaels/Shawnee)\n\n        Ruby Withrow remembers the happy days she spent as a young \n     child on her grandfather Moses Bruno's 80-acre homestead near \n     Shawnee, Okla. There the extended Bruno family, members of \n     the Potawatomi tribe, tended large gardens of vegetables and \n     fruits and raised chickens, hogs and cows. On Sundays the \n     whole family attended the Sacred Heart Catholic Mission just \n     down the road. But all that changed soon after oil was \n     discovered on the Bruno property.\n        Lease agreements were arranged with oil producers, wells \n     were dug, and pumping began in 1939. But family members say \n     Grandpa Bruno never knew how much oil and gas were being \n     taken out of his land or how much money he was due from their \n     sale. All his royalty payments went into a trust fund managed \n     by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). If Bruno needed to buy \n     something, he had to appeal to the local BIA agent, and he \n     was rarely given cash. When the he wanted to buy a cow, the \n     price was deducted from his account and given directly to the \n     seller. When he bought groceries, he paid for them with a BIA \n     voucher.\n        The wells were plugged just 28 months later--Bruno family \n     members say the wells' operator never gave a reason for \n     ending production--but in that short time, they say, the soil \n     was ruined, and the Brunos were able to grow hardly anything \n     on it. Younger family members moved away to find jobs, and \n     the old folks limped along on public assistance until 1960, \n     when Bruno and his wife Frances died within a month of each \n     other. Their heirs decided to sell what remained of the land \n     the next year.\n        Such stories are common among Native Americans. Like \n     legions of others, Bruno acquired his holdings under the \n     Dawes Act of 1887. Its allotment program was an effort by \n     Congress to break up the tribal structure by encouraging \n     self-sufficiency among the Indians. The Dawes Act mandated \n     that the land given to Natives be managed by the \n     Department of the Interior's local BIA agent and promised \n     that any profits from the property would be held in trust \n     for its owners, The problem, say hundreds of families like \n     the Brunos, is that the owners received relatively little \n     of the money coming to them.\n       Over the past decade, many of the families have begun \n     actively pursuing what they say is their rightful legacy. In \n     1996 Elouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet tribe, filed a \n     $135 billion class action against the U.S. government, \n     claiming that billions of dollars belonging to some 500,000 \n     Native Americans and their heirs had been mismanaged or \n     stolen from accounts held in trust since the late 19th \n     century. Through document discovery and courtroom testimony, \n     the Cobell case revealed mismanagement, ineptness, dishonesty \n     and delay by federal officials, leading U.S. District Judge \n     Royce Lamberth to declare their conduct ``fiscal and \n     governmental irresponsibility in its purest form.''\n       The BIA holds 11 million acres in trust for individual \n     Native Americans. Money from timber sales and agricultural \n     and oil leases\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\n     of this property is distributed under the same program that \n     dealt with Moses Bruno. Five years ago, his descendants began \n     tracking their patrimony. Their experience shows how \n     difficult it can be to prove past wrongs and have them \n     redressed.\n       Family members say Moses Bruno was never allowed to see his \n     oil and gas account ledgers. It might not have done him much \n     good if he had been, given that, like many Indians of his \n     generation, he had never learned to read and could write only \n     his name. When his eldest son Johnnie argued that the \n     government was robbing him blind, the older man insisted that \n     the Indian-agency people would never cheat him.\n       After World War II, Bruno's children tried to sue the oil \n     company for saltwater damage to their soil caused by the \n     pumping from the wells. ``But even though my dad Johnnie took \n     photos,'' says Ruby Withrow, 69, ``we couldn't prove Moses \n     had not allowed the salty runoff. There was no paper trail at \n     that time.'' Nor was there money to pay for a lawyer. Over \n     the years, family members looked for documents that could \n     prove the bureau had treated Moses Bruno badly. They went to \n     the National Archives in Washington, visited historical \n     societies in Oklahoma and requested records from BIA offices \n     in Shawnee and nearby Anadarko, Okla. Always they were told \n     that few records were available.\n       The Cobell case reassured the Brunos that others had had \n     similarly unhappy experiences with their BIA trust funds and \n     motivated them to dig deeper for documents to support their \n     complaints. Finally, after a 16-hour marathon on the Internet \n     in the fall of 1998, Dana Dickson, Ruby Withrow's \n     daughter, discovered on an obscure Indian arts-and-crafts \n     site a link to Oklahoma Indian--agency files located at \n     the regional National Archives in Fort Worth, Texas. A \n     family delegation immediately made the trip. ``I'll never \n     forget the first time we went down there,'' says Dickson's \n     cousin Johnnie Flynn. ``Dana and I were pulling file after \n     file. One of them was Moses Bruno's. It was three inches \n     thick. I stopped and looked over at my mother and my Aunt \n     Ruby. There were tears streaming down their faces.''\n       They found grocery receipts and bills from JCPenney for \n     socks at 15[cents] a pair and a coat for $14.66. The purchase \n     order from the Indian agency for Moses' first car was there, \n     as were numerous voucher slips endorsed with his tentative, \n     spidery signature. Most important, there were pages of ledger \n     sheets detailing his individual BIA money account.\n       More than half a dozen visits later, Moses' grandson Leon \n     Bruno has accumulated enough photocopies of documents to fill \n     19 loose-leaf notebooks. Papers show that Moses' entire 80-\n     acre allotment first came under an oil lease in 1923. Six \n     years later, according to BIA documents, 20 of those acres \n     were sold to two local white men for $1,311, or $65.55 an \n     acre. The family has found contradicting government estimates \n     of the land's royalty value at the time, ranging from $50 to \n     $400 an acre. And documents are unclear about whether Moses \n     Bruno understood before the transaction was completed that \n     the land was being sold. A well was drilled on these 20 acres \n     in 1933 and still pumps to this day.\n       In 1931 Bruno got permission from the BIA to withdraw 20 \n     separate acres of his allotment from the trust, and he began \n     selling percentages of his oil and gas royalty interest. Four \n     wells were eventually drilled on the remaining BIA-controlled \n     40 acres and pumped from march 1939 to the end of 1941. It \n     was the practice then for oil companies to send royalty-\n     payment checks for Indian-owned property directly to the \n     superintendent of the local BIA office. Each day the Shawnee \n     office made a deposit via certified mail to the Federal \n     Reserve Bank in Oklahoma City, Okla. The deposit sheet listed \n     the source of each check, its amount and the day's total \n     deposits. Daily entries were also made in the office's cash-\n     receipts journal, registering the payment to each individual \n     Indian account on a ledger card.\n       Sorting through those old documents, with the lingering \n     resentments the families have toward the BIA, can be \n     confusing. When Dana Dickson began comparing the amounts \n     posted to her great grandfather's ledger card with the sums \n     on the deposit sheets for the same days, she discovered that \n     10% was routinely funneled from the oil check to a special-\n     deposit account. Dickson and her relatives suspected that \n     corrupt agents were taking the money for themselves. But Ross \n     Swimmer, a Department of the Interior ombudsman working on \n     behalf of Indian-trust beneficiaries, told TIME that the \n     deduction, which was not exclusively to Moses Bruno's \n     account, was simply a fee that the BIA charged for \n     managing the oil and gas properties held by the trust \n     funds.\n       Nearly two years after the elder Brunos died in 1960, a \n     Shawnee bureau agent suggested that the family sell its \n     remaining 40 acres, along with the property's mineral rights. \n     ``[The minerals have only a] nominal value,'' the agent wrote \n     in a letter to the regional BIA office in Anadarko. The \n     family signed off on the sale, netting a $3,022.50. In 1982 a \n     new oil well was drilled on that land and is still pumping.\n       The Bruno family acknowledges the pressure the BIA was \n     under during the oil-boom years. In the 1935 annual report of \n     the Shawnee agency, the superintendent called his office \n     ``woefully undermanned,'' handling 1,500 Indian money \n     accounts with only one clerk, who had no modern account \n     machines. ``Maybe there were some mistakes made,'' says Leon \n     Bruno. ``[But] a lot of what went on was deliberate.'' The \n     family estimates that Moses Bruno earned a total of $35,000 \n     from his oil and gas leases. The production figures the \n     descendants unearthed, on just one well on the land that was \n     sold in 1993, amount to almost $70 million.\n       It is not clear whether the family will ever receive \n     compensation for any miscalculations that may have been made \n     on their land sales and oil leases. Elouise Cobell's class \n     action has stalled in the face of the Department of the \n     Interior's estimate that it would take five years and $335 \n     million just to account for the money from land and mineral \n     leases covering a period of more than 100 years. And Congress \n     is balking at the expense--even though its committees have \n     issued more than one report over the years about gross \n     mismanagement of Native American trust funds. In December the \n     Bruno descendants decided to withdraw from the Cobell suit \n     and hired a lawyer to pursue their own.\n       ``It's not about the money,'' says Moses' granddaughter \n     Ruby Withrow, a nurse who administers a diabetes program for \n     the Absentee Shawnee tribe. ``I want some justice for a man \n     who trusted the United States and was betrayed.'' The BIA has \n     looked into the family's claims and says that while the \n     records for Moses Bruno's account may not be complete, ``no \n     instance of malfeasance was found in the records that we \n     examined.'' In a fax to TIME, the agency stated that \n     ``understandably, the family did not review these files with \n     a historian's commitment to objectivity.''\n       Still, the search for what happened to Moses Bruno's land \n     has produced a new sense of equanimity for his family. There \n     have been several meetings to bring all the descendants--some \n     200 plus--up to date on the stories the documents tell. Leon \n     Bruno has started a nonprofit corporation, funded by garage \n     sales, raffles and donations from family and friends, that he \n     hopes will eventually allow the family to pay for an \n     organized study of its Potawatomi culture and language. He \n     and his wife Veta attend the annual gatherings of the nine \n     Potawatomi bands, now scattered over several states. Leon has \n     gone through the training and fasting that are required of \n     those chosen as the tribe's honored fire keepers. And he has \n     built a roundhouse on his property in Tecumseh, OK, where \n     family members gather four times a year to light a sacred \n     fire and pray for the memory of their ancestor Moses Bruno.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S362-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S362-S363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING MONROE SWEETLAND\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about a \ncitizen of the great western part of America, Monroe Sweetland.\n  Monroe lives in Oregon, where he has enjoyed a wonderful life of \npublic service. He has been a State Senator, a national leader of \nteachers, a journalist, and the publisher of a number of small \nnewspapers.\n  He served in the Pacific with the Red Cross during World War II. \nAfter returning home he became the political director for the National \nEducation Association in the western States.\n  He was a confidant of Eleanor Roosevelt and an ally of President \nHarry Truman.\n  His home in Milwaukie, OR, which was built in 1878, is a historic \nlandmark. That isn't just because it is an old house, but also because \nof the many important people who visited him there.\n  The most famous visitor was President John Kennedy. In fact, I have \nbeen told that Monroe's wife Lillie was the person who suggested to JFK \nthat a rocking chair would ease the pain in his back.\n  Others who visited Monroe and Lillie included Vice President Hubert \nHumphrey, Ambassador John Kenneth Gailbraith, and Senators Wayne Morse, \n``Scoop'' Jackson and Estes Kefauver.\n  Monroe recently turned 94 years old. Although he has been legally \nblind for several years, he is fond of saying that he has lost his \nsight, but not his vision. As a former newsman, he still enjoys having \nthe paper read to him by visitors.\n  He has been called the father of the modern Democratic Party in \nOregon, and a founding father of Portland State University.\n  He is also responsible, more than any other person, for a very \nimportant piece of Federal legislation--the Bilingual Education Act of \n1968.\n  That law opened the doors of education and opportunity to young \npeople in the West and other parts of the country who are native \nspeakers of Spanish.\n  Up until then, these students were often placed in classes where they \ncouldn't understand what was going on, with disastrous results. But in \nthe early 1960s a number of innovative programs began to spring up, \nincluding a successful one at Pueblo High School in Tucson.\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\n  In 1966, Monroe organized a symposium on the education of Spanish \nspeaking children. Prominent educators and elected officials from \nWestern States came together, and a consensus emerged that bilingual \neducation was a realistic approach to the needs of Spanish speaking \nstudents.\n  U.S. Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas credited Monroe for his \ndecision to attend the symposium, which influenced him to sponsor the \nBilingual Education Act of 1968.\n  Once the bill was introduced, Monroe Sweetland helped marshal support \nfor it. He arranged witnesses for the hearings, and he persuaded the \nNEA to endorse it. Without his efforts, it would not have passed.\n  The Latino community in the United States has come a long way since \n1968. But we are still fighting to provide better education \nopportunities for Latino students. As we continue to press onward, I \nhope we never forget the contributions of Monroe Sweetland and others \nwho helped pass the Bilingual Education Act of 1968.\n  On a personal note, my long-time chief of staff Rey Martinez was \nnurtured in the ways of politics by Monroe. Rey would be the first to \nacknowledge Monroe's political acumen, and I would be the second. \nOregon and our entire country are a better place because of this good \nman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S363-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING OUR TROOPS\n\n\n                      DEATH OF SGT CORY R.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  One such crime occurred in Fort Wayne, IN, on March 29, 2002. John \nRunner, a 34-year-old gay man with disabilities, was found severely \nbeaten in his home. He had also suffered substantial burns caused by \nhot bacon grease. Part of his brain had to be removed during emergency \nsurgery. Law enforcement agents allege that Runner's cousin and \nroommate, Maurice Ellis, found Runner in bed with another man and an \nargument ensued. Investigators say that Ellis proceeded to beat and \ntorture Runner over a 12-hour period. Runner was unable to defend \nhimself due to his disability.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S363-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S363-S365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE FEDERAL BUDGET\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that I \nhave been known to have some thoughts on from time to time and that is \nour Nation's fiscal situation and this body's approach to its budget \nresponsibilities.\n  First, I would like to congratulate my colleagues for passing the \nOmnibus Appropriations bill. In this bill, we funded all of the \nPresident's priority items requested in the fiscal year 2004 budget and \nstill restricted discretionary spending to $876 billion.\n  I recognize that many people were dissatisfied with this legislation. \nSome people believe Congress spends too little and last year my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle offered amendments that would \nhave added over $87 billion to total spending in fiscal year 2004. \nOther people believe Congress spends too much and asked President Bush \nto veto the Omnibus Appropriations bill because it contains too much \n``pork''. It seems that neither extreme was pleased by the fiscal \nresult, which may be the best indication we did the right thing. I will \nnot claim the fiscal year omnibus is perfect. Nevertheless, this bill \nrepresents the best possible compromise between true fiscal discipline \nand Congress' desire to spend.\n  Unfortunately, this is our eighth consecutive year of compromising \nfiscal discipline and the American people are beginning to wonder when \nwe will ever get our act together. The last time discretionary outlays \nauthorized by Congress were lower than spending requested by the \nPresident was in 1996. According to the Cato Institute, real \ndiscretionary spending increases in fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004 \nare three of the 10 largest annual increases in the last 40 years. \nAlso, the Congressional Budget Office reports that if current \nappropriations maintain the same rate of growth we have given them \nsince 1999, we will increase discretionary spending by $2.7 trillion \nover 10 years and every penny of added spending will be reflected in \nthe Federal deficit and debt.\n  Some people may take comfort in CBO's baseline projections that show \nthe budget reaching surplus in 2013. Let me tell my colleagues these \nprojections should not lull us into a false sense of complacency.\n  First, CBO itself explains the baseline projections must estimate the \nfuture paths of Federal revenues and spending under current laws and \npolicies. The baseline is therefore not intended to be a prediction of \nfuture budgetary outcomes. Simply put, the CBO baseline projection \nassumes Congress will restrict the growth of spending to the rate of \ninflation, less than 3 percent a year and less than half its current \nrate of 7 percent. CBO also estimates that Congress will allow Federal \nrevenues as a percentage of GDP to increase from 15.9 percent to 20.1 \npercent, almost a one-third increase.\n  Does anyone seriously believe Congress will restrict spending or \nincrease taxes by the amounts required to meet the CBO projections? I \nwish I could say that I believed these projections but I outgrew fairy \ntales a long time ago.\n  Second, if we are honest with ourselves, many people just do not \nthink deficits are important anymore. the commonly heard refrain from \nsome of my colleagues is that Ronald Reagan proved deficits don't \nmatter. Meanwhile, some people only seem to care about deficits when \nthey get in the way of increased spending.\n  In 1995, the first year Republicans controlled Congress, spending \ngrew by $25 billion. In 2004, with Republicans still in control of \nCongress, spending will increase by $224 billion. Essentially, the \namount we increase spending each year has grown tenfold in just 9 \nyears.\n  Well, I am here to tell you deficits are important. After 10 years as \nMayor of Cleveland and 8 years as Governor of Ohio, I can tell you \nexactly why deficits are important. When a local or State government \nallows its finances to become dangerously unbalanced, creditors demand \nhigher and higher premiums on municipal bonds until interest rates \nbecome unsustainable. Contractors withhold goods and services or demand \nstrict payment terms as a condition of doing business. Taxes are often \nraised, which has a serious impact on businesses and families. Finally, \ngovernment leaders are forced to make draconian cuts in public \nservices.\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\n Families and businesses often seek better opportunities elsewhere, \nbecause their local government leaders cannot solve the problems or \nprovide government services such as school maintenance, fire and police \nprotection and hospital services.\n  This downward spiral is not limited to state or local governments. \nEntire nations in South America, Eastern Europe, Southeastern Asia and \nelsewhere around the globe have followed this well worn path to fiscal \ndemise. As much as we may like to think our Nation enjoys special \nprotection from the laws of economics, the fact is that sooner or later \nour own fiscal irresponsibility and indebtedness will catch up to us. \nNo government is immune to the consequences of deficit spending. Every \ngovernment, State, local or national, that steadily increases spending \nwith no means to pay the bill sooner or later pays a terrible penalty.\n  I know full well the penalty governments pay for fiscal foolishness. \nI took over as Mayor of Cleveland just after the city had gone into \ndefault and it took us 7 years to dig out of that hole. The, when I \nbecame Governor of Ohio, I inherited a $1.5 billion debt and had to \nimmediately make over 700 emergency spending cuts by executive order \nand cut spending four more times during my administration.\n  I am here to tell my colleagues that for the United States, that time \nis close at hand. Our Federal budget is in dire condition. We face a \nsea of red ink as far as the eye can see. And perhaps the worst thing \nabout it is that few people in this body appear to recognize how bad \nour predicament is.\n  Since I came to the Senate in 1999, this body has increased Federal \nspending an average of 7 percent per year. If we maintain this pace, \nFederal spending will double every 10 years. Just 3 years ago, we \nenjoyed a Federal surplus and we now will suffer from major deficits \nfor at least the next 5 years.\n  From the time I first arrived in Washington, I have worked hard to \nreturn the Federal Government to a balanced budget. For a short time, \nafter hand-to-hand combat, we met our goal and for 2 years, fiscal \nyears 1999-2000, we balanced the budget without raiding the Social \nSecurity surplus. Unfortunately, our success in balancing the budget \nwas short-lived. In the blink of an eye we returned to spending the \nSocial Security surplus and running large budget deficits. Today, \ninstead of reducing our $6 trillion national debt, we are expanding it.\n  In 2003, this past fiscal year, we suffered a budget deficit of $375 \nbillion. This means that we spent the entire $161 billion Social \nSecurity surplus, and on top of that we had to issue $375 billion in \nnew debt. And, if we are honest about the numbers, next year, and the \nnext decade, look even worse.\n  Thankfully, in the omnibus bill, we avoided adopting many of the \nirresponsible spending amendments offered by some members of this body. \nSo many of my friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about \nhow bad the deficits are, while at the same time, they keep supporting \nproposals to spend more money which would require borrowing even more \nnext year. Since I joined the Senate in January 1999, there have been \n190 attempts to waive the Budget Act, 67 last year alone. It defies \nlogic for any group of Senators to complain about the deficit when they \nare making 67 attempts to waive the budget act and increase spending. I \nshutter to think what our deficit would look like if all 67 attempts \nhad been successful. I find it troubling that many of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle cry crocodile tears about the size of the \ndeficit while making 67 attempts to waive the budget act.\n  The proposals we did not pass total $87 billion for fiscal year 2004 \nalone and would have cost over $494 billion over the next 10 years, all \nof which would have added to the deficit. In other words, if these \namendments had been approved, next year's deficit would be $564 billion \ninstead of $477 billion. Even at today's very low interest rates of \nless than 5 percent, these amendments would have added $1.7 billion in \nadditional annual interest payments every year. Apparently some people \nsee very little difference between paying $200 billion a year in \ninterest and $202 billion; but where does it end? How much of our \nchildren's future and even our own secure retirement can we mortgage \naway?\n  Nevertheless, there is an optimistic message in these numbers. There \nmay have been 67 efforts to waive the Budget Act in 2003 but only three \nwere successful. For all its well publicized problems, the budget \nprocess is working. The super majority points of order, established to \nexert at least a small level of fiscal discipline, effectively \nprevented 64 of 67 efforts to increase spending.\n  I believe it is time to make the Budget Act even more effective. \nTherefore I will be working to include new points of order in the \nupcoming fiscal year 2005 budget resolution. These points of order will \nhelp end one of the most dishonest budget practices in Washington: the \nuse of Social Security Trust Fund revenues to finance general \ngovernment expenses.\n  One of the biggest problems here in Washington when it comes to the \nbudget is getting the facts straight. For example, it is commonly \nthought--and reported in the media--that we only suffered a $375 \nbillion budget deficit last year. However, this figure ignores the fact \nthat we borrowed and spent $161 billion from Social Security surplus on \ntop of the $375 billion we had to borrow from the private markets.\n  We spend the Social Security surplus and leave the so-called Social \nSecurity trust fund full of government IOUs. Then, we pretend the money \njust dropped from the sky, and ignore the fact that we borrowed more \nmoney--not from the private markets, but from future Social Security \nbeneficiaries. Like most Americans, I think it is wrong to use this \nmoney to fund the day-to-day operations of the government. This is no \nway to manage the finances of our Nation. We must adopt budget process \nmechanisms that encourage fiscal responsibility, highlight the future \nconsequences of our current decisions and limit the potential for \nbookkeeping chicanery that would make an Enron accountant blush.\n  But I am not under any illusions that simply tinkering with the \nbudget rules will restore fiscal discipline. Congress has made an art \nform out of skirting the budget rules it sets for itself, and I have no \ndoubt that we could come up with a number of creative ways to avoid \nthese rules as well.\n  Instead, we need to give the American people the full picture about \nthe budget outlook so that the political pressure will be created for \nCongress to play by the rules and restore fiscal discipline. Last year \nI worked closely with Chairman Nickles and we were able to restore \nseveral important budget enforcement mechanisms such as: extension of \nsupermajority enforcement of budget points of order; extension of \ndiscretionary spending limits in the Senate; extension of restriction \non advance appropriations in the Senate; tighter restrictions on \nemergency spending legislation; and restoration of pay-as-you-go point \nof order in the Senate.\n  Also, as many of you know, last year I offered an amendment to the \nbudget resolution requesting the CBO prepare a report describing the \nlong term unfunded liabilities of the U.S. government. This amendment \nwas approved by unanimous consent and CBO will shortly be providing us \nwith this valuable information. I look forward to sharing this \ninformation with my colleagues. This year, I will go further and work \nto include a provision in the budget resolution directing CBO to \ninclude interest costs in its cost estimates for legislation. Many \nMembers are surprised to learn that CBO does not factor in additional \ninterest expense when it reports the cost of proposed legislation. It \nis as if we went to buy a house or car and completely ignored the \nfinancing costs and amortization schedule.\n  Today, our national debt stands at $6.8 trillion. If our new CBO \nfigures come to fruition, we will add a cumulative deficit of $6.1 \ntrillion from fiscal years 2004-2014, which would bring our debt up to \na whopping $12.9 trillion. At this level, the interest payments on the \nnational debt would exceed $600 billion, which is nearly twice as much \nas we currently spend on non-defense discretionary spending.\n  And who is going to end up paying for this debt? It won't be members \nof this body--no, instead it will land squarely in the lap of our \nchildren and grandchildren. I don't know any parents or grandparents \nwho would think it was a good idea to run up huge personal debts\n\n[[Page S365]]\n\nthat their children or grandchildren would have to pay at the time of \ntheir death, but that is exactly what we are doing with out Federal \nbudget.\n  It is immoral to bequeath nearly $13 trillion of debt to our children \nand grandchildren. And most of the American people agree with me. I \nknow this, because when people come into my office asking for money for \na particular project, I always ask them the same question. That \nquestion is: is this particular priority worth putting your children \nand grandchildren further into debt? And it's remarkable, their \nattitudes immediately change, and many of them reconsider.\n  So the problem isn't that the American people aren't willing to \nsacrifice and make hard choices. The problem is that Congress hasn't \nhad the guts to tell the truth about what we can and can't afford. We \nin Congress don't want to say no to anything. We want to have it all.\n  Over the past 10 years, Congress has increased spending at rates that \nwould stagger the average family. Between 1995 and 2004 the growth in \nmedian income for wage earners in our Nation was 6 percent. There is \nnot a single department in the entire Federal government that has been \nasked to restrict its growth in spending to less than 10 percent. The \nmost frugal department, the Treasury, increased its spending by 10 \npercent or more than 1.5 times the level enjoyed by median income \nearners. The Department of Labor, guardian of the interests of the \naverage workers, grew its spending by more than 99 percent or 16 times \nthe increase earned by the workers it represents.\n  Those are the facts. Congress needs to wake up and smell the coffee. \nUnless we change course, start prioritizing, making hard choices, and \nstop spending like drunken sailors, we are going to saddle our children \nand grandchildren with a debt so large it boggles the mind.\n  I have no illusions about the enormity of the task at hand to restore \nfiscal discipline. It's a big job, but it is nothing short of a moral \nimperative. In order to avoid a total breakdown of the budget and \nappropriations process, President Bush will need to work very closely \nwith Congress. Given the competing priorities in this body, it could be \nvery difficult to increase Defense and Homeland Security by 9 percent \nwhile limiting the growth in domestic spending to only 1 percent. I am \nprayerful the Budget Committee will recognize the reality of these \nnumbers and allocate sufficient funding to domestic budget function \nareas to gain the support of an overwhelming majority of Senators. To \nfail to do so would invite considerably more than 67 attempts to waive \nthe budget act and if the budget is enacted with an arrow margin, I am \nnot sure we will have the votes to defeat all of them.\n  And on top of all the pressure we face to increase spending, many of \nmy colleagues would like to permanently extend the temporary tax \nreforms enacted last year, which would mean even less revenue than CBO \nhas assumed in its most recent budget projections. So if we make these \ntax reforms permanent, we will need to either cut most of the spending \nin the discretionary portion of the budget or dig ourselves into an \neven deeper deficit hole.\n  Nor has anyone in the administration or in Congress seriously address \nthe need to control mandatory spending. More than 55 percent of Federal \nspending consists of so called ``off budget'' mandatory entitlements. \nThese mandatory programs may be off budget when we vote on \nappropriations bill but their costs weigh heavily on the budgets of \nfuture generations.\n  We have to recognize that everything we do this year will be measured \nagainst the backdrop of ever increasing deficits. It is time to take \nthem seriously and begin to make the difficult choices needed to \nrestore fiscal responsibility.\n  This will not be politically easy and I understand that. There is no \nshortage of important things the Federal Government could be doing \nacross the Nation. And, I support many of those spending ideas.\n  But the simple, undeniable fact is that we can't have it all. We have \nto make hard choices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S365-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S365-S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FIDEL CASTRO\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, when we talk about national security and \nhuman rights and our support of democracy, much of our attention \nfocuses on Iraq, other countries in the Middle East, or North Korea. \nBut we cannot forget that just 90 miles off our shore, a dictator named \nFidel Castro continues to stomp his boot down on democratic freedoms \nand human rights in Cuba.\n  After all, the cause of freedom for the Cuban people is no less \nimportant than the cause of freedom for millions in the Middle East and \nother parts of the world. And let me be clear to some of my fellow \nAmericans, Fidel Castro is a ruthless dictator that jails, tortures, \nand even murders those that seek liberty and democracy in his own \ncountry.\n  Just ask Dr. Oscar Biscet's wife. In Spring of 2003, while the \nworld's attention was on Iraq, Castro arrested Dr. Biscet and over 70 \nother Cuban advocates of democracy. Dr. Biscet and his peers did not \npromote violence in their quest for a free Cuba. They merely asked for \nthe God-given right to speak freely, a plea for basic human rights, and \nthe granting of free and fair election. Instead, Castro gave them harsh \nprison sentences. Amnesty International has adopted all of these men \nand women as ``prisoners of conscience.''\n  Dr. Biscet is now nearly a year into his 25 year sentence for \npeacefully opposing the Castro regime. In a letter smuggled out of jail \nto his wife in November of 2003, he described his imprisonment: ``The \ncharacteristics of the cell violate the law. There are no windows. \nThere are only walls. Always in darkness . . . The sky can't be seen.'' \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which last inspected \nCuban prisons in 1986, should be allowed back into Cuba immediately. \nOthers suffer similarly in jail. In many cases Castro and his thugs \nhave killed his own citizens and dissidents who advocated freedom or \ntried to be free.\n  While regular Cuban citizens suffer economic hardships, the regime in \nHavana has used tourism, foreign investment and commerce to strengthen \nits stranglehold over its people. Yet many member of Congress support \ntrading with Cuba and lifting the travel ban. This approach will not \nbring democracy to Cuba.\n  Europe and Canada have never imposed the type of travel restrictions \nthat the United States has imposed. The large increase in travel from \npeople from these free countries has not led to democratic reforms in \nCuba. Actually, the opposite has been happening. As Castro has \ncollected cash from these foreign tourists, he has increased his \nrepression.\n  The tourist trade in Cuba is controlled by Castro's totalitarian \nregime. A system of tourist apartheid has been implemented whereby \nordinary Cubans are denied equal access to hotels, beaches, \nrestaurants, clinics, and hospitals set aside for tourists. Meanwhile, \ntourists are put in hotels and enclaves that are literally walled-off \nfrom the rest of Cuba and every employee of those hotels must be hired \nthrough the Cuban government. Thus, the money spent at these hotels \ngoes directly to feed Castro's government. The money tourists spend on \nhotels and meals is the same money used to pay Castro's thugs that \nimprison Dr. Biscet and other beacons of democracy in Cuba.\n  President Bush has been steadfast in his support for the freedom \nloving people of Cuba. He has threatened to veto any bills that loosen \ntravel and trade restrictions with Cuba. He has taken a bold stand for \nthe good of the Cuban people. The Senate has also acted. We passed S. \nRes. 97 calling for the release of Castro's political prisoners shortly \nafter Castro jailed Dr. Biscet and his peers. Also, last summer we \npassed S. Res. 62 calling on various human rights organizations to take \naction in regard to the situation in Cuba.\n  The international community needs to address the situation in Cuba as \nwell. Tragically, the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights that \nshould be out front and center condemning these atrocities has Cuba \nsitting as a voting member.\n  We must continue to support advocates of democracy currently \nlanguishing in dirty Cuban jails with hardened criminals and murderers. \nMore than at any time in our ongoing struggle to bring freedom to the \nCuban\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\npeople we need to provide a consistent, unified front. We need to \nsupport the Bush Administration's policies towards Cuba. We endanger \nlives and prolong the suffering of the Cuban people by supporting \ntravel and trade with Cuba.\n  Not many people know that I once lived in Cuba. Before Castro took \npower, I played alongside many Cubans for a baseball team in Havana. I \nsaw the beautiful Cuban beaches and got to know the country and its \npeople well. I have fond memories of Cuba and my wife Mary and I would \nlike to go back and visit someday.\n  But as long as good Cubans like Dr. Biscet and others are jailed by a \nruthless dictator like Fidel Castro, I will not travel to Cuba I will \nwait until the day I can visit a free Cuba--A Cuba that respects human \nrights and free speech; a Cuba where children are not brainwashed under \nCastro's propaganda classes and where their spirits are free, where \nthey can grow up without fear, and where they can grow up in freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S366-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE ST.

Mr. President, I pay tribute to the St. Vincent \nde Paul Community Pharmacy of Crescent Springs, KY on its outstanding \ndedication to the community.\n  The St. Vincent de Paul Community Pharmacy has been in operation for \nnearly 2 years now. Since then it has provided an invaluable community \nservice by filling expensive drug prescriptions for the needy for free.\n  In this era of high costs for prescription drugs, it is very \ncomforting to know that there are groups such as St. Vincent de Paul \nwhich are helping low-income people afford the prescriptions that they \nneed. In its first 6 months of operation alone, the pharmacy has 2,000 \nprescriptions totaling $180,000 in value. These efforts are made \npossible by concerned citizens and volunteer pharmacists that dedicate \ntheir time to this worthy endeavor.\n  The people of northern Kentucky, and across the entire Commonwealth, \ncan all be proud of the dedication and kindness shown by the people at \nthe St. Vincent de Paul Community Pharmacy. In order for our society to \ncontinue to be at its best, we must have organizations like St. Vincent \nde Paul Community Pharmacy in our communities and our lives. Kentucky \nis in your debt, and you make us all proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S366-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEPARTURE OF LESLIE BROWN FROM RECLAMATION\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I bid farewell and best wishes \nto Ms. Leslie Brown, who leaves the Bureau of Reclamation's Washington \noffice after fifteen years of dedicated service.\n  For the majority of her 15 years at the Bureau of Reclamation, Leslie \nhas served in their office of Congressional Affairs with distinction \nand efficiency and without regard to ideology or partisanship. During \nmy tenure both as chairman and as ranking member of the Water and Power \nSubcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Ms. Brown \nworked closely with my staff to make sure that testimony was submitted \nin a timely manner. She always worked to ensure that we got the \ninformation we needed from Reclamation in order to address many of the \nwater resources issues facing Oregon and the western United States. We \nwill miss Ms. Brown at Reclamation. With her there, we always knew we \ncould get the information and assistance we needed in a timely manner \nand always with a smile on her face.\n  While Reclamation and those of us in this body who work with that \nagency are sad to see her leave Reclamation, I am pleased that Ms. \nBrown will continue to work with the Congress from her new post in the \nCongressional Affairs office at the Department of Agriculture's Rural \nDevelopment--where she will continue to help Congress address the needs \nof rural communities throughout the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask you and others in this body to join me in \nwishing her good luck and thank her for everything that she has done \nfor me, for Oregon, for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and \nfor the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S366-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING MYRON EDLEMAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I today publicly recognize Myron \nEdleman on his retirement from the Farm Credit Council. He has had the \nhonor of representing farmers and ranchers in American agriculture \nsince the mid-1980s when he was first elected to his first Farm Credit \nSystem entity board of directors. Over the years, the system \nconfigurations may have changed but Myron's service to the system \nremains as dedicated as it was when he first walked into a board room. \nHe has served as an association director, a bank director and as \nrepresentative on the Farm Credit Council. Additionally, he has been \nappointed to select committees, advisory committees, search committees \nand other system assignments too varied and too numerous to itemize. \nHis tenure at Farm Credit has been mutually rewarding. He takes with \nhim friendships and associations that he will forever treasure and \nleaves behind a legacy of commitment and effectiveness which few \ninvolved in the system have equaled.\n  Myron was born and grew up in Willow Lake, SD. He was an outstanding \nstudent at Willow Lake High School and served as valedictorian of his \nsenior class. He lettered 16 times, once a year for football, \nbasketball, and track. He was named to All-State teams in both \nbasketball and football. Despite an opportunity to try out as a catcher \nfor the Chicago Cubs, Myron instead opted for a football scholarship at \nKansas State University. But his love, known even then, was ranching \nand instead of pursuing his college education, he returned to Willow \nLake to go to into partnership with his father.\n  Returning to Willow Lake, he married his high school sweetheart, Jean \nBrower, raised three children, and was a vital part of this small South \nDakota community. He served as an elder and a deacon of the \nPresbyterian Church and was a member of the Gideons. He served also on \nthe Willow Lake Farmers Elevator board of directors for many years. He \nand his father worked together raising purebred Hereford bulls and \ntoday's Edleman Ranch is a fourth generation operation which he owns \nand operates with his eldest son, Marshall. Together they run a Red \nAngus commercial cow/calf operation. He is also involved with sons \nMarshall and Jason as joint owners of the Split Rock Cattle Company. \nAdditionally, he is chairman of Beef Origins, a family-owned business \nwhich is involved in a computer based livestock identification program. \nUnexpectedly, Jean passed on in 1989.\n  Myron's in-depth knowledge of both the livestock and farming \nindustries has proven invaluable in his ability to represent farmers \nand ranchers in a positive and effective manner. His ability to \narticulate that knowledge and share it in a meaningful way has also \nbeen essential to the success he has achieved as a director. And his \nunwavering commitment has been without peer. No matter how last minute \nthe meeting, how inconvenient the conference call time or how many \ntimes flights had to be re-booked. Myron has always been there, on time \nand on top of the issues. Add to this mix his strong personal \ncharacteristics of honesty, integrity and a keen intelligence, plus a \nhandshake that conveys not only strength but honor, and it is easy to \nsee why Myron is widely regarded as the most respected and effective \ndirector in Farm Credit System.\n  Always able to separate his personal politics and opinions from his \ndirectorial duties, Myron has worked unceasingly for agriculture and \nthose who are part of the industry in an unbiased and professional \nmanner. His countless contributions will be missed not only by his \ncolleagues and his friends, but by agriculture as a whole. We are \ngrateful for his service and wish continued success for his future. \nMyron looks forward to spending his retirement with his wife Anne whom \nhe married in 1992.\n  It is with great pleasure that I share his impressive accomplishments \nwith my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S366-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S366-S367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL WILLIAM T. BESTER\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great \nAmerican and a true military hero who has honorably served our country \nfor 35 years in the Army and Army Nurse Corps: BG William T. Bester. \nBrigadier General\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\nBester has had a long and distinguished military career, which he began \nas a staff nurse before obtaining advanced education as a nurse \nanesthetist. He served at various medical facilities including Madigan \nArmy Medical Center in Tacoma, WA, Okinawa, Japan and Fort Sill, OK. \nHis tremendous leadership skills led to his selection as a nurse \ninstructor at the Army Medical Department Academy of Health Sciences in \nSan Antonio, TX, and as a nurse recruiter in Indiana. He also served as \na personnel management officer at the Army personnel command in \nAlexandria, VA, and as deputy commander for nursing at the medical \nfacility at Fort Ben Harrison, IN. Brigadier General Bester served with \ndistinction in a series of assignments as deputy commander for nursing \nat the Medical Department Activity, MEDDAC, at Fort Leavenworth, KS, \ndeputy commander for nursing for the Sixty-seventh Combat Support \nHospital, Wuerzburg, Germany, commander for Medical Task Force 67 \nassigned to provide comprehensive medical support to the National \nSupport Element in Tazar, Hungary, during Operation Joint Endeavor, and \nfinally commander, MEDDAC and director of health services, Fort \nJackson, SC. In every assignment, Brigadier General Bester was \nrecognized for his loyal, dedicated, and proactive leadership \nthroughout the military community.\n   In 2000, Brigadier General Bester was appointed the twenty-first \nchief of the Army Nurse Corps. As chief, Brigadier General Bester \nplanned, implemented and monitored all policy and programs for 3,415 \nArmy nurses and over 13,000 reserve component nurses. He successfully \nimplemented numerous recruiting and retention initiatives in his \ntireless pursuit to combat the impact of the nationwide nursing \nshortage on the nurse corps and the Army civilian nurse workforce. \nBrigadier General Bester was instrumental in obtaining congressional \nsanctioned direct hire authority for civilian registered nurses. This \ndramatically improved the fill rate of professional nurses in Army \nmedical treatment facilities. With regard to recruiting Army nurses, \nBrigadier General Bester championed expansion of Reserve officer \ntraining corps nursing scholarships to almost 200 schools across the \ncountry and expanded the number of available slots for the Army \nEnlisted Commissioning Program for Nursing from 55 to 75. To meet the \ngrowing need for nurse educators and researchers, Brigadier General \nBester and his Federal Nursing Service colleagues worked with the \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and Congress to \nsuccessfully establish a Ph.D. program in nursing science and a \nperioperative clinical nurse specialist program at the Graduate School \nof Nursing.\n\n  As the Assistant Surgeon General for Force Projection and the Deputy \nChief of Staff for Operations, Health Policy and Services, Brigadier \nGeneral Bester shouldered the most complex policy and readiness issues. \nHe consistently achieved positive results by fostering harmonious \nworking relationships within the Pentagon and the Office of the Army \nSrugeon General. Brigadier General Bester was at the forefront of \nefforts to articulate the ``medical position'' to Army colleagues, \nCongress, TRICARE beneficiaries, and the sister services. He \neffectively oversaw and synchronized the conversion of the 91B and 91C \nMilitary Occupational Specialty into the 91W Future Medic--one of the \nmost important and wide-ranging medical training initiatives of the \npast 20 years. Brigadier General Bester also championed the medical \nreengineering initiative changes to the medical force structure, \nquality management techniques for the Army Medical Department, improved \ncivilian personnel hiring incentives, and improved Reserve component \nintegration.\n  As commander of the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and \nPreventive Medicine, Brigadier General Bester effectively guided the \nonly worldwide, medically matrixed health promotion and preventive \nmedicine organization within the Department of Defense. He accelerated \na transformation that enhanced the center's relevance to the Army and \nits ability to deliver effective support across the operational \nspectrum in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on \nAmerica. His emphasis on deployment occupational and environmental \nhealth issues, and the provision of operationally focused, health risk \nassessment guidance to combatant commanders within an operational risk \nmanagement framework, directly contributed to saving the lives and \nhealth of our deployed soldiers in Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the \nPersian Gulf.\n  Brigadier General Bester's accomplishments are eloquent testimony to \nhis talent, dedication, loyalty, and determination to ensure that the \nbest possible medical and preventive medicine support is always \navailable to our soldiers, civilians, and family members. Brigadier \nGeneral Bester has established a legacy of superior performance to be \nemulated by all, which reflects exceptionally on himself, the United \nStates Army, the Department of Defense, and the United States of \nAmerica. I extend my deepest appreciation on behalf of a grateful \nnation for his dedicated service. Congratulations to my friend, \nBrigadier General Bill Bester. I wish him Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S367-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S367-S368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF SEBASTIAN GARAFOLO\n\n   Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I speak in memory of the Honorable \nSebastian Garafolo, who passed away on Wednesday, January 21, 2004 at \n72 years of age.\n  Seb, as he was known, served the people of Middletown, CT for over 31 \nyears, including four terms as one of its most popular mayors. This was \nno small feat. Seb Garafalo was a Republican who was the mayor of a \ncity with three Democrats for every Republican. But his hard work and \nhis kind spirit won him supporters and friends on both sides of the \naisle. Seb Garafalo was a friend and a gentleman first, and a \npolitician second.\n  From an early age, Seb Garafolo was an individual who wanted to make \na difference. As soon as he graduated high school in 1951, he enlisted \nin the Connecticut National Guard. During the Korean War, he was called \nup to active duty and was stationed in Germany. He reached the rank of \nSSG before being honorably discharged. For many years to come, Seb \nGarafolo would be intimately involved in veterans' causes in \nMiddletown, including the founding of the Middletown Military Museum, \nInc. just this past year. Until the day he died, Seb Garafolo never \nforgot his military service and those with whom he served.\n  After years of participating in community organizations, from the \nElks Lodge and the American Legion to the St. Sebastian Church and the \nHoly Name Society, Seb Garafolo began his formal public service when he \nwas elected to the Middletown Common Council in 1973. In 1983, he was \nelected to his first term as mayor. He would hold that post until 1989, \nand then again from 1991 to 1993. Seb helped renovate Middletown's \nschools, roads, and parks, and took the lead on building a trash-to-\nenergy plant. He even put his own life on the line when he wore a wire \nfor the Middletown Police Department while meeting with individuals \nsuspected of organized crime.\n  After his final term as mayor, Seb spent 6 years as Middletown's tax \ncollector, and then was elected, once again, to the Common Council. In \n2001, he closed out a long and accomplished career by serving as \nassistant district director for my friend and colleague Congressman Rob \nSimmons. \n  Seb's commitment to service was obviously extraordinary. And that \nkind of commitment extended to his private life as well. Seb was \nmarried to his high school sweetheart, Marie, and they had two sons, \nMichael and Joseph. When Seb was diagnosed with the disease that \neventually would take his life, he was given six months to live. But he \nwas determined to be there with Marie to celebrate their 50th wedding \nanniversary. So for 2\\1/2\\ years, Seb Garafolo fought cancer with that \ndream in mind.

Mr. President, I speak in memory of the Honorable \nSebastian Garafolo, who passed away on Wednesday, January 21, 2004 at \n72 years of age.\n  Seb, as he was known, served the people of Middletown, CT for over 31 \nyears, including four terms as one of its most popular mayors. This was \nno small feat. Seb Garafalo was a Republican who was the mayor of a \ncity with three Democrats for every Republican. But his hard work and \nhis kind spirit won him supporters and friends on both sides of the \naisle. Seb Garafalo was a friend and a gentleman first, and a \npolitician second.\n  From an early age, Seb Garafolo was an individual who wanted to make \na difference. As soon as he graduated high school in 1951, he enlisted \nin the Connecticut National Guard. During the Korean War, he was called \nup to active duty and was stationed in Germany. He reached the rank of \nSSG before being honorably discharged. For many years to come, Seb \nGarafolo would be intimately involved in veterans' causes in \nMiddletown, including the founding of the Middletown Military Museum, \nInc. just this past year. Until the day he died, Seb Garafolo never \nforgot his military service and those with whom he served.\n  After years of participating in community organizations, from the \nElks Lodge and the American Legion to the St. Sebastian Church and the \nHoly Name Society, Seb Garafolo began his formal public service when he \nwas elected to the Middletown Common Council in 1973. In 1983, he was \nelected to his first term as mayor. He would hold that post until 1989, \nand then again from 1991 to 1993. Seb helped renovate Middletown's \nschools, roads, and parks, and took the lead on building a trash-to-\nenergy plant. He even put his own life on the line when he wore a wire \nfor the Middletown Police Department while meeting with individuals \nsuspected of organized crime.\n  After his final term as mayor, Seb spent 6 years as Middletown's tax \ncollector, and then was elected, once again, to the Common Council. In \n2001, he closed out a long and accomplished career by serving as \nassistant district director for my friend and colleague Congressman Rob \nSimmons. \n  Seb's commitment to service was obviously extraordinary. And that \nkind of commitment extended to his private life as well. Seb was \nmarried to his high school sweetheart, Marie, and they had two sons, \nMichael and Joseph. When Seb was diagnosed with the disease that \neventually would take his life, he was given six months to live. But he \nwas determined to be there with Marie to celebrate their 50th wedding \nanniversary. So for 2\\1/2\\ years, Seb Garafolo fought cancer with that \ndream in mind. And just a few months before his passing, he and Marie \ndid have that golden anniversary celebration.\n  On behalf of the United States Senate, I offer my thanks to Seb \nGarafolo for his years of service to the people of Middletown. And I \noffer my most heartfelt sympathies to Marie, Michael, Joseph, Seb's \nsister Josephine, his grandchildren and great grandchild, and to \neveryone who knew and loved him.\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S368-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO JOHN A. WILLIAMS SR. OF PADUCAH\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to John A. \nWilliams, Sr. of Paducah, KY for his diligence and commitment to the \ncommunity in which he lives. Mr. Williams was honored for his civic \nwork at the Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner on Thursday, \nJanuary 29, 2004.\n  In 1965, John A. Williams founded Computer Services, Inc., CSI, under \nthe initiative to provide the finest bank date processing services in \nWestern Kentucky and Illinois. CSI, which began with six employees and \nthree customers, was an agreement of three Paducah banks to consolidate \nfor the initiative. Mr. Williams continues as chairman of the board for \nCSI, which is now ranked as the fourth largest bank data processing \ncompany in the nation and continues to bring new technology and jobs to \nthe region it serves.\n  Additionally, Mr. Williams has served on the board of every major \nbusiness, civic, and cultural organization in Paducah. He is currently \non the board of Paducah Power Systems, and has served on a number of \nGovernors' Commissions for the Commonwealth.\n  The Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce named Mr. Williams Distinguished \nCitizen for his work in securing money for the Luther F. Carson Four \nRivers Center, leading a campaign that raised more the $9 million for \nthe performing arts center. The citizens of Paducah are proud of the \nbeautiful, downtown Four Rivers Center and appreciate Mr. Williams and \nthe other citizens that put so much time and energy into securing the \nfunds for the center. The center opens at the end of February and will \nprovide the entire region with a wide variety of entertainment, \ncultural, and educational programs.\n  Mr. Williams is a tribute to Paducah and the entire Commonwealth of \nKentucky. I thank the Senate for allowing me to recognize him and the \ncontributions he has made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S368-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BILL WORKMAN\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, thank you for \nthis opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of one of my \nconstituents Bill Workman.\n  I rise to commend him for his previous work as Mayor of Greenville, \nSC from 1983 to 1995, his many years of tireless community activities, \nand his most recent position as vice president of South Carolina \nDistrict Operations of Piedmont Natural Gas Company. He is scheduled to \nretire from this position in February 2004.\n  Mr. Workman also serves as president of the Greenville County \nResearch and Technological Development Corporation and as charter \nchairman of the Greenville Area Development Corporation.\n  Over the past few decades, Greenville and upstate South Carolina have \nslowly been transformed from being a textile capital of the world to a \nmuch more diversified economy. Since 1985, engineering, \ntelecommunications, retail and knowledge-based companies have joined \nmanufacturing as major sources of new jobs. There is no doubt \nGreenville is now one of the Southeast regions' premier cities for \nbusiness.\n  Bill Workman played a leading role in this evolution and has made \nmany noteworthy contributions to Greenville and upstate South Carolina.\n  He served as a past president of the Municipal Association of South \nCarolina and is a recipient of the Order of the Palmetto, a graduate of \nLeadership South Carolina, and is listed in Who's Who in America. He \nwas named the 1999 Nelson Mullins Business Person of the Year in \nGreenville and Volunteer of the Year for 2000-2001 by the South \nCarolina Economic Developers Association.\n  Mr. Workman is a graduate of The Citadel and served 2 years active \nduty. He has worked as a newspaper reporter for the Charleston News and \nCourier and the Greenville News. He later taught and served as dean of \nAllied Health Sciences at Greenville Technical College. He served 6 \nyears on the school board of Greenville County and was a founder of the \nS.C. Literacy Association.\n  He served as executive assistant for natural resources and economic \ndevelopment for Gov. James B. Edwards. Mr. Workman's selfless efforts \nalso include community economic analyses and siting studies involving \nhundreds of counties in North America.\n  He has two sons, three stepdaughters, and three grandchildren and is \nmarried to the former Patti Gage Fishburne of Walterboro.\n  We all appreciate his years of service to his community and wish him \nthe very best in all his future endeavors. Mr. Workman may retire in \nFebruary from his position with Piedmont Natural Gas, but as his past \nhistory has shown, he will never retire from his commitment to making \nGreenville a great place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S368-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S368-S369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NTCA 50th ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the National \nTelecommunications Cooperative Association as they celebrate their 50th \nanniversary. I take great pride in the fact that BEK Communications \nCooperative of Steele, ND is among the founding members of NTCA. \nForming soon after the Rural Electrification Administration, REA--today \nknown as the Rural Utilities Service--was granted authority to make \nloans to telephone companies, BEK and its fellow members in the \nNational Telecommunications Cooperative Association, NTCA, have evolved \nfrom providing basic multiparty telephone service to offering a full \narray of advanced telecommunications services.\n  Rural telecommunications carriers owe a debt of gratitude to REA, and \nthose who sought to expand its role. The idea of expanding the scope \nand authority of the REA, began in the late 1930s when REA \nAdministrator John Carmody wrote:\n\n       Personally, I have long felt there was a real opportunity \n     for constructive assistance to rural people in the idea of \n     Federal financing of farm telephone lines. It seems to me \n     that the rural people have just as much right to up-to-date \n     communication as they have to modern power. There's no \n     question in my mind but that Government assistance will be \n     required if the job is ever to be completed.\n\n  This idea remained just an idea until 1944 when Senator Lister Hill, \na Democrat from Alabama, introduced legislation calling for the \nformation of the Rural Telephone Administration, modeled after the REA. \nSenator Hill was soon joined in his effort to bring telephone service \nto rural America by, Representative W.R. ``Bob'' Poage, Democrat from \nTexas, who introduced similar legislation calling for the expansion of \nthe existing REA to make telephone loans.\n  Following 4 years of failed attempts, Congress finally succeeded in \npassing the telephone amendments to the Rural Electrification Act. On \nOctober 28, 1949, President Harry Truman signed the measure into law, \nwhich granted the REA the authority to make loans for the extension and \nimprovement of rural telephone service.\n  Soon thereafter, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, \nNRECA, created a telephone committee, composed of representatives of \nnewly formed joint electric-telephone cooperative organizations. By \n1954, representatives from these co-ops, with the encouragement of \nNRECA, decided that the time had come to form a separate national \norganization to represent telephone cooperatives.\n  On June 1, 1954, eight companies, including my constituent then known \nas BEK Mutual Aid Corporation, along with: Buggs Island Telephone \nCooperative, Chase City, VA; Mark Twain Rural Telephone Company, \nBethel, MO; Mid-Rivers Telephone Cooperative, Inc. Circle, MT; Pineland \nTelephone Cooperative, Inc. Metter, GA; Winnebago Cooperative Telephone \nAssociation, Lake Mills, IA, Twin Lakes Telephone Cooperative \nGainesboro, TN, and North Central Telephone Cooperative Lafayette, TN \nformed the National Telephone Cooperative Association, which was later \nrenamed the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association.\n  BEK, whose name was formed by the initials of Burleigh, Emmons, and \nKidder counties, was incorporated in 1952, and was one of the first \nrecipients of telephone loans from the REA. In fact, the company \nreceived its first REA loan for $371,000 in April 1952 to purchase and \nupgrade its Hazleton, ND exchange. In 1954, REA approved a second loan \nfor $1,499,000. This funding enabled BEK to expand their service \nterritory with the purchase of several independent telephone companies \nand to\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\nbegin the process of establishing modern dial exchanges. The Hazleton \nexchange became the first to be cut over to modern dial service on \nMarch 3, 1956. BEK continued to grow and prosper throughout the 1950's \nand 1960's. In April 1967, a third REA loan enabled BEK to begin \nupgrading its system to one party service. By June 10, 1977, all of \nBEK's 12 exchanges had been upgraded to one-party service.\n  What began as a dream in the minds of rural residents 50 years ago \nhas evolved into a diverse, state-of-the art telecommunications company \nserving 6,000 members across 5,700 square miles in a six-county area. \nToday BEK Communications provides many basic and advanced services \nincluding: local and long distance telephone service, dial-up and high \nspeed Internet access, using DSL & satellite technologies, advanced \nintelligent network features, ISDN, dedicated data circuits, voice \nmail, automated attendant functions, centrex and more.\n  BEK's success and its commitment to providing exemplary \ntelecommunications services to its members is indicative of all the \nrural telecommunications carriers that make up the membership of the \nNational Telecommunications Cooperative Association. NTCA's membership \nhas expanded from eight members in seven States to 558 members spread \nacross 45 States. These small rural telecommunications systems provide \nvoice services to approximately 3,270,000 subscribers over a combined \nterritory comprising some 40 percent of the geographic United States. \nOn average, NTCA member-companies serve rural areas with a population \ndensity averaging between one to five customers per square mile, a \nsharp contrast from the Bell companies average of 130 customers per \nsquare mile. Today, NTCA member-companies on average serve 5,100 \nsubscribers. In addition to their traditional voice offerings, most are \nalso engaged in the provision of some combination of Internet, \nwireless, long distance, paging, and cable or satellite television \nservices.\n  Through it all, NTCA members have maintained that local touch that \ncan only be found by folks serving their friends and neighbors. With \nthe financial assistance of the Rural Utilities Service, NTCA members \nremain on the cutting edge of technology by expanding broadband \nopportunities through such means as fiber-to-the-home projects in \ncommunities across this country. NTCA rural telecommunications \ncompanies continue to connect the heartland of America to the world. \nNTCA and its 558 member-companies should be commended for their ever \npresent commitment to rural America.\n  Happy 50th Anniversary, NTCA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S369-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S369-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S369-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S369-S370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRANSMITTING THE BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                              2005--PM 62\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly to the Committees on Appropriations \nand on the Budget:\n  The Budget I am proposing for 2005 is a reflection of this Nation's \ngoals and purpose, and advances our three highest priorities. First, \nAmerica will prevail in the War on Terror by defeating terrorists and \ntheir supporters. Second, we will continue to strengthen our homeland \ndefenses. Third, this Nation is building on the economic recovery that \nbegan in earnest in 2003 with policies that further promote growth and \njob creation. In addition, we will continue to strengthen the domestic \ninstitutions that best express our values, and serve the basic needs of \nall: good schools, quality and affordable health care, and programs \nthat promote hope and compassion in our communities. In meeting these \npriorities, the Government must exercise fiscal responsibility by \nlimiting spending growth, focusing on the results of Government \nprograms, and cutting wasteful spending.\n  In 2003, America made great progress in the War on Terror. \nAfghanistan, which once was ruled by the repressive Taliban regime, now \nhas adopted a new constitution, taking a fundamental step on the path \nto democracy. In Iraq, the remnants of the Ba'athist regime are being \nsystematically rounded up, and Iraqis are assuming responsibility for \ntheir own security and future government. Libya has pledged to disclose \nand dismantle all of the regime's weapons of mass destruction programs.\n  These victories do not change a fundamental truth: Our Nation remains \nat war. In this war, which began on September 11, 2001, our citizens \nare the strategic targets of our enemy. We have responded in two \nsignificant ways: First, we have taken the offensive to hunt down the \nterrorists, deny them easy refuge, identify and seize their secret \nfinances, and hold them and their sponsors to account. Second, we have \nmoved to secure the Nation's homeland. In 2003, the new Department of \nHomeland Security began operations in the biggest reorganization of the \nFederal Government in half a century. Over this past year, we have \ntaken steps to reduce the terrorist threat to Americans here at home, \nand protect American interests overseas. This Nation has committed \nitself to the long war against terror. And we will see that war to its \ninevitable conclusion: The destruction of the terrorists.\n  Our Budget reflects the continuing importance of providing for the \ndefense and security of the American people. We will continue to \nprovide whatever it takes to defend our country by fully supporting our \nmilitary, which is performing with great skill and honor in our battles \noverseas. We also are providing the necessary resources to our law \nenforcement and emergency personnel at home to meet the new threats \nposed by terrorists.\n  Just as we have taken much-needed steps to strengthen our national \nsecurity, we have also pursued an aggressive agenda to promote our \neconomic security. In 2003, we worked with the Congress to accelerate \nmuch of the tax relief that had been passed in 2001, so that Americans \ncould keep more of their paychecks and so that businesses would have \nmore incentive to invest in new jobs and new equipment. As a result, \nour economy is strong, and growing stronger. Economic output in the \nthird quarter rose at its fastest annual pace in nearly 20 years. More \nmanufacturers reported rising factory activity than at any point in the \nlast 20 years. American homeownership reached its highest level ever. \nEmployment is on the rise. By cutting tax rates on investment gains and \ndividend payments, we promoted saving, capital formation, and \ninvestment--and Americans' holdings in the stock market rose by almost \n$3 trillion.\n  There is still more to do, however. We cannot be satisfied until \nevery American looking for work has found a job. We must sustain the \nmomentum of this recovery by making the tax relief passed in 2001 and \n2003 permanent. We will continue to open markets abroad for American \nproducts. And as the economy improves, we will also confront the \nchallenge faced by workers who must learn new skills to fill new jobs. \nAs a Nation, we must help Americans develop the skills they need to \nsucceed in a highly competitive, highly productive economy. And so this \nbudget continues to support high standards in our schools and proposes \na Jobs for the 21st Century initiative to ensure older students and \nadults can gain the skills they need to find work now.\n  Economic growth and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars will help us \nmeet another important priority: Cutting the budget deficit brought on \nby recession and war. We must continue to evaluate each Federal \nprogram, to make sure that it meets its goals, and produces the desired \nresults. I propose to hold discretionary spending growth below four \npercent, less than the average rate of growth of American family \nincomes. And spending unrelated to defense and homeland security will \nbe held below one percent growth--less\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\nthan the rate of inflation--while continuing to meet education, health \ncare, and other priorities of this Nation. With this spending restraint \nand continue pro-growth economic policies, we can cut the deficit in \nhalf over the next five years.\n  Finally, this Budget addresses the needs of a great and compassionate \nNation, whose values are strong, and whose institutions of hope are \nenduring. We are helping communities of faith pull the addicted out of \ndependency. We are lifting children out of a life of despair by making \nsure they have mentors, and we will continue to press for improvements \nin our schools, so that no child is left behind. We are extending hope \nand healing to millions suffering from the global epidemic of AIDS. We \nwill begin to implement the benefits of our Medicare modernization and \nreform law, which will bring all our seniors coverage for prescription \ndrugs. And we will make health care more affordable and extend the full \nbenefits of our health care system to more Americans who currently have \nno health insurance.\n  Meeting these priorities will require hard work, skill, and the \nresources of a great Nation. Yet America has always risen to new \nchallenges, and has always set new goals. Challenge and change have \nrevealed the true strengths of this Nation and the enterprise of its \npeople. And as 2004 begins, I am confident those gifts will serve us \nagain, until our work is done.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to extend the date for the submittal of the final \nreport of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \nStates, to provide additional funding for the Commission, and for other \npurposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today Senator McCain and I are \nintroducing legislation to extend the life of the National Commission \non Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States so that it can complete its \ncritically important investigation into the causes of the September \n11th terrorist attacks, which claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 \ninnocent people.\n  Under legislation Senator McCain and I authored in December 2001 to \ncreate the Commission, its final report was to have been completed by \nMay 27, 2004. The Commission itself has asked for more time. So we are \nnow proposing to extend that deadline until January 10, 2005 and to \nprovide an additional $6 million for the Commission to complete its \nwork. Senator McCain and I are grateful to the Minority Leader, Senator \nDaschle, for joining us in this effort. We are also happy to have the \nsupport of Senators Dorgan, Lautenberg, Corzine, Graham, Durbin, and \nDodd. In the House, Representatives Fossella, Shays, Hinchey and \nEmanuel are expected to introduce companion legislation this week, and \nwe welcome their support as well.\n  We want the Commission's final report to be as searching and complete \nas possible. We owe that to the memories of the 3,000 victims and their \nfamilies. And we owe it to the Nation as a whole. In fact, our future \nsecurity depends upon it.\n  George Washington once said we should look back ``to derive useful \nlessons from past errors, and for the purpose of profiting by dear-\nbought experience.'' That is the precise mission of this Commission to \nbetter understand what went wrong so we can prevent such a catastrophic \nattack from ever happening again. The Commission simply needs more time \nto do that.\n  From the beginning, Senator McCain and I have been motivated by the \nexperience of the families of victims of September 11. Above and beyond \nthe grief of their losses, they have endured terrible pain in not \nknowing the whole account of how something so horrific could have \nhappened to them and those they loved. It was a tribute to the power of \nthe families' message that our legislation creating the Commission \npassed the Senate on September 24, 2002, by a resounding vote of 90-8. \nAnd it is a tribute to the enduring power of their message that Senator \nMcCain and I are seeking this extension.\n  Last week, the Commission asked Congress for at least an additional \n60 days to finalize its interviews, hearings, and report. The families, \nhowever, expressed concern that two months may be an inadequate amount \nof time to accomplish all that must be done. They have called for a \nseven-and-a-half month extension so the Commission can conduct all the \npublic hearings it had originally intended to hold, so that it can \nconduct thorough reviews of the President's daily intelligence \nbriefings--a process barely underway--and so that it has the time to \ndeal with the Administration's anticipated objections to declassifying \nmaterial in the final report. Indeed, the Commissioners I asked have \nconfirmed that they can benefit from more than the minimum two months \nrequested.\n  I have therefore been convinced by the families and the Commissioners \nthat the extra time is necessary. But I would also warn the \nAdministration that this extension is not an excuse to engage in \nadditional dilatory tactics.\n  I add this warning because the Bush Administration has a long record \nof opposing this Commission and an equally long record of making its \nwork more difficult. Ever since Senator McCain and I first joined \nforces on this issue, we have faced White House intransigence. The \nPresident opposed the Commission for 10 months until the eve of a \nSenate vote he knew he would lose. During final negotiations over the \ndetails of the legislation, the White House negotiated to keep the \nCommission's duration as short as possible, rather than give it ample \ntime to do a thorough job.\n  Once the Commission got underway, the Administration hampered the \nCommission's progress through slow document production and other \nstalling tactics, limiting the Commission's ability to proceed \nexpeditiously with its investigation. Even now, the Administration is \nrefusing to give the full Commission notes, taken by members of the \nCommission, that describe key White House documents. When one considers \nthe obstacles generated by the White House, it is not in the least bit \nsurprising that the Commission now needs additional time to finish the \njob.\n  I would note, however, that this extension does not preclude the \nCommission from releasing interim reports, as the original legislation \nestablishing the Commission allows. Furthermore, the Commission is free \nto release its final report before the deadline, if it has completed \nits work. The Commission's hearings, questioning of witnesses, factual \nfindings, and staff report issued last week proved exceptionally \nvaluable in shedding light on some of the causes of the terrorist \nattacks. Future hearings and staff reports, no doubt, will continue to \nprovide important new information about weaknesses in our defenses \nagainst terrorism.\n  Therefore, we encourage the Commission to continue to release its \nfindings and recommendations as they become available, so that we can \nlearn from the mistakes of our past as quickly as possible, and work \nharder to shore up existing vulnerabilities. Congress and the relevant \nfederal agencies have a duty to develop new strategies and capabilities \nto deter and prevent future terrorist attacks, and expeditious \nreporting by the Commission will help enormously.\n  Major systemic problems have already surfaced, for example, that can \npoint us in the right direction, or maybe even an entirely new \ndirection, to address an array of vulnerabilities, particularly in our \nlaw enforcement and intelligence communities. Allow me to cite just a \nfew examples from the Commission's work thus far to illustrate how many \nhands we will need, laboring in unison, to patch the breaches that \nremain in America's domestic security:\n  1. An immigration official at Orlando International Airport, Mr. \nMelendez-Perez, testified that on August 4, 2001, he turned away and \nsent home a suspicious, unresponsive, and belligerent Saudi national \nholding a one-way ticket with no departure plans and insufficient funds \nto stay in the U.S. and purchase a ticket home. This individual claimed \nthat he was to meet a friend at the airport but would not name the \nfriend. It turned out that one of the 9/11 hijackers, Mohamed Atta, was \nat the airport on that day. Amazingly, neither the FBI nor anyone else \nfrom the intelligence community has ever debriefed Mr. Melendez-Perez, \neven though the immigration inspector informed the FBI of the incident \nimmediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  2. The excellent performance of Mr. Melendez-Perez demonstrated that \na vigilant and well-trained officer can spot suspicious behavior in the \ncourse of a routine interview. But the Commission's hearings and \nreports also revealed how infrequently that occurs. Government \nofficials admitted in public testimony that consular employees are not \nexpected to screen for possible terrorists during interviews of visa \napplicants, nor are they trained to do so. The Commission discovered \nthat many of the hijackers had passports that were fraudulently altered \nor had other suspicious indicators, but between 1992 and September 11, \n2001, the federal government had not attempted to disseminate, to \nborder security or other relevant employees, available information \nabout the travel and passport practices of Al Qaeda or other terrorist \ngroups. All of the hijackers' visa applications were incomplete, and \nseveral contained false statements that were easily identifiable. The \nhijackers entered the United States, often more than once, without \nincident, despite the fact that several of them had violated \nimmigration law. Hijackers referred to secondary inspections for more \ndetailed scrutiny were nevertheless admitted.\n  3. New information has been revealed about the abundant knowledge the \nintelligence community had about three of the 19 hijackers, who held a \nstrategy session in Malaysia and were extensively tracked by U.S. and \nforeign intelligence services. The story fleshed\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\nout by the Commission underscores the fact that not only did the \ngovernment fail to share information that might have kept the \nterrorists out of the country, but they also failed to share \ninformation that might have exposed the terrorists' September 11th \nplot. That is why I have focused personal attention on the Terrorist \nThreat Integration Center and the Directorate for Information Analysis \nand Infrastructure Protection at DHS to make sure that these new \ncenters are receiving all intelligence information, mixing it together \nwith skilled and intense analysis, and warning the relevant state, \nlocal, and federal officials of emerging terrorist plots.\n  4. All the evidence that consolidated watch lists might have \nprevented entry to some of the terrorists notwithstanding, the watch \nlists still haven't been consolidated despite numerous Administration \npromises to do so. The Commission learned from the Federal Aviation \nAdministration that, prior to September 11th, the no-fly list created \nfor the airlines had only 12-20 names on it, whereas the terrorist \nwatch list at the State Department had tens of thousands of terrorists' \nnames. We also learned that the no-fly list and the larger terrorist \nwatch list are still not equal in numbers and that there are still \nterrorists on the larger list who might be permitted to fly if they \nevade other detection.\n  These disclosures demonstrate the Commission is accomplishing its \nassignment, and so it must be allowed to complete its investigation. I \nam certain the Commission will use the extra months wisely to complete \na thorough investigation, continue its public hearings, interview all \nrelevant government officials and complete a comprehensive final report \nfor release as soon as possible.\n  It is a basic American principle that we must learn from the past in \norder to secure a better future. Our ability to counter, prevent, and \ndefend against the next terrorist attack on our homeland depends in no \nsmall part on the Commission's ability to bring satisfactory closure to \nits work. If we only give the Commission the time, resources, and \ncooperation it deserves, the Commission's full, fair, and unflinching \nassessment of what went wrong will be of immediate value to our \nnational security. And it will be of lasting value to the American \npeople, who will finally discover the unvarnished truth.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this legislation in a timely manner so \nthat the victims' families and the rest of America may have some \nmeasure of peace.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2040\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TERRORIST \n                   ATTACKS UPON THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Extension.--Section 610(b) of the Intelligence \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-306; 6 \n     U.S.C. 101 note; 116 Stat. 2413) is amended by striking ``18 \n     months after the date of the enactment of this Act'' and \n     inserting ``January 10, 2005''.\n       (b) Additional Funding.--Section 611 of that Act (6 U.S.C. \n     101 note; 116 Stat. 2413) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c);\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new \n     subsection (b):\n       ``(b) Additional Funding From the National Foreign \n     Intelligence Program.--In addition to the amounts made \n     available to the Commission under subsection (a), of the \n     amounts authorized to be appropriated by the Intelligence \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-177) \n     and available in the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act, 2004 (Public Law 108-87) for the National Foreign \n     Intelligence Program, not more than $6,000,000 shall be \n     available for transfer to the Commission for purposes of the \n     activities of the Commission under this title.''; and\n       (3) in subsection (c), as so redesignated, by striking \n     ``subsection (a)'' and inserting ``this section''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Democratic and Republican \ncommissioners on the blue ribbon commission investigating the September \n11, 2001 terrorist attacks reached an important and bipartisan \ndecision. They decided they needed more time--more time to get access \nto the documents and people that can help us understand what happened \non that fateful day; more time to analyze this information so they can \nhelp us identify which corrective measures are needed to reduce the \nprospects for future 9/11s; in short, more time to do what they are \nrequired to do by law.\n  I come to the floor today to talk briefly about my views on this \ncommission and its work, and to explain why I have joined with Senators \nMcCain and Lieberman to offer legislation to give the commission the \ntime needed to complete its task and provide the families of the \nvictims of 9/11 and all Americans with a complete and thorough report.\n  The importance of this commission's work cannot be overstated. This \nindependent commission represents the last and perhaps best hope for \nour Nation to understand how 19 individuals were able to execute the \nmost deadly terrorist attack on American soil in this Nation's long \nhistory.\n  How did these terrorists get into this country? What is the source of \nfunding they used to carry out these activities? How did the hijackers \nget themselves, and apparently knives and mace, past airport security? \nHow were they able to hijack four aircraft and drive them to such a \ndeadly end? Why could our intelligence community and policymakers not \ndo more to prevent these heinous acts? What can the Government and \nindividual citizens do in the future to prevent similar attacks?\n  These are but some of the difficult questions the commission has to \naddress. Given the importance of their task, one would think that all \nparties--Democratic and Republican, Congress and the White House--would \nquickly agree to provide the commission whatever it needs.\n  Unfortunately, in the days immediately after the commissioners made \ntheir request, it became evident some parties may not believe the \ncommission should be provided the time it needs to do what is required \nby law.\n  Quoting from the New York Times on January 28:\n\n       The White House and Republican congressional leaders have \n     said they see no need to extend the congressionally mandated \n     deadline . . . and a spokesperson for Speaker J. Dennis \n     Hastert said . . . Mr. Hastert would oppose any legislation \n     to grant the extension.\n\n  As unsettling as this position is, in hindsight, it should not be \nsurprising to those who have followed the history of this commission. \nIn the months immediately after the tragic events of September 11, \n2001, President Bush and Vice President Cheney personally appealed to \nme and to other Members of Congress not to establish a bipartisan blue \nribbon commission.\n  Vice President Cheney suggested to me that creating such an effort \ncould detract from administration officials' efforts to get the \nterrorists responsible.\n  Fortunately, neither the families of the victims of 9/11 nor the \nAmerican people accepted this argument. They understood, and properly \nin my view, that an independent investigation would enhance our efforts \non the war on terror.\n  Far from endangering national security, an inquiry could actually \nhelp us pinpoint and correct flaws in our security and intelligence \ncommunities and identify the necessary corrective measures.\n  Despite the fact that the idea of a commission enjoyed the \noverwhelming support of the families of the victims and of the American \npeople, the administration, and the House Republican leadership \npersisted in their efforts to see that this idea never took flight--in \nsome instances, at the same time they were publicly professing their \nsupport for the commission.\n  For example, on the same day the White House spokesperson indicated \nPresident Bush supported the idea of a commission, his negotiators were \non Capitol Hill vetoing a congressional agreement to establish one.\n  In October of 2002, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees \nannounced they had reached a deal to include language to establish the \ncommission in the intelligence authorization bill. The next day, the \ndeal collapsed and negotiators involved laid the blame at the doorstep \nof the White House and the House Republican leadership.\n  According to the Washington Post, a senior Republican Senator said:\n\n       The House Republican leadership weighed in against [the \n     deal] and the deal collapsed. . . . It is no secret that the \n     White House works through the House Republican leadership.\n\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\n\n  Again, the families of the victims and supporters of the commission \nwere not deterred. In fact, this commission would not exist were it not \nfor the dedicated efforts of the families of the victims. They pressed \non, and in November of 2002, they prevailed.\n  Congress passed the legislation creating the commission and the \nPresident signed it into law. The commission was given until May of \n2004 to do its work. We all knew at the time that this deadline was \nboth arbitrary and highly ambitious, given the scope of the work \ninvolved. Subsequent actions would make meeting this deadline \nimpossible.\n  The commission was immediately embroiled in controversy over the \nselection and subsequent resignation of Henry Kissinger, who the \nPresident selected to chair its work. But the obstacles placed in front \nof this commission were just the beginning. In light of the sensitive \nnature of much of the information the commission would be examining, \ngetting the commission high-level security clearances was the first \npriority.\n  However, for a variety of reasons, a process that could have taken \nweeks stretched into months, thereby preventing the commissioners from \nexamining numerous important documents.\n  Then came open resistance from the Bush administration to commission \nrequests for access to documents and individuals the commissioners \ndeemed vital to their inquiry. The commission quickly became bogged \ndown in negotiations over which documents and individuals it would have \naccess to and under what terms and conditions.\n\n  Many agencies flat out refused to provide access. Others insisted the \nadministration minders be present when the commission questioned \nGovernment employees.\n  The commission was forced to resort to subpoenas to obtain \ninformation from several Federal agencies, and press reports is \nactively considering issuing others.\n  As recently as this past week, it was reported that the \nadministration is still placing roadblocks in front of the commission's \nvital work. Over the weekend, it was disclosed that the White House is \nrefusing to allow the commission access to notes its own members have \ntaken on briefings received by the President.\n  As a result of the administration's repeated failure to cooperate \nfully and immediately with the commission and its important work, it \nhas become increasingly clear that it cannot fulfill the immense task \nplaced before it and comply with the deadline imposed on it.\n  In order to meet this deadline, commissioners tell us they would have \nto cut corners. Scheduled hearings would have to be canceled. \nInterviews with key officials would have to be scrapped. Time to \nanalyze their information and write their report would be short. All of \nthese reasons led the commission, wisely in my view, to request \nadditional time. All of these reasons led me to join the families of \nthe victims, as well as Senators McCain and Lieberman, to conclude we \nmust do everything possible to meet their requests.\n  I hope those who have opposed the commission and its work in the past \nwill step aside. I hope they will allow us to provide the commission \nwith the time it needs to give the families and America the report it \ndeserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 2043. A bill to designate a Federal building in Harrisburg, \nPennsylvania, as the ``Ronald Reagan Federal Building''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation, along with Senator Santorum, to honor former President \nRonald Reagan by naming the Federal Building and Courthouse in \nHarrisburg, PA, in his name.\n  President Ronald Reagan was a watershed force in 20th Century \nhistory. He was a master diplomat and statesman, largely responsible \nfor winning the Cold War. His summits with former Soviet leader Mikhail \nGorbachev were tours de force of negotiation and stagecraft. He was \ncalled ``the great communicator'' for good reason. He conveyed his \nmessage with power and precision, often convincing even his staunchest \nopponents to see things his way. His talents and his touch helped rally \na Democrat-controlled Congress to support much of his legislative \nagenda, including bold fiscal reforms--defying conventional wisdom that \npredicted more partisan stalemate. He ran for President on the slogan \n``Morning in America''--and delivered.\n  President Reagan also took bold steps on the social front. By \ntransferring power from Washington to the States and cities, he showed \nthat local governments can be laboratories for a wide range of public-\npolicy experiments--with greater flexibility and sensitivity. The \napproach was in line with his general push from big government toward \nindividual liberty.\n  To some, Ronald Reagan's greatest legacy was strengthening our \nnational defense. The Berlin Wall toppled, it seemed, directly from his \ncall, ``Mr. Gorbachev, Tear Down This Wall!'' The invasion of Grenada \nrescued American students and resulted in the overthrow of a Marxist \ngovernment. His vision for a national missile defense system is leading \nto greater security for all of us.\n  President Reagan showed courage and charisma, even in crisis. As he \nwas about to undergo surgery to remove a bullet that lay an inch from \nhis heart, he told his wife, ``Honey, I forgot to duck.'' The next \nmorning, the President met with aides in his hospital room and signed a \nbill into law.\n  For these reasons and many more, I urge my colleagues to join us in \nbestowing this honor upon this great American.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2045. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \na voter-verified permanent record or hardcopy under title III of such \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Secure and \nVerifiable Electronic Voting Act of 2004.\n  The 2000 presidential election exposed a number of serious problems \nwith the accuracy and fairness of election procedures in this country, \nas well as the reliability of certain types of voting technology. As a \nresult of these irregularities, many eligible voters were effectively \ndisenfranchised and thus deprived of one of their most fundamental \nrights. This is not acceptable in a democracy such as ours.\n  Our constituents demanded better and we responded.\n  In 2002, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). This \nimportant legislation sets Federal minimum standards for voting \nsystems, including requiring that the equipment used is reliable, \naccurate, and accessible to all. It encourages the use of direct \nrecording electronic voting systems to replace the outdated punch card \nand lever machines. It also requires that voting systems provide voters \nthe opportunity to correct errors and that they produce a permanent \nrecord with a manual audit capacity.\n  However, HAVA does not go far enough. As we move our voting systems \ninto the 21st century, we need to ensure the greatest level of \naccountability possible. Voters need to have confidence in the \ntechnology that they're using, and they need to be assured that their \nvotes will be counted exactly as they are cast. It is imperative that \nany voting system certified by the Federal Government provides these \nassurances.\n  In my home State of California, we are already using touch-screen \nvoting machines in some areas--28 percent of the precincts by the March \nprimary. But, these machines currently do not leave any paper trail and \ncannot be verified for complete accuracy. We need an electronic voting \nsystem that is modern, secure, and verifiable. The State of California \nis taking these steps. Secretary of State Kevin Shelley has required \nthe use of voter-verified paper audit trails and safety measures, such \nas manufacturer security, local testing of machines, and random audits \nof system software. These practices need to be in place nationwide.\n  My bill, the Secure and Verifiable Electronic Voting Act--the SAVE \nVoting Act would require that a voter-verified paper trail for each \nvote cast be in place for the November 2004 elections. What that means \nis this: after an individual votes, he or she will have the opportunity \nto review the vote on a\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\npiece of paper, before it becomes part of the official record. If there \nis a discrepancy, the voter will have an opportunity to change his or \nher vote before it is recorded in the official record. This paper \nrecord will then be the official permanent record used for any recount \nor verification.\n  The SAVE Voting Act would also create greater security standards by \nmaking sure that access to the software is limited to approved \npersonnel who have had background checks. It would require that any \nsoftware used is not transmitted over the Internet, that the Election \nAssistance Commission certifies any and all software used in voting \nsystems, and that the certified code be made available to the public \nfor review. These security measures help to ensure, up front, that the \nelectronic voting systems we use are safeguarded.\n  The SAVE Voting Act would ensure that a permanent paper record is \ntruly, a permanent paper record by banning the use of thermal paper. \nThermal paper has many flaws, including the potential to fade or \nreceive unintended marks, making the vote illegible.\n  Finally, recognizing the current cashed-strapped plight of the \nStates, my legislation would provide immediate financial assistance to \nStates to help cover the cost of adding printers to electronic voting \nsystems.\n  In a democracy, the vote of every citizen counts. We must make sure \nthat every citizen's vote is counted--and counted accurately and fairly \nso that the American people have confidence in the results. HAVA was a \ngood first step. The SAVE Voting Act is the next step, and I encourage \nmy colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2046. A bill to authorize the exchange of certain land in \nEverglades National Park; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Nelson. Our bill is non-controversial \nand will allow the Department of the Interior and the South Florida \nWater Management District to perform a land exchange for the purpose of \nconstructing the C-111 Spreader Canal Project under the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan, known as CERP. Both the Department of the \nInterior and the State of Florida have approved the language of the \nbill, and Senator Nelson and I hope to expedite passage of the bill \nthrough the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the full Senate.\n  CERP, which was authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of \n2000, is the framework that guides our efforts to restore America's \nEverglades. It consists of over 60 major projects that will restore \nEverglades National Park and other areas of the greater Everglades \necosystem. The C-111 Spreader Canal Project is just one of the 60 \ncomponent projects of CERP. The C-111 project will provide important \nenvironmental benefits to the Southern Glades and Model Lands and more \nnatural sheet flow to Florida Bay while maintaining flood protection \nfor surrounding agricultural and urban areas.\n  I am also pleased to report that Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, who \nrepresents the relevant congressional district, and Congressman Jim \nDavis will introduce a companion bill in the House of Representatives.\n  2004 marks the beginning of the fourth year of CERP implementation \nand Everglades restoration. We have been hard at work getting through \nphase one--the planning and organizational phase of such an historic \nand monumental restoration project. We have now entered into phase \ntwo--building the projects that will deliver water to the Everglades \nand revive the dying ecosystem. As we continue to make progress on what \nhas always been a bipartisan and bicameral project, I want to thank my \ncolleagues for their support for the restoration of America's \nEverglades. I look forward to our continued work together to bring the \nRiver of Grass back to its former glory as the crown jewel of the \nnational parks system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 2047. A bill to amend the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act of 2000 to include certain former nuclear \nweapons program workers in the Special Exposure Cohort under the \ncompensation program established by that Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill designate the former Mallinkrodt Nuclear Production Facilities in \nMissouri as a Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) under the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) of 2000. These \nfacilities, which handled and processed highly radioactive materials \nduring the Cold War, are located in Downtown St. Louis, Weldon Springs \nin St. Charles County, and Hematite in Jefferson County, MO \nrespectively.\n  Energy workers at these sites handled and processed highly \nradioactive materials during the Cold War as part of the Manhattan \nProject and our nation's ongoing Atomic Weapons Program. The St. Louis \nDowntown or ``Destrahan'' Site operated from 1942 through 1958. From \nthere, operations and most Mallinkrodt workers were moved out to the \nWeldon Springs Facility which operated until 1958. After that, work \ncontinued at the Hematite Facility in Jefferson County until 1969.\n  This legislation would add these facilities to the four existing \nSpecial Exposure Cohort (SEC) Sites across the country, which were \nwritten into the original EEOICPA. In addition to designating the \nexisting SEC sites, the EEOICPA set up a process to add additional \nsites to the SEC list provided those sites meet certain criteria.\n  A Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) is comprised of a group of employees \nwith specific cancers who worked at four specific nuclear facilities or \nparticipated in certain nuclear weapons tests, and who met other \nrequirements under the EEOICPA. An SEC designation would provide former \nworkers at these sites or their survivors with expedited compensation \nas opposed to requiring these workers to participate in the long, \ncomplex and cumbersome bureaucratic process known as dose \nreconstruction.\n  According to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health \n(NIOSH), there are two key statutory determinations required for adding \na class of employees to the SEC. The first requirement is that it is \nnot feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose \nthat the class of employees received. The second requirement is that \nthere is a reasonable likelihood that such a radiation dose may have \nendangered the members of this class. After extensive research, which \nincluded several briefings with NIOSH, the Department of Energy, \nindependent experts and former Mallinkrodt workers, I believe that \nthere is strong evidence indicating that both statutory requirements \nfor the SEC have been met with regard to the Mallinkrodt Sites.\n  In mid 2001, the Department of Energy (DOE) released a report \nindicating for the first time that the highly radioactive material \nplutonium was processed at the Weldon Springs Site. The report also \nstated that recycled uranium, another highly radioactive material, was \nprocessed at the site. Furthermore, in its recently completed site \nprofile for the St. Louis Downtown Site, NIOSH admits that they have \nvirtually no records or monitoring data on the workers at the site \nprior to 1948. NIOSH also stated that this could be a problem in \ncalculating individual dose, thus requiring some assumptions to be \nmade.\n  Both of the aforementioned issues, the presence of plutonium and the \nloss or destruction of individual monitoring records were reasons for \nwriting the four existing SEC sites into the original EEOICPA.\n  In addition to these issues, long sought after documents from the \nformer Chief Safety Officer for the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) \nduring the time described the Mallinkrodt St. Louis facility as one of \nthe two worst plants with respect to worker exposures. Workers at this \nplant were exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust \nrelative to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \nwere exposed to as much as 200 times the preferred levels of exposure. \nNIOSH confirmed these intense levels at a recent presentation on the \nMallinkrodt-St. Louis Site Profile\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nwhen it described the operations at this plant as a ``messy'' or \n``dirty'' operation in terms of levels of radionuclides present.\n  Finally, NIOSH has informed claimants who worked at these sites or \ntheir survivors that if they are not interviewed as a part of the dose \nreconstruction process, it would ``hinder'' NIOSH's ability to conduct \ndose reconstruction for the claimant and may result in a dose \nreconstruction that ``incompletely or inaccurately'' estimates the \nradiation dose to which the energy employee named in the claim was \nexposed. So NIOSH is basically saying that they are relying on a former \nworker's memory or any information a survivor might have. What if the \nformer worker cannot remember what he was exposed to or was never told? \nWhat if the survivor has no idea as to what materials the claimant \nmight have been exposed? Keep in mind. Most of this happened anywhere \nfrom 40-60 years ago.\n  All of the previously mentioned points are evidence that the health \nof these workers was endangered and that an accurate dose \nreconstruction is not feasible. Therefore, I believe that the \nMallinkrodt sites in Missouri should be designated as a Special \nExposure Cohort.\n  To make matters even worse, the Department of Health and Human \nServices first published the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) \nconcerning the Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and as of \ntoday, January 27, 2004, this rule has yet to be finalized. Many of \nthese former Mallinkrodt workers have died while waiting for the \nproposed SEC rule to be finalized, including some claimants who were \nwaiting for dose reconstruction to be started or completed.\n  This is simply unacceptable! The EEOICPA was intended to provide long \noverdue compensation to these workers within a reasonable period of \ntime. These brave workers answered the call and helped our nation win \nthe Cold War. It is now time for our nation to help them and provide \nthem with the immediate compensation that they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2047\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities \n     (including the St. Louis downtown facility, the Weldon \n     Springs facility, and the Hematite facility) were exposed to \n     levels of radio nuclides and radioactive materials that were \n     much greater than the current maximum allowable Federal \n     standards;\n       (2) the Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were \n     exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative \n     to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \n     were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure;\n       (3)(A) the chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy \n     Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations \n     described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with \n     respect to worker exposures;\n       (B) workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of \n     uranium per day causing kidney damage; and\n       (C) a recent epidemiological study found excess levels of \n     nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts;\n       (4) the Department of Energy has admitted that those \n     workers were subjected to risks and had their health \n     endangered as a result of working with these highly \n     radioactive materials;\n       (5) the Department of Energy reported that workers at the \n     Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and \n     recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive;\n       (6) the National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health admits that--\n       (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site consisted \n     of intense periods of processing extremely high levels of \n     radio nuclides; and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for workers prior to 1948;\n       (7) the National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     sites that if they are not interviewed as a part of the dose \n     reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed;\n       (8) the Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and as of January \n     27, 2004, the rule has yet to be finalized; and\n       (9) many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF MEMBER OF THE SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT.\n\n       Section 3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational \n     Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. \n     7384l(14)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:\n       ``(C) The employee was so employed for a number of work \n     days aggregating at least 45 workdays at a facility operated \n     under contract to the Department of Energy by Mallinkrodt \n     Incorporated or its successors (including the St. Louis \n     downtown or `Destrahan' facility during any of calendar years \n     1942 through 1958, the Weldon Springs feed materials plant \n     facility during any of calendar years 1958 through 1966, and \n     the Hematite facility during any of calendar years 1958 \n     through 1969), and during the employment--\n       ``(i)(I) was monitored through the use of dosimetry badges \n     for exposure at the plant of the external parts of an \n     employee's body to radiation; or\n       ``(II) was monitored through the use of bioassays, in vivo \n     monitoring, or breath samples for exposure at the plant to \n     traternal radiation; or\n       ``(ii) worked in a job that had exposures comparable to a \n     job that is monitored, or should have been monitored, under \n     standards of the Department of Energy in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this subparagraph through the use of \n     dosimetry badges for monitoring external radiation exposures, \n     or bioassays, in vivo monitoring, or breath samples for \n     internal radiation exposures, at a facility.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S376-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 295--CONGRATULATING THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ON THEIR \n                     VICTORY IN SUPER BOWL XXXVIII\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Chafee) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 295, submitted earlier today by Senators \nKennedy, Kerry, Reed, and Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 295) congratulating the New England \n     Patriots on their victory in Super Bowl XXXVIII.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n   (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, backed by the heartiest fans in the \nworld, the New England Patriots are once again the greatest football \nteam in the Nation. I want to join so many others in commending the \nPatriots for their marvelous and miraculous season, in which the team \novercame injuries and a slow start to end up with a fifteen-game \nwinning streak and a second Super Bowl championship in three years. \nFrom the wise stewardship of Bob Kraft and Bill Belichick to the Tom \nBrady-led offense and the Ty Law-led defense, the Patriots are a team \nin the fullest sense of the word. Congratulations also to the Carolina \nPanthers, who mad Super Bowl XXXVIII one of the most memorable season-\nending games in U.S. professional sports history.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, on February 1, 2004, the New England \nPatriots defeated the Carolina Panthers, 32-29 in what has been already \ncalled one of the most exciting Super Bowls of all time. I commend the \nPatriots players, coaches and management for a thrilling victory. These \nPatriots have been a testament to successful teamwork, setting a \nwonderful example of self-sacrifice and unity, and showing us all what \nis possible when we work together, believe in each other, and \ncollaborate for the greater good. The Patriots' embodiment of the team \nconcept was needed to overcome the tenacious Carolina Panthers, who \ncame back again and again in a spectacular effort.\n   The hard-earned victory in Super Bowl XXXVIII, the second in 3 years \nfor the Patriots, was also their 15th consecutive win, putting the team \nin elite company as one of the greatest teams in NFL history. \nAmazingly, once again the New England region, and indeed, the entire \ncountry, were held on the edge of their seats as the Patriots kicker, \nAdam Vinatieri, won the game on a last second field goal. Indeed, \nVinatieri has been a friend to my home State of Rhode Island, active in \nthe Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, D.A.R.E., and as \na spokesperson for the Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island's Teen \nAnti-Smoking Contest.\n   This Patriots team was led all season by their coach, Bill \nBelichick, who has masterminded victory after victory by stressing \npreparation, team work and adaptation. In the championship game the \nPatriots defense, arguably the team's best asset, was led by Ty Law,\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nMike Vrabel, Tedy Bruschi and the veteran Willie McGinest. Vrabel was \nparticularly impressive as an ``Ironman'' playing on the offense and \nscoring a touchdown.\n   The Patriots offense was led by the Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady who \ntime after time led his team back until finally placing them in \nposition to win. Brady was helped on offense by clutch performances \nfrom Troy Brown, Deion Branch, Kevin Faulk and Antowain Smith. \nUltimately it was the Patriots offense, cool under the pressure, that \nbrought them a hard earned victory.\n   Let me also acknowledge a Rhode Island native on the New England \nteam. A former Boston College standout, running back Mike Cloud, was an \nimportant part of the Patriots' winning season, scoring five touchdown \nand making critical plays. Cloud is a former Rhode Island Player of the \nYear and long before he helped the Patriots win their second Super \nBowl, he helped lead Portsmouth High School to three consecutive Rhode \nIsland Class A Championships. I am proud that he has had the \nopportunity to represent our State and play an important role in this \nvictory.\n   Once again, my congratulations to the New England Patriots and their \nfans on their Super Bowl victory. \n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should designate the week beginning \n     February 2, 2004, as ``National School Counseling Week''.\n       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests the President to \n     issue a proclamation--\n       (1) designating the week beginning February 2, 2004, as \n     ``National School Counseling Week''; and\n       (2) calling on the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe the week with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the role \n     school counselors perform within the school and the community \n     at large to prepare students for fulfilling lives as \n     contributing members of society.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              S. Res. 294\n\n       Whereas mentoring is a strategy for motivating and helping \n     young people succeed in life, by bringing them together in \n     structured and trusting relationships with caring adults who \n     provide guidance, support, and encouragement;\n        Whereas mentoring offers a supportive environment in which \n     young people can grow, expand their vision, learn necessary \n     skills, and achieve a future that the young people never \n     thought possible;\n        Whereas a growing body of research shows that mentoring \n     benefits young people in numerous ways, through improvements \n     in school performance and attendance, self-confidence, \n     attitudes and relationships with adults, and motivation to \n     reach their potential;\n        Whereas mentoring is an adaptable, flexible approach that \n     can be tailored to focus on helping young people with \n     academics, social skills, career preparation, or leadership \n     development;\n        Whereas over 15,000,000 young people in this Nation still \n     need mentors, falling into a ``mentoring gap'';\n        Whereas mentoring relies principally on volunteer mentors, \n     so mentoring programs\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\n     must recruit even more volunteers in order to expand their \n     program to help more young people;\n       Whereas, in an effort to begin closing the mentoring gap, \n     this year Congress has significantly increased Federal grant \n     funding for local mentoring organizations to $100,000,000;\n        Whereas the recipients of these grants and other entities \n     carrying out mentoring programs all across the country will \n     need an influx of volunteers to meet the growing demand for \n     mentoring;\n        Whereas nonprofit groups and leading media companies have \n     joined together to designate January 2004 as National \n     Mentoring Month to recruit more mentors for young people; and\n       Whereas the month-long celebration of mentoring will \n     encourage more adults to volunteer their time as mentors for \n     young people and enlist the involvement of nonprofit \n     organizations, schools, businesses, faith communities, and \n     government agencies in the mentoring movement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1)(A) designates the month of January 2004 as ``National \n     Mentoring Month''; and\n       (B) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities that promote awareness of and volunteer \n     involvement with mentoring;\n       (2) praises individuals who are already giving their time \n     to mentor young people; and\n       (3) supports efforts to recruit more adults as mentors, in \n     an effort to close the Nation's mentoring gap.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/02/senate-section/article/S379-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MAMMOGRAPHY QUALITY STANDARDS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 424, S. 1879, relating to mammography \nquality standards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1879) to amend the Public Health Service Act to \n     revise and extend provisions relating to mammography quality \n     standards.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \npass the Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2003, S. \n1879. I am pleased to be sponsoring this bill with Senator Ensign and \nour bipartisan cosponsors. This important bill is about saving lives. \nThat's what the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) does. Accurate \nmammograms detect breast cancer early, so women can get treatment and \nbe survivors.\n  Mammography is not perfect, but it is the best screening tool we have \nnow. I authored MQSA over 10 years ago to improve the quality of \nmammograms so that they are safe and accurate. Before MQSA became law, \nthere was an uneven and conflicting patchwork of standards for \nmammography in this country. There were no national quality standards \nfor personnel or equipment. Image quality of mammograms and patient \nexposure to radiation levels varied widely. The quality of mammography \nequipment was poor. Physicians and technologists were poorly trained. \nInspections were lacking.\n  MQSA set Federal safety and quality assurance standards for \nmammography facilities for: personnel, including doctors who interpret \nmammograms; equipment; and operating procedures. By creating national \nstandards, Congress helped make mammograms a more reliable tool for \ndetecting breast cancer. In 1998, Congress improved MQSA by giving \ninformation on test results directly to the women being tested, so no \nwoman falls through the cracks because she never learns about a \nsuspicious finding on her mammogram. Now it is time to renew MQSA and \nlay the foundation to strengthen it even further.\n  The bill passed by the Senate today will extend MQSA for 2-years. \nThis 2-year reauthorization of MQSA is important. It will give Congress \nan opportunity to consider in the next reauthorization expert \nrecommendations from an Institute of Medicine, IOM, study and a General \nAccounting Office, GAO, report on several issues related to MQSA. I \nhave been working with the Labor, Health and Human Services, HHS, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee to get these studies underway. \nThe IOM study was included in the fiscal year 2004 omnibus \nappropriations bill. The HELP Committee also heard testimony in support \nof a 2 year reauthorization at its hearing last year on MQSA.\n  This legislation is also supported by groups including the American \nCancer Society, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the \nNational Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, Y-ME National Breast \nCancer Organization, and the American College of Radiology Association.\n  I thank Senators Gregg and Kennedy for their support and help in \nmoving this legislation through the Senate. I hope that the House will \nmove quickly to pass this important bill. It is estimated that over \n217,400 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed and over 40,500 \nbreast cancer deaths will occur in the United States this year. Early \ndetection and treatment are important to reducing breast cancer deaths. \nCongress should pass this bill to reauthorize MQSA and extend this \nvaluable program that helps save the lives of women and men with breast \ncancer.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1879) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
