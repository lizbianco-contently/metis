Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the nomination of Michael Leavitt to be Administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency. There will be 1 hour of debate \nprior to the nomination. I am pleased this distinguished nominee for \nthe President's Cabinet will receive an up-or-down vote and anticipate \nhis confirmation by an overwhelming majority this morning.\n  Following the disposition of the Leavitt nomination, the Senate will \nresume debate on the foreign operations appropriations bill. There are \nseveral amendments pending to the bill. We hope to begin scheduling \nvotes on those amendments. Senator McConnell will be here following the \nnomination vote. We anticipate completing action on the bill during \ntoday's session. Therefore, Senators should expect rollcall votes \nthroughout the day and possibly votes into the evening, if necessary.\n  Each day I come to the floor I mention the schedule and the remaining \nbusiness before the Senate. Again, I would like to reiterate that the \ndays of this session are waning, but we have a full legislative agenda \nand executive matters to finish. We have the appropriations bills and \nthe conference reports, Healthy Forests--and the tragic events in \nCalifornia underscore the need for this crucial legislation. Regarding \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act, we are in discussions, and I hope an \nagreement can be reached on its consideration. If not, it will be \nnecessary to take the procedural steps to ensure that the Senate does \nact on this very important piece of bipartisan legislation.\n  We have the Internet tax moratorium. Discussions are underway on an \nagreement to allow us to act before the expiration of the existing law.\n  On the climate change legislation, we have a 6-hour agreement. I hope \nwe can possibly use less time than those 6 hours. We are looking for an \navailable time to consider it this week.\n  We have the judicial nominations as well.\n  Again, I hope to make efficient use of the Senate's time over the \ncoming days, and I hope and look forward to working with the Democratic \nleadership so we can consider these bills under time agreements and in \na timely fashion.\n  Everybody is aware of the scheduling challenges we have during this \ntime of year. But with the cooperation of all Members, we will be able \nto finish our work and adjourn at the earliest possible time. As \nalways, I thank our colleagues and Senators for their cooperation and \nenergy and patience to accomplish this as we go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13325-6", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13325-S13326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the distinguished majority leader is \nin the Chamber, the Senator from Kentucky and I had a conversation on \nthe floor here last night--it was public in nature--indicating that it \nwas the majority leader's intention for us to work on November 10 and \n11 that is, Monday and Tuesday of the week after next.\n  I totally support that. If we are going to get out of here, we have \nto work that week. The leader set November 7 as a time when we should \nget out. I think that will be nearly impossible. We may. I hope, if we \nare going to try to adjourn on November 14, that Members will \nunderstand we are going to have to do more that Monday and Tuesday than \nhave votes on judges. We are going to have to go into \nsubstantive matters and all during Monday have votes. If we are going \nto come at 5 o'clock and have a relatively unimportant vote, then I \ndon't think we will accomplish much.\n\n  If we have, I repeat, any intention, any hope of getting out of here \non November 14--which I hope we could do--we are going to have to work \nMonday and Tuesday. I fully support the majority leader.\n  As I said last night on the floor, the veterans of the State of \nNevada would also understand why, on an important holiday, Veterans \nDay, we would be\n\n[[Page S13326]]\n\nhere doing the people's business. A lot of the business we are doing \nrelates directly to the veterans.\n  So I hope, if we are going to work those 2 days, they are meaningful, \nhard days.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair in response, it is our \nobjective to adjourn as soon as we possibly can, completing the \nbusiness before us. Thus, there is a very good possibility we will be \nable to finish our work that week.\n  A lot of people do want to be back at home, and rightfully so, for \nVeterans Day itself. That Monday before Veterans Day we will have to \nhave a productive day here if our goal is to finish that week.\n  I do want to keep flexible. Right now, I ask the understanding of my \ncolleagues because it very much depends on what happens over the next \nseveral days on the floor of the Senate. That is why we have to keep \nmoving ahead with appropriations and see what happens with the \nsupplemental in conference today, see the progress with the energy and \nmedicare conferences. For right now, we need flexibility, but I think \nbased on the comments the Democratic whip just made, as well as mine, \nif we have a chance of finishing that week, we can make that a very \nproductive week.\n  I know we will have a full hour before the vote. I just want to \ncomment very briefly on another issue for 3 or 4 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13326-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is widely expected that the Federal \nReserve will vote later today to keep the short-term interest rates at \nthe historically low level of 1 percent. This is good news for our \neconomy and very good news for American households. Low interest rates \nare allowing consumers to cut their monthly payments, their debt \npayments, and to invest their hard-earned money in the American dream, \nand that is the ownership of a home.\n  Indeed, sales of previously owned homes have hit their third highest \nlevel on record. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors \nreported that previously owned home sales rose 3.6 percent to a record \nannual rate of 6.69 million units in the month of September.\n  The realtor association's chief economist says the strong home sales \nare a result of ``the powerful fundamentals that are driving the \nhousing market--household growth, low interest rates, and an improving \neconomy.''\n  Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Commerce Department will release the data \non third-quarter economic growth. Most observers expect the agency will \nreport significant gains. Indeed, if the forecasters are right and the \neconomy does show a 6-percent gain, this would be the fastest upward \nswing since 1999.\n  Virtually every region of the country is benefiting from the \nrecovery, as are a host of industries. You read it daily. Sara Lee saw \nits earnings rise 25 percent. Black and Decker's earnings are up 36 \npercent. Xerox profits climbed by 18 percent. Also revealing are \n``first timer'' corporate profits. For example, Amazon.com reported a \nprofit for the first time in a nonholiday period. Lucent Technologies \nis posting profits for the first time in 3 years. Corning and AMR, the \nparent company of American Airlines, both broke a string of 10 quarter \nlosses.\n  All of this activity is helping to bolster the job market.\n  The labor market added 57,000 new jobs last month after seven \nstraight months of job cuts.\n  Wages have gone up, on average, at nearly all income levels. Higher \nwages combined with lower debt payments and mortgage refinancing \noptions are adding much needed juice to the economic engine.\n  So I am optimistic about the direction of the economy as it continues \non this road to recovery. Even the New York Times credits the Bush tax \ncut with higher consumer spending.\n  In the Senate, we will continue to champion policies that work--\npolicies that return tax dollars to the taxpayer yet encourage \nentrepreneurship and innovation, and that promote even higher levels of \njobs and growth.\n  I ask unanimous consent that 60 minutes remain in order prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13326-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \ngo into executive session to resume consideration of Executive Calendar \nNo. 405, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael O. Leavitt, of \nUtah, to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will now \nbe 60 minutes equally divided between the ranking members, or their \ndesignees, and there will be 20 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I will use most of the 20 \nminutes I have available, and perhaps all of it. But first, I thank the \nmajority leader and the minority leader for accommodating my desire to \nspeak on the nomination of Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt to be \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency prior to the vote \nto confirm him.\n  I was, unfortunately, not able to be here last night. So I appreciate \nthat I have a chance to make some remarks this morning.\n  A few weeks ago, I placed a ``hold'' on Governor Leavitt's nomination \nbecause of serious concerns many of his constituents have raised about \nhis record of enforcing our national environmental laws.\n  The President has the right to nominate people of his choosing to \nserve in his Cabinet. That, however, does not obligate anyone to vote \nfor each and every one of them.\n  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not impugning Governor \nLeavitt's character. He has been a public servant for many years and \nhas been credited with many significant accomplishments.\n  I will vote against confirming Governor Leavitt because I have not \nhad sufficient time to investigate the serious allegations that have \nbeen brought to my attention.\n  In fairness to Governor Leavitt, I asked the Congressional Research \nService (CRS) to review and assess the allegations. In a few more days, \nCRS staff would have been able to get back to me. Unfortunately, the \nmajority has seen fit to force a vote on this nominee today.\n  Governor Leavitt has waited 2 months. When former President Clinton \nnominated Katie McGinty to be chair of the Council on Environmental \nQuality, Republicans delayed her confirmation for more than a year.\n  Unfortunately, the majority did not honor the holds placed on this \nnominee, so the process of vetting him properly has been short-\ncircuited. Consequently, we are being asked to vote to confirm an \nindividual nominated to be the nation's highest-ranking environmental \nregulator--without the benefit of having some answers to some very \nimportant questions.\n  The current ``tide'' of environmental protection in America is at low \nebb under the current administration. I don't have enough time here to \nenumerate the hundreds of rollbacks and dilutions of our environmental \nlaws that President Bush and his administration have foisted on the \nAmerican people. Given such a state of affairs, I think it would be \nwise to determine if the nominee shares the same careless disregard for \nclean water, clean air, land conservation, and global warming as the \nPresident.\n  I had planned to ask Governor Leavitt many questions based on \ninformation provided to me by the southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and \nother Utah conservation and citizens' groups. They have cast serious \ndoubt on the Governor's commitment to enforcing our laws to protect \nhuman health and the environment.\n\n[[Page S13327]]\n\n  In 1998, Governor Leavitt was quoted as saying:\n\n       The national government should establish standards. Local \n     governments must figure out how best to meet them . . . \n     governments must focus on outcomes, not programs.\n\n  I agree with the Governor's sentiment that outcomes are what count. \nThe important questions are: Are our rivers getting cleaner? Is the air \nhealthier? Are toxic sites being decontaminated?\n\n  On that score, our environmental laws and programs have a proven \ntrack record. Even this White House has grudgingly acknowledged as \nmuch.\n  The Office of Management and Budget issued a report recently which \nconcludes that the health and social benefits of enforcing tough clean \nair regulations during the past decade have been 5 to 7 times greater \nin economic terms than the costs of complying with the regulations.\n  When compared to the 1950s and 1960s, before most of our major \nenvironmental laws were enacted, we have made outstanding progress. \nRivers like the Cuyahoga no longer catch on fire. Air pollution \ninversions no longer kill 20 people and sicken 4000 more in one fell \nswoop, like an incident in Donora, PA, in 1948.\n  These achievements have resulted from the careful implementation of \ncongressional laws. But those laws can only be effective if they are \nvoluntarily obeyed or enforced by EPA and the States. Regulations won't \ndo any good if they are not enforced.\n  We can be proud of the progress we have made over the past few \ndecades but there is so much more to be done to protect human health \nand the environment. We can't stop now, but that is what President Bush \nis trying to do, and I am concerned that is what Governor Leavitt will \ntry to do, too, if he is confirmed. Despite his commentary about \n``balance'' and ``stewardship,'' Governor Leavitt's record portrays a \ndramatically different approach to the environment. His record reveals \na disturbing tendency to place the short-sighted economic interests of \nregulated industries above protecting the long-term health of the \npublic.\n  I will highlight just a few of more than a dozen examples which \nillustrate this pattern. As I mentioned before, much of the information \nthat follows has come from citizens of Utah who visited my Senate \noffice here in Washington to complain about problems they saw with \nrespect to Governor Leavitt's willingness to protect their environment. \nI might add that I know the State very well. I spend a lot of time in \nUtah. I love it. I love the terrain. I love the Wasatch Mountains all \nof that of which Utah residents are so proud.\n  Governor Leavitt has strongly supported something called the ``Legacy \nHighway'' project. This highway was set to cut through highly \nsignificant wetlands next to the Great Salt Lake that provide the \nbreeding ground for 500 American Bald Eagles.\n  The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last fall that the \nEnvironmental Impact Statement the Governor's staff prepared was \ninvalid because it ignored obvious harmful impacts. To top that, the \nalternative they chose would have violated the Clean Water Act.\n  In another instance, the Governor made a secret deal to remove 2.6 \nmillion acres from possible designation as ``wilderness''.\n  Utah's Sierra Club issued a statement that said:\n\n       Governor Mike Leavitt's environmental track record, which \n     includes working behind closed doors with Interior Secretary \n     Gale Norton to open up Utah's wildlands to polluting \n     industries, suggests that he will be a good fit for the Bush \n     administration, but a disappointing choice for Americans \n     concerned with environmental protection. . . .\n\n  Earlier this year, EPA released a report on the States' record of \nenforcing the Clean Water Act. Utah received one of the lowest scores \nfor enforcement.\n  Governor Leavitt's ``hands-off'' approach is a recurring theme. He \nhas argued in favor of downsizing and even dismantling agencies like \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. It is not hard to imagine the \ndemoralizing impact it could have on EPA staff if the next \nAdministrator is on record saying that EPA should be dismantled. This \nviewpoint reveals the importance Governor Leavitt places on protecting \nour air, water, and land.\n  Do we really want to return to the days before the EPA was \nestablished, when rivers caught on fire and people literally keeled \nover from air pollution? I, for one, do not relish the results of \nconfirming a ``rollback'' Governor as the guardian of our Nation's \nenvironment under a ``rollback'' administration!\n  Another widely reported matter of concern has to do with a fish \nhatchery the Governor and his family have owned. The family was served \nwith 33 indictments for illegal fish transfers that helped to spread a \nsevere fish disease known as ``whirling disease.'' This is a serious \nmatter, but pales in comparison to the actions taken by Mr. Leavitt \nonce he became Governor. According to the Salt Lake Tribune and other \nUtah papers, after being elected Governor, Mr. Leavitt had officials in \nhis administration transfer, demote, or fire as many as 70 State \nemployees who had worked on the fish hatchery indictments.\n  This whole affair definitely has a nasty smell, and it is not just \ndue to the dead fish!\n  Utah's Kennecott copper mine is reportedly the world's largest open-\npit mine. The ore extracted from this mine has brought enormous wealth \nto its owners, but has been paid for by the public in the form of \nextensive environmental damage. Acid mine drainage and the careless \ndumping of waste rock have contaminated surface waters and groundwater \non an unprecedented scale. For at least 10 miles along the Oquirrhs \nmountain face, clean water is all but impossible to find by the local \nwildlife. Cyanide leach pads, acid mine drainage, and other forms of \ndangerous contamination have spread across 20,000 acres of land. \nMetallic contamination has reached Utah's Great Salt Lake and Jordan \nRiver.\n  Mining has always come with a high environmental price tag, and I \nwill grant that some improvements have been made at Kennecott in \nreducing its toxic air emissions. But what I find especially noteworthy \nis that for nearly 20 years conservation and citizens' groups have \nclamored for a clean-up plan for Kennecott. Yet conveniently, this \nlong-sought-after clean-up plan didn't make any headway until this \nyear, right after the Governor's August 11 nomination to become EPA's \nAdministrator. What a coincidence of timing. He has been Governor for \nmany years now. What accounts for this ``Road to Damascus'' conversion? \nIs it political expediency?\n  Utah's U.S. Magnesium Corporation also illustrates Governor Leavitt's \nenvironmental ``credentials'' for the job as EPA Administrator. \nMagCorp, as it is called, is listed No. 1 on EPA's list of toxic \npolluters. Some years, it falls to No. 2. At a minimum, it is one of \nthe nation's worst toxic polluters.\n  According to EPA's Toxic release Inventory, MagCorp accounted for \nmore than 90 percent of total chlorine releases in the United States \nfrom 1998 to 2000. Since 2000, MagCorp's chlorine emissions have \ndecreased and it now accounts for only 80 percent of the Nation's \nchlorine releases. But this slight decrease has not resulted from any \nenforcement action taken by Governor Leavitt's administration. Rather, \nthe reductions are attributable to actions taken by the EPA.\n  My question is, Why did the EPA have to step in to enforce the law? \nTests of the company's waste-water ditches have revealed dioxin \ncontamination at 170 parts per billion. That is 170 times higher than \nEPA's ``action level'' for clean-up. EPA eventually had to step in \nwhere the State had failed to do so. That strikes me as a serious lapse \nin enforcement responsibilities.\n\n  Remember that Governor Leavitt has said, ``The national government \nshould establish standards. Local governments must figure out how best \nto meet them.'' But in case after case of significant environmental \ndamage, we find that the Governor appears to believe that ``he who \nenforces least enforces best.'' What good are environmental health \nstandards, if they are being ignored, year after year? Those standards \nexist for sound scientific reasons and are developed only after years \nof extensive research and independent peer review.\n  The plain fact is this: toxic pollution is dangerous to our health, \nespecially to the health of our children and grandchildren. We may not \nimmediately see the lowered I.Q. scores, cancer ``clusters,'' or \nautoimmune diseases, but make no mistake, they are\n\n[[Page S13328]]\n\namong the tragic results when polluters are allowed to flaunt with the \nlaw with impunity. Failure to enforce our environmental laws portrays \neither a sad ignorance of the health costs or, even worse, a knowing \ndisregard for them. In recent years, scientific analysis of the highest \ncaliber has shown that, if anything, our environmental health standards \nmay be too lax.\n  We have learned, for instance, that children under 2 are 10 times \nmore likely to develop cancer when exposed to the same toxic \nconcentration as adults. An article that appeared in the New England \nJournal of Medicine last April reported that the concentration of lead \nin the blood which can lower a child's I.Q. is lower than previously \nbelieved. In the latest study published in the New England Journal of \nMedicine, researchers report that at blood-lead levels allowed under \nthe current health standard, children's I.Q. scores declined by an \naverage of 7.4 points.\n  We will not be well served by an EPA Administrator who continues, or \neven accelerates, the pace at which President Bush is dismantling our \nfundamental environmental protections. The last person we need as \nAdministrator is someone whose philosophy on key environmental issues \nis less regulation, no matter what the cost to public health and the \nenvironment.\n  I would add that it is not just the Sierra Club and the Southern Utah \nWilderness Association who have voiced opposition to this nomination. \nRocky Anderson, Mayor of Salt Lake City, who opposed the Governor's \n``Legacy Highway'' project, said:\n\n       On environmental issues governor Leavitt and I differ \n     greatly. He's had some great opportunities to provide real \n     leadership, but I think he has been unwilling to spend the \n     political capital to make the important changes. We have \n     serious air quality issues that are simply going to get worse \n     without strong leadership.\n\n  The last 3 years have been the ``darkest hour'' of our Nation's \ncommitment to environmental protection since EPA was created. This \nWhite House has repeatedly foisted its penchant for secrecy and cover-\nup on the Environmental Protection Agency. It held back the Children's \nEnvironmental Health Report for 9 months. It has hidden and \nmisrepresented the impacts of its New Source Review rule. And for the \nfirst time ever, White House officials insisted that the global warming \nchapter be deleted from EPA's Air Quality Trends Report. You do not \nhave to be an atmospheric scientist or professor to know what is \nhappening because of global warming. We see the trend all over, and we \nsee the consequences of that trend. But the administration will have \nnone of that.\n  Earlier this year, the administration tried to prevent the release of \na report on EPA's abysmal enforcement record. I am thankful the report \nwas leaked to the press. Now we have some of the facts regarding EPA's \nenforcement record under President Bush:\n  Enforcement actions against some of the worst environmental violators \nhave been cut by at least 45 percent;\n  Half of the facilities that violate their toxic limits do so by 100 \npercent;\n  13 percent violate their limits by a staggering 1,000 percent; and\n  80 percent of Clean Water Act violators never receive a formal \nenforcement action.\n  This is a total disregard for the law. I think it's time to end the \ndisregard, the secrecy, the obfuscation, and the wholesale abdication \nof responsibility for protecting two of the Nation's most precious \nresources: human health and our environment.\n  My fear is that this abdication won't end with the nominee the Senate \nis poised to confirm; it will get worse. Therefore, I must vote ``No.'' \nAnd I hope many others will vote no to show that we are opposed to this \ndegradation of our environment and to this willful ignorance of the \ncosts that degradation will impose on our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I had a hard time figuring out whom the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey was talking about.\n  Let me just outline how this side is going to use its 30 minutes. I \nhave a few comments to make, and I may respond to some of the things \nthe Senator said about Governor Leavitt. I understand Senator Bond \nwants to come down and have about 5 minutes.\n  I ask if Senator Jeffords would mind if Senator Hatch could have our \nlast 10 minutes because he was not able to spend as much time in the \nChamber yesterday in order to respond to anything else that has been \nsaid about Governor Leavitt.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. No objection.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you very much. I appreciate the cooperation we have \nhad.\n  First of all, as far as the comments the Senator from New Jersey made \nabout Governor Leavitt are concerned, talking about the Legacy Parkway, \nlet me just mention to him that the construction on the highway began \nonly after Utah had the legal authorization to do so from the various \nStates and the Federal agencies. The 2,000 acres of wetlands would be \nprotected as a nature preserve.\n  But I think the most significant point, since he is criticizing the \nadministration along with Governor Leavitt, is that all required \nFederal approvals for the Legacy Parkway project were issued by the \nClinton administration after 6 years of study, public comment, and \nlegal review. That was the Clinton administration.\n  Secondly, on the water quality report, first of all, the report they \nare quoting is from PIRG, which is another environmental extremist \ngroup. It is not part of the Federal Government. The truth is, the PIRG \nreport relied on incomplete data to reach the findings for Utah. When \nthe Utah data was corrected, Utah showed one of the lowest Clean Water \nAct noncompliance rates in the country.\n  For example, between January of 2000 and March of 2001, Utah's \nnoncompliance rate placed Utah among the top 10 States with the lowest \nrates of noncompliance. Right now, 73 percent of the streams in Utah \nmeet all Federal and State requirements. That is a 24-percent \nimprovement over the time since Governor Leavitt took office. It is one \nof his greatest accomplishments, and here he is being criticized for \nit.\n  I have to go back and reread--I wish there were more time to do it. I \ncertainly appreciate Senator Jeffords' comments when he said--and this \nis a quote--\n\n       First of all, it has nothing to do with the qualifications \n     of Mr. Leavitt. I will vote for him and I am hopeful that at \n     some point I will be able to do so. I look forward to that. I \n     consider him a friend. I have worked with him in the past on \n     [various matters].\n\n  Gov. Bill Richardson, a Governor with Governor Leavitt, said:\n\n       He has worked effectively with other Governors regardless \n     of party. Obviously the same willingness and ability to work \n     collaboratively with other elected and appointed \n     environmental officials is crucial to the effectiveness of \n     any EPA Administrator. Mike Leavitt is a consensus builder \n     and can bring people together.\n\n  That is Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, one of his biggest fans.\n  We have talked over and over about the accomplishments of Governor \nLeavitt. He was the chairman of the National Governors Association. He \nis chairman of the Republican Governors Association, chairman of the \nWestern Governors Association. Under his leadership, the visibility in \nthe West has improved. There have been accolades all over the country \non the job he has done as the cochairman of the Western Regional Air \nPartnership cleaning up the air.\n  During his 11-year term, we already mentioned 73 percent of Utah \nstreams currently meet all water quality standards compared to 59 \npercent 10 years ago. And it has all happened since Governor Leavitt \ntook office.\n  I do not understand at this late hour that finally someone is coming \nand criticizing him. I have been critical of the debate so far because \nthey have not really talked about Governor Leavitt, except in praising \nhim, but they have talked about misrepresenting the Bush \nadministration's environmental progress.\n  Now, I think something has to be said that, prior to his markup, \ncommittee Democrats submitted 400 questions to Governor Leavitt. And if \nyou compare that to other administrations, when Carol Browner was up in \n1993--remember that--she had only 67 questions that came from \nRepublicans--not 400; 67. And, of course, for William Reilly there were \njust a handful of questions at that time.\n  Also, going back to the number of days it took between the nomination\n\n[[Page S13329]]\n\nand actually becoming the Administrator, for William Reilly it was just \n13 days; for Carol Browner, just 11 days; and for Governor Whitman, it \nwas 13 days. Now, this has taken 55 days. And when Senator Lautenberg, \na few minutes ago, said he has not had time to look at it, my gosh, if \nhe did not need any more than 10 or 13 days for the others, what is \nwrong with having 55 days? It is certainly more than enough time.\n  We desperately need to have this man in this office. For weeks we \nhave heard nothing about Mike Leavitt and everything about President \nBush, and yet I would like to suggest to you that President Bush's \nrecord and accomplishments are second to none.\n  Let me quote Greg Easterbrook from an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times. \nHe is the senior editor of the very liberal New Republic. He doesn't \nsay many good things about Republicans. He is a Democrat. He is very \nsympathetic to their causes. He says most of the charges made against \nthe White House are ``baloney,'' made for ``purposes of partisan \npolitical bashing and fund-raising.'' He also contends that \n``environmental lobbies raise money better in an atmosphere of panic \nand so they are exaggerating the case against Bush.'' In his view, \nPresident Bush's new rules for diesel engines and diesel fuel ``should \nlead to the biggest pollution reduction since the 1991 Clean Air Act \namendment.''\n  Last night I went over all of the accomplishments of the Bush \nadministration. The fact that the Clear Skies legislation is coming up \nand is going to be the largest mandated reduction in pollutants of any \nPresident in history, a 70-percent reduction in sulfur dioxide and \nnitrogen oxide and mercury. On cleaner fuels and engines, there is the \ndiesel rule. I am prepared to talk about these.\n  At this point I yield to the minority side for any comments they want \nto make because, quite frankly, I want to be in a position to respond. \nI appreciate Senator Jeffords allowing the senior Senator from Utah to \nhave the last 10 minutes of our time. We will wait for other Members to \narrive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I yield the 7 minutes remaining from \nthe time of the Senator from New Jersey to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I appreciate the time. As I understand \nit, I am yielded how many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise as a proud member of the \nEnvironmental Committee and the chair of the Democratic environmental \nteam. I will be voting no on the Leavitt nomination. The reason is, \nwhile I am not pinning all the terrible decisions of this \nadministration regarding the environment on Mr. Leavitt--clearly, he \nwas not there for those--I was very distressed that the questions I \nasked him were simply papered over or, in some cases--six cases--there \nwas no answer at all. I will explain in a moment.\n  I am going to divert for a sentence or two to again express my \nconcern about the fires burning out of control in my State. I send my \nprayers to the people of my State and thank the President for declaring \nit a disaster area. This was absolutely necessary because we need help \nfrom all over the country. These fires are far from out, and the winds \nare unpredictable.\n  Our 7,000 firefighters, the heroes of the day again, are out of \nbreath and need relief. We cannot stand back and say the winds will \ndictate what happens. We have to save lives and homes. I will be going \nto the State as soon as I can, when it is appropriate, and offer all \nthe help we can.\n  My colleagues have been so kind and so good in asking questions. \nRight now we have lost 14 people, 1,518 homes; 501,000 acres are \nburning, four times the size of Chicago. It is a travesty.\n  Getting back to the issue at hand, I do not think it is terribly \ncomforting to the American people to hear that the questions I asked \nwere not answered--many of them--because they know we have had many \nrollbacks. As Senator Lautenberg so eloquently said, I have a little \nscroll I could bring to the Chamber, if I were allowed--I think the \nrules do not allow for that--and I could let out the scroll all the way \npast where the Presiding Officer is sitting. It would list, in fairly \nlarge type, 300 environmental rollbacks.\n  I was stunned to hear a Senator on the radio today say that this \nadministration has the greatest environmental record of any President. \nI can't even respond to that except with the truth. The truth is, we \nhave documented 300 rollbacks.\n  One of my leaders on this issue, in addition to Senator Lautenberg, \nis Senator Jeffords. He has been fighting for clean air harder and \nlonger and with more focus than anyone I know. He could tell you \nchapter and verse why we are losing the battle to clean up our air. \nEvery time the administration calls something ``Clear Skies, beautiful \nforests,'' or ``lovely day,'' it is just the opposite when one cuts \nthrough it. It is essentially special interest legislation that is \nrolling back the progress we have made.\n  If you go to any school in this country and ask the children, do you \nhave asthma, does someone in your family have asthma, do any of your \nfriends, literally almost half the classroom will raise their hands \nhigh. This is not the way it used to be.\n  This is the time when we need strong environmental leadership. \nGovernor Leavitt is one of the nicest people I have ever met. We had a \ncouple of great meetings. But he essentially rolled over my questions, \nin many cases not even answering them at all, just as if I hadn't asked \nanything.\n  Let me tell you about what happened this summer. I call this past \nsummer ``toxic summer.'' Senator Jeffords and I held a press \nconference. Senator Lautenberg was there. We documented what has \nhappened just this summer. Let me give you a quick reason why we need a \nreal environmental leader at the EPA.\n\n  ``Toxic-site cleanups slowing, report says,'' Sacramento Bee.\n\n       Spending on the cleanup of hazardous waste sites is slowing \n     under the Bush administration, and that could delay the \n     cleanup of three dozen sites in California, including several \n     around Sacramento. . . .\n       U.S. is Seeking to Limit States' Influence on Offshore \n     Decisions; California Officials Denounce the Proposed \n     Revisions as an Effort to Bypass Court Rulings. . . .\n\n  Whatever happened to States' rights? I thought this administration \nliked to help States. They are rolling over the States, if the States \nwant to do more cleanup, if the States want to protect their coasts.\n\n       EPA's 9/11 Air Ratings Distorted. . . .\n\n  We all know Senator Clinton did a masterful job of holding up this \nnomination until she got some promises from the administration that she \ncould see exactly what went on behind the scenes and how ``in the days \nafter the terrorist attack, White House officials persuaded the EPA to \nminimize its assessment of the dangers posed by airborne dust and \ndebris from the skyscrapers' collapse.'' Withholding information is \nsick. There is something terribly wrong with this administration.\n\n       Bush Eases Clean Air Act for Industries.\n       In one of the broadest changes to air-pollution regulations \n     since the Clean Air Act was first approved in 1970, the Bush \n     administration . . . eased smog rules affecting more than 500 \n     older power plants and some 20,000 aging factories. . . .\n\n  This is the issue Senator Jeffords has championed.\n  This is another one from the Los Angeles Times, just this summer. \nThis isn't all the 300. This is just this summer.\n\n       EPA Won't Regulate ``Greenhouse Gases''; Environmental \n     Groups' Bid for the Agency to Cut New-Vehicle Emissions is \n     Denied. California May Sue, Saying the Decision Threatens \n     State Efforts.\n\n  Later on this week we will vote on the McCain-Lieberman bill. The \nadministration opposes it.\n  I ask if I may have 2 more minutes from my friend.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from California 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The last chart is frightening.\n\n       EPA Eases Rules on PCB-Tainted Properties.\n\n  These are the most polluted, dangerous properties. People were not \nallowed to sell those properties or transfer those properties until \nthey had a plan that EPA signed off on and approved.\n  Madam President, we need an EPA Administrator with guts and strength \nand the ability to stand up and say he is going to fight for the \nenvironment. The fact that he did not answer a number of my questions \ntells me that I am\n\n[[Page S13330]]\n\nafraid that, in the room when they are debating these issues, Mike \nLeavitt will be a full team player with the Bush administration and not \na team player for the health of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what I want the American people to \nunderstand is that this administration's environmental policies are \nawful, starting with arsenic, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \nclean air, and what they have not done with Superfund. We can go \nthrough a litany of bad decisions. We are going to have a bipartisan \nbill brought up this week dealing with global warming. The most glaring \nissue is this administration doesn't believe global warming is taking \nplace.\n  So when Mike Leavitt called me and said he had been asked by the \nPresident to be the EPA Administrator, I said: Mike, why would you want \nthis job, with what this administration has done on the environment?\n  I said: I like you and I will do everything I can to help you. But \nyou should understand that this administration's environmental policy \nis the worst this country has ever had.\n  So I have done what I could to help Mike Leavitt get through this \nprocess.\n  The main thing I wanted to say and why I have such warm feelings \nabout Mike Leavitt goes back many years ago. I was a sophomore in \ncollege. I went there on an athletic scholarship at a junior college in \nsouthern Utah called the College of Southern Utah. My wife and I \ndecided we were going to get married between my sophomore and junior \nyears, and that we did. Prior to doing that, I went to an insurance \nagent in Cedar City, UT, by the name of Dixie Leavitt. I didn't know \nwho he was.\n  I said: Mr. Leavitt, the reason I want to buy a health insurance \npolicy is because my wife may get pregnant and we don't have the money \nto pay the hospital bill. I want to make sure the insurance policy \ncovers pregnancy.\n  So we went away to another school, several hundred miles away, to \nUtah State University. A couple years later, she became pregnant. Well, \nwe were going through the process of contacting doctors, and she has \nthe baby and the insurance policy does not cover maternity. So I call \nDixie Leavitt long distance, which I could not afford, to Cedar City, \nUT.\n  I said: Mr. Leavitt, I don't know if you remember, but I bought an \ninsurance policy from you. The only reason I bought it was for \nmaternity, and it doesn't cover that.\n  Without him saying he didn't remember or anything else, he said: Send \nme the bills. He personally paid those bills.\n  Now, I have to think some of that goodness rubbed off on his son, \nMichael Leavitt. I think the story about Dixie Leavitt, whom I have \nnever talked to since I talked to him on the telephone many decades \nago, speaks volumes about the kind of man that Mike Leavitt must be \nbecause of his father.\n  I am sorry that Governor Leavitt has accepted this job. I am going to \ndo everything I can, and I hope it works out. Governor Whitman was a \ntotal disappointment to me. She had a much stronger environmental \nrecord than does Mike Leavitt when she was Governor of New Jersey.\n  With all the bad things that this administration has done on the \nenvironment, it is important to note that at least in this instance \nthey chose a man who has character. I hope that character will come \nthrough in the environmental policy of this country and override the \nbad policies of this administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 22 minutes on the majority side and \n5 minutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me take a minute or two, and then I will yield to \nSenator Bond. First of all, the Senator from California was talking \nabout the dismal record in Superfund of this administration, and the \nfact that not enough money has been spent. I want to suggest that there \nis no correlation between the money raised when they had the tax and \nthe money spent on Superfund cleanups.\n  In 1996, during the Clinton administration, the tax fund was at its \nhighest level. Yet money spent by the Clinton administration for \ncleanup was near a 10-year low.\n  To contrast that, in President Bush's 2004 budget, the money for \nactual cleanup is near a 10-year high, while the fund is at a low \npoint. In fact, the 2004 request of the President is $1.38 billion, \nwhich is higher than 7 of the 8 years of the Clinton administration. So \nI don't think there is anything to that particular argument.\n  I also remind the Senator of this: When she talked about people \npraising the President for his environmental record, many of these \npeople praising the President are not Republicans, they are not \npundits. These are Democrats and liberals, who are giving him credit, \nsuch as Gregg Easterbrook, senior editor of the liberal New Republic \nmagazine, as I have mentioned.\n  At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nbehalf of Governor Leavitt. I think the President has made an excellent \nchoice in nominating this Governor, who has a great record. I think the \nenvironment and the Environmental Protection Agency will be well served \nby his nomination. At a time when there are many pressing issues facing \nus in the environmental area, it is important that we have a good \nleader.\n  Governor Leavitt is a good leader. He is a Governor, as I was \nformerly, and I know that he has brought leadership and management \nskills and a State perspective. He was very successful in Utah, and he \nwill bring success, as the Nation's longest serving Governor, to the \nEPA. I believe he stands for environmental principles that we \ndesperately need: collaboration, not polarization; national standards \nand neighborhood solutions; rewarding results, not programs; science \nfor facts, process for priorities; markets before mandates. All of \nthese things are necessary to move forward in improving our \nenvironment.\n  Governor Leavitt has a record of environmental achievement to match \nhis environmental vision. As my colleagues from Utah will describe \nshortly, because of him the air in Utah and the West is cleaner and \nclearer. Visibility over the Grand Canyon has improved because of the \nGovernor's role with the Western Regional Air Partnership. I know our \nfriends from Utah are proud that Utah has among the Nation's cleanest \nwatersheds. That has improved dramatically during the Leavitt \nadministration. Utah's most environmentally sensitive land is better \nprotected because of Governor Leavitt's service.\n  Unfortunately, Governor Leavitt is entering a job in a city where \npolitical opponents try to use the environment to make political gains. \nWe heard charges a few minutes ago that he had not answered all the \nquestions. The interesting part is that we went back and looked at \nsimilar questions asked of previous nominees, particularly \nAdministrator Brown in the last administration. She was not able to \nanswer those questions dealing with the internal operations of the EPA \neither. At the time, we understood, and the Republicans confirmed her.\n  I am delighted that we are moving forward to confirm Governor Leavitt \nbecause he cannot be expected to know everything going on inside the \nEPA. As far as the record of this administration under President Bush, \nenvironmental and health benefits from drastically reduced levels of \nNOX and SOX and mercury pollution in the \nPresident's Clear Skies proposal are being held hostage by those who \nwant to use global warming as a political issue against the President.\n  Environmental benefits, improved energy security, and more efficient \nand reliable electricity protection in New Source Review improvements \nare being attacked and blocked by the President's political opponents.\n  Even my own modest incremental suggestions for improved environmental \ncollaboration in the transportation bill were leaked to the press, \nmischaracterized by the very environmental stakeholders, some of whom \nwe worked with to formulate those improvements.\n\n[[Page S13331]]\n\n  Fortunately, President Bush is maintaining a strong commitment to the \nenvironment and the Environmental Protection Agency. In the face of \nfunding a war on terrorism, growing deficits, and, yes, even tax cuts, \nPresident Bush has requested more money for EPA. President Bush's $7.6 \nbillion request for the EPA is $300 million more than President Clinton \nrequested for the EPA in his last budget. President Bush's $431 million \nrequest for EPA enforcement is the largest request for Federal \nenvironmental enforcement funds in our Nation's history. I just hope \nthat my colleague, Senator Mikulski, and I have enough money in the \nbudget of VA-HUD to meet those goals. It is questionable at this point. \nBut we certainly want to achieve the President's funding.\n  Just last week in the Environment and Public Works Committee, we were \nable to pick up the broken transportation pieces and fashion a \nbipartisan agreement on environmental provisions relating to NEPA and \nthe Clean Air Act. I think this spirit of cooperation can serve this \nbody and our Nation's highway needs well, and maybe we can even flow \nthat cooperation into the Leavitt nomination.\n  I urge my colleagues to follow this new bipartisanship and move \nforward and support the nomination of Governor Leavitt without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise to support the nomination of \nGovernor Leavitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. I have worked with him in the past on education issues and \nfound him to be insightful and, most importantly, cooperative. That is \nwhat I seek from this administration--cooperation. My support for \nGovernor Leavitt brings with it the renewed call for cooperation from \nthis administration on outstanding information requests that I have on \nimportant environmental issues impacting the health of our citizens and \nour environment. I will continue to pursue these requests with Governor \nLeavitt when he becomes Administrator of the EPA.\n  This vote should not be seen as an endorsement of the Bush \nadministration's environmental policy but a vote in support of a fine \nand honorable man who has an extremely difficult job ahead. I look \nforward to working with him to improve the environmental protection \nthat our country deserves.\n  Madam President, it has surprised me to hear some Senators use the \nword obstruction in the context of Governor Leavitt's nomination to be \nthe new Administrator of the EPA. It was a surprise because that is \nexactly what this administration has been doing--obstructing Congress \nand our legitimate requests for information. Much of the obstruction \nhas been related to the unfortunate and probably illegal activities of \nthe administration on New Source Review and on other important air \nquality matters such as multi-pollutant legislation.\n  As Senators may know, the General Accounting Office released a report \nlast week which looked into the effect that the administration's \nproposed NSR changes would have on pending enforcement actions. That \nreport strongly suggests that administration political appointees were \nwell aware that the proposed changes would negatively affect swift and \nenvironmentally protective resolution of those enforcement cases. Yet \nthey proceeded with the changes anyway.\n  In the course of the GAO investigation, GAO conducted some very \ninteresting interviews that bear on Congress's right of access to \nagency information. In GAO's February 12, 2003, interview with Bob \nFabricant, then-EPA general counsel, the interview notes say, ``Mr. \nFabricant mentioned that they were in the process of putting together a \nconfidentially agreement [to provide access to sensitive NSR documents] \nwith the SEPW staff last year but they never completed the agreement.'' \nWhen asked by GAO why the agreement was not completed, ``. . . Mr. \nFabricant and Mr. Valeri laughed and responded that the agreement was \nnot completed because of the results of the mid-term elections.'' The \nGAO interview asked, ``. . . why the results of the election should \naffect GAO and Congress's ability to conduct oversight. Mr. Fabricant \ndid not respond directly to this question but did say that his \nunderstanding is that GAO's access to agency documents is governed by \nthe position of the Congressional requestor.''\n  This new assertion by the agency will come as a very large surprise \nto Senators on both sides of the aisles, both ranking and chair, \nparticularly for those whose information requests were made while they \nwere chairmen, as I was, and are still unsatisfied. It appears that the \nAgency and the administration have adopted a posture, which is not \ndefensible by any statute or precedent, that they will just wait for \nHouse of Congress to change parties and ignore requests for information \nthat is their duty and responsibility to provide in a timely fashion. I \nwould hope that my colleagues would see the peril in any administration \nimplementing such a cavalier attitude toward the Nation's elected \nrepresentatives.\n  The administration has shown an active disrespect for the legislative \nbranch of government which is most disturbing. This pattern is becoming \nabundantly clear, whether it is vital environmental and public health \ninformation or important intelligence and national security data. This \nis not a healthy situation for reasoned public policy debates or a \nwell-functioning democracy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first let me say to my friend from \nVermont that is an excellent statement, and I share his view on the \nqualifications of our nominee. I look forward to his becoming a \nhistoric Administrator of the EPA.\n  I would like to yield myself 5\\1/2\\ minutes so that I can ensure the \nsenior Senator from Utah has the final 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me just mention a few things. It seems as if we \nreally do not need to talk about Governor Leavitt. I agree with the \npraises that many people have made of him. I believe that he is \nprobably the best, most qualified nominee we have ever had, but let me \ntake this time to mention some other things.\n  I already talked about the record, about the Clear Skies legislation \nmandating a 70-percent reduction in sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, \nand mercury. No President in history has ever mandated that. I look \nforward to getting to the Clear Skies legislation.\n  As to cleaner fuels and engines, the diesel rule has been applauded \nall around for the amount of reduction it will bring. The rule \nrequiring new heavy-duty trucks and buses to run cleaner will cut \nharmful pollutants by 95 percent. That is a huge amount.\n  Also, in terms of enforcement, I talked about these in more detail \nlast night, but the President has done more in terms of settlements. \nJust in this short period of time he has been President we have had \nsettlements with Virginia Electric Power, and they are going to spend \n$1.2 billion to reduce pollutants. The Archer Daniel Midland settlement \nhas taken place under this administration. It is going to total $335 \nmillion that will go toward cleaning up the environment; Alcoa, $2.5 \nmillion to fund environmental projects; Lion Oil Company will spend \n$2.5 million to install state-of-the-art pollution control technologies \nthroughout its refinery; and the settlement with Toyota, the same \nthing, $34 million. These are all settlements in the Bush \nadministration. They were not settled during the Clinton \nadministration. So he has that record, and it is a record that is \nbetter than any previous administration.\n  In terms of his budget proposal, I think the Senator from Missouri \ncovered that very well. In cleaner water, we have legislation right now \nin the committee that I chair, and with the cooperation of Senator \nJeffords, we have now passed out a nuclear security bill, waste water \nsecurity bill, and a chemical security bill. Hopefully, they will be \ntaken up and passed before long.\n  As far as this administration, on brownfields, nobody has been able \nto hold a candle to what President Bush and his administration have \ndone in brownfields. I am very sensitive to this because I had an \namendment on the brownfields bill that would include petroleum sites, \nsome 200,000 petroleum sites, and that has been used as an example for \nthe greatest single area of accomplishment, in terms of cleaning up \nthese sites. We are talking about\n\n[[Page S13332]]\n\nbrownfields as opposed to Superfund sites. The legislation will \nsignificantly increase the pace of brownfields cleanups. President \nBush's 2004 budget proposal provides $210 million, more than twice the \nlevel of funding prior to the passage of this legislation. So I would \njust say that I join with the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Trust \nfor Public Land in applauding the President for the accomplishments he \nhas made in brownfields, certainly much better than any other \nadministration.\n  Then lastly, I would just say that the President has actually done \nnot just good enforcement but smart enforcement. Over the last two \nfiscal years, the EPA and the Department of Justice enforcement has \nobtained $8 billion in environmental remediation. This is the best \nconsecutive 2 years of enforcement of any prior administration on \nrecord.\n  I repeat that. In his enforcement, this is the best consecutive 2 \nyears of enforcement of any prior administration on record--the Clinton \nadministration and the previous Bush administration. In fiscal year \n2002 the EPA compliance assistance centers provided environmental \ntechnical assistance to more than 673,000 businesses and individuals to \nhelp them comply with environmental laws. I think that is consistent \nwith the fundamental belief of this President that he does not want to \njust go out and punish people. He does not want to use that for the \nmark or the indicator as to what kind of jobs have been done. He wants \nto help people, help people get sites cleaned up.\n  Comments have been made about the Superfund by the previous speakers. \nI would only say that the amount of money that has been appropriated \nfor cleanup of Superfund sites is higher than any other administration \nthat this President actually has for the 2004 budget. I appreciate \nthat.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the nomination of \nGovernor Michael Leavitt to be Administrator of the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, and to speak more generally on my concerns regarding \nthe impact of EPA policies on environmental issues in California.\n  I have many concerns about the Bush administration's commitment to \nadvancing strong environmental policy. However, because I believe that \nit is important for a President to be able to select his own Cabinet, I \ndo not oppose the President's nomination of Governor Leavitt to be \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is only in \nexceptional cases that I believe the Senate in its role of advice and \nconsent should reject a nominee.\n  Governor Leavitt will be assuming leadership of the EPA at a critical \ntime. The Agency stands at a crossroads in its mission. I strongly \nbelieve that the administration's environmental policies thus far have \nmoved the EPA in the wrong direction. It will require strong leadership \nfrom Governor Leavitt to steer EPA back onto a progressive course.\n  Many environmental issues must be addressed in the coming 2 years on \nboth a national and State level. I look forward to working with \nGovernor Leavitt if confirmed as Administrator of the EPA, and I am \ncertain that together we will be able to find innovative and efficient \nsolutions to the environmental problems confronting California.\n  I would like to discuss a few of the issues.\n  First, I would like to begin by asking Governor Leavitt to take a \ndefinitive stance in the battle against climate change. There is strong \nevidence that most of the global warming that has occurred during the \npast 50 years is attributable to human activities.\n  Shamefully, the White House under the Bush administration has chosen \nto disregard this worldwide problem by thwarting efforts to regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  And given the overwhelming evidence of U.S. culpability regarding \ngreenhouse gas emissions, EPA needs to take a strong stance regarding \nthe enactment of stringent rules and regulations.\n  The United States must catch up to the rest of the modern world in \nthe battle against climate change.\n  Voluntary programs are not sufficient. They barely work--and \ncertainly not to the extent necessary to reduce emissions.\n  We must work to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions as opposed to \nmerely reducing emissions intensity in the manner proposed by the White \nHouse.\n  Even if we achieve the administration's goals of reducing emissions \nintensity by 18 percent, the actual amount of emissions will still \nlikely increase.\n  The recent revisions to the Clean Air Act's New Source Review rules \nare one example of the Bush administration's disregard for air quality \ncontrol. These revisions allow aging and inefficient power plants whose \npermits are up for renewal to continue operating in the exact same \nmanner--environmentally speaking--that they did decades ago.\n  For example, a coal power plant can conduct major repairs and parts \nreplacement, without updating the pollution control equipment.\n  It has been years since the problem associated with clean air and \npowerplants became apparent to everyone, and yet the current \nadministration has pushed through regulations that will let the \npollution continue unabated.\n  I look forward to the upcoming Senate debate and vote on the McCain-\nLieberman climate change bill this week. In anticipation of this vote, \nI encourage the Agency to take a firm stance on climate change.\n  I want to turn now to address a very important issue for California \nvoters: the joint State-Federal CALFED program designed to improve \nCalifornia's water supply, fishery resources and water quality.\n  I have been extremely disappointed to date at EPA's lack of \ninvolvement in CALFED. EPA can and should take a role in CALFED's water \nquality program.\n  I urge the next Administrator of EPA to work closely with California \non water quality. Here are some important steps EPA could take:\n  The CALFED plan proposes to take action on wastewater treatment, \nbromide reduction at municipal water intakes and new efforts to stem \ncontaminants from abandoned mines.\n  These actions will be spliced with source water protection, new \nhealth effects research on Delta water, as well as comprehensive \nmonitoring and assessment of Delta drinking water quality.\n  Finally, to assure progress, public and peer review processes will \nmonitor compliance with drinking water standards, and measure \nperformance against consumer water rates.\n  If EPA partners with California on this program, the benefits could \ninclude better tasting water at lower costs, a longer life for \nCalifornians' plumbing and consumer appliances, and more reliability \nfrom recycling and groundwater storage programs.\n  A decade ago, there were efforts to deregulate a portion of the \nradioactive waste stream and allow these wastes to be either recycled \ninto consumer products or disposed of in local municipal landfills.\n  This effort created such a firestorm of public concern that the \nCongress prohibited it in the 1992 Energy Policy Act.\n  Since that time, there has been no effort to try again to deregulate \nradioactive waste--until now.\n  Recently, the EPA has announced that in the next few weeks it intends \nto issue an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to consider \nderegulating the manner of disposal of radioactive wastes.\n  This action would allow radioactive wastes to be sent to landfills \nthat were neither designed nor licensed to handle such wastes.\n  Radioactively contaminated materials could also be recycled into \nconsumer products, where they could end up in everything from \nchildren's braces to spoons and automobiles.\n  These are not theoretical risks. The Los Angeles Times has reported \nthat the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in Ventura County, CA shipped \nhundreds of tons of radioactively contaminated metals from \ndecommissioned old reactors to a metal recycler in San Pedro. That \nradioactively contaminated metal was then melted down and shipped out \ninto the consumer metal supply.\n  It is my understanding that these Advanced Notices of Proposed \nRulemaking--designed to once again try the controversial deregulation \nof radioactive waste--are being held until after the confirmation of \nthe EPA Administrator has been addressed.\n  It is my hope that Governor Leavitt, if confirmed as the new \nAdministrator, will take a hard look at this issue and block this \nmisguided proposal. I know I will be keeping a close eye on the matter.\n  I would like to now move on to an issue of paramount importance to \nCalifornia.\n\n[[Page S13333]]\n\n  The degraded air quality in California has reached a crisis point. It \nis imperative that EPA addresses the various factors contributing to \nair pollution in California with immediate regulatory efforts.\n  A bit of statistical background is necessary to understand the \nbreadth of the air quality problems.\n  California has the worst air quality in the Nation. For example, Los \nAngeles is the only area in the country that has ``extreme non-\nattainment'' for air pollution standards.\n  Two thousand three has been the worst year for smog in southern \nCalifornia since 1997. The Los Angeles basin has experienced unsafe \nlevels of ozone approximately every other day since the first of May.\n  Legislators and regulators from California are working together to \naddress the sources of air pollution.\n  I am fighting to remove language inserted into the VA/HUD spending \nbill that would prohibit California from limiting the amount of \npollution that can be released from small engines, those that are less \nthan 175 horsepower, such as lawnmowers and small tractors.\n  The California Air Resource Board recently approved landmark \nregulations--which were written with significant input from the small \nengine industry--that would set strict pollution standards on engines \nof 25 horsepower or less, but these regulations would effectively be \npreempted if the language in the VA/HUD bill is signed into law.\n  These small engines release a disproportionately large amount of \npollution based on their size. In California alone, these engines emit \nthe pollution equivalent of 18.3 million cars. Appropriate regulations \ncould cut the emissions from small engines in half.\n  The EPA must take another look at regulating the obscene amount of \npollution that comes from small engines such as lawnmowers and leaf \nblowers. It is my sincere hope that upon confirmation, Governor Leavitt \nwill direct the EPA to examine this issue further.\n  The EPA can also help improve California's air quality by granting \nCalifornia a waiver to the Federal mandate requiring States to add \noxygenates such as ethanol to its gasoline.\n  Ethanol is a highly volatile substance. According to the California \nDepartment of Environmental Quality, ethanol actually appears to have \nresulted in an increase in the amount of volatile organic gases that \nare released into the atmosphere. These gases are implicated in \nincrease levels of smog and ozone in our air.\n  Ethanol use has increased tremendously in California. In fact, 70 \npercent of the gasoline used in southern California and 57 percent of \nthat in northern California is now blended with ethanol.\n  In fact, the conference committee on the energy bill is debating an \nethanol mandate that would almost triple the amount of ethanol used in \nthe Nation's gas supply.\n  California, however, can meet clean air standards without ethanol or \nMTBE. These oxygenates are not necessary to achieve cleaner air. It is \nimperative to examine the role of increased ethanol use on current \nhigher smog levels.\n  Winston Hickox, Secretary of the California Environmental Protection \nAgency, concluded that:\n\n     . . . our current best estimate is that the increase in the \n     use of ethanol-blended gasoline has likely resulted in about \n     a one percent increase in emissions of volatile organic gases \n     (VOC) in the SCAQMD [South Coast Air Quality Management \n     District] in the summer of 2003. Given the very poor air \n     quality in the region and the great difficulty of reaching \n     the current federal ozone standard by the required attainment \n     date of 2010, an increase of this magnitude is of great \n     concern. Clearly, these emission increases have resulted in \n     higher ozone levels this year than what would have otherwise \n     occurred, and are responsible for at least some of the rise \n     in ozone levels that have been observed.\n\n  I urge the EPA to stop the legal wrangling, accept the ruling of the \n9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and issue the waiver to improve \nCalifornia air quality.\n  I now want to discuss my concerns surrounding two specific water \ncontamination issues in California: groundwater contamination by \nperchlorate, and the deplorable state of the New River that flows along \nthe border between California and Mexico.\n  Perchlorate is both a naturally occurring and man-made chemical that \nis used as the primary ingredient of solid rocket fuel propellant. \nWidespread perchlorate contamination was found in California drinking \nwater in 1997, most of it from the manufacture and improper disposal of \nthe chemical.\n  According to the EPA, perchlorate poses a serious health risk to \nhuman health because it interferes with the proper function of the \nthyroid and can potentially cause tumors.\n  I urge Governor Leavitt, if confirmed as Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, to both hasten and increase EPA's \nefforts to identify and hold accountable those entities that have \ncontaminated California's groundwater.\n  To date, perchlorate has been detected in more than 300 groundwater \nwells operated by 80 different agencies throughout California.\n  Collectively, these agencies serve 24.8 million people.\n  In the Inland Empire, a 7-mile plume has contaminated 22 drinking \nwater wells, jeopardizing water supplies for approximately 500,000 \nresidents.\n  The next EPA Administrator must direct the Agency to use its powers \nunder Superfund law to compel the companies responsible for this \ncontamination to participate in its cleanup.\n  On a broader scale, the next EPA Administrator must direct the Agency \nto set a federal drinking water standard for perchlorate as soon as \npossible, both to clarify clean-up standards and to provide oversight \nfor the cleanup efforts.\n  There have been recent suggestions that it will take another 6 years \nbefore the EPA can issue a clean-up standard. Six years is an \nunconscionable delay given that we are discussing pollution of our \ndrinking water supply.\n  EPA should take conduct site-specific assessments to evaluate the \nlevel of perchlorate contamination, and when appropriate, provide \nreplacement water for the communities suffering from contaminated \nwater.\n  This is a matter of utmost urgency for California because human \nhealth is at stake. I strongly believe the EPA must both accelerate and \nstrengthen its response to this problem.\n  I also want to draw the EPA Administrator's attention to the status \nof the New River, which flows along the border between California and \nMexico.\n  The New River has been consistently named one of the most polluted \nrivers in the United State by American Rivers.\n  The New River flows North from the Mexicali Valley into California's \nImperial Valley, carrying with it vast quantities of urban runoff, such \nas raw sewage, industrial and municipal wastes, such as pollution from \nfactories, and agricultural runoff, including pesticides.\n  Here is one startling statistic: Every day, the river pumps between \n20 to 25 million gallons of raw sewage into California.\n  This is such a massive amount of horrific pollution flowing into \nCalifornia every day that we desperately need the help of EPA and the \nFederal Government to develop a solution to this problem.\n  The EPA has worked in Mexico to build two sewage treatment plants; \nhowever, I urge the agency to focus efforts on clean-up strategies in \nCalifornia.\n  In Utah, Governor Leavitt demonstrated his commitment to clean water \nwhen he supported the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act. This \nlegislation helped reduce salt and agricultural drainage, and has had \nbeneficial ramifications in California as well.\n  I applaud Governor Leavitt's efforts in this arena, and I would very \nmuch like to see his Clean Water Initiatives expanded to include other \nimperilled rivers such as the New River in California.\n  I must also voice my concern about the status of the Superfund Trust \nFund. In 1980, citizen concern and outrage over highly toxic sites led \nto the creation of the EPA Superfund program to locate, investigate, \nand then clean the most hazardous sites nationwide.\n  Superfund has not been renewed since it expired in 1995, leaving \ndwindling Federal dollars to clean-up contaminated sites.\n  This is a big shift from the Clinton administration, when taxes on \nchemical and petroleum products provided up to $3.7 billion to clean up \ntoxic waste sites.\n\n[[Page S13334]]\n\n  As a result, the EPA is cleaning up 31 percent fewer Superfund sites, \nand taking in 64 percent less in fines per month than it did during its \npeak.\n  There are 96 sites in California that are currently on the Superfund \nnational priorities list, the second highest number in the Nation \nbehind New Jersey.\n  Approximately 40 percent of Californians live within four miles of a \ncontaminated Superfund site.\n  One site in particular, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in Ventura \nCounty owned by Rocketdyne, has been at the center of years of \ncontroversy regarding clean-up standards and funding.\n  A partial meltdown occurred there in 1959, and over the years other \naccidents and spills resulted in widespread chemical and radioactive \ncontamination, which the federal government has been attempting to \nclean up.\n  EPA has played a key role in overseeing the cleanup.\n  I have been repeatedly promised by EPA that EPA would maintain that \nrole, that it would ensure that contamination at the facility will be \nremediated to EPA's CERCLA, i.e., Superfund, standards, and that EPA \nwill conduct a thorough radiation survey of the site to those CERCLA, \nstandards to find the remaining contamination that needs to be cleaned \nup.\n  Recently, there have been indications that the administration may be \npulling back from those commitments. DOE has said it doesn't want the \npromised EPA survey to go forward and that it wishes to remove only \n5500 cubic meters of radioactively contaminated soil\n  This plan would leave behind 400,000 cubic meters of soil DOE \nconcedes are contaminated above EPA's primary cleanup goal, and then \nrelease the site for unrestricted residential use.\n  Children could end up playing atop the strontium-90 and cesium-137 \nfrom a past reactor meltdown if EPA does not stand firm and stick to \nthe commitments it has made to me.\n  I take the longstanding promises by EPA seriously, and will be \nclosely watching to see that a new Administrator lives up to them. \nGovernor Leavitt has set an encouragingly progressive precedent in his \ninteractions with the Department of Energy, particularly during his \nwork to remove uranium mine tailings from the Colorado River at Moab, \nUtah. Now we ask the Governor, in his role as Administrator of EPA, to \ncontinue that protective stance.\n  I applaud Governor Leavitt in his past efforts to ensure that the \nDepartment of Energy behaves in an environmentally responsible manner, \nand I urge the Governor to martial all available resources to continue \ncleaning Superfund sites.\n  Among the most serious issues we face as a country is the risk of \nterrorism, and among the most worrisome of those threats is that a \nradiological dispersal device--a so-called ``dirty bomb''--could be \ndetonated.\n  The Homeland Security Agency, with input from a number of other \nagencies including EPA, has been attempting to develop cleanup \nstandards to remediate the radioactive contamination that could result \nfrom such an event.\n  Some agencies have pushed for cleanup standards far more lax than EPA \nhistorically has viewed as protective of human health and the \nenvironment.\n  Given the concern many in this Chamber have about EPA's public \npronouncements regarding health risks from the World Trade Center \ntragedy, I will be looking to the EPA Administrator to stand firm in \ninsisting that any cleanup standards established for the aftermath of a \n``dirty bomb'' terrorist event be fully protective of human health and \nthe environment.\n  These standards should be no less protective than EPA's existing \nstandards for cleaning up radioactive contamination from non-terrorist \ncauses such as spills and accidents.\n  I support the nomination of Governor Mike Leavitt, and look forward \nto working with him and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Michael Leavitt to \nbe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, but I want to \nemphasize that I am hoping that Governor Leavitt will bring change to \nthe sorry record that this administration has had on the environment.\n  I am concerned by the direction that our Nation's environmental \npolicy is headed. We need an active Environmental Protection Agency, \nworking to protect the health of our people. This administration has \nbeen active, all right--actively rolling back the environmental \nprogress our country has made, actively working to narrow the reach of \nFederal environmental policy, actively working to promote oil drilling \nin environmentally sensitive areas and actively cutting funding for \nconservation and anti-pollution enforcement efforts.\n  Under this administration, we've seen cuts in funding for the EPA. \nWe've seen an increased focus on cutting sweetheart deals with \npolluters. And we've seen a failure to move forward on new, innovative \nprograms that will help our environment. While environmental regulation \nrequires action and distributes responsibility among Federal, State and \nlocal authorities, Governor Leavitt needs to recognize that the Federal \nEPA is the backstop. The environmental buck will stop on Governor \nLeavitt's desk. If a State is not acting responsibly and protecting the \nhealth and safety of its citizens, Governor Leavitt must step in. I \nhope that Governor Leavitt will fight for the environment, rather than \nfighting for the priorities of the White House.\n  I have concerns with this nominee. A number of environmental watchdog \ngroups have expressed their disappointment about Governor Leavitt's \nrecord on environmental protection during his tenure as Governor of \nUtah. He has a record of supporting a number of projects that were \nenvironmentally questionable, such as the Legacy Highway Project in \nDavis County, UT. It is my understanding that this highway project as \noriginally conceived would harm a significant migratory bird habitat.\n  But in the end, I decided that Governor Leavitt has the background \nand qualifications necessary to do this job. As a governor who has a \ndistinguished background not only leading his own State, but also the \nNational Governors Association and the Western Governors Association, \nhe will bring an experienced hand to the leadership of the agency. \nFurther, as the Vice-Chair of the National Governors Association, he \npushed through a bipartisan policy supporting working out environmental \nissues through a collaborative process.\n  In the area of agriculture, the Administration has delayed the \nimplementation of the Conservation Security Program, a fresh farmer-\nfriendly approach to farm policy that uses incentives to help farmers \ndo what's best for their land and for the air and water they and their \nneighbors breathe and drink. This bipartisan, bicameral program was a \nkey part of the 6 year farm bill passed last year. Yet, it is still not \nimplemented.\n  We've also seen a serious pullback from the Clean Water Act. In the \nface of the SWANCC decision limiting federal jurisdiction on certain \nisolated wetlands, the EPA has released an Advance Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking and policy guidance that pulls back even further. The intent \nof Congress for the CWA is clear--to protect the waters of the United \nStates, and to reach all waters within Federal constitutional \njurisdiction.\n  The court's decision in SWANCC has removed jurisdiction from \nintrastate, non-navigable waters where jurisdiction was based solely on \nthe so-called ``migratory bird rule.'' The contemplated changes to the \nrules pull back much further and would relinquish jurisdiction that the \nFederal Government clearly has and needs to protect waters of the \nUnited States.\n  One of Governor Leavitt's achievements at the National Governors \nAssocation was the adoption of a set of environmental principles he \ncalls ``enlibra.'' The term means ``balance,'' and refers to a process \nof bringing in all the stakeholders in environmental issues together to \ntry to work issues out. I hope that, as EPA Administrator, Governor \nLeavitt will truly strive for balance--because, unfortunately, there \nhas been very little balance in the environmental policies of the \nadministration he is joining.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Gov. Michael Leavitt to serve as Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  As my colleagues here in the Senate know, I have more than a passing \ninterest in the people who run our Government. Many of our problems \nhave\n\n[[Page S13335]]\n\nbeen caused because we do not have the right people with the right \nknowledge and skills in the right place at the right time. The process \nis even more difficult when trying to find people to nominate for \ncontroversial appointments like Federal judgeships or high-profile \nCabinet officers.\n  Well, I would like to say that President Bush got it right. Mike \nLeavitt is clearly one of the best people we could ever get to run the \nEPA.\n  I first met Mike while we were both Governors and were active \ntogether in the Republican Governors and National Governors \nAssociations. Mike served as NGA vice-chairman, under then-Gov. Tom \nCarper, NGA chairman, RGA vice-chairman, while I was chairman, and as \nRGA chairman.\n  He has established a very strong reputation as a straight-shooting \nconsensus builder with the proven ability to work on a bipartisan \nbasis. On many issues, Mike was willing to take on tough issues--such \nas internet taxation and unfunded mandates legislation--and worked with \nboth Republican and Democratic Governors to form consensus and move the \nball down the field.\n  During his three terms as Governor, Mike has demonstrated an \noutstanding ability to efficiently and effectively manage the State of \nUtah's provision of public goods and services. Time after time, \nGovernor Leavitt has set an agenda in Utah, and each time he has rolled \nup his sleeves, pulled together broad coalitions, reached consensus, \nand gotten results.\n  Under Mike's watch, Utah has hosted the most environmentally friendly \nOlympics ever, reduced crime, decreased reliance on welfare, reduced \nunemployment, and improved education funding and performance--all while \nthe State's sales, income, and property taxes have been reduced. In \nfact, During Mike's tenure as Governor, Utah has been named the best-\nmanaged State five times. No wonder he was recently named ``Public \nOfficial of the Year'' by Governing magazine.\n  Governor Leavitt's record on the environment is equally as \nimpressive. Consider: Utah's air quality has demonstrably improved \nduring the Leavitt administration. Utah currently meets all Federal air \nquality standards; this was not the case when Governor Leavitt started \nhis service. Visibility and air quality in the West have improved \nbecause of Governor Leavitt's co-chairmanship of the Western Regional \nAir Partnership. Utah has among the Nation's cleanest watersheds and \nwater quality has improved dramatically during the Leavitt \nadministration. Governor Leavitt helped protect 500,000 acres of \nremarkable land in national parks, monuments, recreation areas and \nwilderness study areas through value-for-value land exchanges with the \nFederal Government. Utah's Quality Growth Commission, which Governor \nLeavitt helped establish, has conserved approximately 35,000 acres of \ncritical land in perpetuity, protecting critical wildlife, watershed \nand historical and agricultural assets in the State. Governor Leavitt \nhelped found Envision Utah, the Nation's largest voluntary quality \ngrowth partnership. It was formed to create a vision and implement \nstrategies to protect Utah's environment for future generations.\n  I cannot think of anyone who is better suited to lead the EPA. \nGovernor Leavitt has continuously demonstrated the tremendous \ninterpersonal skills and management experience necessary to handle the \nmajor challenges that the Agency faces during the months and years \nahead. He cares deeply about the environment and will pull people \ntogether to get things done.\n  Mike's proven ability to facilitate the creation of positive \nsolutions to multiple problems and interests is exactly what is needed \nat the EPA's top post. He has established an impressive track record of \nproducing results; one that I believe will continue should he be \nconfirmed as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  I strongly urge all my colleagues here in the Senate to support \nMike's nomination.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to support President \nBush's nomination of Governor Michael O. Leavitt to be the next \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. I am proud to \nhave the opportunity to make a statement for the record that expresses \nmy endorsement of this qualified nominee. President Bush has chosen an \nindividual who understands the importance of a clean and healthy \nenvironment and who will ensure that the regulations promulgated by the \nEPA will be based on sound science, not speculation and conjecture. All \ntoo often, these regulations are put into effect not because they will \nincrease health benefits, but because it was the politically expedient \nthing to do.\n  Governor Leavitt's record speaks for itself. I think that there is \nlittle doubt, on either side of the aisle that Governor Leavitt is \nextremely qualified to serve as the next administrator of the EPA. He \nhas thrice been elected as Governor of Utah and is currently the \nlongest serving Governor of any State in the Nation. Under this watch, \nUtah saw a reduction in crime, hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics, and cut \ntaxes. It comes as no surprise that five times during Governor \nLeavitt's 11 years as Governor, Utah has been voted the best managed \nState five times. As Governor, he has demonstrated his fitness to serve \nas our Nation's top environmental official by solving problems through \nconsensus building and cooperation. Governor Leavitt has demonstrated \nhis ability to bring all affected parties to the table, roll up his \nsleeves and reach a solution. These skills will be of critical \nimportance as the 2006 arsenic regulations approach and we work toward \ndomestic energy security.\n  Of great concern to the people of my State and the State of Utah is \nthe implementation of the EPA's 2006 arsenic drinking water standard \nwhich lowers the maximum allowable parts per billion of arsenic from 50 \nto 10. Arsenic is a naturally occurring element in my home State of New \nMexico and in the State of Utah. Compliance with this regulation comes \nat a great cost to small communities, those that least have the \nresources to achieve implementation. The estimated national cost of \nimplementing this new EPA rule is $600 million annually and will \nrequire $5 billion in capital outlays.\n  The EPA estimates that roughly 97 percent of the systems expected to \nexceed the standard are small systems, those serving fewer than 10,000 \npeople. These small communities lack the economies of scale present in \nlarger communities and are less able to spread out costs. In Governor \nLeavitt's home State for example, the Utah Department of Environmental \nQuality estimates that implementing the new standards will require $40 \nmillion in capital outlays and predicts that annual operation and \nmaintenance costs will run into the tens of millions of dollars. We \nneed an administrator that will work with these communities so that \nimplementation of this standard can be accomplished as smoothly and \npainlessly as possible.\n  There is no doubt that our Nation is facing an energy crisis. The \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I serve as chairman, \nhas spent many months and many people have put in long hours developing \na comprehensive energy policy that best meets our Nation's energy needs \nwhile safeguarding the environment. I have come to the realization that \nevery department of our Government needs to start looking not only at \ntheir policies but how their policies affect America's energy future. \nAs we move forward with America's energy policy, it is critical that we \nhave an EPA Administrator who understands our country's energy needs \nand is able to make assessments that are both based on empirical proof \nand will protect our invaluable natural resources for future \ngenerations. We need an Administrator who will evaluate how our \nenvironmental policies affect the goal of energy self-sufficiency. We \nneed an Administrator that will promote scientifically valid \ninitiatives when making assessments on the impact of regulations the \nEPA promulgates. I have no reservation that Governor Leavitt is the man \nfor the job.\n  Accomplishing these national priorities will be no easy task. I hope \nthat he has a very successful term because if he does, we will be a \nmore secure Nation for it. I bid him well.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I supported Governor Levitt's nomination \nin the Environment Committee, but that does not mean that I support the \nBush administration's environmental polices. Far from it. Under the \nBush administration, the Environmental Protection Agency has ignored\n\n[[Page S13336]]\n\nthe law and gutted its enforcement. It has been a 30-month polluters' \nholiday.\n  I think the record is clear. There is also an enormous gap between \nthe bipartisan approach that Mike Levitt supported in dealing with \nenvironmental issues while he has served as Governor of Utah, and this \nadministration. For example, the bipartisan Western Governors' policy \nstates ``Westerners do not reject the goals and objectives of federal \nenvironmental laws, nor the appropriate role of federal regulation and \nenforcement.'' Recently, the EPA Office of Enforcement found that \nduring the past 2 years, only 24 percent of the facilities that were in \nmajor noncompliance with respect to the Clean Water Act faced \nenforcement actions. So the EPA's own enforcement office says on major \nwater violations, there hasn't been enforcement.\n  Gap number two, the Western Governors Association has always stressed \nconsultation with all the parties and involving the States. Two \nexamples where the administration isn't doing that are on the question \nof these closed door negotiations with industrial livestock firms, \nbehind closed doors they are talking about amnesty from the Clean Air \nAct and the Superfund law. Another is the lack of consultation with the \nStates on the proposed rule to limit the scope of the Clean Air Act. \nThirty-nine States have objected and said they were not party to that \ndiscussion. So on the question of consultation involving States, there \nis a big gap between the Western Governors and this administration.\n  The third big gap can be seen in the Western Governors Association \npositions on the environment where there is a clear commitment to \nfollowing the law. Certainly that hasn't been done with the Bush \nadministration when it comes to the Clean Air Act. I was on the \nconference committee that wrote the law in 1990, and I can tell you \nthere was absolutely no question that it was the intent of Congress \nthat powerplants, oil refineries and industrial facilities would be \nrequired to install pollution controls. This is a blatant example of \nthe Bush administration's failure to follow the law.\n  What I am interested in is seeing an effort to go back to the kinds \nof policies that the Governors, particularly those in the West, have \nsought to try to bring people together on these contentious issues and \nfind common ground. That has not been what the Environmental Protection \nAgency has done in Washington, D.C. But that is what is needed.\n  When Governor Leavitt came before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I was particularly concerned about his willingness to use \nthe enforcement tools of the agency against serious and egregious \nviolations of the environmental laws. My sense is that the \ncollaborative model that he wishes to pursue is one I support. But it \nis clear, Mr. President and colleagues, that when companies abuse that \nkind of good-faith effort by government, the government has got to be \nwilling to come down with hobnail boots on those who are putting at \nrisk our air and our land and water. Prior to the committee vote, \nGovernor Leavitt sent me a memo making it clear that he is willing to \nlook at a different enforcement approach than this administration has \nused in the past. In the memo, Governor Leavitt wrote ``in warranted \ncircumstances I would use the enforcement power rigorously.'' By \ncontrast, during the Bush administration, enforcement has been \nessentially abandoned, and even the EPA's own internal reports indicate \nthat that is the case.\n  The American people need an administrator who is going to end this \npolluters' holiday and put the Environmental Protection Agency back to \nwork protecting the environment. I think that the Governor's ideas \nabout collaboration are important. They are fresh and creative, and I \nthink that if he is willing to do as he pledged to work with members of \nCongress on both sides of the aisle, that they could revitalize the \nagency and bring a fresh approach to environmental policy. But it is \nimportant for senators to understand that those who talk about \ncollaboration only, without a willingness to back it up with tough \nenforcement policies, could be talking about just window dressing for \nbusiness, or really lack of business as usual.\n  Over the past several weeks, Governor Leavitt has worked hard to \nconvince me he means business. He has reached out and made the extra \neffort to show he will be no just an advocate for collaboration but \nalso a tough, no-nonsense enforcer when he needs to be. He has also \ncommitted to look at the situation involving the City of Portland's \nsewer overflows during wet weather and whether this is an appropriate \ncase for enforcement, given that the local community is making progress \nin addressing the situation and that local ratepayers have already \nspent more than $500 million toward what will eventually be a $1 \nbillion project.\n  So the Governor, in my view, has made clear that he wants to bring to \nEPA a fresh and independent approach to these kinds of issues. He has \nconvinced me that he understands that tough no-nonsense enforcement of \nthis country's environmental laws is absolutely essential when the \nenvironmental collaborative approach does not work. I will be closely \nwatching how Governor Leavitt follows through on these changes in EPA's \napproach to enforcement.\n  It is very obvious to me that there needs to be a dramatic set of \nchanges put in place at the Environmental Protection Agency. My vote \ntoday is essentially a vote because I think the Governor of Utah has \nthe potential to do this job right. I am supporting the Mike Leavitt \nwho I know can be a tough, independent administrator of EPA. For all \nAmericans' sake, I hope Governor Leavitt will be successful in bringing \nabout this change in EPA's direction. I want to give him a chance to \nsucceed, and that is why I am supporting his nomination today.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the Senate's responsibility to \nscrutinize and confirm Presidential nominees is an important one, and \nnever more so than when we are considering who should oversee the \nagency that, as its name indicates, is designed to protect the \ncountry's environment.\n  The individual charged with this responsibility will advise the \nPresident on setting the direction for our national efforts to protect \nthe environment. This person will have the power to decide whether to \nnurture and conserve, or to develop and destroy our Nation's great \nresources. Throughout my career, I have committed myself to a career of \nenvironmental stewardship. I have tried to cast votes and offer \nlegislation that fully reflect and respond to the importance and \nlasting legacy of America's environmental needs. I thus take this vote \nvery seriously.\n  At the same time, I also have another tradition to defend and uphold. \nI have committed myself to playing a constructive role with respect to \nthe Senate's duty to provide advice and consent on the President's \nnominees for Cabinet or other senior executive branch positions. I take \nthat role seriously as well.\n  As the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Mike \nLeavitt would be charged with unique and historic responsibilities, \nwhich will be as important as they are far reaching. In varying ways, \nall Americans will be affected by his decisions. As the Nation's \nprincipal environmental agency, the EPA has responsibility for the \nprotection of air and water resources, for the clean up of toxic \nwastes, and for the regulation of the quality of our environment.\n  That is why I am sensitive to the concerns of some that Governor \nLeavitt will not live up to this responsibility for environmental \nstewardship if his nomination is confirmed. I have been at odds with \nsome of Governor Leavitt's environmental management decisions, and I am \nconcerned that his background might cloud his judgement and objectivity \non a number of important issues and place him at odds with members of \nthe conservation community and with this Senator.\n  While I am concerned with Mr. Leavitt's professed unfamiliarity with \nmany of the laws that I regard as critical for the promotion of a \nbalanced environmental policy, I am somewhat heartened by his comments \nthat he will give this position ``the full measure of his heart.'' I am \nencouraged by this commitment to listen to the views of all \nstakeholders and all points of view and make, in his words, \nenvironmental protection a national ``ethic.''\n  I will take Mr. Leavitt at his word--that he will devote his time and \nenergy\n\n[[Page S13337]]\n\nto the proper enforcement of the EPA's policies, rather than \ncircumventing or repealing laws which preserve our dwindling resources, \nthat he will attempt to address the pollution that makes our air unfit \nto breathe and our water unsafe to drink, and that he will protect our \nland and water resources. I intend to hold him to his word.\n  I also will act in accordance with what I feel is the proper \nconstitutional role of the Senate when it comes to confirming \nPresidential nominees for positions advising the President. I believe \nthat the Senate should allow a President to appoint people to advise \nhim who share his philosophy and principles. My approach to judicial \nnominations, of course, is different--nominees for lifetime positions \nin the judicial branch warrant particularly close scrutiny.\n  For these reasons, I will support Governor Leavitt's nomination \ntoday. However, in doing so, I fully recognize that I have an ongoing \nresponsibility to oversee the institution with stewardship of our \nenvironmental quality to ensure that it lives up to its duties. The \nSenate does not, by confirming Mr. Leavitt, discharge its \nresponsibility to protect our resources and ensure that our \nenvironmental laws are enforced. I feel a responsibility to listen to \nthe voices of the many Wisconsinites and others who are deeply \nconcerned about this administration's environmental record. I am \nhopeful that these voices will be heard by Mr. Leavitt and I will be \nvigilant in ensuring that Governor Leavitt takes his responsibilities \nwith the utmost seriousness.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I join with those of my colleagues \nwho are pleased to see that the nomination of Governor Michael Leavitt \nto be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will finally \nbe moving forward.\n  Governor Leavitt is one of the founders of a bipartisan and \ncollaborative approach to environmental decisionmaking that is a model \nfor dealing with the difficult issues that face us today. His ``En \nLibra'' philosophy has been adopted by the National Governors \nAssociation and is being used by Federal, State, local and private \nentities throughout the country. He is the former chair of the National \nGovernors Association, the Western Governors Association, the \nRepublican Governors Association and the Council of State Governments. \nHis experience spans the private sector, academia, and government.\n  Governor Leavitt is without question qualified for the job. In fact, \nhe is superbly qualified for the job. He is the Nation's longest-\nserving, and arguably most successful Governor, whose tenure has \nbrought unprecedented prosperity to his State, unparalleled efficiency \nto its management, and unequaled improvements to its environment. Along \nthe way he has strived for and achieved--if not perfect harmony--then a \nnotable reduction in the volume and intensity of debate over the kind \nof issues that are more often polarizing than they are unifying.\n  There can be no better recommendation for the individual who is to \nlead the agency charged with stewardship of our country's environment.\n  Unfortunately, Governor Leavitt's nomination was treated shamefully \nby a small handful of individuals bent on using it as an excuse to \naccuse the current administration of all kinds of environmental wrongs, \nto perpetuate outmoded and ineffectual approaches to environmental \nissues, and to cater to the worst kind of unscientific and \nunsupportable rhetoric--all that Governor Leavitt stands against and \nthat this Senate should repudiate for the sake of our nation's welfare.\n  My State of Alaska, as many others--especially in the west--has often \nstruggled with environmental restrictions sought by, imposed by, and \nmaintained by interests with very little knowledge of the conditions we \nlive with. Nonetheless, we take our environmental responsibilities very \nseriously.\n  We care about our environment, and we try very hard to address \nserious issues with clarity and common sense. All too often, common \nsense is lacking when one-size-fits-all solutions are imposed from \noutside, and based more on fanciful gloom-and-doom predictions than on \nfacts.\n  The truth is that we have made mammoth strides in improving our \nenvironment, and every day we learn new ways to apply research and \ntechnology toward doing an even better job.\n  This administration is providing a breath of fresh air--and I mean \nthat both literally and figuratively--when it comes to environmental \nissues.\n  While improvements can certainly be forced--at great cost--by the \nthreat of heavy-handed government enforcement, they come far more \nrapidly when they are to the participants' economic advantage. There is \nall the difference in the world between making money and not losing \nmoney.\n  If we look honestly at what works and what doesn't, we have to \nconclude that reform of the regulatory process is badly needed. \nFrankly, I commend the administration for being willing to look at new \napproaches to building a better environment, rather than continuing to \nhammer at the same old nails.\n\n  I am confident that I will not always agree with the positions that \nGovernor Leavitt may take if he becomes the EPA Administrator. Alaska \nhas a number of outstanding issues with the EPA.\n  We have long hoped to establish Alaska as a separate EPA region, \nbecause attempting to administer such a vast area with so few people \nwho have even seen the issues first-hand is an impossible task that \noften leads to unnecessary and damaging misunderstandings.\n  We would like to move forward on a determination that better defines \nthe extent of Clean Water Act authority over Alaska's wetlands. We have \nover 174 million acres of land classified as wetlands, more than all \nthe other States combined. Much of it is neither use for navigation nor \nconnected in any substantive way with other water bodies, or exists \nsolely because it is underlain by permafrost.\n  We would like to receive active assistance from the EPA in evaluating \nthe long-term health benefits of our reliance on small, diesel-powered \nutilities.\n  We would like to receive recognition that uncontrollable temperature \ninversions due to our climate are the primary reason some of our cities \nhave difficulty attaining compliance with carbon monoxide rules.\n  We would like the agency to work with us on developing a mechanism \nthat will more effectively deliver grants to Alaska's many rural Native \ncommunities.\n  In fact, the list of issues between us ranges from minuscule to \nmammoth--from local issues that should be easily resolved to those \nwhich require the intervention of the Supreme Court.\n  I by no means believe that confirming Governor Michael Leavitt will \nlead to a resolution of them all. What I do believe is that Governor \nLeavitt will offer comprehensive, impartial and thoughtful \nconsideration. That is all I ask, and all that my constituents ask.\n  I strongly support this nomination, and I am very pleased to see that \nit is moving at this time. I would like to think that this marks a \ntriumph for the American people, who have little patience for \ndiversionary rhetoric and divisionary politics. The American people \nwant their Congress to simply do its job, to the best of its ability, \nand with the welfare of the entire country in mind.\n  I will vote to confirm Governor Leavitt on behalf of my constituents, \non behalf of all Americans, and on behalf of a safe, productive and \nhealthy environment. I urge all my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, yesterday on the Senate \nfloor, I voiced my concerns about the Bush administration's weak \nenvironmental record and the need to further debate those concerns. I \nalso shared my belief that Governor Leavitt is an able public servant \nwho will likely be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n  In follow up to those remarks and following the vitiation of the \ncloture vote, I spoke with Governor Leavitt and explained my views on \nthe direction of environmental policy under this President and the need \nfor him to emerge as champion for the environment in an administration \nthat lacks one. I informed him that, having made my objections known, I \nwould vote in favor of his nomination in the hopes that we could forge \na strong working relationship to reach suitable resolutions to the many \nenvironmental problems, including Superfund issues, that plague my \nState of Florida and the Nation.\n\n[[Page S13338]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. And with that I ask the minority, do they have anyone \nelse who wants the time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield at this time the final 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague for reserving his \ntime for me. I also want to pay tribute to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont and the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma for their \nleadership on this matter, for their goodness and kindness in support. \nI have to say with these two fine Senators we have in the Senate, both \nof them supporting this nominee speaks volumes of the fine man he is. \nBut I have also heard from a couple of my colleagues whom I respect \nthat they have ``serious concerns.'' Governor Leavitt has had a \n``careless disregard for water and air,'' ``a disturbing tendency to \nignore regulations,'' ``a hands off approach.'' He is a ``rollback \nadministrator.''\n\n  As I understand it, those statements were made this morning. The \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois said that Governor Leavitt has \n``turned his back on the wilderness.'' He also said that ``Utah is one \nof the biggest polluter States in the Nation.''\n  I cannot blame him too much for making that statement because he is \njust quoting some of the irresponsible people in the environmental \nfield who basically have totally ignored the facts, which I am going to \nspeak about in a minute.\n  I am grateful to these two leaders for the kind way they have handled \nthis nomination and for the effective way they have handled it so we \nwill have a final vote on one of the finest Governors in this land to \nhead one of the most difficult agencies in this land. He is a Governor \nwho is known for working with everybody, known for keeping an open \nmind, known for being honest, known for being active, and known for \nintelligence. I could go on about Mike Leavitt. He is a very fine man.\n  Yesterday during the debate on the nomination of Gov. Michael Leavitt \nto be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, my friend \nand colleague Senator Richard Durbin from Illinois stood up on the \nSenate floor and began an attack on the State of Utah and on Utah's \nGovernor. Now this morning, I find that another friend and colleague, \nSenator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, has been following suit. I am \ncertain both of them are sincere, but I am going to show that both of \nthem are absolutely wrong as well.\n  First, I am very disappointed that my colleagues would spend time \nhighlighting the supposed weakness of another Senator's State and the \nsupposed weakness of that State's top elected official, especially when \nthey are wrong in both instances.\n  It was very appropriate for the Members of the Senate in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to ask the Governor questions \norally and in writing about his management of Utah's natural resources \nand to allow him to provide answers to those questions, but to ignore \nhis answers to those questions and to use the Senate floor to cast \naspersions at Utah I find personally offensive.\n  Secondly, to be frank, I have to say I am especially offended that my \ncolleagues choose this forum to make these attacks with information \nthat is so clearly inaccurate and so cleverly twisted to cast Utah and \nits Governor in the worst possible light, so I find it necessary to \nmake part of the Record the truth about some of the aspersions cast at \nmy State.\n  Utah is one of the cleanest States in the Nation, and in large part \nthis is due to Gov. Michael Leavitt, so one can imagine my surprise \nwhen one of my colleagues comes to the Senate floor to call Utah one of \nthe Nation's biggest polluters and to blame our Governor for it. What \ndoes my colleague mean when he calls Utah a big polluter? A more \nimportant question is, What does the public think it means when they \nhear my colleagues say it?\n  Let me shed some light on where others have sown confusion. One of \nthe principal indexes being looked at by my colleagues is the Toxic \nRelease Inventory, or TRI, which is collected and published by the EPA. \nThe most recent TRI report came out in 2001, but we should keep in mind \nthat the data for that report, or for the TRI, are 2 years old. \nIn other words, the 2001 TRI report makes use of data from 1999.\n\n  A very careful distinction must be made before using numbers from the \nTRI report. Some may believe or wish to cause others to believe that \nthe TRI simply counts up how much pollution goes into our water and our \nair, but this is not necessarily the case, to say the least. In fact, \nevery time a company uses a chemical and then correctly and legally \ndisposes of it, that is considered a release.\n  Even if a pound of a certain chemical is properly recycled, that, \ntoo, is considered a pound of release. When a mining company takes a \npound of dirt and rock and removes metals from it, that leftover soil \nand rock often contains chemicals from the processing and must be \nhandled according to a very strict environmental set of regulations. \nHowever, each pound of that soil and rock is counted as a release under \nthe TRI.\n  States such as Utah and Nevada have very large mining operations, and \nbecause the amount of leftover rock and soil from these operations is \nvery large, these two States show up at the top of the list when all \ntypes of releases are combined.\n  So do TRI numbers really reflect pollution that is going into our air \nand water? Yes, in some cases. But as I just pointed out, many of the \n``releases'' reported under TRI never go into our air or our water but \nare safely sequestered according to the law.\n  I quote from the EPA's TRI report itself, 2001 TRI public data \nrelease, ES-26:\n\n       TRI reports reflect releases and other waste management \n     activities of chemicals, not exposures of the public to those \n     chemicals. Release estimates alone are not sufficient to \n     determine exposure or to calculate potential adverse effects \n     on human health and the environment.\n\n  Most citizens will be more concerned about chemicals actually emitted \ninto the air and discharged into our surface water than they will about \nleftover rock and soil from mining activities that are legally \nsequestered. According to the 2001 TRI report, Utah emitted about 19 \nmillion pounds of chemicals into the air during 1999, but the same \nreport shows that the State of Illinois released nearly 60 million \npounds of chemicals into the air. In other words, according to the TRI, \nduring 1999 Illinois was three times the air polluter that Utah was. I \npoint out that since then, Utah's biggest air polluter, MagCorp, has \nvoluntarily upgraded its facilities and reduced its emissions by more \nthan 90 percent. This is all under Governor Leavitt's management.\n  Let's look at surface water discharges. During that same year, Utah \nreleased 1.2 million pounds of chemicals into the surface water. This \nwas below the average of all States. However, the TRI report shows that \nNew Jersey released 3.7 million pounds and Illinois released 8 million \npounds of chemicals into the surface water. In other words, according \nto the EPA, New Jersey is three times the water polluter that Utah is \nand Illinois almost eight times the polluter that Utah is.\n  So what does this mean? Does it mean that Illinois and New Jersey \nshould be labeled as large polluters or, as my State was erroneously \nlabeled, the biggest polluters in the country? No, of course not, and I \ncertainly do not believe that to be the case. I believe they are both \nbeautiful and well run States, just as I know Utah to be.\n  I think it does mean, though, that the Senators from these two States \nshould be more careful about attempting to pin the ``polluter'' label \non my State and on my Governor, and I am not going to stand for it. \nThat is why I am making these remarks today, among other reasons. \nFrankly, I am going to stand up for this very fine Governor and good \nperson who is known to be a person who works with people of all beliefs \nand from all parties.\n\n  Some of my colleagues and many in the environmental community have \nbeen a little too fast and too loose with pinning that unhelpful label \nof ``polluter'' on others and on the industries that keep our society \nrunning.\n  I have also heard on the Senate floor that Utah has one of the worst \nrecords for water quality enforcement in the Nation. This is patently \nfalse. There was a report put out by the environmental group that \nstates this falsehood. However, the statement was\n\n[[Page S13339]]\n\nbased on incomplete reporting on water quality data from Utah.\n  In an analysis of the complete data, the EPA has in fact determined \nthat Utah ranks among the top 10 States in water quality compliance--\none of the top 10 States--and yet we have to put up with this type of \nunfortunate mischaracterization of my State.\n  Admittedly, some of my colleagues pay much too much attention to some \nof these people who are in this game for politics rather than for doing \nwhat is right for the environment. I might as well point out that Utah \nis also in complete compliance with EPA's air quality standards. This \nis rare amongst States, and it was not the case when Governor Leavitt \ntook office.\n  I have also heard that Governor Leavitt has turned his back on \nwilderness in Utah and he supports bulldozing new roads through our \nnational parks. Both statements are false as well, and rather than \nlaunch into a long debate about wilderness and BLM roads, I ask \nunanimous consent that the memorandum of understanding between the \nState of Utah and the Department of the Interior on State and county \nroad acknowledgment be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Anyone who reads this document will see that the \nunderstanding does nothing to allow new roads or even the upgrade of \nexisting roads.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. They will also see that the understanding specifically \nexcludes roads in our parks, refuges, wilderness areas, and even in our \nwilderness study areas. More important, these issues have nothing \nwhatever to do with the Environmental Protection Agency, and that needs \nto be pointed out.\n  Finally, I reiterate my love for my beautiful State of Utah and for \nmy good friend Michael Leavitt. In my statement yesterday, I showed \nthat the record is clear that Michael Leavitt is a champion of the \nenvironment and that he is widely recognized as one of our Nation's top \npublic managers. I urge my colleagues to put their full support behind \nhis nomination to head up the Environmental Protection Agency and I do \nnot believe they will be sorry. I believe my colleagues will find him \nto be the great leader that we all know him to be.\n\n\n     MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING Between the State of Utah and The \n   Department of the Interior on State and County Road Acknowledgment\n\n       This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is entered into \n     between the U.S. Department of the Interior and the State of \n     Utah on this 9th day of April 2003.\n       Whereas,\n       1. In a Report to Congress prepared in June of 1993, the \n     Department of the Interior explained that unresolved \n     conflicts over the status of rights-of-way created pursuant \n     to Revised Statute 2477 were creating a continuing cloud on \n     federal agencies' ability to manage federal lands.\n       2. On August 7, 2002, a bipartisan group of eight western \n     governors wrote urging the Department of the Interior to \n     bring finality to R.S. 2477 disputes in a cooperative manner.\n       3. On July 16, 2002, the National Association of Counties \n     adopted a resolution urging the Department of the Interior to \n     adopt a policy approach to R.S. 2477 rights-of-way that would \n     allow counties to maintain historical rights of way across \n     federally managed lands.\n       4. Disputes involving R.S. 2477 rights-of-way have \n     generated numerous expensive and inconclusive federal court \n     lawsuits that have left numerous questions concerning the \n     ownership status of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way unresolved; and \n     the high cost of this litigation has made it difficult for \n     states and counties to assert their rights and for \n     conservation groups to assert their interests.\n       5. The Department of the Interior has traditionally \n     approached R.S. 2477 issues by trying to define the precise \n     legal limits of the original statutory grant.\n       6. Most of the asserted R.S. 2477 rights-of-way that \n     actually have been part of western states-inventoried and \n     maintained transportation infrastructure since before the \n     enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n     (FLPMA) in 1976 satisfy the statutory requirements of \n     ``construction'' and ``highway'' under almost any \n     interpretation of those statutory terms.\n       7. The State of Utah has many R.S. 2477 claims, and on June \n     14, 2000, sent to the Secretary of the Interior a Notice of \n     Intention to File Suit under 28 U.S.C.\\1\\ 2409a(m) to quit \n     the title to those claims.\n       8. The roads in which the State of Utah and Utah counties \n     assert claims include many roads of continuing importance to \n     rural transportation.\n       9. Rights-of-way granted under R.S. 2477 are vested \n     property rights that cannot be eliminated or diminished \n     without due process. However, the statutory grant of the \n     rights-of-way did not require the issuance of an identifying \n     record, such as a patent. The resulting uncertainty \n     surrounding the identity and scope of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way \n     has created unnecessary difficulties in federal, state and \n     local transportation and land use planning decisions.\n       10. The State of Utah and Utah counties have spent \n     considerable time and substantial resources to gather \n     information about road claims and are prepared, if necessary, \n     to litigate those claims.\n       11. Federal, state and local managers and environmental \n     advocacy organizations have all demonstrated a desire to put \n     disputes surrounding R.S. 2477 to rest and move toward an \n     approach to land management that emphasizes cooperation.\n       Now, therefore, the parties stipulate and agree as follows:\n       1. The Department shall implement a State and County Road \n     Acknowledgment Process (Acknowledgment Process) to \n     acknowledge the existence of certain R.S. 2477 rights-of-way \n     on Bureau of Land Management land within the State of Utah, \n     as further described in, and subject to the terms and \n     conditions of, this MOU.\n       2. For purposes of the Acknowledgment Process only, neither \n     the State nor any Utah county shall assert a right-of-way for \n     any:\n       a. roads that lie within Congressionally designated \n     Wilderness Areas or Wilderness Study Areas designated on or \n     before October 21, 1993, under Section 603 of FLPMA; and\n       b. roads that lie within the boundaries of any unit of the \n     National Park System; and\n       c. roads that lie within the boundaries of any unit of the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System; and\n       d. roads that are administered by a federal agency other \n     than the Department of the Interior, unless that federal \n     agency consents to the inclusion of the road in the \n     Acknowledgment Process.\n       3. The State of Utah, or any Utah county, shall submit a \n     request to initiate the Acknowledgment Process for a \n     candidate road and shall reimburse the Bureau of Land \n     Management for the reasonable and necessary cost of \n     processing each request. Each eligible road submitted shall \n     have the following characteristics:\n       a. the road existed prior to the enactment of FLPMA in 1976 \n     and is in use at the present time;\n       b. the road can be identified by centerline description or \n     other appropriate legal description;\n       c. the existence of the road prior to the enactment of \n     FLPMA is documented by information sufficient to support a \n     conclusion that the road meets the legal requirements of a \n     right-of-way granted under R.S. 2477; this information may \n     include, but is not limited to, photographs, affidavits, \n     surveys, government records concerning the road, information \n     concerning or information reasonably inferred from the road's \n     current conditions; and\n       d. the road was and continues to be public and capable of \n     accommodating automobiles or trucks with four wheels and has \n     been the subject of some type of periodic maintenance.\n       4. The Acknowledgment Process referenced in this MOU that \n     the Department shall use to acknowledge eligible roads is \n     FLPMA's recordable disclaimer of interest process.\n       See 43 U.S.C. 1745; 43 C.F.R. subpart 1864. The recordable \n     disclaimer of interest process provides a clear statutory \n     basis for resolving claims and provides an opportunity for \n     public notice and participation. The Utah State Director of \n     the Bureau of Land Management will issue a recordable \n     disclaimer of interest if the requirements of the applicable \n     statutes and regulations, and the terms of this MOU, have \n     been satisfied.\n       5. By signing this agreement, the Department recognizes \n     that road width and ongoing maintenance levels are essential \n     aspects of road management. Therefore, the scope of a road \n     that the Department disclaims should include a sufficient \n     width to allow the State or county to maintain the character, \n     usage, and travel safety of the road existing at the date of \n     this MOU. For purposes of the Acknowledgment Process only, \n     the width of the road asserted and the width of the road \n     disclaimed shall not exceed the width of ground disturbance \n     that currently exists for the road at the date of this MOU.\n       6. After the Department issues a recordable disclaimer of \n     interest for an acknowledged road, the State or a county may \n     want to increase the road's width beyond the already \n     disclaimed right-of-way, or to improve the road in a way that \n     substantially alters its character (such as by paving a \n     previously unpaved surface). But the recordable disclaimer of \n     interest process will not be used as a mechanism to \n     substantially alter the characteristics of a road. In cases \n     where the State or a county wishes to substantially alter a \n     road that is subject to the Acknowledgement Process in a way \n     that is outside the scope of ordinary maintenance, it will do \n     so only after notifying BLM of its intentions and giving BLM \n     an opportunity to determine that no permit or other \n     authorization is required under federal law; or, if a permit \n     or\n\n[[Page S13340]]\n\n     other authorization is required, securing such a permit or \n     other authorization, issued in compliance with any applicable \n     law, including requirements of Title V of FLPMA and the \n     National Environmental Policy Act. In the event a permit is \n     deemed necessary, the Department will make its best effort to \n     process requests for access under Title V of FLPMA promptly \n     and cooperatively.\n       7. In order to facilitate the Acknowledgment Process in \n     Utah, the Department hereby declares that the requirements \n     for determinations under the ``Interim Departmental Policy on \n     Revised Statute 2477 Grant of Right-of-Way for Public \n     Highways; Revocation of December 7, 1988 Policy,'' dated \n     January 22, 1997, shall be inapplicable to acknowledgment \n     requests submitted in accordance with this MOU. While the \n     1997 Interim Policy shall still apply to all other requests \n     for right-of-way acknowledgment that are not submitted \n     pursuant to this MOU, the Department recognizes that other \n     interested states and counties may wish to submit proposed \n     MOU's for consideration by the Department that are generally \n     consistent with the principles set out in this agreement.\n       8. The State, Utah counties and the Department shall work \n     cooperatively to minimize trespass situations on roads that \n     are outside the scope of this MOU.\n       9. It is understood that the State and counties have \n     evidence regarding the existence of many roads, including \n     those in which they assert no ownership interest. They may \n     choose to use this evidence for other purposes, such as to \n     illustrate whether the land through which the roads run have \n     wilderness-like characteristics or resource values. The \n     Acknowledgment Process will take place independently and \n     without prejudice to any other use of this evidence or other \n     valid existing rights, if any.\n       10. After submitting a road to the Acknowledgment Process, \n     the State or a county may withdraw it from consideration at \n     any time prior to the actual recording of the disclaimer \n     issued by the Department, for any reason, without prejudice. \n     The submission of a road to the Acknowledgment Process does \n     not prejudice the State's or a county's valid existing rights \n     regarding that road under the law.\n       11. The Department shall execute any implementing \n     agreements with the State of Utah or Economy Act agreements \n     as appropriate with other federal agencies, as required by \n     applicable statutes and regulations, when effectuating the \n     purposes of this MOU.\n       12. Activities under this MOU and any implementing \n     agreements shall be conducted in accordance with mutually-\n     agreed upon plans for the classification of information by \n     the State, for the review and release of information, and for \n     cooperation in the preparation of any and all reports to \n     Congress. The release of any information by the Department \n     under this MOU will be in accordance with applicable statutes \n     and regulations.\n       13. Any expenditure of appropriated funds by the Department \n     will be developed in specific agreements authorized by \n     applicable statutes and regulations and is subject to the \n     availability of funds. This MOU shall not be used to obligate \n     or commit funds or as the basis for the transfer of funds.\n       14. This MOU shall not be construed as creating any right \n     or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or \n     in equity, by a party against the State of Utah, Utah \n     counties, the United States, it agencies, its officers, or \n     any other person. This MOU shall not be construed to create \n     any right to judicial review involving the compliance or \n     noncompliance of the State of Utah, Utah counties, the United \n     States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person with \n     the provisions of this MOU.\n\n     Signed 4-9-03\n     Gale A.

Will the Senator from Utah yield briefly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Utah be \ngiven 1 additional minute and he yield it to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am less familiar with Governor Leavitt's \nenvironmental record in Utah than is our colleague Senator Hatch. I \nhave known him for more than a decade. We became Governors together in \nthe same year. We were elected in 1992. We know him. We know his \nfamily.\n  I know him to be a thoughtful, decent, caring human being. He is a \ngood manager and a good leader of his State. He has also been a great \nleader of our Nation's Governors.\n  I was privileged to serve as Chair of the National Association of \nGovernors at the time he was Vice Chair. He succeeded me as Chair. He \nis very bright and surrounds himself with excellent people. But what I \nlike best is he is very good at bringing together people with diverse \npoints of view, trying to build consensus. We need that in a lot of \nareas in our Nation's Capitol these days, and we especially need it \nwith respect to environmental issues. I look forward to voting for his \nnomination and working with him if he is confirmed.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague from Delaware. His comments speak \nvolumes as to why we should support Governor Leavitt. I am particularly \npleased and grateful for his support in this matter, as I am for the \nsupport of the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the Senate will proceed to a vote on confirmation of the \nnomination. The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Michael O. Leavitt to be Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S13341]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the Senator from \nIdaho. It has been a pleasure for me to work with him on this issue. I \nthink we have been working now for close to 3 years, beginning with the \nQuincy Library Group in California to try to forge a different forest \npolicy, and also to recognize that our forests are overburdened with \nundergrowth, with non-indigenous species; and so fires, when they \nhappen, burn hotter and do much more destruction than they have done \nhistorically.\n  I thank the Senator for his sympathy for what our State is going \nthrough. I want to tell you that I just spoke with the White House, \nwith Mr. Rove, because I had heard from Mr. Blackwell, the regional \nforester, that the forest fire has taken a turn, because the winds have \nchanged, and is now heading for half a million acres of bark beetle-\ninfested forests near Lake Arrowhead and 44,000 homes are now in \njeopardy.\n  This is just huge. I hope that anyone listening will begin to bring \nin some military help, more C-130s. With the winds down, the C-130s can \nwork. Perhaps this area can be worked from the air. But the fire is \nadvancing so strongly and also like a spear into San Diego itself, and \nover the Santa Monica mountains into Malibu. So we have a real \nmaelstrom on our hands.\n  We think we have a good bill. We believe we have the only bill that \ncan be accepted by this body, and I am hopeful that the leadership will \nbring this bill to the floor very shortly. I think we need to put \neverything aside and just get a bill passed.\n  The Senator is right about streamlining the administrative review \nprocess. Our bill does that. It does so in a way that it does not \nprevent collaboration, does not prevent public testimony, but it \nstreamlines the process.\n  I think we have handled judicial review in a way that we can agree \nmakes it truncated; temporary injunction, 60 days, and if you want \nanother, you have to come back and justify it. It is the Federal court \nin the area of the project. We have the first old-growth protection \nwhich will be codified in the history of this country.\n  It is a good bill. I hope that those who might want to place \namendments on this bill will really not do so, so we can pass a bill \nand get it moved on so the 20 million acres that are in this bill, \nwhich we know are at the highest risk of catastrophic fire, can be \ndealt with quickly.\n  The Senator and I have talked. The Appropriations Committee has been \nhelpful in getting additional dollars for bark beetle infestation. But \nfor 3 years now, we have known this was going to happen. The day is \nupon us and we must do right by our forests. So I am very grateful for \nthe Senator's help and collaboration on this.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from California. She has been a full \ncooperative partner in working in a bipartisan way. She has outlined \nmany of the provisions in the bill that have been worked out between \nthe Agriculture Committee, the chairman, Mike Crapo, Senator Domenici, \nBlanche Lincoln, and a good many others. It was a collaborative, \nbipartisan effort.\n  I agree that this is a bill that should be on the floor as we speak. \nIt should not be amended. There are a lot of other bills that will come \nand other issues that can be addressed.\n  But California is facing its worst nightmare as we speak in the form \nof fire. The reality of what the Senator spoke to in the San Bernardino \nForest in the Greater Lake Arrowhead area is truly a firestorm of great \nproportions, and we hope the winds will die down and shift and they \nwill come in off the ocean and bring moisture and lift the dewpoint and \nlower the fires. That isn't happening as we speak. Quite the opposite \nis happening, as we play out the Santa Ana and get through this season.\n  But in the meantime, the destruction is now almost immeasurable. You \nsee it on the faces of the people being interviewed. Maybe America \nfinally recognized it when San Diego could not play football in their \nhome stadium. They had to move to Phoenix because they are using the \nparking lot as a staging area. Maybe America scratched its head a \nlittle and said: What is wrong with this? Should this be happening? No, \nit should not be--at least to the extent that it is.\n  The Senator from California is right that procedure can help lessen \nthe impact of the kind of fire scenario we are seeing. She and I have \nteamed up with our leadership and said let's debate this bill now on \nthe Senate floor and throughout the balance of the week, after we \nfinish foreign operations. We can do that. It should not take but a \nfull day of debate. A lot of issues ought to be talked about on this \nbill, and then we ought to pass it so America can see that the Congress \nof the United States is responsive when California is at risk to the \nproportion that it is today. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Idaho, also. I was just \ntalking to Representative Lewis. He indicated that two members of his \nfamily each lost their homes. I understand that Representative Duncan \nHunter also lost his home. So they join literally 1,500 families now \nwho are bereft, without housing, without their home. Really, everything \nthey have built is just gone. Now we find that there are another 44,000 \nhomes in jeopardy. So I very much appreciate the comments of the \nSenator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1977\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up amendment No. 1977.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Ms. Snowe, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1977.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the definition of HIV/AIDS prevention for purposes \n            of providing funds for therapeutic medical care)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. XX. For purposes of section 403(a) of the United \n     States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \n     Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673(a)) the term ``HIV/AIDS \n     prevention'' means only those programs and activities that \n     are directed at preventing the sexual transmission of HIV/\n     AIDS, and activities that include a priority emphasis on the \n     public health benefits of refraining from sexual activity \n     before marriage shall be included in determining compliance \n     with the last sentence of such section 403(a).\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nSnowe and Senator Murray as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe fiscal 2004 foreign operations bill to provide the administration \nwith greater flexibility in how it funds HIV/AIDS prevention programs.\n  We believe this amendment is critical to our efforts aimed at \nstopping the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus and providing a safe and \nhealthy future for millions of people around the world. Time is not on \nour side, and we must act now.\n\n  Our amendment does two things. First, it reserves at least one-third \nof the funds for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV rather than \none-third of all prevention funds for ``abstinence-until-marriage'' \nprograms. This recognizes that HIV prevention includes many types of \nactivities, and those that target the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS \nsuch as abstinence-until-marriage programs are really only a subset.\n  Second, our amendment defines an abstinence-until-marriage program as \nany program that includes, but is not necessarily limited to, providing \ninformation that emphasizes the public health benefits of refraining \nfrom sexual activity outside of marriage.\n  Earlier this year I was proud to join my colleagues in passing the \nUnited States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act \nof 2003. This is a historic piece of legislation that expressed our \nresolve to see the United States take a leadership role in the fight \nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The bill recognized that prevention, \nalong with care and treatment, is an essential component of that fight.\n\n[[Page S13342]]\n\n  The bill, as passed by both Houses and signed by President Bush, \ncontains language that recommends for fiscal year 2004 and 2005 that at \nleast one-third of all global HIV/AIDS prevention funds be set aside \nfor abstinence-before-marriage programs. This sense of the Senate \nprovision becomes a mandate for fiscal year 2004 through 2008. Our \namendment simply clarifies the congressional intent of this provision \nand increases the flexibility of how HIV/AIDS prevention funds are \nspent.\n  In order to fulfill our goal of stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS, we \nshould not tie the hands of workers on the ground by limiting the use \nof HIV/AIDS prevention funds. A brief glance at some of the numbers \nrelated to the HIV pandemic demonstrates the importance of funding a \nwide range of prevention activities.\n  Worldwide, 40 million people--that is huge--are infected with HIV; \n29.4 million people are infected in sub-Saharan Africa alone. That is \n70 percent of the world's total. As of 2001, 21.5 million Africans had \ndied of AIDS. That is 21.5 million Africans dead from AIDS. The \nnational intelligence council projects at least 50 million new cases of \nHIV by 2010 in five countries alone: China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, \nand Russia. Fifty million new cases in five countries. That is a huge \npandemic.\n  Currently fewer than 1 in 5 persons at risk for HIV/AIDS worldwide \nhave access to prevention. Yet UNAIDS and the World Health Organization \nhave conducted research that shows that two-thirds of the estimated 45 \nmillion new HIV infections expected to occur between now and 2010 could \nin fact be averted with effective prevention. Two-thirds of 45 million \nanticipated cases could be prevented. That is a very critical figure \nfor us to make use of.\n  Passing the global HIV/AIDS bill was an important first step to \nmeeting that challenge. Our amendment builds on that endeavor and \nincreases the effectiveness of the legislation.\n  Let me be clear. Our amendment does not strike the 33 percent earmark \nfor abstinence-until-marriage programs. It simply expands the \ndefinition of abstinence-until-marriage and gives the administration \nmaximum flexibility to fund programs that successfully increase \nabstinence among young people. The key word is ``successful.'' All \nSenators, including myself, know that abstinence is a key strategy in \npreventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, and the importance we place on those \nprograms is reflected in the legislation. What we are trying to do--and \nI am trying to do--is give the administration and the people on the \nground the flexibility needed to design HIV prevention programs that \nmeet the needs of a given community.\n  Different programs work better in different communities. There is no \nreal one-size-fits-all program. A May 2003 report from the Bill and \nMelinda Gates Foundation and the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation highlights \nthat proven AIDS prevention programs involve behavior change programs, \nincluding delay in the initiation of sexual activity, faithfulness, \ncorrect and consistent condom use, testing and treatment for sexually \ntransmitted disease, promoting voluntary counseling and testing, harm \nreduction programs for HIV drug users, preventing the transmission of \nHIV/AIDS from mother to child, increasing blood safety, empowering \nwomen and girls, controlling infection in health care settings, and \ndevising programs geared toward people living with HIV/AIDS.\n  Let's take a closer look at one of these prevention programs: \npreventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child. We have seen \ngreat strides in recent years in this area. Studies have shown that \ncombining drugs such as Nevirapine with counseling and instruction on \nthe use of such drugs reduces mother-to-child transmission by 50 \npercent. And we have tens of millions of AIDS orphans in Africa alone. \nSo it is a really important program.\n  Such cost-effective prevention programs are not related to abstinence \nand should not be constrained by the 33 percent earmark in funds for \nprevention. Our amendment will allow local communities to spend money \non HIV prevention that is most effective in that community. If the most \neffective program in a community is the promotion of abstinence until \nmarriage, my amendment will not preclude funding for such a program.\n  Ensuring that the earmark applies only to programs related to \npreventing the sexual transmission of HIV would free up additional \nresources for non-abstinence programs while at the same time \nmaintaining the importance of abstinence-until-marriage activities. In \nfact, my amendment would not prevent the United States from spending \nmore than one-third of funds for the prevention of the sexual \ntransmission of HIV on abstinence-until-marriage programs if the \nadministration decided that was the most effective use of those funds.\n  We believe the United States should have the flexibility to fund \nprograms that are successful in leading to increased abstinence.\n  In response to a letter I wrote to Assistant Secretary of State for \nLegislative Affairs, Paul V. Kelly inquiring about the definition of an \n``abstinence-until-marriage'' program, Secretary Kelly responded:\n\n       Achieving the HIV/AIDS prevention goals of the President's \n     Emergency Plan will require a comprehensive and sustainable \n     approach recognized by both the Plan and the law. The ``ABC'' \n     model [Abstain, Be faithful, Use condoms], has been used \n     successfully to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission in Uganda as \n     well as Zambia and Ethiopia. These successes show that \n     promoting behavior change and healthy lifestyles, including \n     abstinence and delayed sexual initiation, mutual monogamy, \n     faithfulness and fidelity in marriage and reduction in the \n     number of partners, consistent and correct use of condoms, \n     and avoidance of substance abuse, are successful in \n     preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\n  This tells me that this administration understands that the most \neffective way to prevent HIV is a multipronged approach. We should be \nable to fund programs that place a priority emphasis on abstinence but \nalso discuss other methods as outlined under the ABC approach.\n  For example, the United States Agency for International Development \nhas sponsored Zambia's HEART, Helping Each Other Act Responsibly \nTogether, HIV/AIDS prevention program, a mass media campaign that \npromotes HIV/AIDS prevention through messages about abstinence, \nconsistent condom use, and the fact that ``you can't tell by looking'' \nif another person is HIV-positive.\n  A 2001 impact survey of youth aged 13 to 19 found that many of the \nrespondents chose to remain abstinent because of the campaign. In fact, \nrespondents were more likely to report that they chose to abstain than \nto report condom use. This confirms what I have long believed: if young \npeople are given the necessary information and education, they will \nmake an informed and health decision regarding their sexual activity.\n  If programs like the HEART program in Zambia are successful in \nincreasing abstinence, we should not turn our back on them or limit the \namount of resources available because they discuss multiple prevention \nstrategies.\n  Again, this amendment is about giving our Government and other \ncountries the flexibility to get the job done.\n  Cultural differences, epidemiology, population age groups, and the \nstage of the epidemic in a given community will all play roles in how \nan effective HIV/AIDS prevention program is designed.\n  This amendment is pro-abstinence, it recognizes that there is more to \npreventing the spread of HIV/AIDS than preventing the sexual \ntransmission of HIV, it balances congressional priorities with public \nhealth needs, and it preserves the administration's flexibility in \ndeciding which programs to fund that would be most likely to increase \nabstinence.\n  It is a commonsense amendment and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I thank Senators Snowe and Murray for cosponsoring this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Feinstein and myself to clarify the funding under \nthe United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \nAct of 2003.\n   As my colleagues will remember, we stayed on the floor late into the \nnight to pass that bill, and we did so in a bipartisan manner, without \namendment, because of the critical importance of providing the \nPresident with a bill before he attended the G-8 Summit in Evian, \nFrance. In doing so, we sent the President to the G-8 with the firm\n\n[[Page S13343]]\n\ncommitment and resolve of the United States to tackle the global AIDS \ncrisis.\n   This clarification was not made in May, because of the fact that \nthere was no time to conference any changes from the House-passed bill. \nI believe we did the right thing by sending that bill to the President \nwhen we did, but as we address issues today related to funding that \ncommitment, I believe we have a responsibility to address this \nclarification.\n   This amendment recognizes prevention--along with care and \ntreatment--as essential to stemming the AIDS epidemic and supports a \nmultiplicity of HIV prevention strategies. HIV prevention must include \nmany types of activities, of which prevention activities targeting \nsexual transmission are only a subset.\n   The amendment is consistent with the intent of the bill by reserving \nat least one-third of the funds for the prevention of the sexual \ntransmission of HIV for ``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs--\notherwise known as ``abstinence only.'' Ensuring that one-third of \nprevention funds, instead of one-third of all funds, are used for these \n``abstinence only'' programs preserves the funding for multilayered \napproaches which have been most effective in combating HIV \ntransmission. It is also important to note that the amendment takes \ninto account the fact that there are many ways to succeed in changing \nthe behavior of young people so that they abstain, including programs \nthat emphasize the health benefits of refraining from sexual activity \nbefore marriage, and ensures that these programs can benefit from this \nfunding.\n\n  This clarification reinforces the notion that encouraging programs \nthat educate about abstinence and delayed sexual initiation is a key \nstrategy in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Strategies that include \nencouraging the delay in the initiation of sexual activity, \nfaithfulness as well as consistent and correct condom use have had the \nhighest rate of prevention of HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa. \nAccording to the May 2003 report from the Bill and Melinda Gates \nFoundation and Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, we need to develop a \nmultilayered approach that combines those types of programs with \ntesting and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, promoting \nvoluntary counseling and testing, harm-reduction programs for IV drug \nusers, preventing mother to child transmission, increasing blood \nsafety, and controlling infection in health care settings.\n  This amendment supports the intent of the United States Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 by ensuring that \nfunds are targeted to the programs that are the most effective, while \nbalancing the priorities on spending these resources. The amendment \nalso preserves the President's flexibility in determining which \nprograms will be supported.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment provides the right approach \nto this critical issue and I urge my colleagues to support this \nclarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. I am very strongly supportive of the points she has made.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky. I think he and I totally agree that if Members \nhave amendments, they should get them to the floor and then we can \nbegin voting on them. Traditionally, we break at 12:30 for the \nRepublican and Democratic caucuses. I would like to get a vote before \nthen. I do not know what the situation is on the Feinstein amendment. I \nask my friend from Kentucky whether that is something on which we might \nvote. There has not been a chance for someone on the other side to \nspeak as of yet.\n  I think what we need to do, if we can, and before I yield the floor, \nis make this plea on our side of the aisle--and I suspect the same one \nwill be made on the other side--that if Members have amendments, bring \nthem and see either Senator McConnell or myself. If they are going to \nrequire a rollcall, we can enter into some time agreements.\n  Senator McConnell and I have some housekeeping amendments which we \ncan dispose of by voice vote, but let's get these others with a time \nagreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I certainly concur with my friend from \nVermont. We hope to finish this bill today. We believe we can. There \nare not a large number of amendments on each side.\n  With regard to Senator Feinstein's amendment, we are taking a look at \nthat now and hope to be able to react soon about moving that one \nforward as well. If everyone would share our view that it might be \ndesirable to finish this bill today, the way to get that done is to \ntalk to Senator Leahy and myself about amendments. We are open for \nbusiness and would love to sit down with Members and talk about their \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator \nfrom Vermont for their comments. I very much appreciate them.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are now about a month behind time in \ngetting a number of the appropriations bills through. Senator McConnell \nand I worked very hard on this bill. I think we have crafted good, \nbipartisan legislation. Unlike some of the things that happen around \nhere, this has had strong input from both sides of the aisle. It would \nbe a shame if there were so many delays it became part of an omnibus--\nor, as some more accurately describe, an ``ominous''--appropriations \nbill.\n  This bill, as much as anything, can reflect the real nature of \nAmerica. We are the wealthiest, most powerful nation on Earth. There \nare so many things we can do and should do even better. It requires \npennies per person, for example, to remove the threat of measles, \ndiphtheria, and other diseases in Africa and elsewhere, diseases that \nkill millions of children.\n  I do not doubt that if anybody in this body were told, ``Look at \nthese 20 children; if they will give us $2 or $3, we will save their \nlives; if they do not, the children are going to die,'' of course we \nwould reach in our pocket and say: ``How about some money for others?''\n  We do have some money for that. It is nowhere near as much as a \nwealthy nation such as ours should have, but it is a start. That is \njust one of the things that is in the bill on which we should move \nforward.\n  There will be those who will try to bring the amount on AIDS \nprevention up to the amount the President of the United States has \npromised over and over again in speeches. We will be supportive and try \nto bring it up to that amount. I hope the administration will support \nus as we try to support what the President has said he wants.\n  There are so many other areas. There is money in there to help the \nvictims of landmines. There are still millions of landmines in the \nground all over the world. The Leahy War Victims Fund that is in here \nis designed to help them. That is a bipartisan effort.\n\n  I say that, not to go down through a litany of everything that is in \nthis piece of legislation, because I would much prefer people come \nforward and raise their amendments and have them voted on. We, as \nSenator McConnell said, can finish this bill today. We can finish by \nearly evening with cooperation. After 29 years here, I know what \nhappens to a bill such as this. It is almost like pulling teeth to get \npeople to the floor now. At about 5 or 6 at night, people are here \nsaying, My gosh, I have to go to this; I have to go to that; can't you \nput this over to tomorrow?\n  I know we have time agreements. Now is the time to do it. The \nMcConnell-Leahy store is open. Come by and do your shopping. Let us \ntalk. Let us reason together. Let us seek prayerful guidance under the \nbenevolent tutelage of the distinguished Presiding Officer, and let us \nget this bill off and get it voted through. The final package is going \nto pass overwhelmingly. Let's get the amendments done.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S13344]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As of October 2003, there are 13,000,000 refugees \n     worldwide, many of whom have fled religious, political, and \n     other forms of persecution.\n       (2) Refugee resettlement remains a critical tool of \n     international refugee protection and an essential component \n     of the humanitarian and foreign policy of the United States.\n       (3) Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the \n     President designates, in a Presidential Determination, a \n     target number of refugees to be admitted to the United States \n     under the United States Refugee Resettlement Program.\n       (4) Although the President authorized the admission of \n     70,000 refugees in fiscal year 2003, only 28,419 refugees \n     were admitted.\n       (5) From fiscal year 1980 to fiscal year 2000, the average \n     level of U.S. refugee admissions was slightly below 100,000 \n     per year.\n       (6) The United States Government policy is to resettle the \n     designated number of refugees each fiscal year. Congress \n     expects the Department of State, the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services to \n     implement the admission of 70,000 refugees as authorized by \n     the President for fiscal year 2004.\n       (b)(1) The Secretary of State shall utilize private \n     voluntary organizations with expertise in the protection \n     needs of refugees in the processing of refugees overseas for \n     admission and resettlement to the United States, and shall \n     utilize such agencies in addition to the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees in the identification and referral \n     of refugees.\n       (2) The Secretary of State shall establish a system for \n     accepting referrals of appropriate candidates for \n     resettlement from local private, voluntary organizations and \n     work to ensure that particularly vulnerable refugee groups \n     receive special consideration for admission into the United \n     States, including--\n       (A) long-stayers in countries of first asylum;\n       (B) unaccompanied refugee minors;\n       (C) refugees outside traditional camp settings; and\n       (D) refugees in woman-headed households.\n       (3) The Secretary of State shall give special consideration \n     to--\n       (A) refugees of all nationalities who have close family \n     ties to citizens and residents of the United States; and\n       (B) other groups of refugees who are of special concern to \n     the United States.\n       (4) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees describing the steps \n     that have been taken to implement this subsection.\n       (c) Not later than September 30, 2004, if the actual \n     refugee admissions numbers do not conform with the authorized \n     ceiling on the number of refugees who may be admitted, the \n     Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall report to \n     Congress on the--\n       (1) execution and implementation of the refugee \n     resettlement program; and\n       (2) reasons for the failure to resettle the maximum number \n     of refugees.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1982\n\n       On page 75, line 17, after ``Afghan'' insert the following: \n     ``Independent''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1983\n\n       On page 35, line 10, after the semi-colon, insert ``and''.\n       Page 35, line 12, strike ``; (3)'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``: Provided further, That such funds \n     may not be made available unless the Secretary of State \n     certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that''.\n       On page 35, line 15, strike ``; and'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``: Provided further, That''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1984\n\n       On page 105, line 25, strike ``180 days'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof the following: ``one year''.\n       On page 106, line 3, strike ``nongovernmental'' and \n     everything that follows through ``plan'' on line 6, and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following: ``governments and \n     nongovernmental organizations, shall submit to the Committees \n     on Appropriations a strategy''.\n       On page 106, line 10, strike ``$10,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof the following: ``$5,000,000''.\n       On page 106, line 11, strike ``implement the action plan'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof the following: ``develop the \n     strategy''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1985\n\n       On page 87, line 23, strike ``That in'' and everything \n     thereafter through ``subsection'' on line 24, and insert in \n     lieu thereof the following: ``That the application of section \n     507(4)(D) and (E) of such Act''.\n       On page 87, line 26, strike ``the'' and everything \n     thereafter through ``subsection'' on page 88, line 1, and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following: ``and''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1986\n\n       On page 20, line 9, before the colon, insert the following: \n     ``, of which up to $1,000,000 may be available for \n     administrative expenses of the United States Agency for \n     International Development''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1987\n\n       On page 34, line 17, strike ``$2,500,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof: ``$3,500,000''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1988\n\n  (Purpose: To withhold funds for foreign assistance for nations that \n               refuse to pay diplomatic parking tickets)\n\n       Beginning on page 98, strike line 24 and all that follows \n     through page 99, line 10 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 644.

Senator \nLeahy has four technical amendments and one providing funds for \nadministrative expenses for USAID in the Democratic Republic of Timor-\nLeste; another Leahy amendment increasing funding for Colombian-United \nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights; and a Schumer amendment \nwithholding funds for nations that refuse to pay diplomatic parking \ntickets.\n  That is the summary of the amendments that are at the desk. As I have \nindicated, they have been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand I am a cosponsor of Senator \nBrownback's refugee amendment. If not, I should be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have no objection. These are all cleared \non our side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendments are agreed to en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1978 through 1988), were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to this \nforeign operations bill cosponsored by Senators Brownback, Kennedy, and \nLeahy that will help persecuted refugees across the world.\n  I think this amendment will enhance our Nation's commitment to \nhumanitarian principles.\n  In 1990, Congress passed what has become known as the ``Lautenberg \namendment,'' a provision that has allowed nearly 700,000 persecuted \nreligious minorities to come to the United States.\n  These individuals have qualified for refugee status based on their \nmembership in an ethnic, religious, or national minority facing a \ncredible threat of state-enforced persecution.\n  In 1998, I traveled to the Balkans to visit ethnic Albanians Kosovars \nwho had fled their homes in the face of the brutal rampage of Slobodan \nMilosovic. Many of these refugees eventually came to the United States, \nand I was proud to greet them at Fort Dix in New Jersey.\n  Today, I continue to believe that the United States, as a prosperous \nglobal leader, has a special responsibility to those who have been \ndisplaced because of political conflict or those who are threatened by \nethnic, racial, or religious persecution.\n  The amendment we included in this bill today reflects our serious \nconcern about the low number of refugees currently gaining entrance to \nthe U.S.\n  Each year, the President designates a maximum number of refugees to \nbe admitted under the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program. It is then up \nto various Government agencies to find and process those refugees who \nare eligible and to help them gain admission to the U.S.\n  However, in the past few years, the annual number of admitted \nrefugees has been dramatically lower than ceiling set by the President. \nIn fiscal year 2003, for example, the U.S. admitted only 28,419 \nrefugees, though the limit had been set at 70,000.\n  With 13 million refugees worldwide, it is unconscionable that the \nU.S. cannot offer admission to the full number of individuals legally \nauthorized.\n  There are various reasons for the shortfall in refugees admitted to \nthe U.S. It is extremely demanding on our foreign service officers \nabroad to find and process each refugee applicant. The amendment agreed \nto today attempts to improve this process by directing the Department \nof State to reach out to international non-profit organizations and \nprivate voluntary organizations to help identify refugee applicants.\n  Our amendment also urges the Secretary of State to prioritize those \nrefugees who are most in need, so we can ensure that humanitarian \nconsiderations not political ones determine the order of the waiting \nlist for entry.\n  There is a refugee crisis in the world, and this nation must play a \nrole in trying to solve this crisis. On the African continent alone, \nsome 45 countries host over 3.3 million refugees. These numbers are \ngrowing as the accelerating violence in West Africa continues to uproot \nthousands from their homes.\n  Current civil conflicts in Liberia, the Congo and elsewhere suggest \nthat the number of refugees will increase in the coming months.\n  I thank my colleagues for remaining committed to helping victims of \noppression, war and persecution across the world. As a child of \nimmigrants, I believe that our country's history and values instruct us \nto continue welcoming in the ``tired, the poor, and the huddled \nmasses.''\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1989\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there are three additional amendments \nthat have been cleared which we would like to act on individually.\n  There is a Craig amendment regarding reforestation in Afghanistan. I \ncommend Senator Craig for recognizing a problem that we solved while we \nwere in Afghanistan 2 weeks ago, which is the country has stripped a \nhuge percentage of its trees. As a result of that, there is enormous \nerosion that they would not have otherwise had.\n  Senator Craig knows a good deal about reforestation. He jumped on \nthat and has offered this very worthwhile amendment which would \nappropriate $5 million for a reforestation program in Afghanistan. I \nknow Senator Craig is hoping this fund will be something like a \nchallenge grant in which corporations and individuals in America and \nfoundations in America that have an interest in reforestation would \ncontribute knowing that at least up to $5 million of that money will be \nmatched by the these USAID funds.\n  It is a very worthwhile project. I commend Senator Craig for \nrecognizing this and coming up with a way to begin to deal with a huge \nproblem related to the rebuilding of Afghanistan.\n  I send the Craig amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Craig, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1989.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might be \nlisted as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n\n[[Page S13346]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 1989) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, finally I send an amendment by Senator \nLeahy and myself to the desk which provides assistance to the Ibn \nKhaldun Center for Development in Egypt related to democracy building.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 1991.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide assistance for the Ibn Khaldun Center for \n                         Development in Egypt)\n\n       On page 17, line 17, after the colon insert the following:\n       Provided further, That of the funds made available pursuant \n     to the previous proviso, $2,000,000 shall be made available \n     for the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development:\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer an amendment--\ncosponsored by the ranking member of the subcommittee--that provides $2 \nmillion for the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development in Egypt.\n  The Center is directed by Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a vocal champion of \nhuman rights and democracy in Egypt. My colleagues may remember that \nDr. Ibrahim was arrested on June 30, 2000, on charges that included \ndefaming the country's image. Many in Cairo and abroad believe that Dr. \nIbrahim's arrest was a direct response by the Egyptian Government to \nhis investigations into discrimination against the country's Coptic \nChristian minority and parliamentary fraud.\n  Dr. Ibrahim spent several years in jail and was finally acquitted \nthis spring after a second retrial. However, imprisonment neither \ndulled his desire for democracy, justice or human rights in Egypt nor \nhis passion for pursuing these fundamental rights in the face of \nrepression from the authoritarian Egyptian government.\n  In fact, when my staff visited Dr. Ibrahim in prison almost 2 years \nago he was just as feisty in support of democracy for Egypt as when he \npassed through Washington a few short months ago.\n  Given Dr. Ibrahim's noble cause, the amendment provides funding for \nthe center for core support and programmatic activities that promote \ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights in Egypt.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which underscores \nthat an important front in the war on terrorism includes the pursuit of \nfreedom, democratic institutions, the rule of law and human rights in \ncountries throughout the Middle East.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1991) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Sessions is here and I am \nprepared to offer an amendment. Therefore, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1993\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I spoke last night about my concern over \nour inadequate attention given to the substantial problem of health \ncare transmission of AIDS in Africa. As part of this bill, we are \nmoving forward with a $15 billion program to deal with AIDS in Africa.\n  Some of the agencies involved have been too slow, frankly, to \nrecognize how significant the transmission of AIDS is in Africa as a \nresult of medical transmissions. It occurs in two primary ways. One, \nthroughout Africa they are reusing needles for injections. When people \ncome in, they are given shots. There is one story of an elementary \nclassroom where all were injected with an immunization using the same \nneedle, something we would not tolerate in America.\n  As a matter of fact, we have taken extraordinary steps to make sure \nthat no one in America who goes to a physician or doctor or hospital or \nclinic comes home infected with AIDS. We did that with the Ryan White \nAct. We dealt with hemophiliacs who have blood transfusions. We knew \nthat was a major cause of the transmission of AIDS. We stopped that. We \ntest all blood. We know it is clean or we will not allow it to be \ninjected in someone's body.\n  That is not true now in Africa. Twenty-five percent of the blood in \nAfrica is transfused without being tested.\n  We also know that in some countries in Africa as much as 40 percent \nof the adults have the HIV virus. We know that many more transfusions \ntake place in Africa than in the United States. You would be surprised \nto know that; most people would. Diseases such as malaria cause anemia, \nand frequently physicians utilize transfusions to deal with that.\n  They have other problems that lead to the need for transfusions. Many \nmore transfusions take place in Africa. Many more injections take place \nin Africa, surprisingly. We find that when people go to the doctor in \nAfrica, they can receive a pill, but they tend to get a shot for \nwhatever their problem is. We believe at least as much as 40 percent of \nthe injections in Africa are unnecessary. Perhaps even more of the \ntransfusions are unnecessary. But in addition to being unnecessary, \nthey are highly risky.\n  That is the problem. When you reuse a needle, you put patients at \nrisk. In America, we have gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure \nour blood is clean and our needles are clean. In addition, we have gone \nto great lengths to make sure that health care workers, through \naccidents, won't prick themselves with a needle that might be \ncontaminated. Remember, we have only about a 1 percent infection rate \nin the United States, whereas in Africa it is much larger throughout \nthe continent.\n  We have numbers from a study in South Africa that between ages 2 and \n15, there are 670,000 children infected with HIV. Studies have shown \nthat some of their mothers are not infected with HIV. How did they get \nit? This is not a sexually caused problem for most of them. This is a \nproblem caused, I am afraid, from unsafe health care practices.\n  Senator Leahy knows Holly Burkhalter of Physicians for Human Rights. \nThey have been dealing with this issue for some time. They have \nconcluded that it may be the single most significant act we can take to \nprevent AIDS in the short term in the world.\n  We have also discovered that it would take only a relatively small \nportion of the $15 billion to fix it, the combination of testing and \ncertifying that every transfusion is done with blood that is clean and \nsafe. You take every injection in Africa, even some that are\n\n[[Page S13347]]\n\nunnecessary, but every injection in Africa, if you examined all of \nthose and gave a free and clean non-reusable needle for every injection \nin Africa, we are talking about less than $100 million, really about \n$75 million. That is what it would take. We are going to be spending $3 \nbillion a year in Africa on AIDS over the next 5 years.\n\n  There has been some dispute over how much of HIV is caused by medical \ntransmissions. The WHO says the number is 10 percent. They say that \nblood transfusions are 5 to 10 percent. They also say that needles \naccount for 2.5 percent.\n  I have conducted two hearings before the Health, Education Labor and \nPensions Committee, of which Senator Enzi, the Presiding Officer, is an \nable member. We have taken the best witnesses we could get. Dr. \nGisselquist and others who are familiar with the issues have testified. \nI have become more convinced than ever that those numbers are \nconservative. But at the 10-percent number, the numbers come in at \n250,000 to 450,000 infections per year from health care in Africa.\n  Imagine that: 250,000 to 450,000 human beings, many of them children, \nmany of them infants, going to the doctor to get health care, to get a \nshot, coming home infected with a disease that will lead to their early \ndeath.\n  Because it is a matter of such colossal error, we need to confront \nit, and we can. We can do so much better. I will be offering an \namendment to urge that we earmark at least $75 million to fix the \nproblem. I believe in very short order we can completely fix it. There \nis no excuse for any blood in Africa being used that had not been \ntested. Seventy-five percent of it is tested now. Why don't we go the \nrest of the way? Do you think that is not a large number, the 25 \npercent? It is a tremendous number.\n  Particularly, women who go for transfusions after birth or because of \nmalaria and anemia, those kinds of conditions, are the ones causing the \ntransfusions. They are coming home with AIDS, and they are dying.\n  These numbers don't consider the fact that people who have been \ninfected by a health care injection or transfusion can go out and \ninfect others, their spouses, or other people. It creates a cycle of \ngrowth in the spread of AIDS that is unacceptable.\n  Dr. Gisselquist says the numbers should be declining in Africa today. \nThey are not. The only explanation for the failure of the numbers of \ninfections in Africa to decline, in his view, is medical transmissions. \nHe has studied every study of this issue that has ever been done in \nAfrica. From that, he considers it as high as 30 percent, three times \nthe number I mentioned before, three times that number. And on the WHO \nnumbers, we are talking about 1,000 infections per day, a number that \ncan be fixed.\n  It is time for us to ensure, as part of this bill, that the people \nwho are running our AIDS program for the United States and the world \nunderstand we expect them to confront the medical transmission issue.\n  The good news is, the great news is that we can bring these \npercentages to virtually zero. We can stop 1,000 to 2,000 infections \nper day. We can take it to zero and eliminate this problem for less \nthan $100 million a year.\n  I say let's do it. We need to have a sense of urgency. Mr. Tobias, \nheading this effort, needs to have a sense of absolute urgency. This \nhas been talked about for years.\n  Last night I had a chart that depicted a headline article in the San \nFrancisco Chronicle, dated October 27, 1998--5 years ago yesterday--\ndetailing needles of death, talking about this very problem. Nothing \nhas been done about it. It will not undermine the effort to deal with \nthe sexual transmission of the disease and it will not, in my view, \nscare people from going to health care clinics to get treatment--the \nonly two excuses I have heard to date as to why we should not go \nforward.\n\n  I thank the Chair and Senator McConnell for his leadership in \nmanaging this bill and his willingness to listen to my concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is an excellent amendment that has \nbeen cleared on both sides of the aisle. It is an important \ncontribution. The Senator from Alabama is making an effort to combat \nthis plague, which is clearly the No. 1 public health problem in the \nworld today. I thank him for this important contribution.\n  Has the Senator sent the amendment to the desk?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1993.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require that a portion of the funds appropriated for the \nGlobal AIDS Initiative shall be made available for injection safety and \n                         blood safety programs)\n\n       On page 23, line 8, strike the period and insert ``: \n     Provided further, That of the funds appropriated under this \n     heading, not less than $29,000,000 shall be made available \n     for injection safety programs, including national planning, \n     the provision and international transport of nonreusable \n     autodisposable syringes or other safe injection equipment, \n     public education, training of health providers, waste \n     management, and publication of quantitative results: Provided \n     further, That of the funds appropriated under this heading, \n     not less than $46,000,000 shall be made available for blood \n     safety programs, including the establishment and support of \n     national blood services, the provision of rapid HIV test \n     kits, staff training, and quality assurance programs.''.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I see my friend from Vermont here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the Senator has done us all a \nservice with his amendment. I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nincluded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1966\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few moments on \nbehalf of an amendment that I believe is now pending, offered by \nSenator DeWine and myself relative to global AIDS.\n  I thank Senator Mike DeWine for his amazing leadership on public \nhealth issues, particularly relating to the Third World. Most of my \ncolleagues are not aware of the commitment Senator DeWine and his wife \nFran have made to the island of Haiti, which they have visited, as I \nunderstand, 15 different times. I was fortunate to join him on one of \nthose trips a few months back and to meet with some of the poorest \npeople in the world, who happen to live in our backyard. They are \nsuffering from the worst conditions you can imagine and, sadly, also \nbeing devastated by their own AIDS epidemic.\n  Senator DeWine has, through his family and friends, politically \ncommitted himself to the people of Haiti. I believe this amendment he \noffers today is consistent with that commitment. That is why I am \nhonored to be his cosponsor on this amendment relative to global AIDS, \nwhich takes an important step forward in meeting a pledge America has \nmade.\n  Senator DeWine said Friday, when he introduced our amendment, this is \nclearly the right thing to do. If we want to put this into perspective, \nour headlines every day focus on the war on terrorism and the situation \nin Iraq, as they should; but Secretary of State Colin Powell very \neloquently told the U.N. a few days ago what his perspective was. I \nwill quote that:\n\n       AIDS is more devastating than any terrorist attack, any \n     conflict or any weapon of mass destruction.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       It kills indiscriminately, and without mercy. As cruel as \n     any tyrant, the virus can crush the human spirit. It is an \n     insidious and relentless foe. AIDS shatters families, tears\n\n[[Page S13348]]\n\n     the fabric of societies, and undermines governments. AIDS can \n     destroy countries and destabilize entire regions.\n\n  That is what Secretary of State Colin Powell said to the U.N. I think \nit is an appropriate introduction in the consideration of this \nimportant amendment. This is becoming the worst plague the world has \never seen. Imagine those words for a moment, when we consider the \nplagues throughout the history of the world. Already, 25 million people \nhave been killed by HIV/AIDS. Eight thousand people die from AIDS every \nday--that is 8,000 mothers, fathers, and children. Today, another 42 \nmillion people around the world face a death sentence from AIDS because \nthey have no access to treatment. It can cost as little as a dollar a \nday.\n  As parents die, 14 million AIDS orphans have been left without the \ncare and support they need. Unless we act soon, there will be 25 \nmillion AIDS orphans by the end of the decade.\n  Reflect for a moment on the scenes that we have seen in Liberia and \nother parts of Africa, where we find children carrying automatic \nweapons, hell-bent on violence and destruction--children who, frankly, \nhave no parental supervision for a variety of reasons, but increasingly \nbecause their parents have died from the AIDS epidemic. The boys become \npredatory with these guns, destabilizing villages, societies, and \ngovernments, threatening violence on people in a wanton fashion. The \ngirls, these AIDS orphans, sadly without education and support, many \ntimes turn to prostitution, perpetuating the cycle of infection which \nwill then, of course, not only claim their lives but their children as \nwell. That is the cycle of AIDS as we know it today. To think of \norphans alone is a sad thought. To think as orphans as predators, or \norphans who are young girls who become submissive in societies and \nperpetuate sexual disease is to really take to heart the comments of \nSecretary of State Colin Powell.\n\n  Each year the world loses a population greater than the population of \nthe city of Chicago, which I represent. We lose a population greater \nthan that to AIDS. We know how to stop these deaths. It is not \nhopeless. For those who have given up and say this is God's verdict on \npeople who deserve it one way or another, they are not only wrong \nmorally, they are wrong medically.\n  According to the World Health Organization, 5 million to 6 million \nHIV-infected people in developing countries immediately need treatment. \nFewer than 1 percent of medically eligible people in Africa now have \naccess to treatment. Less than 1 percent have access to treatment \ntoday.\n  The World Health Organization declared AIDS an emergency and promised \nto treat 3 million people by 2005. It is not going to happen.\n  Current global spending on AIDS is now less than half of the bare-\nbones budget, $10.5 million, that is needed to reach this goal. We know \nwhat the goal should be. We have set the goal. America has joined in \nsetting it with the World Health Organization, and we are going to \nutterly fail in meeting this goal.\n  According to Global HIV Prevention Working Group, current prevention \nspending falls $3.8 billion short of what is needed by 2005. If we \nclose this prevention gap, if we meet the goals we have set--those of \nus in the West who are blessed with the best hospitals, doctors, and \ntechnology in the world--we can prevent 29 million to 45 million \ninfections by 2010.\n  As the CIA director, Mr. Tenet, recently said about AIDS:\n\n       Is this a security issue? You bet it is. With more than 40 \n     million people infected right now, a figure that--by 2010--\n     may reach 100 million, AIDS is building dangerous momentum in \n     regions beyond Africa.\n\n  As the disease spreads, it unravels social structures, decimates \npopulations, and destabilizes entire nations.\n  The National Intelligence Council found that in five of the world's \nmost populous nations, the number of HIV-infected people will grow to \nan estimated 50 million to 75 million by 2010. AIDS is particularly \ndevastating national armies around the world that ensure stability. In \nSouth Africa, according to the RAND Institute, some military units have \ninfection rates as high as 90 percent.\n  This amendment will add $289 million in funding to the battle against \nAIDS. The President pledged the U.S. would come forward with $15 \nbillion over 5 years. This Congress went on record saying we would \nspend $3 billion this year. The DeWine-Durbin amendment moves us to \n$2.4 billion. We are still not where we promised we would be. But we \nmust take this important step forward. I urge my colleagues to join me.\n  As Majority Leader Frist said so well:\n\n       History will judge whether a world led by America stood by \n     and let transpire one of the greatest destructions of human \n     life in recorded history--or performed one of its most heroic \n     rescues.\n\n  We can spare babies from AIDS. We can give mothers hope. We can give \nfamilies an opportunity to survive. I have been to Africa. I have met \nthese people. I have sat with them. I have cried with them over their \nplight in this world today. I have left feeling helpless and determined \nto come to this floor, as often as God gives me the strength to stand \nbehind this desk, and fight that we will have money in our budget to \nmeet the promise we have given to these poor people around the world.\n  No one else, no other nation, is as rich as the United States. No \nother nation has stepped forward with this massive commitment. The \nDeWine-Durbin amendment today moves us closer. We reached $2.4 billion. \nWe are still about $600 million short of what we promised. After this \namendment is considered, I will offer an amendment to make up that \ndifference.\n  I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, do what is right \ntoday, not only for the stability of the world but to give hope to \npeople around the world who wonder if anyone notices and anyone is \nlistening. We notice, we are listening, and the DeWine-Durbin \namendment, with so many cosponsors, will move us toward providing hope \nto these families for a future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \nthe noon recess be extended by 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for his \nvery fine statement and for his sponsorship of this amendment. This is \nthe third time my colleague and I have worked on an amendment on AIDS \nhelp for the people of the world who are literally dying of this dread \ndisease. I salute him for his very fine work and for his very fine \ncomments today.\n  Last Friday, we offered an amendment to the Foreign Operations bill \nthat would increase the bill's current funding level for the global \nAIDS initiative by $289 million, as Senator Durbin has indicated. This \nadditional funding would bring the total fiscal year 2004 allocation to \n$2.4 billion. This $2.4 billion would allow us to meet our goal of \nproviding at least $2 billion in bilateral assistance, and it would \nalso allow us to meet our current matching commitment to the global \nfund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n  The new AIDS coordinator, Randall Tobias, would be able to distribute \nthis money for the prevention, treatment, and control of and research \nin regard to AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis, as well as malaria.\n  I am very pleased a number of our colleagues have joined us as \ncosponsors of this amendment. In addition to Senator Durbin, Senator \nColeman, Senator Warner, Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, Senator Graham \nof South Carolina, Senator Alexander, Senator Santorum, Senator \nCollins, Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Bingaman, Senator Corzine, \nSenator Brownback, Senator Lugar, Senator Roberts, Senator Hagel, \nSenator Dole, Senator Specter, Senator Hatch, Senator Clinton, as well \nas Senator Kerry have also cosponsored this amendment. I thank them all \nfor their cosponsorship. I thank each one of them for their support and \nfor their own efforts to fight the ravages of the global AIDS epidemic.\n\n  Fighting AIDS is a monumental task, a huge effort that will demand \nthe time, resources, support, and certainly the prayers of the American \npeople and people around the world for years to come.\n\n[[Page S13349]]\n\n  It is a global problem with global implications. It is delicate; it \nis intricate; it is anything but simple. I think the American people \nunderstand this. They certainly need to know this. They need to know we \nwill be fighting against AIDS and HIV for a long time.\n  The disease, death, and destruction it has left in its wake will not \ngo away overnight, no matter what we do. Our amendment today will not \ncompletely solve this problem. It will not make AIDS go away, but it \nwill help. It will begin to make a difference. It certainly can make a \ndifference. The resources this amendment will provide will, in fact, \nsave lives.\n  Let there be no mistake about it; passing this amendment will save \nthousands of lives. It will save lives because the resources we will \nprovide by this amendment will go to organizations, groups, doctors, \nand nonprofit organizations that are already in the field, already are \nin these countries, that have already proven they have the ability to \ngo out and do the job. So in this regard, it is very simple. There are \nthings we can do right now to save these lives and to make an immediate \ndifference. For example, as I said Friday, I have had the opportunity \nto travel to Guyana and Haiti in this hemisphere and, as we did this \npast summer, along with Senator Frist and other Members of the Senate, \nwe traveled to the southern part of Africa, where we had the \nopportunity to see doctors and organizations in the field doing the \nwork. They were already saving lives and they looked at us and, in so \nmany words, said: Give us the resources, give us the help, give us the \nassistance we need so we can expand the work we are doing.\n  We saw them in place. What this bill will do is to give them more \nhelp and assistance so they can expand their work, treat more people \nand help save more lives.\n  I think the most striking example of this is when we see a mother who \nis HIV-positive, we know the facts are if she is HIV-positive when she \nis pregnant with a child and about to give birth, the odds are 30 \npercent that child will be HIV-positive and that child will be \ncondemned to death. We also know, though, that for as little as $3, \nthat mother can be treated and the odds will be reduced from 30 percent \nto 5 percent or 4 percent that she will give birth to a child who will \nbe HIV-positive. We can give lifesaving drugs and that lifesaving \ntreatment for a very small amount of money, for the cost of two cups of \ncoffee in the United States. We can do that, and we need to do it.\n  In addition to fighting HIV/AIDS, we must remain vigilant in our \nefforts to fight other global epidemics. That is another reason this \namendment is so important. The funds it provides, in addition to \nfighting HIV/AIDS, can be used to fight the spread of tuberculosis and \nmalaria. These are two diseases we have the ability to fight, two \ndiseases we have an obligation to fight.\n  Like HIV/AIDS, the statistics are staggering. According to the World \nHealth Organization, tuberculosis kills 2 million people per year. It \nis estimated that between 2000 and 2020, nearly 1 billion people will \nbe newly infected by TB; 200 million people will get sick from it; and \n35 million people will die from it if the control of it is not further \nstrengthened. TB is a leading cause of death among women of \nreproductive age worldwide and it is estimated to cause more deaths \namong this group than all causes of maternal mortality. With an \nestimated 3 million new cases of TB each year, Southeast Asia is the \nworld's hardest hit region. In Eastern Europe, TB deaths are increasing \nafter almost 40 years of steady decline. More than 1.5 million TB cases \noccur in sub-Saharan Africa each year. This number is rising rapidly, \nlargely due to the high prevalence of HIV.\n\n  The fact is, people who are HIV positive or who already have AIDS are \nfar more susceptible to acquiring tuberculosis. Their compromised \nimmune system, quite simply, has a very difficult time fighting off the \nTB infection. As a result, TB is the leading killer of people living \nwith HIV/AIDS. One-third of people infected with HIV would develop TB--\none-third. At the end of the year 2001, 13.1 million people living with \nHIV/AIDS were coinfected with tuberculosis.\n  In Africa alone, more than 50 percent of individuals with active TB \nare also HIV positive. And in Asia, TB accounts for 40 percent of AIDS \ndeaths.\n  The spread of malaria is equally troubling. According to the World \nHealth Organization, over 40 percent of the world's children live in \nmalaria epidemic countries. Each year, approximately 300 to 500 million \nmalaria infections lead to over 1 million deaths, of which over 75 \npercent occur in African children. In fact, every 30 seconds an African \nchild dies of malaria.\n  As with HIV/AIDS, there are some relatively simple things we can do \nto help prevent these needless deaths. For example, insecticide-treated \nnets have been shown to reduce mortality among children under 5 years \nby approximately 20 percent. This translates to the prevention of \nalmost half a million deaths each year in sub-saharan Africa alone. \nSimple items such as these nets can cost as little as $1.50, while a \nyear's supply of insecticides to retreat a net costs from 30 cents to \n60 cents. Yet a recent ``Child Survival'' series in the British medical \njournal The Lancet concluded that:\n\n       Fewer than 5 percent of children in regions of Africa with \n     very high prevalence rates of malaria are using insecticide \n     treated materials to prevent malaria.\n\n  Again, as with HIV/AIDS, we as a nation and as a people have the \nresources and the ability to fight these preventable diseases. With \nthis amendment, we can do so much good. So I say to the Members of the \nSenate, I say to my colleagues, we should not and we must not tolerate \na world where so many people are suffering from HIV/AIDS and so many \npeople are suffering from malaria and tuberculosis. We simply should \nnot tolerate a world where this suffering and dying occurs. And where \nwe have the ability and where we have the tools to help make a \ndifference and to save lives, we must act, and we must act quickly. We \nshould not delay. We must act now.\n  Every 10 seconds, someone in the world dies because of AIDS. In just \nthe short time I have been speaking here on the Senate floor--in just \nthat time--at least 60 people have died because of AIDS. Those are \nlives that we can help save. Those are lives that I believe we must \nhelp save.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us, to join Senators Durbin, Coleman, \nWarner, Daschle, Leahy, Graham of South Carolina, Alexander, Santorum, \nCollins, Smith of Oregon, Bingaman, Corzine, Brownback, Lugar, Roberts, \nHagel, Dole, Specter, Hatch, Clinton, and Kerry in supporting this \namendment. This amendment will mean more lives can be saved. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13349-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sense of the Senate on declassifying portions of \n     the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities \n     Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001.\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The President has prevented the release to the American \n     public of 28 pages of the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence \n     Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks \n     of September 2001.\n       (2) The contents of the redacted pages discuss sources of \n     foreign support for some of the September 11th hijackers \n     while they were in the United States.\n       (3) The Administration's decision to classify this \n     information prevents the American people from having access \n     to information about the involvement of certain foreign \n     governments in the terrorist attacks of September 2001.\n       (4) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested that the \n     President release the 28 pages.\n       (5) The Senate respects the need to keep information \n     regarding intelligence sources and methods classified, but \n     the Senate also recognizes that such purposes can be \n     accomplished through careful selective redaction of specific \n     words and passages, rather than effacing the section's \n     contents entirely.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that in light of these findings the President should \n     declassify the 28-page section of the Joint Inquiry into \n     Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the \n     Terrorist Attacks of September 2001 that deals with foreign \n     sources of support for the 9-11 hijackers, and that only \n     those portions of the report that would directly compromise \n     ongoing investigations or reveal intelligence sources and \n     methods should remain classified.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment. I note there are other sense-of-the-Senate amendments in \nthis legislation. I will at the end of my statement ask consent that we \nconsider waiving points of order.\n  Let me describe what the amendment is and why I have offered the \namendment. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator \nSchumer from New York.\n  The Congressional Joint Intelligence Committee inquiry into the \nintelligence community activities before and after the terrorist \nattacks of September 2001 finished its work. This past summer, when the \nreport was finally authorized for release by the administration, we \ndiscovered that the report, which took 9 months to write and 7 months \nto declassify, contained 28 pages that had been redacted by White House \nlawyers.\n  I will quote a couple of people, one who is in the Chamber now. I \nwill quote Senator Shelby and Senator Graham, the chair and ranking \nmember of the Intelligence Committee while this inquiry was underway. \nAs I indicated, 28 pages of this report were redacted by White House \nlawyers. That means the American public cannot see what was in that \nreport. We will have no knowledge and no information about what was \ncontained in that rather exhaustive report.\n  The Bush administration has refused to declassify these pages, citing \nconcern for intelligence-gathering ``sources and methods.'' I don't \nthink that is an insignificant issue, by the way. I think intelligence \ngathering and the sources and methods for doing so are important. But \nit is also important, it seems to me, to ask the question, Should these \n28 pages have been redacted? Should the 28 pages have been outside the \nview of the American people, given the fact that this report was done \nin order to evaluate what happened leading up to 2001, what was \nhappening with respect to our intelligence community, what was \nhappening with respect to other countries?\n  There has been a great deal of speculation about Saudi Arabia. It is \nassumed that somehow in these pages there is discussion about the \nSaudis. The Saudi Government is implicated by some because 15 of the 19 \nhijackers were from Saudi Arabia. Even the leaders of the Saudi \nGovernment, who some have said are the object of the redacted pages, \nwant it declassified. They are angry and embarrassed at being singled \nout and want to defend themselves, and therefore they want this \ndeclassified.\n  How much of the 28 pages could be declassified? Senators Graham and \nShelby, the former chair and cochair of the Intelligence Committee who \ndirected the report are quoted saying the following: ``I think they are \nclassified for the wrong reason,'' the former vice chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee told NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``I went \nback and read every one of those pages thoroughly. My judgment is 95 \npercent of that information should be declassified and become \nuncensored so the American people would know.'' Asked why the section \nwas blacked out, Shelby said: ``I think it might be embarrassing to \ninternational relations.''\n  Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who was the chairman of the committee \ninvestigating this, also called for declassification. He said releasing \nthe report would permit ``the Saudi Government to deal with any \nquestions which may be raised in the currently censored pages and allow \nthe American people to make their own judgment about who are our true \nfriends and allies in the war on terrorism.'' Senator Graham made that \nrequest in a letter to President Bush.\n  This is a very important issue and it has gone on for months and \nmonths and months. This report was developed after an extensive amount \nof study and investigation. The report was then published after being \nedited by the Bush administration and the White House. And a rather \nsubstantial portion of that report--most speculate dealing with the \nSaudis--was censored, classified, or redacted. That is, the American \npeople are not permitted to see that which is included in the report on \nthose 28 pages.\n  Again, the chairman and vice chairman of the committee that led or \nthat directed the preparation of this report say most of that \ninformation of the 28 pages should be declassified, implying, I \nbelieve, since they are not quoted directly, that declassifying that \nwould not compromise sources and methods and not compromise our \nintelligence community.\n  My hope is that the Senate, with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, \nwill weigh in on this in a very significant way and say to the \nadministration these 28 pages should be made available.\n  Now, in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, I point out that it is \nthe sense of the Senate that in light of the findings--and I have a \nseries of findings--the President should declassify the 28-page section \nof the joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and \nafter the terrorist attacks of 2001 that deal with the foreign sources \nof support for the 9/11 hijackers and that only those portions of the \nreport that would directly compromise ongoing investigations or reveal \nintelligence sources or methods should remain classified.\n  In point of fact, those whose expert opinions I respect have said \nthey have read the redacted or the censored or classified portions very \ncarefully and believe most of it should not have been classified; most \nof it should have been made available to the American people. If that \nis the case, and if the Saudi Government itself has said this \ninformation ought to be declassified, let us deal with it on the public \nrecord. Then I believe the American people ought to expect a right to \nsee this information.\n  My hope is we will have a vote on this amendment, a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment that will allow the Senate in this forum to send a \nmessage to the President and to the White House that we believe the \nbulk of this 28-page redaction should be made available to the American \npeople posthaste.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the \nSenator from North Dakota, for having offered this sense of the Senate. \nThe sense of the Senate has an additional significance as we face some \nfundamental issues in the closing days of this session.\n  First, I will talk about the base concerns. As the Senator from North \nDakota said, the principal purpose of the joint inquiry was to \ndetermine what had been the role of the intelligence community in the \nevents leading up to September 11. In many instances in the course of \nthat pursuit, the committee staff came to unearth FBI reports, CIA \nreports, and other intelligence community reports. We were not in a \nposition, either in terms of our staff capabilities or our \njurisdiction, to then go behind those reports to attempt to validate \nthem. These were reports written by\n\n[[Page S13351]]\n\nagents of these appropriate intelligence agencies, but we could not, \nfrom primary sources, validate them. The FBI, primarily--and some other \nintelligence agencies, as well--were tasked to do exactly that, to find \nout if their own documents in many cases could be substantiated.\n  Those requests were made approximately a year ago. Still, today, many \nof those requests have not been answered. The administration has said, \neither directly or in some cases through intermediaries, that our \nreport is deficient in that there is not second- and third-party \nconfirmation of the statements we include. We included exactly what the \nFBI or CIA or other agencies had written. We asked the appropriate \nagencies, primarily FBI, to pursue these to determine if they were \nsubstantiated, and in many instances that has not occurred.\n  There is also an issue not of micro but of macro importance: This \nreport makes a very compelling case, based on the information submitted \nby the agencies themselves, that there was a foreign government which \nwas complicitous in the actions leading up to September 11, at least as \nit relates to some of the terrorists who were present in one part of \nthe United States.\n  There are two big questions yet to be answered. Why would this \ngovernment have provided the level of assistance--financial, \nlogistical, housing, support service--to some of the terrorists and not \nto all of the terrorists? We asked that question. There has been no \nresponse.\n  My own hypothesis--and I will describe it as that--is that in fact \nsimilar assistance was being provided to all or at least most of the \nterrorists. The difference is that we happened, because of a set of \ncircumstances which are contained in these 28 censored pages, to have \nan unusual window on a few of the terrorists. We did not have a similar \nwindow on others. Therefore, it will take more effort to determine if \nthey were, in fact, receiving that assistance. That effort has, in my \njudgment, been grossly insufficiently pursued.\n  An even more serious question is what would lead us to believe that \nif there was this infrastructure of a foreign government supporting \nsome of the 19 terrorists, that as soon as September 11 concluded, as \nsoon as the last flames were put out at the Pentagon, the World Trade \nCenter and on the field in Pennsylvania, all that infrastructure was \nimmediately taken down? Again, this is my hypothesis: I don't believe \nit was taken down. I believe that infrastructure is likely to still be \nin place assisting the next generation of terrorists who are in the \nUnited States.\n  Those are very fundamental questions, and if the public had access to \nthese 28 pages, they would be demanding answers.\n  As I mentioned in the beginning of my remarks, there is another issue \nwhich is going to emerge in the next few days. We had a long debate in \nthis Chamber on the supplemental appropriations bill, the bill \nproviding $87 billion for the reconstruction and occupation of Iraq. We \nhad a long debate as to whether some of that reconstruction money \nshould be in the form of loans rather than, as the President has \ninsisted, all of it being in grants.\n  What is one of the practical effects of making all of the U.S. money \nwhich will go into the reconstruction of Iraq a grant? The answer to \nthat question is that one of the consequences, ironically, will be that \nwe will make all of the countries which currently have loans to Iraq \nthat much more solvent because we will have, without any request for \nrepayment, made a significant investment in enhancing the economic \nviability of Iraq and, therefore, the ability of whatever government is \nplaced in ultimate control of Iraq more capable of repaying those \nloans.\n  There is a further irony that some of those countries, which are \ndisclosed in the 28 censored pages as having been complicitous with the \nterrorists, are among the list of those creditors of Iraq that are \ngoing to get this indirect economic benefit. I believe the Members of \nCongress, who are going to be called upon to vote on whether we should \ngrant this indirect benefit to a country that has been less than \nsupportive of our Nation's war on terror, ought to know that before we \nvote and then find out later the full consequences of what we have \ndone.\n  So there was an issue as to why these 28 pages should have been \nreleased when the report was initially completed in December of 2002. \nThose issues remain today. And there is the additional issue of whether \nwe are going to inadvertently grant a significant financial benefit to \na country that has been to say less than our ally in the war on terror \nwould be a gross understatement.\n  I commend the Senator from North Dakota for having offered this sense \nof the Senate. It is a very important issue. I hope this Senate will \nadopt the sense of the Senate. If not, if the President continues to \nrefuse to allow the American people to have access to this information, \nthen I hope the Congress will be willing to use some of the authorities \nthat it has to declassify information. Because the higher interest is \nnot in placating this administration's unwillingness to be forthcoming \non the issue. The higher interest in this democracy is that the people \nhave access to relevant information which is not an issue of national \nsecurity but which is a significant issue in terms of understanding the \nconsequences of decisions that we have and will soon be making.\n  I urge adoption of the sense of the Senate and again express my \nadmiration to the Senator from North Dakota for having presented it \nthis afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a few additional comments. My \ncolleague from Florida is in a very unique position. Having worked with \nhis colleague from Alabama, Senator Graham and Senator Shelby provided \na great public service as they initiated this inquiry.\n  The inquiry, as described by my colleague in part, is an evaluation \nof whether there were other governments that participated in supporting \ngroups of terrorists who committed acts of terror against this country. \nThe answer to that question is very important. My colleague indicates \nthat if such a program were in place or had been in place by another \ngovernment to support groups of terrorists, what leads us to believe \nthat parts of that program are not continuing to still operate and, \ntherefore, continue to threaten our country?\n  The very important question with this sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nis: Should we not have the ability to know, should full disclosure not \nbe the routine rather than the exception? Should the 28 pages that have \nbeen withheld from the American people be made available to them so we \nall are able to evaluate exactly the same set of information?\n  My conclusion is, yes, absolutely. It ought to be done sooner rather \nthan later.\n  I have been intending to offer two amendments to this appropriations \nbill. One dealt with this sense of the Senate which I have just \noffered. The second dealt with a sense of the Senate with respect to \nthe cooperation that is now being received or lack of cooperation by \nthe 9/11 Commission, the other commission that is headed by former \nGovernor Kean that is looking into 9/11 and the relationship of a \nseries of issues, both prior to 9/11 and following, by our intelligence \ncommunity and others.\n  One of my great concerns is reading in the newspapers just in recent \ndays about the 9/11 Commission. This is a blue-ribbon commission. One \nof our former colleagues, Senator Cleland, is on the Commission. It is \na commission that has to finish its work by May of next year. It has a \nrelatively short timeframe. Now we hear that they have had to issue a \nsubpoena to one of the Federal agencies to get them to cooperate giving \ninformation to them. There were other stories yesterday and the day \nbefore. They are concerned about not getting information from the White \nHouse.\n  We are not going to be satisfied until we have everything we need to \ndo our job. Governor Kean says--he is a former Republican Governor from \nNew Jersey--this is not about politics. It is about a blue-ribbon \ncommission having access to all of the information so it can do its \njob.\n  I find it unbelievable that any agency or crevice or any corner of \nthis Government would not open its records and provide full and \nimmediate cooperation with the 9/11 Commission. That is the least we \nshould expect of every single\n\n[[Page S13352]]\n\nagency. They have had to subpoena information from the FAA and yet they \nare not getting information from the White House that they are \nrequesting. Kean said in an interview that he will resume negotiations \nwith the White House this week and hopes to reach a resolution one way \nor the other on documents the panel is seeking. The Commission has the \npower to issue subpoenas and Kean says he does not rule out sending one \nto the White House.\n  Why should we read this in the papers? I don't understand it. There \nought not be any agency, including the White House, that does not fully \ncooperate in every respect immediately with the request for information \nfrom this 9/11 Commission.\n  We have had two studies, one initiated by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. That is the one that was the focus of my first amendment. \nThe second was to have been the focus of the second amendment. Both \nwere sense of the Senate--first, to declassify the information so that \nthe American people will be able to see what was there. Don't censor \nthis material; give the American people information. The second is to \nsay to all Federal agencies, cooperate with the 9/11 Commission fully, \ncompletely, and immediately.\n  Now, my understanding is, having consulted with the majority, they \nwill raise a point of order against the amendment I have offered just \nmoments ago because it is ``legislating on an appropriations bill.'' My \nsecond amendment would be the same. They would make a point of order \nagainst them, and the point of order would stand, I expect. So when \nsuch a point of order is made, I will regret it. I understand those are \nthe rules of the Senate. But on the very next piece of legislation that \ncomes to the floor--and I believe one is coming later this week that is \nan amendable vehicle and is a nonappropriations bill--we will vote on \nboth of these sense-of-the-Senate amendments.\n  I might also say that while a point of order will be raised on these, \nthere are sense-of-the-Senate provisions, I believe, in the underlying \nbill, or sense-of-the-Senate provisions to be added to it. I will not \nraise similar points of order. My hope is that all Senators will join \nme in understanding that this is not partisan or political, it is about \nthis country's interests--our interests in preventing future acts of \nterrorism, our interests in finding out what happened, what went wrong, \nand how we can improve the intelligence-gathering system in this \ncountry. Who did what? Were foreign governments involved? If so, which \nones and to what extent? These questions need to be answered. Both of \nmy resolutions are designed to do one thing--provide more information \nto the American people, No. 1; No. 2, to ask every corner of our \nGovernment in every official working of this Government to decide that \nthey will completely, cooperatively, and immediately work with the 9/11 \nCommission to provide the requested information.\n  We ought not to have to come to the Senate floor to ask why the White \nHouse, the FAA, or this or that agency has not already fully cooperated \nwith the 9/11 Commission. It is in this country's interest to see that \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, I ask for consideration of my amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Was consent requested, Mr. President? I am sorry, I \ndidn't hear.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I asked for consideration of my amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that we waive points of order and have my amendment \nbe considered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in accordance with the precedent of May \n17, 2000, I raise a point of order that the amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1974\n\n       (Purpose: To authorize appropriations for Foreign Relations \n     and for Foreign Assistance, and to authorize Millennium \n     Challenge Assistance)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, the pending amendment will be set \naside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1974.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer an amendment that \nauthorizes the spending contained in this appropriations bill. I thank \nSenator McConnell and Senator Leahy specifically for the way in which \nthey have worked with me throughout this year on matters pertaining to \nforeign policy. Our staffs have consulted closely for months, and I \nbelieve that our respective legislative efforts have been enhanced \ngreatly by this cooperation.\n  My amendment is an up-to-date version of S. 925, the foreign affairs \nauthorization bill. It contains all of the amendments included in the \nS. 925 Senate floor action in July. It is truly a bipartisan product. \nOn those 3 days in July in which we debated the bill, we considered \ndozens of amendments from both sides of the aisle. The Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee worked with Members on constructive legislative \nlanguage to enhance the bill; various components have received \nunanimous committee support.\n  I thank almost every Member of this body who has contributed in one \nway or another to this amendment because the amendments of almost every \nMember of this body are a part of the product we are considering today. \nThat is why it not only has enormous bipartisan support, it has pride \nof authorship of virtually every Senator.\n  In this amendment, the Senate speaks forthrightly on the foreign \npolicy challenges that this appropriations bill addresses by setting \nforth funding levels for specific programs and projects. This amendment \ngives voice to the Senate's views on issues touching every continent, \nfrom the threats of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, to the \nsafety of Americans working in our embassies overseas, to the \nPresident's proposed Millennium Challenge Account, which is designed to \nspur economic growth in the poorest countries.\n  My amendment authorizes appropriations for our diplomats, our foreign \naid workers, our Peace Corps volunteers, many of them in harm's way. \nThey are our civilian soldiers in the war on terrorism, and they are \nengaged in a noble battle against disease, poverty, and humanitarian \ndisasters. American diplomats and aid workers have become targets in \nmost countries and embassies around the world, but there is no shortage \nof recruits who want to be trained and sent abroad to do America's \nwork.\n  I thank every member of my committee for their hard work during the \nauthorization process. Members on both sides of the aisle have devoted \ntens of hours to developing constructive approaches to a number of very \ndifficult foreign policy questions. The Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee has approached many foreign policy problems in a bipartisan \nspirit; thus, all of our authorizing legislation in S. 925 passed out \nof the committee by a vote of 19 to 0.\n  I thank and commend, once again, the distinguished ranking member of \nour committee, Senator Biden, for his abiding cooperation through this \nwhole lengthy process of this year. Republicans and Democrats reasoned \ntogether and made compromises that led to excellent legislation. The \nmembers of our committee are united in our belief that the \nauthorization bill contained in this amendment will enhance U.S. \nnational security.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote of confidence in the Senate's \nability to help shape a world where peace, justice, and prosperity \nmight prevail. This is not an academic exercise. Authorization \nlegislation is important. If we are to have a foreign policy that has \nthe long-term support of the American people, the Congress must be in \nit on the takeoffs as well as the landings. We should not be satisfied \nwith appropriating funds after American soldiers\n\n[[Page S13353]]\n\nare on the ground. Congress must be in on the policy formulations and \nthe fulfillment of U.S. commitments. Our role is to help make the hard \ndecisions, not just to sign the checks after decisions are made.\n  Extensive hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have \nformed this amendment. The Senate needs the authorization process to \nproject its voice on foreign policy and to have an impact on the \ndirection this country takes in the world. I believe this step is \nespecially necessary because we are now trying to accomplish our \nlegislative work in extraordinary and dangerous times. These times \ndemand the Senate do its duty to pass a foreign affairs authorization \nbill.\n  Up to this point, we have not done our duty. We are asking a great \ndeal of our diplomats, our military, and the administration; and on a \ndaily basis, Senators of both parties can be heard delivering \ncommentary on the administration's war effort. Our responsibilities as \nthe elected representatives of the people make such commentary relevant \nand expected.\n  Even as we perform oversight and function as loyal critics within our \nGovernment, we cannot forget we have our own responsibilities in \nfighting the war on terrorism. If we function merely as critics and \ncommentators without taking the time and effort to authorize the very \nlegislation that pertains to our Nation's security, we are failing in \nour duties. This simply cannot continue.\n  After September 11, 2001, we know we need a robust civilian foreign \npolicy capacity in addition to a strong military if we are going to \nshape a world that embraces democracy, tolerance, open markets, and the \nrule of law. But we find the State Department is stretched thin. Our \npublic diplomacy is underfunded and unfocused on many occasions. Our \nforeign assistance faces constant conflicting pressures and we need to \nplay catchup just to make sure Americans are as safe as possible in \ntheir embassy workplaces, and Americans who approach those workplaces \nare as safe as possible.\n  We have no civilian surge capacity so our soldiers in Afghanistan and \nIraq end up doing the nonmilitary tasks that should be done by \ncivilians. Our appropriators have been sensitive to foreign policy \nneeds. They have carried the burden of keeping vital foreign policy \nprograms going, but a few lines in appropriations bills are not \nsufficient to provide the needed direction and framework and the \nsustained oversight this body should be paying to our civilian foreign \naffairs capacity.\n  This year the foreign affairs authorization bill has had to overcome \nobstacles that have had little to do with its own merits. This \nauthorizing amendment lays out Senate priorities for foreign affairs \nspending. I have resisted adding anything to it that was not approved \nin July in open debate and after the adoption of the dozens of \namendments I talked about from virtually most, if not all, Senators on \nthis floor. The bill exists as it emerged from the Senate floor at that \ntime and it puts people first, as well as the safety of Americans who \nwork around the world for us. It places a high priority on programs \nthat help foreign governments cooperate with us in tracking down \nterrorists. It authorizes additional funds for security upgrades at \nembassies which we know are among the most threatened U.S. targets in \nthe world. As we saw in Kenya and Tanzania, Americans serving in \nembassies are on the front line in the war against terrorism.\n  The amendment authorized an increase in danger pay for the diplomats \nwho serve in high-risk posts. We are in a race to prevent terrorists \nfrom acquiring weapons of mass destruction and the authorization of \nthis amendment will increase our capabilities. The amendment authorizes \na greater American effort to reach out to the Islamic world. Beyond the \nwar on terrorism, the amendment places a high priority on recognizing \nthe deep reservoir of hope for humanity that resides in the American \nheart. It authorizes the fulfillment of our humanitarian instincts, \nincluding programs for child survival, nutrition and health, famine \nassistance and the Peace Corps. It authorizes the Millennium Challenge \nAccount, President Bush's new program to invest American development \ndollars where they are most likely to spur economic growth.\n  A lot of work has gone into the deliberations on the Millennium \nChallenge Account and the final product is supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Senate, as well as the President of the United States \nand the Secretary of State. All of us now support the President's \nconcept for creating a new means of delivering economic assistance to \nnations that are implementing positive and measurable economic and \npolitical reforms. We agree with the President that this and our \ndevelopment assistance programs are important tools in the war on \nterrorism. They can prevent failed states, improve our relationships \nwith developing countries, and reduce impoverished conditions that are \nconducive to terrorist recruitment.\n\n  The Senate has been diligent this year in moving other foreign policy \nitems. Among the measures we have passed are the global AIDS bill, the \nMoscow Treaty, NATO expansion, and the Iraq supplemental. The Senate \nhas shown a capacity to act decisively on the Nation's foreign policy \nbusiness because we recognize that in these perilous times it is our \nduty to do so. American national security is at risk, and as the \nleaders entrusted with passing legislation to keep America secure, we \nshould include the authorization for the civilian foreign affairs \nagencies and their programs among our accomplishments this year.\n  I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I apologize because I \njust arrived on the floor--I am sorry. I thought my distinguished \nfriend, the senior Senator from Indiana, had propounded a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. I am prepared to accept the passage of the amendment \nby voice vote if it is the pleasure of both managers of the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say initially that in my experience \nin the Congress I have learned to recognize the quality of the senior \nSenator from Indiana. He is a fine man, an outstanding legislator, and \nhis heart is always in the right place.\n  I understand the importance of the State Department authorization \nbill. I have understood it for the more than two decades I have been in \nthe Congress. It is important legislation. On this side of the aisle, \nwe understand that and that is why we have worked so hard over the \nyears to try to move forward. As the Senator from Indiana knows, it \ncertainly was not his fault, but we had great difficulty moving the \nbill previously as a result of one Senator. On this legislation he now \nwants to make a part of this foreign operations appropriations bill, we \nhave spent 2 days on this bill and during that period of time we had \nsome good debate. We adopted some amendments. But we on this side feel \nwe should move forward as with all legislation and not cut it off. In \neffect, that is what is happening.\n  So without belaboring the point more, I raise a point of order that \nthis is legislating on an appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to suspend rule XVI of the standing rules of the \nSenate during the Senate's consideration of H.R. 2800 in order to offer \namendment 1974 to that bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the question of the two managers of \nthe bills: How much time do we need to spend on this? It is my \nunderstanding the issue that has been raised by the Senator from \nIndiana will take a two-thirds vote to pass the Senate. I am sure there \nare a few people who wish to speak on this, and I am sure on our side \nwe could arrive at a reasonable period of time prior to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the Senator from Indiana how much time he \ndesires before proceeding to a vote?\n\n[[Page S13354]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond to the distinguished Senator that I would like \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Are there any requests for time on the other side?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then would the request be a half hour evenly divided? Is \nthat what the Senator is suggesting?\n  Mr. REID. I think that is totally reasonable, if I could interrupt. \nWe need to check with the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Senator Harkin has agreed to take 15 minutes. We don't know \nof anyone else who wished to speak on it, other than the manager of the \nbill.\n  I hope, if we can go into an extremely brief quorum call, we can come \nup with a time agreement very quickly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I hope we can move on with this very \nquickly. I think a brief quorum call is a good idea. I therefore \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask that there be 30 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, on the Lugar amendment, after which we will \nhave a vote on that amendment. Have we had the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on Lugar--on the motion to \nwaive.\n  Mr. REID. No, on the motion to suspend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On the motion to suspend; I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes at the outset of \nthis debate.\n  Mr. President, I regret that objection has been made, although I \nunderstand the reasoning of those who have made the objection.\n  I identified this as the State Department authorization bill, a bill \nthat also included authorization for the money in the challenge account \nand, for that matter, a good number of other things that, in this \nparticular urgent period of the war on terrorism, attempts to help \nbrave Americans who are serving in our embassies, who are serving in \nhumanitarian ways abroad. I need not remind the Senate that a number of \nthese brave Americans have lost their lives in recent days and weeks. I \nneed not remind the Senate we are at war. This is not an incidental \namendment or a last-minute whim of one Senator.\n  Nor, for that matter, is it a particular desire of our committee--\nwhich voted 19 to zero in behalf of some very important principles that \nsupport Americans on the civilian side of the war against terrorism--to \nimpose our will upon the Senate. Obviously, we are not in a position to \ndo so. But I pointed out in the days of debate on the amendment that I \nhave offered today, there were tens of amendments offered by many \nSenators. A majority, I believe, of the body have tried to perfect this \nbill. It is not a controversial bill. It is, in fact, a statement of \nthe best motivation, the idealism of the Senate. It is our best \ncollective effort to try to meet an imperative in the war against \nterrorism.\n  At this point, a point of order has been raised that this is \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. Indeed, it is. I have made a \nmotion to waive that requirement, given what I believe is the gravity \nand the importance of the lives of the Americans we are trying to \nserve.\n  Members may decide that they wish to debate procedure today. And \nprocedure in the Senate and the rules of the Senate are very important. \nBut the rules of the Senate also permit, as one rule of the Senate, the \nwaiver, so that authorization might occur on an appropriations bill.\n  Some Senators have approached me and indicated they think there is a \nlot of merit in the bill. As a matter of fact, some of their own work \nis in this bill, in this amendment I am offering. Yet at the same time, \nthey are reluctant to vote for my waiver on this occasion, my desire to \nset aside rule XVI, because they believe there are, after all, many \nconsiderations the Senate might be taking up today. There is a broad \ngamut of domestic issues, for that matter, discussions of foreign \npolicy--various ideas that might come to Senators that might be quite \nwelcome to our national debate.\n  I do ask for consideration of the whole package of the ideas, \nauthorizations, and support that my amendment provides the Senate today \nbecause I believe it is important to our country. I believe it is \nimportant, as a statement of who we are, that we are doing business. We \nmight make a statement, when we have this vote, that we are prepared, \nreally, not to do business, but in our own internal difficulties we are \nprepared to frustrate each other at almost every pass.\n  We enjoy the fact that, as a Senate, we are fairly evenly divided. \nYet I pointed out on this particular bill we are not divided. So there \nalmost has to be a very peculiar twist, it seems to me, that finds this \ndebate whether or not we should authorize the State Department \nMillennial Challenge.\n  Beyond that, there has been perhaps a debate in the Senate throughout \nthe year. It is an important one. It is important to be resolved \nconstructively. There may be some Senators who would say that, by and \nlarge, it is probably useful to have authorization bills but some \nSenators almost in the next breath will say it is not very necessary. \nIn other words, if in fact programs are not thought through and they \nare not fleshed out and there are not formats for them that, by and \nlarge, somehow we get along year by year appropriating money and adding \nsome verbiage that gives a hint that someone authorized these \nexpenditures along the way as well as appropriated them.\n  We found in July when Senator Biden and I were attempting to manage \nthis bill that there were a lot of Senators who were in favor of what \nwe were doing but some Senators said we have not really had our day on \nthe floor; we have really not had a chance to offer our agenda; the \nreason we couldn't was because the format of the Senate always seemed \nto be taking up appropriations bills; and rule XVI says you cannot have \nauthorization of general legislation. Therefore, we were cut out from \nany consideration of objectives which we thought were very important. \nAs a result, we came along with an authorization bill and Senators said \nfinally we have an authorization bill. This offers us the opportunity \nto pile in everything that we have.\n  The Senators who argued against that point of view said, no, that \nreally wasn't what the debate on foreign policy was about. But the \nopposition to that was simply we understand that, but we have not had \nour chance and we don't see that we are going to have our chance. We \ndon't see another authorization bill coming along the pike. Therefore, \nalthough yours will somehow disappear in the midst of all of these \nother discussions, that has happened for years. Very seldom do we pass \nauthorization bills, and in the case of foreign relations, as a matter \nof fact, not many for many, many years.\n  As a result, our staff found as we approached the State Department \nand foreign assistance and what have you that this year there was a \nneed for cleanup of a lot of our case activity, and we hope to do some \nmore of that work next year. One reason for that is if you do not have \nauthorization bills and force things to happen, no one really examines \nlegislative language. There are a whole series of bureaucracies and \nresponsibilities from year to year. No one pays attention and, \nlegislatively, no one cares.\n  Let me say we do care. In fact, a large majority of Senators care \nabout the content of this legislation. I believe it is very important \non this occasion that my proposal to lay aside rule XVI should be \nadopted, and that will be our goal. I encourage an ``aye'' vote not \nonly on the rule XVI waiver but a vote on behalf of brave Americans who \nthis amendment supports and serves and remembers.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains to each side?\n\n[[Page S13355]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes in opposition, and 6 \nminutes for the proponents.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Obviously, if the distinguished Senator from Indiana needs \nmore time, I would not object to a unanimous consent request from him.\n  Does the Senator from Iowa wish time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have an amendment but I am not seeking time on this \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, time is running. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the time under the quorum call not be charged against the side of \nthe distinguished Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, that leaves us how much time on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 11 minutes 12 seconds, and \nthe proponents have 6 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't know if we have people coming to \nspeak. If no one does, I will soon yield back the time so we can vote. \nI urge, as Senator McConnell has and as the leaders have, those who \nhave amendments on which they seek votes to come to the floor and offer \ntheir amendments. I know that the intent of Senator McConnell and \nmyself is if there are no other amendments waiting to be disposed of or \npending, we plan to go to third reading. Going to the third reading \ncould be in a matter of the next couple of hours at that pace.\n  Some Senators have said they had a number of amendments. At such \npoint that there are no amendments pending, it is our intention to go \nto third reading.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged to my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts has arrived. I ask the Chair how much time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those in opposition have 9 minutes and 12 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate it. I will be prepared to address the \nSenate in a minute. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, the amendment before the \nSenate is the State Department reauthorization legislation. I commend \nthe Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Delaware for fashioning \nthe reauthorization. It has not been done for a number of years, and I \nam very strong in support of that proposal. If the amendment of the \nSenator from Indiana is effective, we will lose the opportunity to have \nat least considered one of the very important amendments to the State \nDepartment reauthorization which dealt with hate crimes. I think it is \nentirely appropriate we have an opportunity to address the hate crimes \nissue on the State Department reauthorization because the State \nDepartment reauthorization obviously is dealing with foreign policy \nissues, and the origin of hate crimes is domestic terrorism. We have \nseen in recent times the growth of hate crimes in the United States. It \nis of significant importance. Hate crimes are not just crimes against \nan individual; they are crimes against a group in our society. They do \nnot just do damage to an individual; they do something to our whole \nsense of community. That is why they are so treacherous. That is why \nthey are so heinous. That is why they are so wrong.\n  We have seen the hate crimes that have taken place on the basis of \nrace, and on the basis gender, and the basis of sexual orientation. \nParticularly the time of the tragic circumstances surrounding the death \nof Matthew Shephard, whose death in Wyoming was tragic. He had studied \noverseas and was fluent in Arabic and German before joining the Federal \nservice.\n  Mr. President, crimes motivated by hate because of the victim's race, \nreligion, sex, ethnic background, and disability are not confined to \ngeographical boundaries of our great Nation. The current conflicts in \nthe Middle East, the ethnic cleansing campaigns in Bosnia, Rwanda or \nthe Holocaust itself demonstrate that violence motivated by hate is a \nworldwide danger. We have a special responsibility to combat it here at \nhome.\n  Since the September 11th attacks, we have seen a shameful increase in \nthe number of hate crimes committed against Muslim Americans, Sikh \nAmericans, and Americans of Middle Eastern descent. Congress has done \nmuch to respond to the vicious attacks on September 11. We authorized \nthe use of force against terrorists and those who harbor them in other \nlands. We have enacted legislation to provide aid to victims and their \nfamilies, to strengthen airport security, to improve security of our \nborders, to strengthen our defenses against bioterrorism, and to give \nlaw enforcement and intelligence officers enhanced powers to \ninvestigate and prevent terrorism. But the one thing we have not done \nis to try to deal with the hate crimes issue.\n\n  We are prepared to vote on that. We are interested in half an hour \ntime limitation, but we are told people have holds on that legislation. \nMembers will refuse to let the Senate consider this legislation. I have \nindicated to the Senator from Indiana that I am prepared to permit and \nsupport the State Department reauthorization, but at least give us some \nopportunity to vote on hate crimes as a clean bill with a short time \nlimit. We will take next week or the week after. We will even take a \ndate in January or February of next year, but give us an opportunity to \nvote on hate crimes. The other side says no--not the Senator from \nIndiana--but the other side says no. So we are in a situation that \nsays, well, let's circumvent or at least use the rules in such a way \nthat will say we have two-thirds of the Senate that will permit him to \nuse this reauthorization and effectively deny the Senate the \nopportunity to address the hate crimes issue. I don't fault the Senator \nfrom Indiana, but if this goes on, I am going to be there on the next \namendment offering the hate crimes bill. Make no mistake about it. Make \nno mistake about it. We will have the opportunity and the time to take \nthis up.\n  I might mention there are some other issues as well, including the \nissue of the minimum wage. Here we just increased our own salaries by \n$3,400 and we have not been given an opportunity to increase the \nminimum wage by 75 cents an hour for 2 years. We are denied that \nopportunity. We are excluded from that. We had that as an amendment to \nthe State Department authorization and we were told we cannot have an \nhour to debate that.\n  Meanwhile, we see what is happening to the people at the lowest end \nof the economic ladder, primarily women.\n\n       Regarding the minimum wage, it is a women's issue because a \n     majority of those receiving the minimum wage are women. It is \n     a children's issue because one-third of the women who receive \n     the minimum wage have children. It is a civil rights issue \n     because a disproportionate number of the men and women who \n     receive the minimum wage are men and women of color. And it \n     is a fairness issue. In this country of ours, people who work \n     40 hours a week, 52 weeks, ought to have a living wage. But \n     we are denied that opportunity. What is it about our \n     Republican friends that they refuse to permit the Senate to \n     go on record on these issues?\n\n  Now we are asked, let's have an exception. If we have an exception to \nthis, we should face up to minimum wage, to hate crimes, and other \nissues. Fair is fair. I am for this legislation. It is up to the \nmajority to set the agenda and give us an opportunity to vote on these \nissues and not deny a vote in the\n\n[[Page S13356]]\n\nSenate in terms of hate crimes and minimum wage. They say no, no way, \nyou are not going to get your opportunity.\n  I hope this amendment will not be accepted. I hope we can work this \nout with the majority leader. We have tried, we have tried, we have \ntried, and we have tried, but to no avail. Since it is of no avail and \nwe do not have cooperation, there will be no alternative for me other \nthan to offer the amendment.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  Let me respond as thoughtfully and calmly as I can because the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts has indicated he has been a \nvery strong friend of American diplomacy, of our diplomats abroad, of \nthose who are at risk presently in the war against terror. I appreciate \nthat. I have visited with him about ways in which we could have an \nauthorization bill for the State Department, the millennium challenge, \nand the other issues that were in this comprehensive Senate bill, S. \n925, originally, as amended by so many Senators. The Senator's \nstatement illustrates precisely the problem on which Senators must now \nvote.\n  That is, simply, if we are to have an authorization bill this year \nfor the State Department, this is the opportunity. We had an \nopportunity in July. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \npoints out correctly that he and other distinguished Senators had a \nnumber of issues that they believed were important. Hate crimes and the \nminimum wage are two of them. And there were additional ideas that \nSenators wanted to present. They made the point at that time that they \nbelieved that on our side of the aisle, they had not been given an \nopportunity to forward their agenda, to have a time certain for clean \nbills.\n  Therefore, although in some cases they said, we regret the fact that \nthe State Department authorization bill is likely now to be withdrawn \nand not to happen, essentially it hasn't happened for many years. As a \nmatter of fact, very few authorization bills were happening. The only \nreason, I gather, that hate crimes and unemployment compensation came \nup in July was a belief on the part of proponents of those ideas that \nthey had no other authorization bill on which to have a debate or to \nattach their amendments, that the appropriations procedure we are under \ntoday precluded all of that.\n  I ask that even those who are strong proponents of legislation \ndealing with the minimum wage and hate crimes support the authorization \nof legislation that helps civilian Americans who are at risk in the war \nagainst terror now. That is an important objective. It has not been my \npurpose to try to frustrate the aims of any Senator but, rather, simply \non behalf of a committee that voted 19 to zero and on behalf of a \nSenate that approved tens of constructive amendments, to try to forward \nthat work product while there is still an opportunity this year.\n  This is the moment in which Senators must make that sort of decision. \nSome may wish to make it on the basis of procedure or the basis of how \nthe two parties get along with each other in the Senate. But I would \nplead with Senators that this is important by itself. It is an \nimportant, relevant vote for American security and American good \ngovernance.\n  I believe the American people respect this effort. They want us to do \nthis. They want Senators to vote aye, even though some may say this is \nat least an opportunity to make points on other discussions at the \nexpense of the totality of all of it ending up in failure.\n  I appreciate very much the cooperation of the managers of the bill. I \nthank, once again, my distinguished ranking member, Joe Biden, who has \nserved our committee well as chairman and as a member for three \ndecades, for all of the constructive work. I thank especially the \nmembers of the staffs on both sides of the aisle who have diligently \ndevoted hundreds of hours of constructive work trying to reform aspects \nof the State Department, a bureaucracy of our Government that had not \nbeen observed and touched for a long time and which this bill, an \nauthorization bill, has really the unique capacity to do.\n  For all these reasons, I ask that Senators vote aye and that we have \nan opportunity for this legislation to proceed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the hate \ncrimes bill be considered as original text before March 15 on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I make a similar request in terms of the minimum wage \nbefore March 15 of next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 1 minute 15 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me just say, in view of the two \nproposals made by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, I \noffered objection on both of these counts because I am the only \nRepublican Senator in the Chamber. On behalf of the leadership of our \nparty, that was my duty, given the fact that our party had not had an \nopportunity to consider those proposals.\n  I would just say, personally, I am hopeful that consideration will be \ngiven to the Senator from Massachusetts and to all Senators for \nproposals that are constructive. Those two have a lot of constructive \nemphasis, and it may well be that before March 15, the Senate will be \nable to entertain those motions. I hope the Senator understands my \nobjection today. That is why I stated it as a part of this conclusion.\n  Once again, I am hopeful that Senators will vote constructively in \nfavor of the foreign relations bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to suspend rule XVI with regard to amendment No. \n1974.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa was here waiting.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend from Vermont yield, just for an \nobservation? The Senator from Colorado is here. He has an amendment \nwhich I believe is acceptable. I wonder if we could go ahead and \nprocess that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously I will follow the lead of my \nfriend from Kentucky. If the Senator from Colorado has one that is \ngoing to be accepted, let's do that. I ask we do that and then go to \nthe Senator from Iowa. I hope he would accept a time agreement just so \nwe can get moving because, as I stated earlier, certainly on my side, \nonce there are no amendments pending, I am ready to go to third \nreading.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are looking at the amendment of the Senator from \nIowa and hope to get back to him shortly as to whether we can support \nit. In the meantime, if it is all right with my colleagues--\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield just for a brief question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd is on a very important \nappropriations conference committee. He is going to recess tonight at 6 \no'clock. Senator Byrd cannot be here until 6 o'clock. On his amendment \nhe would like to speak for 20 minutes.\n  Senator Landrieu, as I have said before, has an amendment she wishes \nto offer. She said she could speak for 15 minutes on her side on that.\n  Senator Harkin has an amendment. If that cannot be worked out, he \nwants 15 or 20 minutes. And there, of course, are a couple of other \nthings that need to be resolved. I just indicate that everyone on our \nside, as Senator Leahy has announced, should come over and start \noffering these amendments because I have been told by the two leaders \nthey want to finish this bill tonight. If that is the case, the way \nthings are moving here--which is not very fast--it would be a long \nnight. So I hope they would come over and offer these amendments on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I certainly agree with my friend from \nNevada. The idea is to finish tonight. In order to facilitate that, we \nhave a Senator on the floor ready to offer an amendment. I suggest the \nSenator from Colorado be allowed to send his amendment forward, say a \nfew words on its behalf, and let's adopt it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1995, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nallowing me to offer this amendment at this time.\n  There is an amendment I have at the desk, No. 1995. I understand I \nhave the right to modify that. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1995, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit international military education and training funds \n                from being made available for Indonesia)\n\n       On page 147, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n\n         limitation on the provision of imet funds to indonesia\n\n       Sec. 692. (a) Subject to subsection (c), no funds \n     appropriated by title IV of this Act, under the subheading \n     ``international military education and training'' under the \n     heading ``Funds Appropriated to the President'' shall be made \n     available for military education and training for Indonesia.\n       (b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the United \n     States Government from continuing to conduct programs or \n     training with the Indonesian Armed Forces, including counter-\n     terrorism training, officer visits, port visits, or \n     educational exchanges that are being conducted on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) The President may waive the application of subsection \n     (a) if the President--\n       (1) determines that the national interests of the United \n     States justify such a waiver; and\n       (2) submits notice of such a waiver and a justification for \n     such a waiver to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives in accordance with the regular notification \n     procedures of such Committees.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this amendment, co-sponsored by Senator \nGordon Smith, would prohibit International Military Education Training \nfunds for Indonesia. It also gives the President the authority to waive \nthis prohibition for national security reasons. Let me explain why it \nis important for the Senate to consider and approve this amendment.\n  Nearly 15 months ago on August 31, 2002, 10 Americans living in \nIndonesia were brutally attacked less than 6 miles from their homes. \nHundreds of rounds of ammunition were fired at them for 45 minutes, \nleaving two Americans dead and most of the other survivors nursing \nmultiple bullet wounds.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet with one of the survivors of this \nhorrible tragedy, Mrs. Patsy Spiers, who, along with her husband Rick, \nwas shot multiple times. While Patsy was fortunate enough to survive \nthis ordeal, her husband was not. In January, Mrs. Spiers was brave \nenough to sit down with me and walk through her painful experience. The \nnext day I contacted President Bush urging him to press the Indonesian \ngovernment to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the attack.\n  Immediately after the ambush, an investigation into the ambush was \nconducted by the Indonesian civil police. The police report implicated \nthe Indonesian military in the attack, but indicated that further \ninvestigation into the ambush needed to be done. Shortly after the \npolice report was filed, the Indonesian military exonerated themselves \nfrom the attack.\n  Only after diplomatic pressure from the United States did the \nIndonesian government decide to continue the investigation into the \nambush. The Indonesian government also promised to permit the full \nparticipation of the FBI. Despite visiting the country multiple times, \nthe FBI has not received the cooperation it needs to determine who was \nresponsible for these brutal murders.\n  At this juncture, there are indications that Indonesian military may \nhave had some involvement in this attack. Yet, despite these continued \nallegations and lack of cooperation, the Indonesian government and its \nmilitary still receives U.S. assistance through the International \nMilitary Education Training fund. I believe that until a full and open \ninvestigation has been completed and those responsible are prosecuted, \nIMET funding for the Indonesians should be denied.\n  Since my face-to-face meeting with Mrs. Spiers, I have continued to \nwork with the administration, FBI investigators, and colleagues here in \nthe Senate with two distinct goals in mind. The first is to deny the \nrelease of funds until the Indonesians have completed the investigation \ninto these murders. The second goal is to ensure that an impartial \ninvestigation, with help from the FBI, is conducted into the brutal \nattack so that those responsible will be brought to justice.\n  In no way should the United States government provide military \nassistance to Indonesia until this matter is resolved. What kind of \nmessage will we be sending to other governments if we provide this \nassistance without first determining who was responsible? Just as \nimportant, what kind of message do we send to the families of Ted \nBurgon and Rick Spiers who were murdered in the ambush if we continue \nthis military assistance. Are not the lives of American citizens more \nimportant than this military assistance?\n  I fear that by our inaction we send the wrong message to the world. \nWhat kind of precedent will be set for other Americans who travel \noverseas? We cannot allow the murder of our citizens to be ignored and \nthe Indonesian government should not let those responsible go \nunpunished.\n  I appreciate the efforts by the manager of this bill and his staff \nfor their assistance on this amendment. It is my\n\n[[Page S13358]]\n\nhope that we can quickly resolve any concerns with my amendment so it \ncan be accepted. These American families deserve a resolution and \njustice.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member on \ngetting agreement on my amendment.\n  I need to get the attention of the floor manager, the Senator from \nKentucky, if I might.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think there \nmay be a Senator on this side who has a question. We are not quite \nprepared to accept it yet. I suggest that a way to handle this is to \nset it aside. Of course, it can be brought back at any time. If there \nis a need to have more debate and a vote, we will bring it up for that \npurpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from \nColorado. I misspoke earlier when I thought it was cleared on the other \nside. We are working on that now. Hopefully, we will be able to get it \ncleared. If the Senator from Colorado will agree to temporarily set it \naside and go back to it before we finish the bill, we hope to get it \ncleared.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Kentucky and \nthe Senator from Vermont working on this most important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd already has an amendment \npending and he is here to speak on it. We have been waiting for him. \nHis amendment is already here.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he wouldn't mind if \nI presented this for 5 minutes. That is all the time I need.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection to that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. What does this mean with respect to the amendment I have \npending, which is being set aside by unanimous consent?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is our hope that after the Senator \nfrom West Virginia speaks--and I have maybe 5 minutes or so to oppose \nthe amendment--we vote.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Kentucky that Senator Byrd is here. \nI hope that before we dispose, with a recorded vote, of the Landrieu \namendment, we will allow Senator Byrd to speak and, if necessary, we \ncan have two votes in succession.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are certainly prepared to vote on the Byrd \namendment. I will have to get back to the Senator from Louisiana on her \namendment. I have no problem if she would like to explain it and send \nit to the desk.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for Senator Landrieu to offer her amendment; \nthat following the offering and her statement, Senator Byrd obtain the \nfloor and be allowed to make a statement. He indicated he would take \napproximately 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object--and I shall not--when would \nthe vote on the Byrd amendment occur?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if it is agreeable with the other side, \nit is my expectation that, after 5 minutes or less to oppose the Byrd \namendment, we will move to a vote.\n  Mr. REID. That would be appropriate with us on this side.\n  Mr. BYRD. The vote on the Byrd amendment would occur, and after how \nmany minutes can we vote on the amendment by the Senator from \nLouisiana?\n  Mr. REID. The majority has not seen that amendment. They don't know \nwhat they are going to do with it or whether we can have a vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1998\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy \nbecause he was involved in a very important conference earlier today \nand he is anxious to proceed on his amendment.\n  I will offer this amendment in the hope that my friends on the other \nside will support it. There is very good support on this side for this \namendment. It has to do with women and children in armed conflict.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1998.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that women and children have access to basic \nprotection and assistance services in complex humanitarian emergencies)\n\n       On page 147, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 692. (a) None of the funds made available by title II \n     under the heading ``international disaster assistance'', \n     ``transition initiatives'', ``migration and refugee \n     assistance'', or ``united states emergency refugee and \n     migration assistance fund'' or made available for such \n     accounts by any other provision of law for fiscal year 2004 \n     to provide assistance to refugees or internally displaced \n     persons may be provided to an organization that has failed to \n     adopt a code of conduct consistent with the Inter-Agency \n     Standing Committee Task Force on Protection From Sexual \n     Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises six core \n     principles for the protection of beneficiaries of \n     humanitarian assistance.\n       (b) In administering the amounts made available for the \n     accounts described in subsection (a), the Secretary of State \n     and Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development shall incorporate specific policies \n     and programs for the purpose of identifying specific needs \n     of, and particular threats to, women and children at the \n     various stages of a complex humanitarian emergency, \n     especially at the onset of such emergency.\n       (c) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives a report on activities of the Government of \n     the United States to protect women and children affected by a \n     complex humanitarian emergency. The report shall include--\n       (1) an assessment of the specific protection needs of women \n     and children at the various stages of a complex humanitarian \n     emergency;\n       (2) a description of which agencies and offices of the \n     United States Government are responsible for addressing each \n     aspect of such needs and threats; and\n       (3) guidelines and recommendations for improving United \n     States and international systems for the protection of women \n     and children during a complex humanitarian emergency.\n       (d) In this section, the term ``complex humanitarian \n     emergency'' means a situation that--\n       (A) occurs outside the United States and results in a \n     significant number of--\n       (i) refugees;\n       (ii) internally displaced persons; or\n       (iii) other civilians requiring basic humanitarian \n     assistance on an urgent basis; and\n       (B) is caused by one or more situations including--\n       (i) armed conflict;\n       (ii) natural disaster;\n       (iii) significant food shortage; or\n       (iv) state-sponsored harassment or persecution.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, recent reports indicate that the \npercentage of civilians killed and wounded as a result of armed \nconflict has risen from 5 percent at the turn of the century to almost \n90 percent today, which means that in war it is not just the soldiers \nwho are being killed, the men and women in uniform, but also civilians. \nThat is a new occurrence in this century. It is something that this \namendment attempts to address by directing our resources--not adding \nmoney, not authorizing new language, but simply directing, within the \ncontext of this bill, some attention to be given to this fact.\n  War is not what it used to be. Its horrors are experienced by more \nthan just the soldiers fighting on far-off battlefields. It is \nexperienced by women and children. It is taking a brutal toll on\n\n[[Page S13359]]\n\nthese civilians, most of them women and children.\n  Over 30 wars are now being waged around the world. One in four of the \nworld's children live in war zones.\n  In the past decade, more than 2 million children were killed during \nwartime, more than 4 million were wounded, and 1 million have been \norphaned or separated from their families as a result of war.\n  It is estimated that over 300,000 children have been forced to serve \nas soldiers. These are children as young as 7, 8, and 9 years old \nserving as soldiers, including an alarming number of girls serving as \ncombatants, cooks, and, unfortunately, sex slaves.\n  In Sierra Leone, 94 percent of displaced families surveyed had \nexperienced sexual assaults, including rape, torture, and sexual \nslavery.\n  After the genocide in Rwanda, 70 percent of the remaining population \nwas female and more than half of the mothers were widows.\n  Despite these statistics, a survey of current Government-sponsored \nforeign aid programs reveals that there are but a few coordinated \nprograms targeted at the protection of women and children in conflict \nand after.\n  Senator Biden and I offered legislation to address the shortfall. S. \n1001 would authorize the new women and children armed conflict fund, \nsimilar to the displaced children's fund. In addition, it would require \nseveral other efforts to be undertaken by our Government to make sure \nthat this issue was addressed appropriately. It would require that the \nU.S. Government develop and implement a strategy to ensure that its \nhumanitarian programs respond to and reduce the risks of exploitation, \nviolence and abuse of women and children in places like Uganda, \nLiberia, and Iraq; prevent future crises by creating a list of early \nwarning signs to alert policymakers of possible risks to women and \nchildren; foster stability in conflict-prone environments by focusing \non reducing threats to innocent civilians in crises around the world.\n\n  What my amendment does is provide a bridge for us to stand on until \nthis bill can be passed and this fund can be established. It says: Here \nis what we can do not, within our existing programs with our existing \nfunds.\n  The Landrieu amendment ensures that organizations and programs \ncurrently serving refugees and displaced persons incorporate \nprotections against violence; encourages the Secretary of State and \nAdministrator of USAID to incorporate into their current agenda \nspecific policies and programs that identify the specific needs of, and \nparticular threats to, women and children; asks for the Secretary to \nreport to Congress on their progress in this area to date and provide \nrecommendations for improving U.S. and international systems for the \nprotection of women and children.\n  Protecting women and children is not only the right thing to do, but \nit is also the smart thing to do. Women are a critical part of \nrebuilding war torn countries.\n  In March 2003, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan made the following \nobservation:\n\n       Study after study has shown that there is no effective \n     development strategy in which women do not play a central \n     role. When women are fully involved, the benefits can be seen \n     immediately: families are healthier and better fed; their \n     income, savings and reinvestment go up. And what is true of \n     families is also true of communities and, in the long run, of \n     whole countries.\n\n  A focus on safety and protection directly impacts the overall well \nbeing of women and children. This year's Mothers Index, published by \nSave the Children, reports that there is a direct correlation between \nunder education and poor health and conflict. Seven of the bottom ten \ncountries in the area of health and education are in conflict and post-\nconflict situations.\n  This amendment does not call for us to break the budget caps or \ncreate a new program. It merely ensures that every dollar that we are \nspending to secure the peace is spent in the most effective way \npossible.\n  Again, this amendment provides a bridge for us to stand on until the \nbill I just described can be passed in its complete authorized form. So \nthis fund can be established, and then the authorizing bill would come \nforward with more of the details.\n  But it is important that we take this step today to recognize the \nfact that there are so many women and children brutalized in war. It is \nnot just about the soldiers in uniform any longer, unfortunately. This \namendment asks the Secretary to report to Congress on their progress in \nthis area, and it encourages the Secretary of State and the \nAdministrator of USAID to incorporate into their current agenda \nspecific policies and programs that identify the specific needs of and \nparticular threats to women and children.\n  In conclusion, I submit that study after study has shown the \nnecessity of our effort to direct funds in this way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that specific quotes from individual young \nwomen and girls, particularly, be printed in the Record. The language \nis pretty graphic so I will not read it in the Chamber, but I want it \nprinted in the Record to say how serious this issue is in terms of the \nUnited States and all of the aid we are giving, and directing a portion \nof that, and to be cognizant of the tremendous torture, humiliation, \nand pain inflicted upon innocent women and children.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Protection From Sexual Violence and Physical Harm\n\n       ``From Pweto down near the Zambian border right up to Aru \n     on the Sudan/Uganda border, it's a black hole where no one is \n     safe and where no outsider goes. Women take a risk when they \n     go out to the fields or on a road to a market. Any day they \n     can be stripped naked, humiliated and raped in public. Many, \n     many people no longer sleep at home, though sleeping in the \n     bush is equally unsafe. Every night there is another village \n     attacked, burned and emptied. It could be any group, no one \n     knows, but always they take the women and girls away.''--\n     United Nations official in Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\n              Protection From Trafficking and Prostitution\n\n       ``My mother died when I was very small and my father worked \n     as a laborer on other people's farms. At the age of 16, I was \n     lured by my neighbor into a good job. Feeling the pressure \n     and hard times faced by my family and myself, I was very \n     pleased to receive this opportunity. I didn't realize that my \n     faith would land me into the brothel of Bombay. I spent the \n     hell of my life for one year there. Then I was sold to a \n     brothel in Calcutta. I spent three-and-a-half hears there, \n     and it was more bitter than ever. I'm happy that I was \n     rescued, but now I've started thinking who will rescue all \n     those Nepalese who are still in the brothels in many parts of \n     India? I'm worried for those sisters and request the stop of \n     such evil practices in the society.''--Sita, 23-year-old \n     former prostitute from Nepal\n       ``I was eleven when the rebels attacked our town in \n     Liberia. I got separated from my parents and was captured. I \n     stayed with the rebels for four years. Seven men raped me at \n     the same time and I was forced to pick up arms. I have one \n     child of the rebels--I don't know exactly which one the \n     father is. I escaped and went to Guinea. I had no caretaker \n     and started to work as a `hotel girl' (prostitute). I thank \n     Save the Children protection workers for having identified me \n     and offering me skill training.''--Florence, 18-year-old girl \n     living in a refugee camp in Guinea\n\n            Protection of Children From Military Recruitment\n\n       ``I've seen people's hands get cut off, a 10-year-old girl \n     raped and then die, and many men and women burned alive. So \n     many times I just cried inside, because I didn't dare cry out \n     loud.''--Mariama, 14-year-old girl soldier from Sierra Leone\n       ``During the fighting, you don't have time to think. Only \n     shoot. If a bad person gives an order, you have to follow it. \n     If he says burn the village, you have to burn it.

I hope it can be \naccepted. I hope there won't be a necessity for a vote on such a \ncommonsense and much-needed amendment. I ask for the Senate's \nconsideration at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJeffords and Senator Corzine be added as cosponsors to Byrd amendment \nNo. 1969.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is my amendment pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not yet pending, but if the Senator \ncalls for the regular order it will be.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I call for the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order has been called for. The \namendment is now pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1969\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Does that amendment need to be stated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not necessary.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask that it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes \n     amendment numbered 1969. At the appropriate place add the \n     following: Section (a) None of the funds made available by \n     this Act or any other Act may be used by the Coalition \n     Provisional Authority (CPA) unless the Administrator of the \n     Coalition Provisional Authority is an officer of the United \n     States Government appointed by the President by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate. (b) This provision shall be \n     effective March 1, 2004.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the clerk.\n  I suggest my statement in support of this amendment be entitled ``Too \nMuch Money, Too Little Accountability.'' That would be an appropriate \ntitle if I were to suggest it.\n  This is an amendment about accountability. This is an amendment to \nensure that those administration officials charged with spending \ntaxpayer funds are held accountable to the American people and to their \nrepresentatives in the Congress.\n  To date, the Coalition Provisional Authority, CPA, has not been held \naccountable for the money it spends, and that is your money. That is \nyour money, I say to the taxpayers of this great country. Those who \nspend it should be held accountable. That is what you believe, I am \nsure.\n  Not until the President requested $20 billion in reconstruction aid \nfor Iraq did the CPA make any effort to inform the Congress and the \npublic about the administration's reconstruction plans. Let me say that \nagain. This is an amendment about accountability. This is an amendment \nto ensure that those administration officials charged with spending \ntaxpayer funds are held accountable to the American people and to their \nrepresentatives in the Congress.\n  To date, the Coalition Provisional Authority has not been held \naccountable for the money it spends--your money. Not until the \nPresident requested $20 billion in reconstruction aid for Iraq did the \nCPA make any effort to inform the Congress and the public about the \nadministration's reconstruction plans.\n  The CPA's access to nonappropriated funds--now get this--has allowed \nit to maintain a low profile, so low that one cannot see it, and to \noperate largely outside the scope of congressional oversight.\n  Last fiscal year, the CPA, the Coalition Provisional Authority, in \nIraq spent $1.7 billion in assets frozen under the Saddam Hussein \nregime. The CPA spent almost $1 billion in assets seized after the war. \nThat is your money. The CPA spent $2.5 billion in oil revenues \ncollected through the United Nations Food for Oil Program. Altogether, \nit spent $7.5 billion in the fiscal year 2003, including $2.5 billion \nappropriated in the supplemental that was passed and enacted by \nCongress in April of this year.\n  This CPA did not appear before the Congress even once to explain how \nthose funds would be spent. This year, assuming that the Congress \nappropriates the $20 billion in reconstruction aid requested by the \nPresident, the CPA's budget will grow to $23 billion, which includes $2 \nbillion in unappropriated funds left over from last fiscal year and \nalmost $1 billion included in the supplemental for the Coalition \nProvisional Authority's administrative expenses.\n  At $23 billion, the Coalition Provisional Authority's budget will be \nmore than three times what it spent in the last fiscal year. Now, that \nwill be more than the Federal budget for seven Cabinets out of the 15 \nCabinet Departments that run the Federal Government. That is a lot of \nmoney to flow through the hands of the Coalition Provisional Authority \nin Iraq.\n  The CPA's budget is four times the budget of the Commerce Department. \nThink of that. Do we demand accountability from the Commerce \nDepartment? The CPA's budget is twice the size of the entire Interior, \nLabor, and Treasury Departments and it is billions of dollars larger \nthan the budgets of the Agriculture Department and the Justice \nDepartment.\n  The Senate gives its advice and consent to Presidential appointments \nto the highest level positions in the Bush administration, or any \nadministration. In the Clinton administration, Reagan administration, \nand Carter administration, the Senate gave its advice and consent to \nPresidential appointments to these high-level positions in the \nDepartments. Even a lowly second lieutenant in the Army--now get this. \nEven a lowly second lieutenant in the Army, who is responsible for the \ntwo dozen to three dozen soldiers under his command, is subject to the \nconfirmation by the Senate. And yet the official who is responsible for \ngoverning and rebuilding Iraq, a country made up of 23 million, 24 \nmillion people--the official with a budget larger than half the Federal \ndepartments and responsible for the livelihood of 23 million or 24 \nmillion Iraqis--is not subject to confirmation by the Senate.\n\n  As it stands today, the people's representatives--that is you, \nSenator. That is you, Senator. And that is you, I say to every other \nSenator and I say it to myself as well. As it stands today, the \npeople's representatives--that is us. I am talking about us--the \npeople's representatives in the Senate have no say in who leads the \nCPA, even though the administration's endeavors in Iraq have drained \n$118 billion from our budget, have seized tens of thousands of National \nGuardsmen from our States, and have so far taken the lives of 351 U.S. \nsoldiers in this war. The CPA claims to be vested with all the \nlegislative, executive, and judicial authority necessary to achieve the \nadministration's objectives in Iraq and yet the Congress has done \nnothing--nothing--to ensure that its administrator is held accountable \nto the American people.\n  Beginning March 1, 2004, my amendment would prohibit the Coalition \nProvisional Authority in Iraq from spending any appropriated funds \nuntil its administrator has been appointed by the President with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. Is it asking too much, that we ask \nthat the person, the one individual, the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority's administrator--is it asking too much that he be appointed \nby the President of the United States by and with the consent of the \nSenate? That is not asking too much. That is in defense of the American \ntaxpayer. That will make sure, yes, that person will be accountable to \nthe American taxpayer, to the American people, to the representatives \nof the American people in Congress.\n  The sums of money that are being spent in Iraq are enormous. This is \nnot just chickenfeed we are talking about. We are talking about huge \namounts of the taxpayers' money. That person should be accountable to \nthe taxpayers\n\n[[Page S13361]]\n\nof the country, accountable to the Congress of the United States, made \nup of the elected representatives of the people. The sums of money are \nenormous--$87 billion we spent, of which $20.3 billion would be in that \namount. I said a moment ago we have appropriated already $118 billion. \nThat includes the April supplemental and includes the supplemental we \njust passed. It was passed by the Senate. This is too much money to \nappropriate without ensuring that the decisionmakers in Iraq will be \nheld accountable to the American people. We owe it to the taxpayers, \ndon't we? Yes. We owe it to the taxpayers to do better than that.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, with all due respect to my good \nfriend from West Virginia, who has had many good ideas in his 45 years \nin the Senate, let me suggest this may not be one of them. What the \nSenator from West Virginia is suggesting here is that we change a \ntemporary position--a position currently held by Ambassador Bremer, \nwhich he is trying very hard to work his way out of by having at the \nearliest opportunity a chance to turn Iraq over to Iraqis and come \nhome--into a confirmed Senate position. Ambassador Bremer spent a lot \nof time back here testifying, as he should have, on the supplemental. \nBut the real job to do is over in Iraq, trying to get this new \ngovernment up and running, trying to get the Iraqi security force to a \nsubstantial level so we can begin to draw down American troops. I think \nmost of us have concluded we have too many positions that need to be \nconfirmed.\n  In fact, I can recall a meeting in my office earlier this year, right \nbefore the August recess, a bipartisan meeting discussing the \npossibility of reducing the number of positions which require \nconfirmation and having that bill take effect January 20, 2005, for \nwhoever the next President is, to try to make it possible for the next \nadministration to function more successfully without all of the \nproblems that come from an excessive number of confirmations.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld is the designated authority for Iraq. Of course, \nhe was confirmed by the Senate. Ambassador Bremer, the CPA \nadministrator, reports to the Secretary of Defense. During the \nconsideration of the supplemental, my good friend from Vermont tried to \nshift the authority from the Defense Department over to the State \nDepartment. Certainly an argument can be made for that. But that failed \non a vote of 56 to 42.\n  The fact is Ambassador Bremer, as I indicated earlier, is trying very \nhard to work his way out of this job. This is very much a temporary \nposition. We didn't go in there to be there a very lengthy period of \ntime. This temporary job can end the moment the Iraqis are in a \nposition to take over the administration of their own country. We all \nknow how lengthy confirmations can be. Do we really want to derail \nreconstruction by having Ambassador Bremer back here for lengthy \nconfirmation proceedings? He is already on the job. As I understand the \namendment, if this were to take effect and he were not to be confirmed \nby March 1 of next year, all the funding would be cut off. So this \nwould be an extraordinarily high profile confirmation.\n  I know my good friend from West Virginia thought this war was a \nmistake. He has been very clear about that. A Senator would have to be \nextraordinarily inattentive not to get the point that the Senator from \nWest Virginia believes the whole thing was a mistake. But I would say \nwith the utmost respect for my good friend, we are there. We are there \nnow. Regardless of how one felt about the process of getting us there, \nit seems to me we have a lot on the line in having this Iraqi effort be \nsuccessful, regardless of how we felt about going in.\n  I venture the opinion that no matter who the next President is, they \nwill try to finish the job in Iraq just like this administration is \nstill in Bosnia and Kosovo, an administration policy of the previous \nadministration.\n  This job needs to be finished. I plead with my colleagues. Let us not \nmake it any more difficult to wrap up this very tough assignment and \nhave Ambassador Bremer come back and do something else for the rest of \nhis life.\n  I hope the Byrd amendment will not be approved. We have had ample \nopportunity to cross-examine Ambassador Bremer and to question him on \nevery conceivable issue related to this, and I am sure we will have \nother opportunities to do it. But I think the confirmation process is \nsimply not appropriate for this particular position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time remains to the senior \nSenator from West Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 3 minutes, of course with an equal amount of time on the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to have a few minutes myself with an equal amount of time allotted \nto the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. I have a few words I would \nlike to say in attempting to rebut what my friend said.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I really have said all I wish to say. \nI would be happy to yield time, if I have any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit at this point.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thought we had 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from West Virginia \nthat I basically have completed my argument and am not interested \nnecessarily in having the last word. I would be anxious to move ahead \nwith a vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I didn't realize there was no time limit. \nI will be brief.\n  I have heard the arguments of my friend from Kentucky: Why stop \nthings now ahead of this confirmation? Unfortunately, while a great \ndeal of planning went into the war in Iraq--even though there was never \nany question of the outcome, because we are the most powerful nation \nhistory has ever known, of course, and we would succeed against a \nthird-rate or fourth-rate military power like Saddam Hussein--it \nappears that very little planning went into what happens after the war. \nOf course, there have been more American casualties since the President \nsaid the mission was accomplished, the war was over, and as he famously \ntaunted the Iraqis, ``Bring it on.'' Unfortunately, they did. But we \nsaw first a general being placed in there, which didn't work, and we \nput Paul Bremer in there, again without much planning. The \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky said we had debate on the floor \nabout the transfer from the Department of Defense to the State \nDepartment. That was defeated. I remember the debate very well. \nInterestingly enough, the talking points of the administration in \nopposition were that they are perfectly satisfied with having all of \nthis coordinated by the Secretary of Defense. There was no need to \nplace it anywhere but the Secretary of Defense. That was it, and the \nWhite House position carried.\n  What the White House talking points didn't say, and we all found out \nabout 3 days later, was they had already made the decision to take it \nout of the Department of Defense and put it into Dr. Rice's office. \nActually, moving it out of the Department of Defense had already been \ndecided by the White House. But as often happens when we are told one \nthing and something else is being done, the talking points coming over \nfrom the White House said they had every intention of leaving it--in \neffect emphatically every intention of leaving it--under the direction \nof the Under Secretary of Defense.\n  That probably should have been the tipoff, that they were emphatic \nand intended to leave it there. They had already made up their mind to \nleave it there. Of course, that is not how it turned out. But I worry \nbecause if you have somebody who is in charge of more foreign \nassistance than the Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID \ncombined, both of whom require confirmation, if you give all of this \npower to someone who does not require confirmation, what does that say \nabout our role in the Senate? What does that say about what we feel \nabout transparency and accountability?\n\n[[Page S13362]]\n\n  We are appropriating over $20 billion basically to be distributed \nsolely as the Administrator feels he should. That is more than the \nSecretary of State and the Administrator of the USAID get to \ndistribute, and they have to be confirmed. The answers were not \nforthcoming.\n  I think of the plan we were suddenly shown on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I recall the distinguished Senator from West Virginia asked \nfor more time and, of course, he could not get it. Ambassador Bremer \ncame here, and we were given a plan. They had gone out, apparently, for \na couple of months before saying what they were going to do. Then it \nturned out, amazingly, I know--I am just shocked to find this out--the \nplan was given only to the Republicans, maintaining the same kind of \npartisanship there is on this. We were supposed to ask questions of \nAmbassador Bremer. But only Republicans were allowed to see this plan \npaid for by the taxpayers of this country. When Democrats asked about \nit, he said, Well, I thought that had all been sent to you. Apparently \nthe mail only goes to 51 Senators and not to the other 49.\n  Be that as it may, the plan was interesting. It did say the United \nStates wanted to give the Iraqi people a chance to form a government \nand a country that would fulfill President Bush's vision for them. Some \nthought that was a little bit condescending to a country where \ncivilization goes back long before this country's was ever discovered. \nAt least we had a chance finally to talk about it.\n  The same way in which the White House told us the Secretary of \nDefense was the only one who should be in charge of this--we find they \nhad already made the decision; They did not tell us about it--\napparently they didn't tell the Secretary of Defense about it either. \nThey were yanking it out from him and putting it with somebody else.\n  My point is, if we are going to give somebody $20 billion to buy \n$33,000 pickup trucks and $6,000 telephones for Taj Mahal jail cells \nand have scholarships that are not available to Americans but \napparently will be to Iraqis, the person ought to be at least confirmed \nso we have a chance to ask questions.\n  I think the Senator from West Virginia is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, my amendment does not cut off funds for \nreconstruction, as I thought I understood the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky to say. If I am incorrect and did not hear him say that \nor indicate that, I certainly would be glad to be corrected.\n  My amendment would allow the President to allocate that money to \nother agencies but would not allow the CPA to spend that money until \nthe Administrator is confirmed by the Senate. This won't shut down \nfunding for the troops. The Senate has until March 1--4 months away--to \nconfirm the Administrator of the CPA. After the Homeland Security \nDepartment was created, for example, the Senate confirmed Governor Tom \nRidge in just a few short weeks--in just a matter of days. I think it \nwould be the same with Ambassador Bremer.\n  I certainly have no complaint with respect to Ambassador Bremer. My \namendment is not about Ambassador Bremer, currently the head of the \nCPA, and all of his potential successors. They will have a great deal \nof authority.\n  I say again that a lowly second lieutenant in the Army is subject to \nconfirmation by the Senate. Surely the head of CPA should be as well.\n  My colleague talks about the desire to bring the situation to a \nconclusion in Iraq as soon as possible.\n  I agree with him that the job in Iraq should be finished as soon as \npossible. But it should be carried out with accountability to the \nelected representatives of the American people.\n  I also add this postscript: Judging from the events as we have seen \nthem transpire going back several months, I don't believe this \nsituation in Iraq is going to end very quickly. It shows every \nindication of intensifying. We are in one big mess.\n  I remember a time when I believed if the President and the \nadministration were to hold out the olive branch and show an indication \nof willingness to share in economic and political responsibility in \nIraq with major European countries and other countries in Asia and \nelsewhere, if that willingness had been demonstrated some months ago, \nthere would be other major countries making large contributions in \ntreasure and in manpower in Iraq today. But that olive branch was not \nextended. That willingness to share economic and political \nresponsibility in Iraq was not voiced. It was not made manifest.\n  Now, I hope that the train has not gone by the station without \nstopping. As we see the horrific events unfolding in Iraq, I am not so \nsure that those major European erstwhile contributors would be so \nwilling even to contribute now. The back of the hand was extended to \nthem before the war and it has not been otherwise since the war, to any \nextent.\n  By virtue of these mistakes that the administration has made, it is \nnot my belief that the situation in Iraq is going to end all that \nquickly. I hope it will. But we should not bet on that. Therefore, it \nwould be appropriate to require the President appoint an Administrator \nand that the Senate be required to confirm or reject that person. That \nwould assure the American people of accountability and of \nresponsibility on the part of their elected representatives and on the \npart of the CPA Administrator. It is the right thing to do by the \nAmerican people. It is the right thing to do under the Constitution \nbecause the power of the purse is vested here, in the Congress, in this \nbody and the other body.\n  That power of the purse carries with it the duty of oversight. \nCongress cannot properly oversee an administrator who is not \naccountable to the Congress, an administrator who has not been \nconfirmed by the Senate. Therefore, Congress is not in a position to \ncarry out its responsibility under the Constitution of being \naccountable to the American people and in accordance with the words of \nthe Constitution.\n  I say that it is time the Senate act. The Senate has been silent too \nlong. The Senate was silent before the war. The Senate was silent \nbefore it voted on October 11 of last year to give the authority to the \nPresident of the United States to use the military forces of this \ncountry as he saw fit. The Congress gave the President of the United \nStates a blank check, as it were, with respect to authority to take \nthis Nation into war and to put these men and women, soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines, in harm's way. It was a most shameful moment when \nCongress washed its hands. One of the most shameful moments in the \nhistory of the Senate was when it passed the cusp and attempted to wash \nits hands of the responsibility of following the Constitution of the \nUnited States which says that Congress shall have the power to declare \nwar.\n  That moment has come and gone, but still, as the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky says, our people are there. We are now there. So \nwhat do we do?\n\n  I say to Senators, put yourselves into these desks, these chairs, \ninto these shoes of ours 1 year from today and look back and see if you \ncast the right vote on this amendment. How will it be 1 year from today \nif we find we are in deeper and deeper and deeper and it has become \nanother Vietnam--which I supported; I supported the war in Vietnam. I \nwas practically the last person out of Vietnam because I supported the \nPresident. I supported Johnson. I supported Nixon. I supported them all \nthe way. But one should learn by his mistakes.\n  We were ill advised when it came to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. We \nwere ill advised by the administration. I voted for it. Two Senators \nvoted against it. Wayne Morse said that the resolution would pass but \nthat those who voted for it would be sorry. I voted for it. I was \nsorry. I am sorry. We should learn by our mistakes.\n  We were not properly advised by that administration and we were not \nproperly advised by this administration. That is why we are in Iraq. I \nwill have more to say about that at another time.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kentucky is right. We are there. What \ndo we do? In this matter, we have a responsibility to hold Ambassador \nBremer, or whoever is the Administrator of the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority, accountable to the Congress.\n  It has been said that Mr. Bremer has already testified before the \nCongress in\n\n[[Page S13363]]\n\nsupporting the President's $87 billion request for Iraq. Of course he \ntestified. Yes, he testified. He was before the Appropriations \nCommittee a short time, a few hours. Ambassador Bremer wanted the \nCongress to give him $20 billion. But how often will he testify after \nhe receives the money? How receptive will he be to further invitations \nto testify before congressional committees once he has received a blank \ncheck, as it were?\n  Let's not delude ourselves to the extent which Ambassador Bremer was \nmade available to the Congress. He testified only once before the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and he did not have to respond to a \nsingle outside witness called to challenge the administration's lying. \nAmbassador Bremer went so far as to refuse to return to the \nAppropriations Committee to answer additional questions because, ``I \ndon't have time.'' He said that in response to me. I asked Ambassador \nBremer if he could make himself available and would make himself \navailable to the Senate Appropriations Committee in the event the \nchairman asked him to return and he said: I don't have time. I am sorry \nthat the transcripts have not been printed--yet--but the transcripts \nare around, the transcripts of the hearings.\n  He said: I don't have time. Can you imagine that? He wouldn't say \nthat if he had to be confirmed by the Senate. He would have time. He \nwould make himself available whether the Senate would be under the \ncontrol of the Republicans or under the control of the Democrats, \nwhatever. He would find time. He would be available. Yes, indeed.\n  So he said: I don't have time. I am completely booked, and I have to \nget back to Baghdad to my duties.\n  What are his duties? If he were required to be confirmed, his duty \nwould be to come back before the Senate and to answer questions, and to \nanswer questions under oath, if necessary.\n  Senators who believe that sufficient action has been taken to ensure \naccountability by the CPA Administrator are kidding themselves. The CPA \nhas not been sanctioned by the Congress. And Ambassador Bremer has not \nbeen confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Congress has no legislative ties to \nthe CPA or its Administrator. Congress has no strings by which it can \nsay to the Administrator: You come before this committee and, if \nnecessary, you be prepared to take an oath that what you say is the \ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.\n  That is a part of it. That is what we are talking about.\n  The secret national security directive that created the CPA dictates \nthat Ambassador Bremer shall report to the Secretary of Defense and the \nPresident. It does not mention the Congress. It does not mention the \nAmerican people.\n  When Tom Ridge was appointed Homeland Security Director after the \nSeptember 11 attacks, the White House refused to allow him to testify \nbefore Congress. The President said: No, he is a member of my staff.\n  Well, technically that was correct. The President opted to create a \nnew Homeland Security Department and reorganize the Federal Government \nrather than allow an unconfirmed member of his administration to \ntestify before the Congress.\n  That kind of record should not comfort Members of Congress. We have a \nresponsibility to the American people to ensure that the administration \nofficials responsible for the lives of their loved ones who are \nfighting in Iraq and for their taxpayer dollars that are being spent in \nIraq are held accountable for their actions. We must stop just passing \nthe buck along to the President.\n  With regard to the argument that holding these officials accountable \nwill somehow endanger our troops, I urge Senators to reject that flimsy \nscare tactic. What endangers the troops is not having their \ndecisionmakers held accountable to the people. When funds are being \nspent on postal ZIP Codes, garbage trucks, and escalator and garage \nbeautification projects rather than the necessities of the troops, that \nis when the Congress must be the most vocal in questioning the judgment \nof those in the administration who wield power.\n  I urge Senators to focus on the bigger picture. Senators should cast \ntheir votes not only with the thought of a Republican administration \ndirecting reconstruction efforts in Iraq, but with an image of a \nDemocratic administration directing the reconstruction efforts in Iraq. \nI think I know what the answer would be then.\n  We need to look beyond the party label of the current administration. \nI am not talking about Mr. Bremer. I spoke of his saying he didn't have \ntime, and he didn't. Those were his words, made of his own free will. \nMilton wrote about man's free will, ``Paradise Lost.'' Those were Mr. \nBremer's words. I have no reason to find fault with Mr. Bremer at all. \nHe is not there without confirmation by virtue of his choice. But that \nis the way it is. As Walter Cronkite used to say, that is the way it \nwas.\n  We need to look beyond the party label. We need to take a longer term \nview of accountability.\n  Let me say in closing, I thank my friend from Kentucky, who has \nalways been a gentleman with me, has always been straightforward with \nme, and has conducted himself, on this occasion, as on all others, as a \ngentleman should.\n  I thank him for his characteristic courtesy in this instance. I \nrespect his argument. I respect his vote. But the record will be made \nand the record will stand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am aware of no further debate on \nthis amendment. I assume the Senator would like a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. BYRD.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for accepting an amendment for the \nmanagers' package that deals with making sure we have something in the \ncriteria for the Millennium Challenge Account, assistance dealing with \npeople with disabilities.\n  Basically, the amendment makes a small but significant change to the \nMillennium Challenge Account ensuring that one criteria used in \ndetermining a country's eligibility for the Millennium Challenge \nAccount funds is their commitment to providing opportunities for the \ninclusion of people with disabilities. This account represents one of \nthe largest increases in foreign aid spending in half a century, about \n$1 billion this year and an additional $4 billion within the next 3 \nyears.\n  People with disabilities have been left out of our foreign assistance \nprograms for too long. This amendment does not require they do anything \nnew.\n  Since 1996, over 100 countries, including the United States, have \nsubmitted reports to the United Nations under implementation of 22 \nrules to equalize opportunities for people with disabilities. President \nBush has implemented a new freedom initiative in this country on behalf \nof people with disabilities. In 2001, he charged each agency with \nreviewing their policies to remove barriers that promote inclusion of \npeople with disabilities in American society. I commend and I \ncompliment President Bush for taking this step. This amendment takes \nthis initiative and extends it basically to our foreign assistance \nprograms.\n  I have a report from the National Council on Disability, dated \nSeptember 9, 2003. It is titled: ``Foreign Policy and Disability: \nLegislative Strategies and Civil Rights Protections To Ensure Inclusion \nof People with Disabilities.''\n  In the cover letter from the chairperson of the National Council on \nDisability to President Bush, Mr. Lex Frieden pointed out that in 1996:\n\n       NCD recommended a series of policy changes to ``ensure the \n     inclusion of people with disabilities in all foreign \n     assistance programs. . . .\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Seven years later, NCD has concluded that inclusion of \n     people with disabilities in U.S. foreign policy will be \n     achieved only when specific legislation is enacted to achieve \n     that purpose.\n\n  That is what we have done. We have added specific legislative \nlanguage to ensure in the Millennium Challenge Account one of the \ncriteria to be used is whether that country is trying to provide \nopportunities for the inclusion of persons with disabilities.\n  In the executive summary of this report filed by the National Council \non Disability, it says:\n\n       Individuals with disabilities are subject to a broad \n     pattern of discrimination of segregation in almost every part \n     of the world. In most countries, people with disabilities and \n     their families are socially stigmatized, politically \n     materialized and economically disadvantaged. The economic \n     cost to society of excluding people with disabilities is \n     enormous. No nation in the word will achieve its full \n     potential for economic development when it leaves out people \n     with disabilities. No society will be a complete democracy \n     unless people with disabilities can participate in public \n     life. Failure to respond to the concerns of people with \n     disabilities ignores one of the great humanitarian and human \n     rights challenges of the world today.\n       The United States is well positioned to lead the world in \n     demonstrating how to build on the tremendous human potential \n     of people with disabilities.\n       The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) represents a \n     sweeping commitment on the part of the U.S. government to \n     abolish discrimination against people with disabilities in \n     all walks of life.\n       At present, U.S. foreign policy does not reflect the great \n     accomplishments of people with disabilities within the United \n     States. U.S. citizens with disabilities cannot serve in many \n     embassies abroad because these buildings are physically \n     inaccessible. Qualified and talented individuals may be \n     excluded from U.S. government service abroad based on their \n     medical history.\n       The U.S. National Council on Disability (NCD) calls on the \n     Executive Branch and Congress to create a new foreign policy \n     that ensures access by people with disabilities to the \n     benefits of democracy and economic development around the \n     world.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of the National \nCouncil on Disability's report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Part I. Executive Summary and Conclusions\n\n       More than 600 million people, almost 10 percent if the \n     world's population, have a disability. This number will rise \n     dramatically in the coming years as the population ages and \n     as more people become disabled by AIDS. Rates of disability \n     are particularly high in post-conflict societies, among \n     refugee populations, and in countries with histories of \n     political violence. Even in stable societies, however, people \n     with disabilities make up the poorest of the poor. In some of \n     the world's poorest countries, according to the United \n     Nations (UN), up to 20 percent of the population has a \n     disability.\n       Individuals with disabilities are subject to a broad \n     pattern of discrimination and segregation in almost every \n     part of the world. In most countries, people with \n     disabilities and their families are socially stigmatized, \n     politically marginalized, and economically disadvantaged. The \n     economic cost to society of excluding people with \n     disabilities is enormous. No nation in the world will achieve \n     its full potential for economic development while it leaves \n     out people with disabilities. No society will be a complete \n     democracy unless people with disabilities can participate in \n     public life. Failure to respond to the concerns of people \n     with disabilities ignores one of the great humanitarian and \n     human rights challenges of the world today.\n       The United States is well positioned to lead the world in \n     demonstrating how to build on the tremendous human potential \n     of people with disabilities. It is among the world leaders in \n     protecting the civil rights of people with disabilities, with \n     legislation that seeks to ensure their full participation in \n     society, and in supporting their independent living. The \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) represents a sweeping \n     commitment on the part of the U.S. government to abolish \n     discrimination against people with disabilities in all walks \n     of life. Since the adoption of the Rehabilitation Act in \n     1973, U.S. civil rights laws have required all U.S. \n     government programs to be inclusive of and accessible to \n     people with disabilities. As they have exercised their rights \n     over the past 30 years, Americans with disabilities have \n     broken barriers to inclusion, shattered stereotypes about \n     their limitations, and contributed to the economic, cultural, \n     and political life of the nation.\n       At present, U.S. foreign policy does not reflect the great \n     accomplishments of people with disabilities within the United \n     States. U.S. citizens with disabilities cannot serve in many \n     embassies abroad because these buildings are physically \n     inaccessible. Qualified and talented individuals may be \n     excluded from U.S. government service abroad based on their \n     medical history. In addition to failing to protect U.S. \n     citizens with disabilities in foreign operations, U.S. \n     foreign policies and programs have generally not been \n     designed to respond to the concerns of individuals with \n     disabilities abroad. While the Foreign Assistance Act has \n     long established that ``a principal goal of the foreign \n     policy of the United States shall be to promote the increased \n     observance of internationally recognized human rights by all \n     countries,'' the rights of people with disabilities have been \n     long ignored.\n       The U.S. National Council on Disability (NCD) calls on the \n     Executive Branch and Congress to create a new foreign policy \n     that ensures access by people with disabilities to the \n     benefits of democracy and economic development around the \n     world. All U.S. foreign operations abroad (including foreign \n     assistance efforts) would be greatly improved if the \n     principles established in U.S. civil rights law--under the \n     Rehabilitation Act and the\n\n[[Page S13365]]\n\n     ADA--were applied to U.S. operations abroad. Such a policy \n     would require U.S. foreign assistance funding to be used in a \n     manner that is accessible to people with disabilities. Such \n     protections would also ensure that U.S. citizens and \n     contractors with disabilities would be protected against \n     discrimination in the implementation of U.S. programs abroad. \n     Leadership by U.S. citizens with disabilities in our foreign \n     operations would greatly improve our ability to respond to \n     the concerns of people with disabilities in other countries.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also ask unanimous consent that the cover letter \npreceding that by Mr. Lex Frieden also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Council on Disability,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2003.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the National Council on \n     Disability (NCD), I am submitting a report entitled Foreign \n     Policy and Disability: Legislative Strategies and Civil \n     Rights Protections To Ensure Inclusion of People with \n     Disabilities. This report is a follow-up to NCD's 1996 \n     Foreign Policy and Disability report that found continued \n     barriers to access for people with disabilities in U.S. \n     foreign assistance programs.\n       In the 1996 report, NCD recommended a series of policy \n     changes to ensure inclusion of people with disabilities in \n     all foreign assistance programs, including the establishment \n     of specific objectives for inclusion with a timetable for \n     their fulfillment. Seven years later, NCD has concluded that \n     inclusion of people with disabilities in U.S. foreign policy \n     will be achieved only when specific legislation is enacted to \n     achieve that purpose. This report reviews a number of models \n     that Congress has adopted for linking human rights and \n     foreign policy that can be adapted to ensure the inclusion of \n     people with disabilities. This report looks primarily at the \n     U.S. Department of State and the United States Agency for \n     International Development (USAID). Among the various \n     strategies and approaches to improve foreign assistance \n     policies and practices, NCD recommends that Congress amend \n     the Foreign Assistance Act to ensure inclusion of people with \n     disabilities in all U.S. programs by requiring every U.S. \n     agency operating abroad to operate in a manner that is \n     accessible and inclusive of people with disabilities. NCD \n     recommends that this be accomplished by, among other reforms, \n     amending the Foreign Assistance Act to create a Disability \n     Advisor at the State Department and creating an office on \n     Disability and Development at USAID.\n       NCD also calls on your Administration to recognize that all \n     U.S. government operations abroad should be brought into \n     compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act.\n       The principles of non-discrimination, access, and inclusion \n     of people with disabilities have been established as civil \n     rights. The reforms discussed in this report are needed to \n     ensure that people with disabilities can fully contribute to \n     U.S. foreign policies and programs abroad as they have done \n     so effectively at home.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lex Frieden,\n                                                      Chairperson.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I thank the manager and the ranking member for \nworking out the language. This may seem like a small thing but, believe \nme, this is big. This is going to say--and we look at other criteria--\nbut we will look at a country to see what they are doing to provide for \npeople with disabilities.\n  Quite frankly, this country ought to be taking the lead around the \nworld in that area because we have a lot to talk about in what we have \ndone in our own country since the Americans with Disabilities Act was \npassed in 1990. What we have done is shown that people with \ndisabilities can provide economic stimulus to a country. They can \nprovide part of that economic engine that a country needs. We have \nshown conclusively, no matter where you are, no matter what country, \nthat if your policy is one of exclusion of people with disabilities, \nkeeping them institutionalized, materialized, not fully participating \nin society, it costs that society more to do that than it does to \ninclude them in education, for example, transportation, employment, and \ncultural affairs.\n  My amendment was designed basically to implement what the National \nCouncil on Disability concluded when they said, ``The inclusion of \npeople with disabilities in United States foreign policy will be \nachieved only when specific language is enacted to achieve that \npurpose.'' That is what we have done this evening with the inclusion of \nthis amendment.\n  I only hope when we go to conference with the House that we can have \nthe support of the administration. As I said, President Bush had an \nenlightened policy on people with disabilities when he came in in 2001. \nI hope the White House will take that inclusion policy of theirs and \nmake sure we keep it in this foreign operations appropriations bill for \nthe next year and that they will use the Millennium Challenge Account \nto promote and to stimulate other countries in thinking about how they \ncan provide for the inclusion of people with disabilities.\n  I thank Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, and their respective staffs \nfor working on this issue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 2001; 2002; 2003; 1995, As Modified Further; 2004; \n2005; 2006; 1973; 2007; 2008; 2009; 2010; 2011; 2012; 2013; 2014; 2015; \n         1998, As Modified; 2016; 2017; 2018; and 2019; En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2004\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on August 31, 2002, two American \nschoolteachers and one Indonesian citizen who were working at an \ninternational school for the children of Freeport McMoRan's mine \nemployees were killed, and eight more Americans were wounded, when they \nwere ambushed on a mountain road in Indonesia. Indonesian garrisons \nreportedly controlled all access to the remote road where the attack \noccurred. Police reports indicated that the Indonesian military was \nvery likely involved in the attack, but the investigation was then \nturned over to that same military, where it has stalled. The Indonesian \nmilitary, to date, has proven unwilling to fully cooperate with the \nFBI.\n  The survivors of the attack and the families of the murdered want \ntheir government to insist that Indonesia cooperate in uncovering the \ntruth about the ambush and in bringing those responsible to justice. \nThe Senate should support them.\n  The House already has. Congressman Hefley of Colorado offered an \namendment linking resolution of this issue to Indonesia's access to the \nInternational Military Education and Training program when the House \nconsidered the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. His amendment \nwas accepted by unanimous consent. The Senate should send an equally \nunequivocal signal.\n  Today I offered an amendment, with the support of Senators Campbell \nand Wyden, to do just that. I appreciate the support of the managers, \nSenators McConnell and Leahy, who have accepted this amendment into the \nlarger bill. I also appreciate the efforts of Senator Allard, who \nshares my interest in this issue.\n  My amendment is not out of step with current policy. I would like to \ncall my colleagues' attention to an article from the October 23 edition \nof the Australian Financial Review. The article states that, during \ntheir recent talks in Bali, ``Mr. Bush told Mrs. Megawati military \nrelations could not resume until Jakarta had completed a full \ninvestigation into the killing of two Americans near the Freeport mine \nin Timika in Indonesia's Papua province last year.'' Our President was \nright to make that point. There can be no ``business as usual'' when it \ncomes to the murder of American citizens, and there can be no \n``business as usual'' until the FBI has received full cooperation, and \nany perpetrators uncovered by the investigation are held accountable \nfor their actions.\n  This amendment simply makes it clear that the Senate wholeheartedly \nendorses that policy. It states that the full normalization of the \nmilitary relationship between the United States and Indonesia cannot \nbegin until the FBI has received full cooperation, not partial \ncooperation, in its investigation, and individuals found to be \nresponsible are brought to justice. I am pleased that the Senate has \ntaken action to make certain that our resolve is firm and our signal \nperfectly clear.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2020\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I also have an amendment by Senator \nFeingold that has been approved on both sides. I send the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 2020.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds to support the development of responsible \n        justice and reconciliation mechanisms in central Africa)\n\n       On page 147, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n  responsible justice and reconciliation mechanisms in central africa\n\n       Sec. 692. (a) Of the funds appropriated under title II \n     under the heading ``economic support fund'', $12,000,000 \n     should be made available to support the development of \n     responsible justice and reconciliation mechanisms in the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, and \n     Uganda, including programs to increase awareness of gender-\n     based violence and improve local capacity to prevent and \n     respond to such violence.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am aware of no opposition to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2020) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gregg \nbe added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1968 relating to the Leahy \namendment on war crimes in Africa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are very close to completing the \nbill. We have a couple of problems on this side that are not yet worked \nout. We have a few more amendments we are working on which we are going \nto clear tonight. For the moment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1966\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share a few comments \nabout the DeWine-Durbin amendment. It is well meaning. It is dealing \nwith a critical subject that I am particularly interested in: the \nspread of AIDS in Africa.\n  I think we can do better in a lot of ways about how to confront that \nissue. I appreciate Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy today agreeing \nto an amendment that I proposed to deal with the medical transmission \nof AIDS. But I would just say a couple of things here.\n  We are moving to a historic increase in the amount of money we are \nspending for AIDS. The $15 billion we have approved is quite a \nsignificant increase in this important effort throughout the world, \nparticularly in Africa.\n\n[[Page S13369]]\n\n  If this amendment is passed, it would add another $289 million to the \n$2 billion that was requested by the President. I would like to offer \ninto the Record and quote from a letter dated October 16 to Chairman \nStevens of the Appropriations Committee from Mr. Joseph O'Neill, deputy \ncoordinator and chief medical officer, Office of the Global AIDS \nCoordinator.\n  As I said, this is in his letter of October 16:\n\n       Dear Chairman Stevens: It is my understanding that an \n     amendment regarding funding for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \n     malaria may be offered today to the Fiscal Year 2004 \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill currently under \n     consideration on the Senate floor.\n       I want to reiterate the Administration's strong support for \n     the Fiscal Year 2004 budget request of $2 billion for all \n     international HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria activities, \n     including $200 million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria, as part of the President's larger \n     commitment to spend $15 billion over the next five years \n     through the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. I also want to \n     highlight that it is by careful design that the President's \n     Fiscal Year 2004 budget request is for $2 billion.\n       The cornerstone of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \n     Relief is its focused approach to use $9 billion in new \n     funding over the next five years to bring comprehensive and \n     integrated HIV/AIDS prevention, care and large-scale \n     antiretroviral treatment to 14 countries in Africa and the \n     Caribbean. These countries are home to nearly 70 percent of \n     HIV-infected persons in Africa and the Caribbean and 50 \n     percent of the HIV-infected persons in the world. There are \n     considerable challenges inherent in meeting the bold goals \n     the President has set for these 14 countries which must be \n     addressed in the early years of implementation. We believe it \n     is important to ramp up spending on these countries in a \n     focused manner, increasing the amount spent each year to \n     efficiently and effectively create the necessary training, \n     technology, and infrastructure base needed to deliver \n     appropriate long-term medical treatment in a sustainable and \n     accountable way.\n\n  That is a mouthful, but I think it says some valuable things. This \nadministration believes we have to effectively utilize the money, and \nit takes some time. It is certainly necessary for training, technology, \nand infrastructure that there be a base of that before we can fully \nimplement and spend this extra amount of money we intend to spend.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Similarly, the U.S. Government support for the Global Fund \n     to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is strong. Currently, \n     the United States is responsible for 40 percent of all \n     contributions made to the Global Fund. We have reached a \n     critical time in the Global Fund's development, and other \n     nations must join the United States in supporting the work of \n     the Global Fund.\n       For the reasons stated above, the Administration strongly \n     opposes any efforts to increase funding beyond the $2 billion \n     requested in the President's Fiscal Year 2004 budget. I \n     appreciate your support on this issue and look forward to the \n     continued strong bipartisan support of the Senate in ensuring \n     the success of this lifesaving initiative. It is signed: \n     Joseph F. O'Neill, MD, Deputy Coordinator and Chief Medical \n     Officer, Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator.\n\n  One of our Senators, Mr. Alexander, on September 3 made this \nstatement. It has a lot of truth to it. He came back from a trip to \nAfrica. He wrote an op-ed piece. He gave 10 very wise and practical \nbits of advice to the leadership in this AIDS effort on the Senate \nfloor on September 3. This is one of his final bits of advice on how to \nhandle the situation.\n\n       Finally, move fast, but do not spend too fast. I imagine we \n     are going to have a pretty good debate about that in the \n     Senate. I have already heard some people say let's spend $2 \n     billion and others say let's spend $2.5 and others say let's \n     spend $3 billion. The fact is, we are going to spend $15 \n     billion of taxpayers' money in fighting HIV/AIDS in 14 \n     countries and the Caribbean. We are going to do it over 5 \n     years. We need to keep in mind that the African system cannot \n     absorb too much money too quickly. There are treatment \n     guidelines to prepare and to teach. They are very \n     complicated. There is a staff to recruit. There are patients \n     to find and persuade. There are health care organizations to \n     establish.\n\n  This amendment unfortunately is not offset. I would be very \ninterested in seeing if we could fund this or we could utilize this \nmoney. I am very reluctant to not support an amendment Senator DeWine \nhas worked so hard on. He is a person committed to doing the right \nthing. He is a person committed to fighting AIDS. He wants to see us do \neven more than we are doing. I respect that. I admire him terrifically. \nHe has been around this world. He has met people who are suffering. He \nwants to help, as we all do.\n  But the problem is, we agreed to a budget. I serve on the Budget \nCommittee. That budget is a very serious matter. We decided we could \nspend only so much money. This foreign operations bill has a limit on \nthe amount of money we have agreed to spend in foreign operations. If \nthis amendment were to frame itself in terms of having an offset, that \nit would fund this $289 million out of the billions of dollars in this \naccount and would show where we could withdraw and reduce some of those \nother accounts, I would be very tempted to support Senator DeWine's \namendment. Unfortunately, it does not. It spends on top of the budget. \nIt increases and breaks the budget. It is $289 million above the amount \nwe have agreed we could afford to spend. I can't see us doing that.\n  There are so many good ideas here. There are so many things we can do \nin this country and outside of this country. We have another increase \nin spending this year in our Federal appropriations bills. We would all \nlike to spend more on projects than we are able to. But we have an \nincrease that is not slashing our budget. We are not cutting our \nbudget, even though we are going to set a record this year for deficit \nspending. We are going to set a record in deficit spending this year. \nBut we can't continue to break the budget we fought so hard to create, \na budget most of us committed to staying with.\n  Maybe somewhere, as this process goes along, there can be some \noffsets that can help increase funding for the Global AIDS Program. I \nhope so. But I have, as so many have, voted against extra spending for \nthings I care about--IDEA, kids in school, education, highways, matters \nI believe in and care about, when they exceed our budget. I have not \nbeen able to support them. I will not be able to support this one.\n  I know all of us have priorities, items we care passionately about. I \ncertainly do. I know Senators DeWine and Durbin do. I respect their \nconcerns and their passion. We are going to have a huge increase in \nspending for HIV/AIDS in Africa. It is the right thing to do. I have \nhad two hearings in the HELP Committee on which I am a member on the \nAIDS problem in Africa. I have concluded we can do more for medical \ncare. The amendment I crafted deals with rearranging the moneys we plan \nto expend to focus on that problem which can result in the greatest \nimmediate decline in infections of any other action we could take. I \ncannot go along with breaking the budget on this matter. I hope we can \nwork on it. I will certainly be willing to work with the Senator and we \nwill see what we can do to increase this funding as we can.\n  The budget is an important matter. We don't need to get in the habit \nof breaking it. I will not vote to break it in this instance.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  reforestation program in afghanistan\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Chairman McConnell for the hard \nwork he has put into the Fiscal Year 2004 Foreign Operations and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill. It is a challenging process, and \nhe has done an excellent job balancing competing interests within the \nconfines of a limited budget allocation.\n  I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the \nSubcommittee regarding the development of a reforestation program in \nAfghanistan. In this appropriations bill, with the adoption of an \namendment the chairman and ranking member and I have worked on, $5 \nmillion is to further a reforestation program in Afghanistan. I \nrecently traveled to the Middle East with the chairman and witnessed \nfirst hand the devastating conditions of the natural landscape in \nAfghanistan.\n  As the chairman of Public Lands and Forestry Subcommittee, it saddens \nme to see the degradation that has occurred to the natural landscape of \nthis country. Years of war and poverty have put a great strain on the \necosystems of this country. It is time to put an end to the denuding of \nthe hillsides and turn them back to their brilliant shades of green.\n\n[[Page S13370]]\n\n  I would like to see this funding be used to develop a reforestation \nprogram for the country. I think it is important to cultivate the \nnative species to replenish and rejuvenate the area to provide \nadditional opportunities for recreation, wildlife, and business \ndevelopment. The intent of this provision is that the expertise and \nskill of land grant universities, such as the University of Idaho, \nshould be used to assist in developing this program. I also feel that \nthis is an area in which the private sector could lend their assistant \nwith both the development of the program and the reforestation of the \ncountry. Again, there are also leading edge forest products companies \nin my State like Potlatch Corporation and Boise Cascade who also have \nexpertise of their own and a long time working relationship with the \nuniversity.\n  This is an opportunity, through active management, to change the fate \nof the natural landscape of Afghanistan.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I commend the Senator for his interest in this project \nand look forward to the development of the reforestation program.\n\n\n            Landmine Awareness Programs for Afghan Children\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for over two decades, the Afghan people have \nendured conflict and internal unrest. And although they are now in the \nprocess of rebuilding their country, for many, safety remains elusive. \nOne reason is the continued presence of landmines, which were put into \nuse by occupying powers and governments such as the Soviet Union and \nTaliban. Unfortunately, these weapons, whose danger is recognized by \nnations throughout the world, remain a major threat to the safety of \nordinary Afghans--especially children.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Leahy, has been a leader in calling the \nworld's attention to the dangers created by land mines and the \nobligation of the United States and other governments to help ensure \nthat innocent civilians, especially children, are not killed or \ncritically injured by land mines and unexploded ordnance left behind \nafter armed conflict ceases.\n  There are now over 10 million land mines throughout Afghanistan. This \nnumber is truly staggering. It is estimated that the process of \nclearing these devices could take up to 25 years--almost three decades. \nThese land mines pose a tremendous danger to the children of \nAfghanistan. As my colleagues may be aware, Afghan children often \nperform a variety of chores that entails their passage through mine-\nladen fields. In fact, as several types of mines are small and brightly \ncolored, children can be tempted to pick them up or to play with them. \nToo often, young Afghans die or lose a limb as a result of landmine-\nrelated incidents. Indeed, every month, 150 Afghans are injured by \nlandmines, and many of these are children.\n  We need to help these innocent children. We need to protect them not \nonly from the horrors of war, but from the dangers that are left \nbehind. Let me call to the attention of my colleagues an ideal \norganization to further this effort. Its name is ``No Strings,'' and it \nis a new aid organization that seeks to use theater and puppetry to \nprovide life-saving education about landmines to children in \nAfghanistan. ``No Strings'' is composed of two main groups: one with a \nbroad background in humanitarian relief organizations, and the other \nwith extensive experience in the field of children's educational \nentertainment and puppetry. I believe my colleague, Senator Leahy also \nis aware of this organization.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment so that, ``No Strings''--and \nother worthy organizations--would be able to engage Afghan children and \nteach them life saving mine safety lessons. Clearly, we must act in \norder to help to protect a generation of Afghans. However, since \nSenator Leahy has generously offered to join with me in discussing this \nmatter with appropriate officials at the State Department to encourage \nthe Department to fund innovative programs like ``No Strings,'' I will \nwithhold offering the amendment at this time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague from Connecticut \nthat we need to give special attention to children in Afghanistan and \nelsewhere who are being put at risk by landmines and unexploded \nordnances that are a dangerous byproduct of the civil conflict in that \ncountry. Creative ways to teach children about the dangers that \nlandmines and unexploded ordnances pose is critically needed to prevent \nany more innocent Afghani children from being killed or crippled. I \nbelieve that organizations, such as ``No Strings'' which has been \nmentioned by Senator Dodd, that are prepared to develop novel programs \nto protect children from the dangers of landmines are worthy of US \nsupport. I look forward to working with Senator Dodd in support of \nfunding for such important projects.\n\n\n                  international water security center\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would like to ask the assistant minority leader two or \nthree questions about international water security. First, what do we \nmean by water security and what is its relevance to foreign operations?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the question asked by my friend, the senior \nSenator from Vermont. As you know, water is vital for the life and \nhealth of people and ecosystems and a basic requirement for the \ndevelopment of countries. Yet, around the world, people lack access to \nadequate and safe water to meet their most basic needs. Water resources \nand the related ecosystems that provide and sustain them are under \nthreat from pollution, unsustainable use, land-use changes, climate \nchange and many other forces. Water shortages and degradation \ndisproportionately affect arid regions of the world, many of which lack \nthe technical and financial wherewithal to effectively address the \nproblems. Water and poverty are closely related. In areas of water \nscarcity, the poor are hit first and hardest. Conversely, water is the \nsingle factor most limiting economic development in many arid regions. \nThere is, of course, a huge diversity of needs and situations around \nthe world, but together we have one common goal: to provide water \nsecurity. This means ensuring that freshwater, coastal and related \necosystems are protected and improved; that sustainable development and \npolitical stability are promoted; and that every person has access to \nenough safe water at an affordable cost to lead a healthy and \nproductive life.\n  Water security is closely linked to national security. As we in the \nwest are fond of saying, ``whiskey is for drinking; water is for \nfighting.'' That may sound tongue-in-cheek, but in reality, there \nexists a long history of international tensions and conflicts over \nwater resources, the use of water systems as weapons during war, and \nthe targeting of water systems during conflicts caused by other \nfactors. Strategic areas of the Middle East, South and Central Asia, \nSouth America and North Africa are plagued by recurring tensions over \ntransboundary allocation of scarce water resources.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I understand that over 1 billion people do not have \naccess to safe and secure sources of drinking water. Does my friend \nfrom Nevada have any thoughts on additional actions this subcommittee \ncan take to promote international water security?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the question from my friend, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky. To achieve water security, we face the serious \nchallenges of meeting basic needs, securing the food supply, protecting \necosystems, sharing water resources, managing risks, valuing water, and \ninvolving stakeholders in governing water wisely, while maintaining a \nbalance between social, political, cultural, environment needs. The \nchallenges are formidable, but so are the opportunities.\n  There are many experiences around the world that can be built upon. \nFor example, through our experiences in managing scarce water resources \nin the desert State of Nevada, we have gained a valuable knowledge base \nupon which other arid and water-starved regions can build. Scientists \nin our university system are recognized among the foremost world \nleaders in water management in these lands. As an important initiative \nto increase water security, they have prepared an impressive proposal \nto launch an International Water Security Center.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. What do you envision as the role of an International Water \nSecurity Center?\n  Mr. REID. The center would be a clearinghouse for scientific research \nin support of water conflict resolution. As a focal point for advanced \nresearch and education in water security issues, it would bring \ntogether scientists, engineers, water managers, and policy\n\n[[Page S13371]]\n\nmakers from arid and other water-starved regions worldwide. Through \ncollaborative research exchanges, the center would promote long-term \ncapacity building in developing countries, which would benefit from our \nleadership in desalinization, water treatment, hydrologic modeling, \nwater-use efficiency, and other technical approaches. The center would \nalso support education of young Americans in international water policy \nand security, an area of expertise that we will certainly need in the \nfuture. The wide spectrum of cultures and landscapes would broaden the \noutlook of everyone involved, fostering the multidisciplinary \napproaches needed to ensure project viability and longevity.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Where might the center be based?\n  Mr. REID. The University and Community College System of Nevada would \nprovide an excellent home for the center. Through the research and \neducational programs undertaken by its major institutions, this \nUniversity System is known throughout the world for its expertise in \nwater resource and watershed management. For example, the Desert \nResearch Institute, or DRI, is a unique blend of academia and \nentrepreneurship. Grounded in fundamental research, DRI and its Center \nfor Watersheds and Environmental Sustainability apply scientific \nunderstanding to the management of scarce water resources in countries \naround the world while addressing needs for economic diversification \nand science-based education.\n  The University of Nevada, Reno, and University of Nevada, Las Vegas \ncollaborate with DRI and conduct nationally recognized research and \neducational programs in their own right. The University of Nevada, \nReno, UNR, has one of the Nation's largest and well-known education \nprograms in the study of groundwater. A new international program at \nUNR sends undergraduate and graduate students to work with local \nvillagers in some of the world's most impoverished nations. This \ntraining works both ways, helping the world's poorest people and \ntraining American students to work safely and effectively overseas. At \nthe University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, the interdisciplinary \neducational program in Water Resource Management considers the \nscientific and engineering aspects of the hydrologic sciences within \nthe context of policy and management issues related to water and water \nsecurity. The expertise of UNLV's William S. Boyd School of Law in the \nfield of water rights and water allocations is also a fundamental to \nthis program.\n  With its strong tradition of fundamental research and collaboration, \nthe University and Community College System of Nevada is perfectly \npoised to host an International Water Security Center. The University \nSystem is overseen by a chancellor and a 13-member Board of Regents.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much funding is requested and how would it be used?\n  Mr. REID. I am requesting an annual appropriation of $1.25 million \ndollars each year for the next 3 years. This funding would be used to \ndevelop an administrative structure, identify potential collaborators \nand projects, initiate ``seed'' projects, educate and train American \nstudents in water security, launch research initiatives, and develop \nand implement a plan for continued center activities without the need \nfor additional Congressional appropriations. The funding would be \nadministered by the University of Nevada Chancellor's office, and made \navailable to scientists and researchers throughout the University \nSystem. The Chancellor's office has a long tradition and expertise in \nadministering federal, state and non-profit research grants.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, S. 1426, the fiscal year 2004 Foreign \nOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act \nfor 2004, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations \nprovides $18.1 billion in discretionary budget authority and $20.3 \nbillion in discretionary outlays in fiscal year 2004 for Foreign \nOperations appropriations. This bill contains about two-thirds of total \ninternational affairs spending in the budget. The bill funds U.S. \nExport and Investment Assistance, Bilateral Economic Assistance, \nMilitary Assistance, and Multilateral Economic Assistance.\n  The bill equals the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget \nauthority and is $9 million in outlays below the 302(b) allocation. The \nbill provides $796 million less in budget authority and $713 million \nless in outlays than the President's budget request. The bill provides \n$5.6 billion in budget authority less and $148 million in outlays more \nthan the 2003 enacted level including 2003 supplemental appropriations. \nExcluding those supplemental appropriations, the bill provides a $1.866 \nbillion increase over last year, or 11.5 percent.\n  I am concerned about a proposed amendment that would add funds for \nGlobal HIV/AIDs programs without providing an offset within the bill. \nAny amendments that add funding without offsets will have a budget act \nviolation and I will not be able to support them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nS. 1426, FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS, 2004.--SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                 [Fiscal year 2004, dollars in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority.............       18,093           44       18,137\n    Outlays......................       20,294           44       20,338\nSenate Committee allocation:\n    Budget authority.............       18,093           44       18,137\n    Outlays......................       20,303           44       20,347\n2003 level:\n    Budget authority.............       23,708           45       23,753\n    Outlays......................       20,146           45       20,191\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............       18,889           44       18,933\n    Outlays......................       21,007           44       21,051\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............       17,119           44       17,163\n    Outlays......................       20,182           44       20,226\n \n                    Senate-Reported Bill Compared To\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority.............            0            0            0\n    Outlays......................           -9            0           -9\n2003 level:\n    Budget authority.............       -5,615           -1       -5,616\n    Outlays......................          148           -1          147\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority.............         -796            0         -796\n    Outlays......................         -713            0         -713\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority.............          974            0          974\n    Outlays......................          112            0          112\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I take a brief moment to draw the \nattention of my colleagues to the situation in Cambodia, and in \nparticular to the continued courage and determination of the Alliance \nof Democrats.\n  The Alliance--which consists of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party and \nthe royalist FUNCINPEC party--has taken a bold stand for freedom in \nCambodia in the wake of flawed parliamentary elections last July. \nDespite intimidation and pressure from the ruling Cambodian People's \nParty, CPP, the Alliance is refusing to enter into a coalition \ngovernment that is led by Prime Minister Hun Sen--himself an enemy of \ndemocracy and justice.\n  Having met with Alliance leaders in Washington not too long ago, and \nhaving personally traveled to Cambodia in 1998, I can appreciate their \nrefusal to allow Hun Sen to continue to mislead that country. In the \npast, senior Alliance leaders have been targets of assassination \nattempts, a bloody coup d'etat staged by the CPP, and imprisonment and \npolitical exile. Under Hun Sen's misrule, terrorists, criminal triads \nand pederasts find a haven in Cambodia. Corruption is the norm in that \ncountry, as are politically motivated killings.\n  It might interest my colleagues to know that there have been two high \nprofile shootings in Phnom Penh over the past several weeks, both \nvictims being affiliated with the FUNCINPEC party. Reporter Chour \nChetharith was murdered outside the Ta Prohm radio station. According \nto press reports, the ``execution-style killing followed a warning by \nPrime Minister Hun Sen . . . that Ta Prohm should stop broadcasting \nprograms critical of his speeches.''\n  Pop singer Touch Sunnich was shot a few short days ago--her only \ncrime apparently being a supporter of non-CPP party. My heart goes out \nto these victims and their families.\n  It is not enough for the diplomatic community to condemn this \nkilling. It\n\n[[Page S13372]]\n\nis past time that someone is held accountable for all the lawlessness, \nviolence, and corruption that unfortunately has become the norm in \nCambodia. I offer to my colleagues that the Alliance is trying to do \njust that by holding Hun Sen accountable--and they deserve the full \nbacking and support of the international community.\n  Let me close by expressing my great disappointment with the U.S. \nEmbassy in Phnom Penh. Recently, they issued a visa to travel to the \nUnited States to a notorious human rights abuser and gangster in \nCambodia--Chief of the National Police Hok Lundy. Why the Embassy would \nissue a visa to someone considered by many of his own compatriots to be \na terrorist is beyond me. It is no understatement that Hok Lundy is the \nLi Peng of Cambodia--and should be held accountable for the violence \nfollowing the 1998 elections.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there are four remaining amendments \nthat have been cleared on both sides: One by Senator Brownback \nproviding funds for certain programs in Tibet; Senator Leahy, \nadditional funds for the related accounts; Senator Kennedy regarding \nHIV/AIDS; Senator Frist, myself, Senator Leahy, technical \nclarifications on HIV/AIDS.

Mr. President, I come to the Chamber to express my \nprofound sorrow to the families in southern California who have lost \ntheir homes and some who have lost their loved ones during this \nconflagration of fire. I extend my sympathy to the millions of citizens \nin southern California who have lost part of their rural refuge to \nthese massive wildfires.\n  Thirteen fires are burning an estimated 600,000 acres of brush and \ntrees, and over 1,900 structures, as of this morning, have been burned. \nThe fire has put thousands of others at risk and, of course, land and \nmud slides will come with the winter rains. More than 50,000 people \nhave been evacuated as we speak. Over $20 million has been spent thus \nfar on fire suppression.\n  Yesterday our President declared Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San \nDiego, and Ventura Counties as major disaster areas and ordered Federal \naid to supplement State and local recovery efforts.\n  The Old Fire, which started Saturday morning and by Sunday had merged \nwith the Grand Prix Fire, had grown to over 52,000 acres in only a \nmatter of a few hours. It is expected now, as we speak, to consume Lake \nArrowhead today. Many firefighters on the ground are describing this \nfire as Armageddon. For communities such as Lake Arrowhead, that have \nbeen suffering through the third year of western bark beetle epidemic, \nthe fire was their worst nightmare. Now it has come true.\n  In the San Bernardino greater forest area around Lake Arrowhead, over \n90,000 acres are now dead. They are simply kindling, standing, waiting \nfor the wave of fire that is now striking that forest. If the U.S. \nForest Service had had a streamlined NEPA and appeals process that \nrecognized the importance of dealing with insects, disease, and damage \nfrom windstorms and ice storms, and fire, the Forest Service might have \nhad the opportunity to cut fuel breaks between the live forests and the \nwildland and the urban interface.\n  Sadly, the Senate has been fiddling around with H.R. 1904, and now \nsouthern California is ablaze. Not all of H.R. 1904 would have been \ndirected to the California problem, but now that we are into the \nstanding timber areas of San Bernardino, and we have watched that \nforest die through bug infestation, unable to do anything about it, \nhere is where it could have helped. The wildland urban interface, where \nfirebreaks could have been built, where the fire could have come down \nfrom the trees and onto the ground, many homes could have been saved.\n  If the Forest Service didn't approach every project as a one-size-\nfits-all NEPA process, they might have been able to thin the forest out \na little, which would have increased the intensity and strength of the \nwestern bark beetle epidemic and perhaps reduce this risk of \nconflagration.\n  If a viable forest products industry still existed in the area, one \nwhich closed its doors in the mid-1980s due to the Forest Service's \nfailure to manage\n\n[[Page S13373]]\n\nand thin the forest through the removal of trees, some of this pain and \nsuffering might have been avoided.\n  While it is the Forest Service's duty to manage the lands entrusted \nto them, we in the Congress also must take some blame. It seems that we \nhave forgotten to provide the leadership the agency needs to understand \nour expectation of them.\n  This is not new. Many of us have stood on this floor and many experts \nhave spoken on the issue of forest health for a decade--whether it is \nthe lower Sierras or the San Bernardino or the forests of Idaho or all \nof the Great Basin region of the West. We have 190 million acres now of \ndead and dying forests. The great tragedy is that California, with the \nSanta Ana winds that come this time of year, set up the perfect \nscenario, and now the great tragedy is hitting.\n  This Congress has to deal with the issue. Senator Feinstein has been \non the Senate floor working with it. She and I have worked together \nwith the appropriate committees--the Agriculture Committee, and my \ncolleague, Mike Crapo, Senator Cochran, Senator Domenici--we have all \ncome together to try to solve this problem. We have a solution and it \nis H.R. 1904, and it is a positive step forward.\n  It is now time for this Senate to debate this bill, vote it up or \ndown. I see my colleague from California on the floor. I turn to her \nand most sincerely say, Mr. President, I express great sadness and \nsorrow for the tragedy now underway in her State. I wish it was over. \nBut the firestorm that is sweeping across southern California today \nwill only die with the winds and when we begin a positive effort at \nrestoring the health of our natural lands and forested areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13373-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On March 17, 1999, Murietta, CA, resident Randy Bowen, who is black, \nwas attacked at a party in the Lake Skinner Hills. Bowen's two white \nassailants were self-proclaimed white supremacists. They first hit \nBowen in the head with a bottle and, when he fled, slashed his back \nusing a straight razor. Both men were found guilty of committing a hate \ncrime.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13373-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE MENTALLY ILL OFFENDER TREATMENT AND CRIME REDUCTION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and \nCrime Reduction Act is a good bipartisan bill that would help State and \nlocal governments deal effectively with a serious law enforcement and \nmental health problem--the extent to which mentally ill individuals \ncommit crimes and recidivate without ever receiving appropriate \nattention from the mental health, law enforcement, or corrections \nsystems. I am pleased that the bill passed the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously last week, and the Senate unanimously last night.\n  I have enjoyed working on this bill with Senator DeWine, who has \nshown commitment and leadership on this issue. I am also pleased that \nSenators Cantwell, Domenici, Durbin, Grassley, and Hatch have joined \nSenator DeWine and I as cosponsors of this bill.\n  The issues this bill addresses have received increasing attention of \nlate. For example, Human Rights Watch released a report just last week \ndiscussing the fact ``that jails and prisons have become the Nation's \ndefault mental health system.'' The first recommendation in the report \nwas for Congress to enact this bill.\n  All too often, people with mental illness rotate repeatedly between \nthe criminal justice system and the streets of our communities, \ncommitting a series of minor offenses. The ever scarcer time of our law \nenforcement officers is being occupied by these offenders who divert \nthem from more urgent responsibilities. Meanwhile, offenders find \nthemselves in prisons or jails, where little or no appropriate medical \ncare is available for them. This bill gives State and local governments \nthe tools to break this cycle, for the good of law enforcement, \ncorrections officers, the public safety, and mentally ill offenders \nthemselves.\n  I held a Judiciary Committee hearing last June on the criminal \njustice system and mentally ill offenders. At that hearing, we heard \nfrom State mental health officials, law enforcement officers, \ncorrections officials, and the representative of counties around our \nNation. All of our witnesses agreed that people with untreated mental \nillness are more likely to commit crimes, and that our State mental \nhealth systems, prisons, and jails do not have the resources they need \nto treat the mentally ill, and prevent crime and recidivism. We know \nthat more than 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and \nprisons have a mental illness, that about 20 percent of youth in the \njuvenile justice system have serious mental health problems, and that \nup to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious mental illness \nwill come into contact with the American criminal justice system at \nsome point in their lives. We know these things, but we have not done \nenough about them at the Federal level, and our State and local \nofficials need our help.\n  The bill does not mandate a ``one size fits all'' approach to \naddressing this issue. Rather, it allows grantees to use the funding \nauthorized under the bill for mental health courts or other court-based \nprograms, for training for criminal justice and mental health system \npersonnel, and for better mental health treatment in our communities \nand within the corrections system. The funding is also generous enough \nto make a real difference, with $100 million authorized for each of the \nnext two fiscal years.

Mr. President, the arrest of Russian businessman Mikhail \nKhodorkovsky by Russian security agents last weekend is of grave \nconsequence to U.S.-Russia relations. It caps a chilling and aggressive \nturn toward authoritarianism in Vladimir Putin's Russia. It is past \ntime for all friends of Russia, and all who support strong U.S.-Russia \nrelations, to speak out about the ascendant role of the Russian \nsecurity services in the Kremlin, President Putin's suppression of free \nmedia, the government's politicized prosecutions of its opponents, \ncontinuing and grievous human rights violations at the hands of the \nRussian army in Chechnya, and increased Russian meddling, intimidation, \nand harassment of its sovereign neighbors. American policy must change \ndramatically as a result of these developments, which have been in \nevidence for several years, for there can be no stability in U.S.-\nRussian relations, to say nothing of any strategic partnership, as long \nas Russia is moving away from the values of freedom and democratic \nprogress so many Russians celebrated when the Soviet Union fell 12 \nyears ago. I will have more to say on this matter, but for the moment I \nwish to draw my colleagues' attention to an incisive opinion article by \nBruce Jackson entitled ``The Failure of Putin's Russia,'' published \ntoday\n\n[[Page S13374]]\n\nin the Washington Post, and an accompanying Post editorial entitled \n``Pedaling Backward.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that these articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 28, 2003]\n\n                     The Failure of Putin's Russia\n\n                         (By Bruce P. Jackson)\n\n       Every so often the arrest of one man involves more than the \n     charges he may face and his fate before the court. In these \n     rare instances, the legal proceedings are a distraction from \n     the larger moral and strategic implications, and so they are \n     intended to be. The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky by Russian \n     secret services in Siberia over the weekend is one such \n     arrest.\n       The ``crimes'' of Khodorkovsky are considerable in the eyes \n     of the special prosecutor and the new regime of former KGB \n     officers who now surround President Vladimir Putin. As \n     chairman of Yukos Oil, Khodorkovsky is a successful \n     businessman who built the largest privately held company in \n     Russia from the wreckage of the Soviet energy sector, \n     converted his firm to Western business practices and entered \n     into merger discussions with American corporate giants. This \n     conduct alone might, in today's Russia, be considered a \n     threat to the state, but the real charge behind the arrest \n     contains much more.\n       This has been a year in which independent media and major \n     independent business owners in Russia have been put out of \n     business by the strong-arm tactics of the special prosecutor \n     and the newly vigilant Federal Security Service (FSB), the \n     agency that succeeded the KGB. In a climate that progressive \n     Russian business executives compare to the fearful period of \n     the 1950s, Khodorkovsky made the fatal mistake of expressing \n     political opinions and having the temerity to provide \n     financial support to opposition parties.\n       While this alone is insurrectionary behavior in the \n     increasingly czarist world of President Putin, Khodorkovsky \n     had the additional misfortune of being the last surviving \n     oligarch. For those who have not kept up their Russian, \n     ``oligarch'' is a term of art for ``rich Jews'' who made \n     their money in the massive privatization of Soviet assets in \n     the early 1990s. It is still not a good thing to be a \n     successful Jew in historically anti-Semitic Russia.\n       Since Putin was elected president in 2000, every major \n     figure exiled or arrested for financial crimes has been \n     Jewish. In dollar terms, we are witnessing the largest \n     illegal expropriation of Jewish property in Europe since the \n     Nazi seizures during the 1930s.\n       Unfortunately, the implications of Khodorkovsky's arrest go \n     beyond the suppression of democratic voices and the return of \n     official anti-Semitism. This arrest must be seen in the \n     context of increasingly aggressive, military and \n     extrajudicial actions in Ukraine, Moldova, the South Caucasus \n     and Chechnya. In the past month, Putin has demanded that \n     Ukraine sign a concessionary economic treaty; Russian \n     intelligence services have been detected behind election \n     irregularities in Azerbaijan and Georgia and in influence-\n     peddling in Moldova and Abkhazia; and Russian gunboats have \n     confronted the Ukrainian Coast Guard in an illegal attempt to \n     seize a valuable commercial waterway.\n       For the balance of his first term, Putin has skillfully \n     taken advantage of America's necessary preoccupations with \n     the war on terrorism and the liberation of Iraq. Now Moscow \n     and the capitals of Eastern Europe are watching carefully to \n     see how Washington responds to this latest crackdown. If the \n     United States fails to take a hard line in response to such a \n     high-visibility arrest, chauvinists in the Russian Ministry \n     of Defense and the FSB will correctly conclude that there \n     will be no meaningful response to the reestablishment of a \n     neo-imperial sphere of influence in the new democracies to \n     Russia's south and west. In addition to the expected Cold \n     War thuggery and opportunistic financial seizures, we \n     should expect that the new powers in Russia will rig the \n     crucial elections in Ukraine and Georgia next year and \n     continue to prop up the brutal dictatorship of Alexander \n     Lukashenko in Belarus.\n       Finally, the incarceration of one man in Moscow's notorious \n     Matrosskaya Tishina Prison poses painful questions for U.S. \n     policy. It is now impossible to argue that President Bush's \n     good-faith efforts at personal diplomacy with Putin have \n     produced democratic outcomes. Indeed, each of Putin's visits \n     to the Crawford ranch and Camp David has been followed by the \n     cynical curtailment of democratic freedom inside Russia. \n     While it remains unclear what positive qualities Bush \n     detected in Putin's soul during their famous meeting in \n     Slovenia, it is abundantly clear that this is the ``soul'' of \n     a would-be Peter the Great.\n       If anyone should pay a price for the pursuit of thuggish \n     policies, it is Putin. It's difficult to see why the U.S. \n     Senate would even consider repealing the Jackson-Vanik \n     Amendment, the 1974 legislation under which Russia still must \n     receive an annual waiver from the United States to maintain \n     normal trade relations. On the contrary, Congress should \n     probably consider additional sanctions. The FSB-led attack on \n     Russian business has already cost American shareholders \n     multiple billions in their savings. These losses will \n     undoubtedly continue until some element of the rule of law \n     returns to Moscow.\n       The arrest of one man has sent us a signal that our well-\n     intentioned Russian policy has failed. We must now recognize \n     that there has been a massive suppression of human rights and \n     the imposition of a de facto Cold War-type administration in \n     Moscow. It is not too soon to wonder if we are witnessing the \n     formal beginning of a rollback of the democratic gains we \n     have seen in Central and Eastern Europe, in Ukraine and \n     elsewhere since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n       Obviously, there will be some in Washington who will argue \n     that all the oligarchs are probably guilty of some \n     unspecified crime or another. And that we would be wise not \n     to jeopardize our relationship with Putin for the sake of one \n     man or one company. But there are some who are probably still \n     waiting for the facts of the Dreyfus case before jumping to \n     conclusions. The rest of us already know that we have been \n     played for fools.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 28, 2003]\n\n                           Pedaling Backward\n\n       Speaking to his cabinet yesterday, Russian President \n     Vladimir Putin dismissed the speculation sparked by last \n     weekend's arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest \n     man. ``Everyone should be equal under the law,'' President \n     Putin said, ``irrespective of how many billions of dollars a \n     person has on his personal or corporate account.''\n       Would that it were true. Whatever he may or may not have \n     done, Mr. Khodorkovsky, chairman of the Yukos oil company, \n     has not been arrested solely because he may have committed \n     crimes. If the Russian government were to hold all wealthy \n     businessmen to account for the laws they broke while \n     accumulating capital over the past decade, far more people \n     would be under arrest. In fact, Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest has \n     been widely understood in Russia as a political act--and \n     possibly the beginning of a real change in official Russian \n     attitudes toward private property and capitalism itself.\n       Mr. Khodorkovsky stands out in Russia because he has made \n     his company and its books more transparent than had any of \n     his rivals. Though the origins of his empire are shady, he \n     is, in some ways, Russia's first real capitalist--and like a \n     real capitalist, he hasn't hesitated to participate openly in \n     the democratic system by donating money to political parties, \n     including those who oppose Mr. Putin. Putting him under \n     arrest sends a clear signal to other Russians that no one is \n     safe from arbitrary prosecution, or from the political whims \n     of the Kremlin.\n       It's also a signal that the Russian government cares far \n     more about destroying its rivals than it does about genuinely \n     improving the Russian economy. In recent months, there were \n     signs that capital flight from Russia had stabilized, as \n     Russian businessmen slowly began to feel more confident in \n     the country's legal system. Following Mr. Khodorkovsky's \n     arrest, the stock market crashed and the Russian ruble \n     plunged, as rumors of new capital flight abounded. Large \n     investors, including Western oil companies, may be confident \n     they have enough Kremlin connections to stay in the country, \n     but smaller investors are now more likely to stay away.\n       The Bush administration's reaction to this arrest may \n     determine whether it sticks. Just a few weeks ago, President \n     Bush endorsed ``President Putin's vision for Russia: a \n     country . . . in which democracy and freedom and rule of law \n     thrive.'' It's hard to see how President Putin's ``vision'' \n     can include the rule of law if it also includes arbitrary \n     prosecution. Certainly there are some within the \n     administration who believe that a Russian strategic decision \n     to start rolling back democracy and the rule of law will \n     undermine the Russian-American relationship. But the \n     president himself must now recognize that that is what now \n     may be happening. Mr. Bush may be unable to persuade his \n     friend Vladimir to behave differently, but it is vital that \n     he try. The preservation of democracy in Russia is more than \n     an ideal; it is a crucial U.S. interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13374-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13374-S13375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the vital \nimportance of developing, and then maintaining, effective cybersecurity \nsystems in our workplaces, our government offices, and our homes. We \nhave all become acutely aware, as we confront the many possible threats \nto our national security, that much of our critical infrastructure is \nnow run by computer networks. Illegal access to these networks can \ncompromise the provision of power, telecommunications, and water in an \ninstant. In the private sector, whole industries now rely on \ninformation technology in order to function. In addition, millions of \nAmericans depend on their computers to explore the Internet, to access \ninformation and entertainment, and to preserve their personal records. \nAt the same time they must protect their most significant, and often \nintimate, data--such as medical records and credit card information. \nWith all this at risk, effective cybersecurity should be paramount in \nevery corporation, government agency, and personal home.\n\n[[Page S13375]]\n\n  This past weekend marked National Cybersecurity Day. With the strong \nefforts of the Federal Trade Commission and the Congressional Internet \nCaucus, we have come a long way in raising awareness about \ncybersecurity. The FTC has made a great deal of important information \navailable on their website, and I encourage people to visit that \nwebsite, at www.ftc.gov. I am proud to be a Senate cochair of the \nInternet Caucus, along with Senator Burns, Congressman Goodlatte, and \nCongressman Boucher. In addition to an impressive array of speakers on \nall aspects of the Internet, the caucus has begun a series of \nconstituent education seminars, targeted at helping all of us provide \nbetter information, assistance, and support to the people in our home \nstates as they grapple with the dizzying possibilities and pitfalls of \nthe Internet.\n  Our efforts have not been limited to just one day. Last week this \nbody passed important anti-spam legislation that will help to keep \nunwanted--often illicit--e-mail off the Internet, and off our computer \nscreens. In the Judiciary Committee, we have held hearings recently on \nthe dangers of peer-to-peer technology. This technology has the \npotential to revolutionize the way people share all sorts of \ninformation. But as with any technology, it can be abused. Peer-to-peer \nnetworks can be used to distribute child pornography and to expose our \nchildren to a host of obscene materials. It can also be used to delve \ninto people's private records or illegally to share copyrighted \nmaterial.\n  Pornography, and child pornography in particular, is prevalent on \npeer-to-peer networks. According to recent reports, as much as 42 \npercent of peer-to-peer requests are for pornography. What is more, at \na recent committee hearing we learned that at least one popular peer-\nto-peer network does not identify its pornographic material in any way. \nThus, advertisements on its network appear just as regularly with child \npornography and other obscene content as with scientific reviews and \nscholarly papers.\n  Some of the danger of using peer-to-peer networks can be alleviated \nwith good cybersecurity. Reading privacy statements, taking the time to \nunderstand the software you are using, as well as keeping filters and \nantivirus software turned on and up to date, all help. Knowing what \nyour children are doing online is also important. In addition, we have \ngiven prosecutors powerful tools to go after the people who threaten \nour security.\n  Our efforts must continue. The very nature of cyberspace means that \nthe threat to security is always changing. Our responses must evolve as \nwell, both as individuals and as legislators. I am pleased to be \ncontinuing to work with Chairman Hatch as we investigate, not just the \npeer-to-peer situation, but the larger set of circumstances that may \nthreaten our cybersecurity. As we identify those threats, our primary \ngoal will be to raise awareness about those dangers, and to give \ncitizens and law enforcement the tools they need to protect our rights, \nto improve our security, and to redress wrongdoing as we continue to \ndevelop ever-better cybersecurity systems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13375-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in the time since major combat in Iraq \nhas ended and peacekeeping and transitional operations have begun, the \nUnited States, our allies and the Iraqi people have accomplished much.\n  The men and women of our armed forces in particular deserve much \npraise for their diligence and bravery. They have been given the goal \nof establishing democracy in Iraq, and their success in this endeavor \nis directly linked to the freedom and security we enjoy in the \nhomeland. A free and democratic Iraq will stand as a beacon of hope \namidst one of the world's most troubled regions.\n  Fortunately we are now seeing many of the fruits of their labor.\n  Nearly 760,000 metric tons of food items have been dispatched into \nIraq in just one month's time. Health care centers are receiving \nshipments of health care kits, refrigerators and furniture. Shipments \nof office supplies including furniture, computers and printers have \nbeen received in Iraq and will be used to equip seven essential \ngovernment ministries.\n  The Iraqi people are stepping up to provide leadership for their \nnewly liberated country. Crops are being successfully planted in areas \nthat have not produced for years. Iraqis are volunteering for the new \nIraqi Army. The Iraqi Nurses Association has initiated a two-day \nconference to lay the ground work for adequate nursing services in Iraq \nover the next ten years and close to 30,000 Iraqis have undergone \ntraining to be members of Iraq's new police force.\n  More importantly, representative democracy in Iraq has taken shape. \nThe Iraqi Governing Council has been formed and brings together 25 \npolitical leaders from across Iraq. The Council will name Iraqi \nMinisters, represent the new country internationally, and draft a \nconstitution that will pave the way for national elections leading to a \nfully sovereign Iraqi government.\n  Recently, we have confirmed that Saddam Hussein's sons, Uday and \nQusay have been killed in a firefight in Mosul. This development has \nled to an increase in tips from the Iraqi people, one of which led us \nthe capture of 660 surface to air missiles, as well as an increasing \nconfidence among the Iraqi people.\n  With two thirds of the Hussein regime gone, one has reason to hope \nthat the final piece of the puzzle will soon follow.\n  And this good news that we are witnessing in Iraq is a direct result \nof the hard work and dedication of our troops. Were it not for their \ncourage and perseverance, our presence in Iraq would be in vain.\n  Our military men and women will surely face more difficult days in \nIraq, and the Iraqi people will be tested by the responsibilities that \ncome with freedom. The thugs who propped up the previous regime and \noutside forces with goals of their own continue to cause problems, stir \nup trouble and initiate violence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so \nthan in a country that has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n  Today I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one can \nmake for his country. On August 23, Spec. Stephen M. Scott, 21, of \nLawton, OK, died of noncombat-related injuries near Al Fallujah after \nbeing evacuated to the 28th Combat Support Hospital.\n  His wife, Marie Scott remembers her husband as a gentle giant with a \nvery affectionate personality. ``He was amazing,'' she said of Scott. \n``He was 6-foot-5 and weighed 225 pounds, but was so gentle . . . If \nthere was a little guy getting picked on he'd be the one to stand up \nfor him.''\n  Spec. Scott died doing just that. His mission in Iraq was clear: to \nhelp the Iraqi people overthrow the shackles of a brutal dictatorship--\nto help the little guy.\n  As we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, let us never forget that \nthe freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n  Spec. Scott did not die in vain. He died so that many others could \nlive freely. And for that sacrifice, we are forever indebted. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with him and his family today and with the \ntroops who are putting their lives on the line in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13375-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MOVING TO SUSPEND RULE XVI\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

The \namendment also would have ensured that these holding companies do not \ndamage the financial standing of small businesses or pass the costs of \nbad investments to consumers.\n  Senator Feingold and Senator Brownback were correct. This amendment \nis just good public policy and would have protected small contractors \nagainst big utilities. I appreciate their hard work and dedication to \nthis important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13376-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           TATYANA GORYACHOVA\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Tatyana \nGoryachova for her contributions to journalism and her strength in the \nface of extreme adversity. Ms. Goryachova is a Ukrainian newspaper \neditor who, as a result of her unbiased reporting and journalistic \nintegrity, has suffered threats and physical assault.\n  A free press is a defining characteristic of a democratic society. A \nfree press in the U.S. is provided for and protected by our \nConstitution. In Ukraine before the fall of communism in 1991, \nnewspapers were censored and only allowed to publish officially \nsanctioned positions. While a free press is taking hold in Ukraine, \nsignificant pressure remains to publish only stories favorable to \ngovernment and business interests.\n  Ms. Goryachova and her husband, Sergey Belousov, have owned and \nedited the Berdyansk Delovoy in Berdyansk, Ukraine since 1998. As \neditor, Ms. Goryachova has insisted on evenhanded coverage. The \nnewspaper has exposed corruption in the city government and covered \nchallengers as well as incumbents in city elections--a decision that \nbrought her into conflict with government officials.\n  Ms. Goryachova's professional choices have made her the subject of \nsevere personal hardships. The Berdyansk Delovoy office was vandalized. \nMs. Goryachova's life has been threatened. She was attacked and had \nacid thrown in her face, causing serious damage to her eyes and skin. \nDespite this, she has persevered and continued complete coverage at the \nnewspaper.\n  Ms. Goryachova found an advocate in Hal Foster, an American \njournalist and Omaha World-Herald correspondent she met at a journalism \nseminar in Kiev, Ukraine. Mr. Foster arranged to have Ms. Goryachova's \neye injuries treated in the United States. He secured an anonymous \nbenefactor who paid for her care.\n  In addition, the Berdyansk Delovoy needed its own printing press to \ncontinue publishing. After hearing Ms. Goryachova's story, Omaha World-\nHerald Publisher John Gottschalk offered to donate a printing press to \nthe newspaper. The generosity of an anonymous donor and the Omaha \nWorld-Herald has ensured that Tatyana Goryachova will have both her \neyesight and a strong voice in her community.\n  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis wrote in 1913 that, \n``Sunlight is the best of disinfectants; electric light the most \nefficient policeman.'' Ms. Goryachova understands that exposing \ncorruption and illuminating Ukraine's darkest corners is the surest way \nto end abuse and promote democracy.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Robert \nand Margaret Scott, better known as Bob and Muff, who will celebrate \ntheir 60th wedding anniversary on November 6, 2003.\n  As they celebrate this milestone in their lives, they will surely \nreflect on the many changes, successes and accomplishments they have \nexperienced together over the last sixty years. Theirs is a journey of \nwhich they can be proud.\n  Bob is the son of the late Chester and Evangeline Scott. Bob attended \nMiami University of Ohio for his undergraduate degree and received his \nmaster's and PhD in Organic Chemistry from Northwestern University. His \nwife, Muff, is the daughter of the late Benjamin and Ann Penix. She \nreceived her bachelor's and master's degrees in English from the \nUniversity of Kentucky.\n  Bob and Muff met and began dating in college. Although their \nrespective schools were over sixty miles apart, a college weekend \nbrought them together. They were married on November 6, 1943 in \nMorehead, KY.\n  The Scotts moved to Delaware in 1950, when Bob took a position with \nHercules. Over his 35-year career at Hercules, Bob moved from being a \nbench chemist to a plant chemist, to eventually becoming the Director \nof Research and Development. Muff divided between raising a family, \ncommunity service and substitute teaching at area schools. They are \nblessed with three children, Bob, Ann and Tom, and six grandchildren, \nLee, Rob, Joshua, Clarissa, Clay and Lex.\n  Bob and Muff are active members of the community. Bob is Warden to \nDelaware's Episcopal Bishop, Wayne Wright, and has been Warden for the \nlast four Bishops in Delaware. The Scott's are also members of Christ \nChurch in Greenville, DE where Bob has often been a vestry member. Bob \nwas also a delegate to the National Episcopal Church Triennial \nConvention for more than 20 years, during the contentious times when \nthe Episcopal Church first accepted the ordination of women as clergy \nmembers and bishops. Reverend John Martiner of Christ Church describes \nBob and Muff as a real team. Whether folding church bulletins or \nvolunteering at community events, they are always working together. \nThey are devoted to each other and to their families.\n  Bob and Muff are also dedicated to St. Michael's School and Nursery, \na non-profit institution that provides affordable, high-quality early \nchildhood education and childcare to the community. Both Bob and Muff \nare on the board of directors. They have served on the board \nalternately for over 30 years. Helen Riley, the executive director of \nSt. Michael's, describes the Scott's as representing the true spirit of \nphilanthropy. Muff is known as the ``Board Builder'' at St. Michael's. \nShe brings in next generations of families to support the organization. \nShe has involved young children in philanthropy by teaching them to \ndonate their own toys and books, and by showing them the value in \nvolunteering their own time. Bob serves as an advisor to the school and \nhas proven to be reliable and dependable for expert advice from a \nbusiness standpoint. They often sell books at their church and collect \nmoney in tin cans for scholarships and faculty training and \nadvancement.\n  Today, I rise to congratulate Bob and Muff on their 60th wedding \nanniversary. Both have shown great service and commitment to their \nfamily and their community. They serve as true role models. I know that \ntheir years together hold many beautiful memories. It is my hope that \nthose ahead will be filled with continued joy. I wish them both the \nvery best in all that lies ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13376-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13376-S13377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING STEVE PICCO\n\n Mr. CORZINE.

A bill to revise and extend the Community Services Block \nGrant Act, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981, and the \nAssets for Independence Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today Senator Dodd and I are \nintroducing the Poverty Reduction and Prevention Act of 2003. This bi-\npartisan\n\n[[Page S13379]]\n\nbill proposes to reauthorize important legislation that provides \nmeaningful assistance to 18 million Americans seeking to fight their \nway out of poverty. The bill includes the Community Services Block \nGrant, the Low-Income Heating and Energy Assistance Program, and the \nAssets for Independence Program.\n  Statistics show us that poverty touches a large proportion of \nAmericans over their lifetimes. Sometimes poverty is a chronic \ncondition that persists over several generations. But more often, \npoverty happens as a consequence of life's unexpected tragedies--\nillness, job loss, divorce, or disability. These can seriously \nundermine a family's ability to support itself. What's needed is a \nsafety net in such times of need. Our Poverty Reduction and Prevention \nAct can provide that help and can make the difference in a family's \nefforts to fight their way out of poverty become self-sufficient again.\n  The services of the Poverty Reduction and Prevention Act are provided \nprimarily through Community Action Agencies, created 40 years ago. The \nheart of these programs are those provided through the Community \nServices Block Grant, created in 1981. The block grant allows for \nmaximum flexibility to tailor programs to meet local needs with minimal \nadministrative cost. Today the programs touch the lives of almost 25 \npercent of those living in poverty. These programs fund a state-\nadministered community services network of more than 1000 local \nagencies that work to alleviate poverty and empower low-income families \nin communities across the United States. The agencies are very \neffective in leveraging their funds to mobilize additional resources \nfrom local businesses and foundations, as well as other public sources, \nto make an effective impact in fighting poverty in their communities.\n  A number of social services are provided that are designed to help \nlow-income individuals and their families achieve a better quality of \nlife. They help people find and keep a good job, get an adequate \neducation, obtain a decent place to live, pay their utility bills, and \neven learn how to manage a household income.\n  The Poverty Reduction and Prevention Act has five major themes for \nits services: to assist families in poverty address their immediate, \nmost basic needs and work toward self-sufficiency; to serve the non-\ntraditional poor who are facing poverty due to unexpected events such \nas a plant closing or a major illness or injury; to assist special \npopulations, including those dealing with chronic poverty and for whom \nconventional solutions have failed; to work for systemic change in low-\nincome communities to promote economic development and community \nrevitalization; and to provide direct assistance to help low-income \nindividuals pay their utility bills.\n\n  These programs are the true ``safety net'' for millions of low-income \nand at-risk families and individuals and serve as the centerpiece of \nmost local social service programs in 96 percent of the counties across \nthe country. Last year the programs in the Poverty Reduction and \nPrevention Act served over 19 million people, primarily through CSBG, \nserving 13 million, and the Low-Income Heating and Energy Assistance \nProgram, providing assistance to over 5 million.\n  In Tennessee, over 100,000 individuals were served by CSBG last year, \nalmost 25 percent of whom were disabled. Over 60,000 families were \nserved, 90 percent were living below the federal poverty level, and 40 \npercent were elderly or disabled families living on a fixed income. And \nthose who are helped in turn help others by volunteering in the \nprograms and giving back to their community. For example, in my home \nState of Tennessee, long known as the Volunteer State, those who \nbenefitted from these programs gave back to others by working over \n190,000 volunteer hours.\n  And there is good accountability for how those funds are spent in the \ncommunity. Each agency is governed by a board of directors, a third of \nwhich consists of representatives who live in the low-income community, \na third are locally elected officials, and the remaining third are \ncommunity leaders from business, labor, religion, and education.\n  These programs are not only important to those who receive services; \nthey also make good use of the Federal dollar. Last year in addition to \nthe Federal monies appropriated for these three programs, the community \nagencies identified other state and local monies and private \ncontributions. In total, local agencies administered over $9 billion on \nbehalf of low-income families and individuals in communities across the \ncountry.\n  In addition to good fiscal accountability and effective use of \nFederal dollars to leverage additional resources, the programs are a \nmodel when it comes to tracking and reporting the outcomes they are \nhelping people achieve. In Tennessee, for example, we know that 43 \npercent of individuals who were seeking employment were able to find a \njob, and two-thirds of those jobs included health care coverage. Over \n75 percent of those seeking housing assistance were able to move from \nsub-standard to good, stable housing, and 524 families were moved out \nof homelessness. Over 85 percent of elderly households assisted were \nable to continue living independently.\n  Through LIHEAP in Tennessee, over 72,000 received assistance in \npaying their utility bills, thereby avoiding having their heating and \ncooling cut off, which is of very real importance for health and safety \nas well as quality of life. The high cost of energy is a growing \nproblem for those families trying to get by on a lower income and for \nour elderly living on fixed incomes.\n  By helping these people in meaningful ways, the programs administered \nunder the Poverty Reduction and Prevention Act have not only made a \ndifference in thousands of lives but have also saved my state money in \nsignificant ways--by avoiding the higher costs of \nhomelessness, reducing the number of people in poverty, reducing the \nneed for nursing homes and institutional care, and providing an \nimportant ``bridge'' to help people moving off of welfare achieve \npermanent self-sufficiency,\n\n  While these programs have had many very real successes in the past, \nas we approached this reauthorization we also looked for ways we could \nimprove the programs and provide even better access to and delivery of \nthese important services. In drafting the reauthorization we gave \nparticular attention to clarifying and strengthening the purpose of \nthese important programs, which, in summary, is to fight and reduce \npoverty, working in partnerships with community and state leadership.\n  In this reauthorization we believed it was important to give states \ngreater flexibility in determining who should receive services. We \nwanted to expand services to the extent possible to assist more of the \nworking poor and their families achieve economic stability and self-\nsufficiency. While giving more flexibility, we also provided incentives \nto encourage States to focus on those most in need and to help those \ntransitions from welfare to self-sufficiency. And we strengthened the \naccountability and monitoring of funds at both the state and local \nlevel. We explicitly asked States to hold the line on excessive \nadministrative salaries and expenses, again at both the state and \nagency level.\n  In this reauthorization we also wanted to highlight best practices \nand encourage creativity and innovation in fighting poverty. We called \nfor identifying exemplary local agencies as Centers of Innovation to \npromote the sharing of best practices among all community agencies.\n  Focusing on outcomes, we directed local agencies to have established \nclear goals for reducing poverty in their community and to show that \nsubstantial progress is being made in meeting those goals before \nreceiving continuing block grant funds. These goals include leveraging \ncommunity resources and fostering coordination across Federal, State, \nlocal, and private programs and services.\n  In the area of heating and cooling assistance, we are recommending a \nsignificant increase in the funds authorized for this important \nprogram, and we have added provisions and specific triggers that allow \nfor better, more effective release of emergency funds for LIHEAP \nassistance under extraordinary circumstances.\n  The programs included under the Poverty Reduction and Prevention Act \nof 2003 are important to millions of Americans who deserve our \nconsideration and need our support. The services touch almost every \ncommunity in\n\n[[Page S13380]]\n\nthe country and are often the only source of assistance available to \nthe people the programs are designed to serve. Quite simply, what these \nservices do is help restore dignity to those we serve. Every day one of \nthese programs makes a difference in the lives of our neediest \ncitizens. What this bill can accomplish will make possible a better \nquality of life for individuals and for neighborhoods and communities \nacross this great land. I join my colleague Senator Dodd in urging the \npassage of this important reauthorization legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Alexander in \nintroducing the Poverty Reduction and Prevention Act, which \nreauthorizes the Community Services Block Grant, the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, and the Assets for Independence Act. I would \nespecially like to congratulate Senator Alexander, Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Children and Families, and his staff for working so \nhard to ensure that this bill would be a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, was greatly disturbed by the latest \nU.S. Census poverty data released last month, which shows that poverty \nrose to 12.1 percent in 2002, bringing the total number of people \nliving in poverty to 34.6 million. The number of children in poverty \nrose by 400,000, which means that nearly 17 percent of children are \nliving in poverty. Even more disturbing is that the number of people \nwho lack health insurance rose by 2.4 million in 2002, bringing the \ntotal number of uninsured to an alarming 43.6 million. Although the \nproportion of uninsured children did not change between 2001 and 2002, \n11.6 percent of all children remain without the necessary safety net of \nhealth insurance. Our children truly are our future; we must treat them \nlike the precious resources that they are and provide them with the \nservices and assistance they need.\n  There are many troubling signs for families today, particularly \nfamilies with children. Unemployment continues to be a problem. \nFamilies are running out of unemployment benefits without finding jobs. \nThe most recent data from the Department of Health and Human Services \nshows that welfare caseloads continue to decline overall, but in many \nStates over the last year, caseloads are increasing. With States facing \ntheir worst budget crisis since WWII, many programs for low-income \nfamilies are being cut. This is particularly a problem given that half \nthe states are cutting child care funds. Parents need affordable child \ncare to get and keep jobs. Clearly, this is a time of crisis for our \nNation's low-income individuals and families. It is time for our \ngovernment to help them through these difficult economic times and give \nthem the opportunities and the tools to lift themselves back onto their \nfeet.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will reaffirm our nation's \ncommitment to alleviating poverty and upholding the American ethos of \nhelping our neighbors. For over 40 years, Community Action Agencies \nhave been using Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) funds to \ncoordinate and deliver comprehensive poverty programs and services to \nour nation's poor. From administering Head Start programs, to \ndelivering meals to the sick and elderly, providing adult education and \nliteracy, and implementing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, CSBG funds are reaching and helping nearly a quarter of all \npeople living in poverty in the United States. It goes without saying, \nthat ideally, we would like to reach out to each and every individual \nand family living in poverty, but this bill is a start. It is a good \nstart. It is a firm commitment to communities that when times are \ntough, Community Action Agencies will continue to work at the local \nlevel to address local needs.\n\n  The bill will enhance community flexibility in serving the poor and \nworking poor. I don't need to tell you, that a poor person living in \nurban New Haven has different needs from an impoverished family living \nin rural Danielson, CT. The same holds true for Community Action \nAgencies across our Nation. One Community Action Agency could be using \ntheir CSBG funds to teach computer skills in a town where a major \nmanufacturing plant just closed down, while another Community Action \nAgency is using the same funds to develop rural waste water management \nsystems. I am pleased that this reauthorization retains and strengthens \nthe flexibility that makes CSBG such a unique and successful program, \nby upholding and strengthening the successful and innovative Results \nOriented Management Assessment (ROMA) system of accountability and \nmonitoring procedures.\n  I am also pleased that reauthorization of this bill will allow \ncrucial assistance to reach more of our country's poor and working poor \nby setting a minimum eligibility level for assistance at 125 percent of \nthe poverty level and a maximum of 60 percent of the State median \nincome. In Connecticut alone, nearly 32 percent, or 437,492 households, \nare below 60 percent of the State median income. Conversely, if we had \nset the maximum at 185 percent of the poverty threshold, we would only \nreach 269,373 households. By using the State median income as a \nmaximum, not only will this bill be benefitting the Nation's families \nliving in poverty, but it will also assist those working poor families \njust above the poverty line, including those leaving welfare to make a \nsmooth and permanent transition to self-sufficiency.\n  The bill also reauthorizes the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, LIHEAP, which allocates grants to States to operate home \nenergy assistance programs for low-income households. According to the \nmost recent data from the Department of Health and Human Services, 4.8 \nmillion households received winter heating assistance, 250,000 \nbenefitted from cooling aid and 87,000 received summer crisis aid in \nfiscal year 2001. This legislation makes funding LIHEAP more responsive \nto community needs by basing emergency funding triggers on the price of \nhome energy bills and the average number of heating and cooling days in \na month. These simple automatic triggers will ensure that LIHEAP funds \nare readily available in times of crisis.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate and thank Senator Alexander for \nhis fine work on this bipartisan piece of legislation. I firmly believe \nthat this bill is a step in the right direction. Every day in this \nchamber and throughout the halls of the Senate, we talk about leaving \nno child behind, food stamps, comprehensive health care, job training \nand rural housing assistance. Mr. President, this bill encompasses all \nof these programs and services, and many more important poverty \ninitiatives. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and join \nus in helping to strengthen low income communities, so that we can help \nmore families become self-sufficient. In these tough economic times, \nfamilies deserve this support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1787. A bill to establish the Steel Industry National Historic \nSite in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that will honor the importance of the steel industry in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Nation by creating the ``Steel \nIndustry National Historic Site'' to be operated by the National Park \nService in southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  The importance of steel to the industrial development of the United \nStates cannot be overstated. A national historic site devoted to the \nhistory of the steel industry will afford all Americans the opportunity \nto celebrate this rich heritage, which is symbolic of the work ethnic \nendemic to this great Nation. The National Park Service recently \nreported that Congress should make remnants of the U.S. Steel Homestead \nWorks an affiliate of the national park system, rather than a full \nnational park, which had been considered in prior years, including \nlegislation I offered two years ago in the 107th Congress. Due to the \ncurrent backlog of maintenance projects at national parks and the \nresulting moratorium on new national parks, the legislation offered \ntoday instead creates a national historic site that would be affiliated \nwith the National Park Service. There is no better place for such a \nsite than in southwestern Pennsylvania, which played a significant role \nin early industrial America and continues to today.\n\n[[Page S13381]]\n\n  I have long supported efforts to preserve and enhance this historical \nsteel-related heritage through the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area, which \nincludes the City of Pittsburgh, and seven southwestern Pennsylvania \ncounties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Fayette, Greene, Washington and \nWestmoreland. I have sought and been very pleased with congressional \nsupport for the important work within the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area \nexpressed through appropriations levels of roughly $1 million annually \nsince fiscal year 1998. I am hopeful that this support will continue. \nHowever, more than just resources are necessary to ensure the \nhistorical recognition needed for this important heritage. That is why \nI am introducing this legislation today.\n  It is important to note why southwestern Pennsylvania should be the \nhome to the national site that my legislation authorizes. the \ncombination of a strong workforce, valuable natural resources, and \nPennsylvania's strategic location in the heavily populated northeastern \nUnited States allowed the steel industry to thrive. Today, the \nremaining buildings and sites devoted to steel production are \nthreatened with further deterioration or destruction. Many of these \nsites are nationally significant and perfectly suited for the study and \ninterpretation of this crucial period in our Nation's development. Some \nof these sites include the Carrie Furnace Complex, the Hot Metal \nBridges, and the United States Steel Homestead Works, which would all \nbecome a part of the Steel Industry National Historic Site under my \nlegislation.\n  Highlights of such a national historic site would commemorate a wide \nrange of accomplishments and topics for historical preservation and \ninterpretation from industrial process advancements to labor-management \nrelations. It is important to note that the site I seek to become a \nnational site under this bill includes the location of the Battle of \nHomestead, waged in 1892 between steelworkers and Pinkerton guards. The \nBattle of Homestead marked a crucial period in the Nation's workers' \nrights movement. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, individuals, and \npublic and private entities have attempted to protect and preserve \nresources such as the Homestead battleground and the Hot Metal Bridge. \nFor the benefit and inspiration of present and future generations, it \nis time for the Federal Government to join this effort to recognize \ntheir importance with the additional protection I provide in this bill.\n  I would like to commend my colleague, Representative Mike Doyle, who \nhas been a longstanding leader in this preservation effort and who \nsponsors the companion legislation, H.R. 521, pending in the House of \nRepresentatives. I look forward to working with southwestern \nPennsylvania officials and Mr. August Carlino, President and Chief \nExecutive Office of the Steel Industry Heritage Corporation, in order \nto bring this national historic site to fruition. I urge my colleagues \nto cosponsor this legislation and I intend to work for its swift \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1791. A bill to amend the Lease Lot Conveyance Act of 2002 to \nprovide that the amounts received by the United States under that Act \nshall be deposited in the reclamation fund, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould greatly benefit one of the largest irrigation districts in \nSouthern New Mexico. Last Congress, H.R. 706, the Elephant Butte Lease \nLott Conveyance Act, passed the House and Senate unanimously. The \npurpose of the original bill was to provide security to 403 lease lot \nholders who were interested in purchasing property currently being \nleased to them by the Bureau of Reclamation. Many of the lease holders \nhad, at the urging of the Federal Government, invested time and money \ninto improving these lots, including the addition in many cases of \npermanent fixtures. The bill I bring today would amend that Act by \nclarifying where the proceeds from the sale of these lands would be \ndeposited.\n  With regard to proceeds, the late Honorable Howard Bratton, a former \nFederal District Court judge for the District of New Mexico, ruled in \n1992 and in 1997 that the Elephant Butte Irrigation District was \nentitled to net profits generated from the leasing of grazing and farm \nlands of the Rio Grande Project. I would just mention that while the \nlatest in these rulings was handed down almost 6 years ago, the \nDistrict has yet to receive these profits. I understand the Bureau of \nReclamation, at the urging of the Federal District Court, has told the \nElephant Butte Irrigations District that it will rectify this situation \nin fiscal year 2004. I intend to closely monitor that situation.\n  The Lease Lot Conveyance Act of 2002 is silent with regard to any \ncrediting of the proceeds from the sale of the 403 lease lots. \nReclamation has taken the position that the proceeds should be credited \nto the Reclamation Fund. I would just like to note that the repayment \nobligations of the District were met and title was transferred to the \nDistrict in the early nineties. The District, therefore, believes that \nunder current law and the opinions of the Federal District Court in New \nMexico, they would be entitled to these funds.\n  The bill I am introducing today makes it clear that the proceeds of \nthe sale should go to the irrigation district instead of to the \nReclamation fund. With Reclamation expenses continually escalating, I \nhave been told by the District that they would utilize these proceeds \nto offset on-going operation and maintenance costs.\n  While the appraisal of these lands is still pending I do want to be \nclear that we are only talking about roughly 250 acres out of the total \n78,000 acres compromising the Elephant Butte and Caballo Reservoir \nboundaries. I believe it is reasonable to allow these funds to go to \nthe District. I hope the Senate will act expeditiously on this matter, \nso that the process can continue to move forward as we intended it to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LEASE LOT CONVEYANCE.\n\n       Section 4(b) of the Lease Lot Conveyance Act of 2002 (116 \n     Stat. 2879) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``As consideration'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(1) In general.--As consideration''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Use.--Amounts received under paragraph (1) shall be--\n       ``(A) deposited by the Secretary, on behalf of the Rio \n     Grande Project, in the reclamation fund established under the \n     first section of the Act of June 17, 1902 (43 U.S.C. 391); \n     and\n       ``(B) made immediately available to the Irrigation \n     Districts, to be credited in accordance with section 4(I) of \n     the Act of December 5, 1924 (43 U.S.C. 501).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1788. A bill to amend title 40, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Administrator of General Services to lease and redevelop certain \nFederal property on the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nhelp revitalize the Denver Federal Center (DFC) and the surrounding \ncommunity of Lakewood, CO. This bill will allow the General Services \nAdministration to enter into public/private partnerships, thereby \nefficiently and effectively addressing infrastructure and environmental \nissues at the DFC.\n  The DFC is a 670-acre campus with 77 active buildings. It began as a \nmunitions manufacturing plan during World War II. Since then, many \nother agencies have called the DFC home, leaving behind a history of \nlandfills, leaking underground storage tanks, chemical laboratories, \nand firing ranges that have contaminated the area. Additonally, many of \nthe existing buildings are more than 60 years old and are in need of \nextensive repair or replacement. The Colorado Department of Public \nHealth is requiring an environmental investigation and clean-up of \ncontaminated areas at a cost of over $70 million.\n  As the Denver metropolitan region grows, the GSA has an opportunity \nto create public / private partnerships that will help foster the \ngrowth of the DFC campus into a regional hub of commerce and \ntransportation as formulated in the visions of the local communities. \nAt the same time, through these public / private partnerships, the DFC \nwill be able to help\n\n[[Page S13382]]\n\nclean up a 60-year-old environmental mess.\n  The Regional Transportation District (RTD) would like to create an \nintermodal facility and public transit hub as the West Corridor Light \nRail is developed. New offices can be developed, not only for Federal \ntenants, but potentially for private businesses as well.\n  I believe this bill will provide many benefits all around--through \nthe partnerships created, this bill will create new jobs and preserve \njobs and institutions already in place, while at the same time taking \ncare of a much needed and necessary environmental preservation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1788\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act shall be cited as the ``Denver Federal Center \n     Redevelopment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DENVER FEDERAL CENTER DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY.\n\n       Part C of subtitle II of title 40, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new chapter:\n\n            ``CHAPTER 71.

DENVER FEDERAL CENTER DEVELOPMENT.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1793. A bill to provide for college quality, affordability, and \ndiversity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it should be our common purpose to \nguarantee the promise of a good education to all from birth through \ncollege. The strength, security, and future of our Nation lie in the \neducation and character of our people.\n  In recent years, on a bipartisan basis, we have been working to \nimprove pre-school, elementary, and secondary education. We should move \nforward in the same bipartisan way on higher education.\n  Last year, on a bipartisan basis, we passed the No Child Left Behind \nAct to raise standards for students in elementary and secondary schools \nto hold schools and states accountable for results. These worthwhile \nschool reforms deserve to be well-funded, so that all public school \nstudents will have a fair chance to succeed.\n  Last year, Senator Gregg and I also introduced a bipartisan bill to \nimprove the quality of early childhood education in the states, and \nhelp ensure that young children begin school ready to learn.\n  This year, in the Education Committee, again on a bipartisan basis, \nwe have worked to strengthen the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA) and ensure that special needs children receive a \nquality education. I hope we can pass that legislation soon, to assure \nthat the federal government meets its full obligation to children with \ndisabilities.\n  The next great challenge we should confront on a bipartisan basis is \nto ensure that every student with the talent, desire, and drive to go \nto college is able to afford to go to college. Education is the golden \ndoor of opportunity, but for too long, the door of higher education has \nbeen closed to many students, because of their inability to pay. \nSurely, we have reached a stage in America where we can say it and mean \nit--cost will never be a barrier to a college education.\n  Just as Social Security is a promise of retirement security to senior \ncitizens, just as Medicare is a promise of health security to senior \ncitizens, so we should make ``Education Security'' a promise to every \nyoung American. If you work hard, if you finish high school, if you are \nadmitted to a college, we should guarantee that you can afford the cost \nof the four years it takes to earn a degree.\n  As we move forward on the reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct, let us come together again on a bipartisan basis to make college \naffordable to all qualified students. No students should have to \nmortgage their future to obtain a college degree.\n  At other times in our nation's history, we have acted boldly to \nextend college opportunity. In 1862, a year after the Civil War began, \nPresident Abraham Lincoln signed into law the Morrill Land Grant \nColleges Act which set aside at least 90,000 acres in each Union \nState--30,000 acres for each of the state seats in Congress. The Act \nwas named for Congressman Justin Morrill from Vermont, and the funds \nfrom sales of the land were to be used for public colleges and \nuniversities in the fields of engineering, agriculture, and military \nscience. In the following years, over 70 colleges were established, and \nin 1890, the Morrill Act was extended to Southern and Western States. \nToday, over 3.5 million students are educated in public colleges and \nuniversities first created under the Morrill Act.\n  The next great benchmark in higher education came in 1944 when \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt signed the GI Bill to help the vast number \nof veterans who would be returning to civilization when World War II \nended. The nation embraced the transforming principles that became a \ncornerstone of our democracy, that the benefits of college education \nshould be available to all in our society, not just the elite, the \nwealthy or the white. In less than a decade, 8 million veterans \nbenefitted from the GI Bill, and the immense success of that bill is in \nno small measure the reason why the World War II generation is now \ncalled the Greatest Generation.\n  In the half century since the GI Bill was enacted, we have made \nongoing efforts to make college a reality for as many young men and \nwomen as possible. In 1972, we created what we now know as Pell Grants \nto make college affordable for low and middle income families. Since \nthen, over 79 million students have attended college with the \nassistance of a Pell Grant, which are named for our distinguished \ncolleague Claiborne Pell, who served as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee.\n  In 1993, we created the Direct Loans to make inexpensive student \nloans available to college students. In the same year, we created \nAmeriCorps to encourage young people to serve their communities and \npursue their education.\n  Now, in this new century, in this new century, it is essential for \nCongress to take new steps to make the dream of a college education a \nreality for all.\n  Men and women with a college degree now earn 75 percent more than \nthose without it--a million dollars more in earnings over their \nlifetime. Those who use computers on the job earn 43 percent more than \nthose who do not. Jobs requiring at least some post-secondary education \nare estimated to account for over 40 percent of total employment growth \nover the next decade.\n  The need for a college education is greater that ever, but so is \ncost, and the soaring cost today is often pressing college education \nout of reach for qualified students. Last year, tuition and fees at \nfour-year public colleges rose an average of 14 percent, and the year \nbefore, 10 percent. For families in the lowest quartile of income \naverage public university costs now consume over 62 percent of their \nincome--compared to 42 percent in the early 1970's.\n  It is shameful that federal aid has not kept pace with rising \ntuition. Twenty years ago, a Pell Grant covered over 80 percent of \nfour-year college costs. Today, it covers less than 40 percent. Twenty \nyears ago, the typical package of student financial aid had 60 percent \nin grants and 40 percent in loans. Today, the ratio is reduced the \ntypical package now has 40 percent in grants and 60 percent loans--and \nthe grant-loan imbalance is getting worse.\n  Each year, over a half a million high school graduates who are \nqualified for college do not go to college full-time, because they \ncannot pay the bill. The average low-income, college student has an \naverage of $3,800 a year in college costs not covered by grants, loans, \nwork, or family savings.\n  Students who begin college have trouble staying in college and \ngraduating from college. Only 48 percent of students from upper-income \nfamilies graduate from college by age 24, and that figure is seven \ntimes the graduation rate of students from low-income families. Only 7 \npercent--7 percent--of low-income students graduate from college by age \n24. Students from minority backgrounds and those who would be the first \nin their family to achieve a four-year college degree are 33 percent \nmore likely to drop out of college.\n  Only forty percent of all whites in ages of 18 to 24 attend college. \nOnly 30 percent of African-American and only 16 percent of all Latinos \nare enrolled in college. Four in ten Latino college students drop out \nwithin three years of their enrollment.\n  We cannot allow these unacceptable percentages to continue. We must \ndo more to help students attend and finish college, and do more to help \ncolleges train more teachers and better teachers for our public schools \nso that more young men and women will be able to go to college and earn \ntheir degree, and fulfill their role in the nation's future.\n  It is a privilege today to join our Democratic colleagues on the \nEducation Committee, in introducing the College Quality, Affordability, \nand Diversity Improvement Act of 2003 to improve college opportunity \nfor qualified students. We know that too many families and students \nacross the country are struggling to afford the cost of college and we \nshould do all we can to\n\n[[Page S13384]]\n\nhelp them. The bill will improve access to college in six key ways. It \nhelps students pay for college by providing more financial aid. It \nslows the excessive increases in college tuition. It makes the \nrepayment of students loan less costly. It encourages and rewards \nstudents working their way through school. It help minority and low-\nincome students go to college and finish college. It improves the \nrecruitment and training of public school teachers who will prepare the \nnext generation of college students.\n  In compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the cost of \nour bill is offset by eliminating windfall profits to banks that \nparticipate in the student loan program.\n  Fulfilling a pledge of ``Education Security'' requires renewed \nresolve by everyone--students, families, colleges, states, and the \nfederal government. Students should work to save money for college. \nFamilies should pay what they can afford. Colleges should commit to \nreducing increases in tuition. States should continue as much support \nas they can for students. Federal support should fill the gap that \nremains.\n\n  Under our bill, $1,500 more in student aid will be available to hard-\npressed, middle-class families and $3,800 to lower income families.\n  We increase the maximum Pell grant by nearly $500, from $4,050 to \n$4,500, in order to keep pace with rising costs of tuition in public \ncolleges; 4.8 million lower income and working class students will get \nlarger Pell grants and 200,000 middle-class students will get Pell \ngrants for the first time.\n  The Act makes $3,000 in HOPE tax credit aid available to low-income \nfamilies who currently do not receive this aid, in part because the tax \ncredit is not refundable, and doubles the $1,500 HOPE scholarship tax \ncredit that middle-class families currently receive. Over 4 million \nPell grant students in families with a median income of $15,200 a year \nwill receive the HOPE tax credit for the first time. For 3.2 million \nmiddle-income families, their tax credit will double in size.\n  The bill increases campus-based financial aid programs such as \nCollege Work-Study and the Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, \nwhich means $200 more in aid to needy students on average.\n  The bill eliminates $100 in annual student taxes (also called \n``origination fees'') on federal need-based loans. Over 5 million \nstudents will no longer have to pay these up-front fees for the \nprivilege of borrowing tens of thousands of dollars.\n  For needy families struggling to send their children to college, \nthese changes will provide $3,800 in additional college aid each year--\n$500 in increased Pell aid, $3,000 in HOPE tax benefits, $200 more in \ncampus-based aid, and $100 in waivers of student loan fees.\n  The rising cost of college is an increasingly serious problem for the \nnation. Students need more financial aid each year. Families need \nprotection from tuition increases that year after year are in the \nhundreds, or even thousands of dollars. We have ignored the tuition \nincrease problem in higher education for too long.\n  In fact, few students actually pay ``sticker price'' tuition at \nprivate colleges, since many get a discount. At private universities, 8 \nout of every 10 students receives a discount from the published tuition \ncost, and those discounts average 40 percent of the sticker price.\n  The sticker price of college tuition is rising for many reasons. \nPublic colleges are dependent on state funding that has been declining \nwith the struggling national economy. As states cut back their support \nfor higher education, tuition rises. Colleges can reduce some costs in \norder to limit tuition increases, and we can help them do so.\n  Tuition is rising in general because colleges believe that in the \nconstant competition for students and faculty, it is necessary for each \ncollege to have the best facilities and programs. In effect, and \nbecause of this, a ``higher education arms race,'' colleges are \nconstantly striving to be ahead of the competition.\n  This bill rejects the price controls on college tuition that some \nhave suggested. Instead, it creates incentives for colleges to reduce \ncosts. It reduces regulatory costs for colleges and supports voluntary \nlimits on cost growth. It requires states to do their part in \nsupporting higher education. It ensures that families obtain better \ninformation about the true cost of college. And importantly, it rejects \nthe idea of withholding federal student aid for students who attend \ncolleges with excessive tuition costs, because doing so would hurt the \nneediest students.\n  Our bill supports the creation of college consortiums that will \njointly buy in bulk and share the costs of health care, libraries, \nfaculties, and other needs, so that they achieve economies of scale. It \nreduces regulatory burdens on colleges. When we lower the operating \ncosts of colleges, we make it easier for them to restrain tuition \nincreases.\n  The bill requires the Secretary of Education to convene a ``higher \neducation arms control'' summit. Groups of competing colleges will be \nconvened by the Secretary to negotiate limits on future growth in \ntuition. The Secretary will be given the authority to waive anti-trust \nprotections, when the waiver is needed to achieve reduced tuition \ngrowth.\n  States and colleges must do their part to make college affordable. \nThe bill insists that states must not treat college students like piggy \nbanks to balance state budgets. The bill offers a new partnership to \nStates, under which additional federal resources will be available to \nstates that invest in higher education. States that dramatically cut \nhigher education will be limited to current levels of aid.\n\n  Finally, our bill requires schools to publish their true tuition: the \nextent and average amount of discounts offered to students. Families \nshould know how much school really will cost and how possible it is to \nbargain for the best deal.\n  No matter what we do on grants and college costs, loans will continue \nto be a large part of college aid, but that debt should not be \nexcessive. Today, the average debt on student loans is $17,000, but it \ncan exceed $100,000 for graduate students and professional students. \nThis bill makes it easier to repay student loan debt or work it off. It \ncreates a new refinancing option for borrowers now saddled with \nconsolidated loans at high interest rates. It saves taxpayers money by \nrewarding student and school participation in the Direct Loan program.\n  The Act converts the current tax deduction for interest tax on \nstudent loans into a tax credit. This bipartisan proposal of Senator \nSnowe and Senator Schumer will provide low-income graduates with up to \n$1,500 in reimbursement for interest in student loans.\n  To encourage public service, the Act forgives the debt on Direct \nLoans for remaining after ten years for students in certain public \nsector jobs. Currently, student loan debt is often so large that it \nprevents students from accepting public interest jobs and forces them \nto look for higher paying jobs in the private sector. The bill rewards \nthose who choose lower paying public interest jobs in sectors where the \nneed is great, such as public safety, law enforcement, teaching, and \npublic interest legal services.\n  In addition, the Act enables all college graduates to refinance their \nstudent loans, just as their families would refinance a home mortgage. \nUnder current law, graduates who make payments on multiple variable \ninterest rate student loans can consolidate their loans today into a \nsingle fixed rate loan at the relatively low interest rate of 3.42 \npercent. But over 5 million borrowers consolidated their student loans \nyears ago at higher interest rates. The bill enables them to refinance \nthat consolidated loan at today's prevailing interest rate.\n  The availability of new Refinanced Direct Loans will dramatically \nreduce student loan repayment for millions of college graduates. A \nmiddle-class borrower, for example, with $60,000 in student loan debt \nat 7 percent interest will save $1,200 a year, or more than $10,000 \nover the life of the loan, if they refinance under this proposal.\n  Further, the bill rewards schools and students that save taxpayers \nmoney by participating in the federal Direct Loan program. For every \ndollar borrowed through the Direct Loan program instead of the \ntraditional private FFEL program, taxpayers save approximately fourteen \ncents. Our bill offers schools that participate in the Direct Loan \nprogram a percentage of the federal savings earmarked for student\n\n[[Page S13385]]\n\naid. Taxpayers will save money and students will receive more financial \naid, as a result of this ``Direct Loan Reward Program.'' It's a win-win \nproposal.\n  In light of the growing need today, current law imposes too heavy a \npenalty on students who work their way through college. Their financial \naid is reduced by 50 cents for every after-tax dollar they earn.\n  This bill exempts from penalty the first $9,000 earned by traditional \ncollege students and the first $18,000 earned by adults attending \ncollege. Those students who work to support their college education \ndeserve this additional assistance.\n  This bill includes a series of proposals to enable larger numbers of \nminority first-generation college students to go to college and \ngraduate from college. Our national commitment to diversity in college \neducation has been re-affirmed earlier this year by the Supreme Court. \nA major part of that commitment is preparing all young persons to \napproach the doors of higher education, making sure the gates are fully \nand fairly open to them, helping students to pay the costs, and \nenabling them to stay in college and graduate from college.\n  The Act increases funding for the successful TRIO and GEAR UP \nprograms that provide information and counseling about college \npreparation, financial aid, and admissions.\n  It increases the access of low-income students to college preparation \nand tutoring programs for the Scholastic Achievement Test and American \nCollege Test that have been proven to be effective.\n  In addition, it assists students in making well-informed decisions on \ncollege applications and enrollments, encourages colleges to act on \ntheir own to modify policies that make it more difficult for already \ndisadvantaged students to apply or enroll.\n  The Act supports partnerships between community colleges and four-\nyear colleges, and it encourages them to provide targeted assistance in \nthe form of tutoring, financial aid, child care, counseling, mentoring, \nand innovative course schedules, all with the goal of improving the \nadmission, retention and graduation rates of low-income students, and \nnon-traditional students.\n  Increased funding will be available for Hispanic-Serving Institutions \nand Historically Black Colleges and Universities. These colleges are \nthe source of an extraordinary proportion of minority graduates from \ncollege and they deserve greater support.\n  The federal government must do its part in strengthening further \ndiversity in higher education and colleges and individual students must \ndo their part as well. Diversity is our nation's strength, and all of \nus have an obligation to support it.\n  The Act includes a series of initiatives to help recruit and retain \nhigh-quality teachers for the nation's public schools. A fundamental \naspect of preparing students for college means making sure they have a \ngood teacher in every classroom.\n  The shortage of such teachers is increasingly severe. America will \nneed more than 2 million new teachers in the next decade. Today, \napproximately one in every three teachers leaves teaching within the \nfirst three years, and almost half leave within the first five years. \nThe No Child Left Behind Act has set a goal of a highly-qualified \nteacher in every classroom by 2006. Clearly, it is time for the nation \nto make teacher training a priority.\n  The Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998 included a new title II \nprogram to respond to the teacher shortage. The Act scales up the \ncurrent title II ``pilot program'' and strengthens and expands it, so \nthat every State will receive funds every year, in order to assure that \nas many children as possible are taught by highly qualified teachers.\n  The Act authorizes additional for State Grants and Partnership \nGrants, with the goal of establishing formula grants for every State. \nWe need to train teachers more effectively, attract more men and women \nto the field of teaching, and encourage them to continue in the field. \nThese grants will improve preparation, recruitment, and retention of \nteachers, and help States and schools put a highly qualified teacher in \nevery classroom.\n  By increasing the accountability of teacher preparation programs, the \nAct strengthens teacher preparation courses, so that teachers will have \nthe skills and support they need to succeed in the classroom. The bill \ncreates a new national database to provide accurate information on the \nquality of these preparation programs.\n  In addition, the Act establishes innovative programs to attract and \nretain teachers. A mentoring program will help train new teachers and \nprovide professional assistance from more experienced teachers. A new \nhome-ownership program will provide teachers in high-need districts \nwith funds to afford the purchase of a home. A separate initiative will \ndevelop links between community colleges and four-year colleges in \nteacher preparation programs, and help train teacher aides in high-need \ncommunities to become teachers.\n  The Act also helps attract teachers to high-need areas in high-demand \nsubjects, by increasing the amount of student loan forgiveness from \n$5,000 to $15,000, for teachers who teach math, science, special \neducation, bilingual education, or early education in these areas.\n  Good teachers in our schools are essential for preparing students to \nenter college. We must do all we can to support them and give them the \ntraining necessary to enable all students to achieve.\n  In total dollars, the size of this legislation is approximately $15 \nbillion a year. For a sense of context, I would note that we have just \napproved an $87 billion package for Iraq, have a $786 billion annual \ndiscretionary budget, and a $2.3 trillion annual mandatory and \ndiscretionary budget. This legislation is comparatively small.\n  There are three types of cost included. First, there are the tax \nprovisions that total approximately $9.2 billion a year--the same size \nas the President's tax breaks on dividend and capital gain income. We \nshould replace those dividend and capital gains cuts for the very \nwealthy instead with the education tax benefits included in this \nlegislation for families trying to pay for college.\n\n  Second, there are about $1.3 billion in annual changes to the student \nloan program for which this legislation fully pays. The bill eliminates \nwindfall profits to lenders in the loan program in order to pay fully \nfor the elimination student loan origination fees and to enable \nborrowers out of school to refinance their consolidated loans.\n  In particular, this bill closes a loophole in the student loan \nprogram whereby taxpayers subsidize a small minority of lenders to the \ntune of over $400 million a year in order to assure them a 9.5 percent \nrate of return. 9.5 percent is too much in today's interest rate \nenvironment. All lenders should receive the same guaranteed market rate \nof return for participating in the student loan program and no more.\n  Finally, the legislation includes approximately $4.5 billion in \nannual increases in discretionary education spending. That amount \nequals one half of one percent of the discretionary budget and is the \nsame amount that education funding increased last year. It is a modest \nproposal, frankly.\n  In the past, higher education policy helped the poor and the middle \nclass together. In recent years, though, we have developed separate \napproaches for these two groups--grants for the poor, and tax benefits \nfor the middle class. The median family income of recipients of Pell \ngrants is $15,000 a year. The HOPE Scholarship tax credit is available \nonly to families with more than $40,000 in income.\n  Because of the high cost of higher education for everyone, and \nbecause each student's own interest in a college education is also in \nour common interest, this bill will help both hard-pressed low-income \nand hard-pressed middle income families to send their children to \ncollege and prepare them for the future.\n  Our bill has the support of a variety of national groups: the United \nStates Students' Association, the United States Public Interest \nResearch Group, the Direct Loan Coalition, the National Council for \nCommunity and Education Partnerships, the Council for Opportunity in \nEducation, the College Migrant Association, the National Association of \nSecondary School Principals, the American Federation of Teachers, the \nNational Education Association, and Kaplan, Inc.\n\n[[Page S13386]]\n\n  Quality, affordability, and diversity--these are the focus of this \nact because these are the three great challenges we face today in \nhigher education policy and each closely related to the others. \nTogether, we can meet these new challenges in this new century and make \nthe promise of Education Security a reality not just a reality for some \nof our citizens but a reality for all of our citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1793\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A college education is more important than ever, and \n     the Federal Government should do more to make it affordable \n     and accessible to all qualified students because--\n       (A) recent shifts in the economy have increased the demand \n     for college-educated workers and increased the wage gap \n     between college-educated workers and those without a degree \n     (workers with a Bachelor's degree earn 75 percent more than \n     workers with just a high school diploma); and\n       (B) jobs requiring some postsecondary education are \n     expected to account for about 42 percent of total job growth \n     from 2000 through 2010.\n       (2) Increased access to college, reformed admissions \n     systems, and better retention of students are needed \n     because--\n       (A) 65 percent of high-income students are on a college-\n     preparatory track, whereas only 28 percent of low-income \n     students are on a college-preparatory track;\n       (B) 7 times as many students from high-income families (48 \n     percent) graduate from college by age 24 as students from \n     low-income families (7 percent);\n       (C) 80 percent of 4-year institutions of higher education \n     use the SAT in the admissions process;\n       (D) commercial SAT coaching classes, such as those run by \n     Kaplan, Inc. and Princeton Review, have demonstrated \n     effectiveness in raising a student's SAT score by 100 points \n     or more, which can significantly improve a student's chance \n     of getting into an elite college;\n       (E) SAT coaching programs range from $700 to $3,000 per \n     course and the costs are prohibitive for low-income students;\n       (F) those students who receive SAT coaching tend to be \n     disproportionally middle or upper class;\n       (G) 34 percent of students who receive SAT coaching are \n     from families whose combined annual income is between $40,000 \n     and $80,000, and 43 percent are from families whose combined \n     annual income is more than $80,000;\n       (H) applying to college early decision provides an \n     advantage to an applicant equal to an additional 100 points \n     on the SAT;\n       (I) low-income students are less able to apply to colleges \n     early decision because such students need to compare the \n     financial aid packages at different colleges;\n       (J) 40 percent of all Whites age 18 through 24 are enrolled \n     in institutions of higher education, whereas only 30 percent \n     of all African-Americans and only 16 percent of all Hispanics \n     are enrolled in institutions of higher education;\n       (K) nearly 4 out of every 10 Hispanics enrolled full time \n     in 4-year colleges drop out within 3 years of their initial \n     enrollment, African-Americans are half as likely as White \n     students to complete a Bachelor's degree in 4 years, and low-\n     income students are half as likely as upper-income students \n     to complete a Bachelor's degree in 4 years;\n       (L) in 1990, 1 in 4 Americans was a member of a minority \n     group, and in 2001, 1 in 3 Americans was a member of a \n     minority group;\n       (M) low-income, college-qualified high school graduates \n     have an annual ``unmet need'' of $3,800 in college expenses, \n     expenses not covered by grants, loans, work, or family \n     savings;\n       (N) 46 percent of all students who work in addition to \n     being full-time students report 25 hours or more a week of \n     employment; and\n       (O) 50 percent of those employed more than 25 hours a week \n     report that working hurts their grades and retention in \n     college, and students who work more than 35 hours a week are \n     considerably less likely to complete a year of college than \n     those who work less than 15 hours a week.\n       (3) Federal student aid is too focused on loans instead of \n     grant aid because--\n       (A) although approximately $55,000,000,000 is made \n     available annually in direct and indirect Federal aid to \n     postsecondary education students and their families, in 2002, \n     60 percent of such Federal student aid was in the form of \n     loans while only 40 percent was in the form of grants, a \n     reversal of the distribution 20 years ago;\n       (B) the purchasing power of the Pell Grant has declined \n     since Pell Grants cover only 40 percent of average fixed \n     costs at 4-year public colleges, about half of what they \n     covered 25 years ago;\n       (C) 15 years ago Pell Grants covered 98 percent of average \n     tuition at 4-year public colleges, whereas today Pell Grants \n     only cover 64 percent on average;\n       (D) the Federal Government saves money under the Direct \n     Loan program and makes a profit of 3.5 cents on every dollar \n     lent under the Direct Lending program, while it loses 10.37 \n     cents on every dollar lent under the Federal Family Education \n     Loan Program; and\n       (E) average student indebtedness is $17,000, and reaches \n     over $120,000 for professional school graduates.\n       (4) The Federal Government should do more to help States, \n     local educational agencies, and schools ensure a qualified \n     teacher in every classroom because under the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001, States are required to ensure that all \n     teachers teaching in core academic subjects within the State \n     are ``highly qualified'' not later than the end of the 2005-\n     2006 school year. States need to do much more to meet the \n     challenges in the new Federal law. In the 1999-2000 school \n     year, 29 percent of elementary school students, 59 percent of \n     middle school students, and 29 percent of high school \n     students were taught by teachers without both a major and \n     certification in the subject in which they taught.\n       (5) There is a severe shortage of qualified teachers, \n     especially in high-need fields and low-income areas because--\n       (A) approximately a third of America's teachers leave \n     teaching sometime during their first 3 years of teaching and \n     almost half leave during the first 5 years;\n       (B) overall turnover rate for teachers in high-poverty \n     areas is almost a third higher than it is for teachers in all \n     schools;\n       (C) underqualified teachers are more often found in high-\n     poverty schools; and\n       (D) in low-poverty secondary schools, approximately \\1/3\\ \n     of students are taught by a teacher who lacks either a \n     college degree in the subject area in which the teacher \n     teaches or certification in such subject area, while in high-\n     poverty secondary schools, approximately \\1/2\\ of students \n     are taught by such a teacher.\n       (6) Teacher shortages are more severe in some fields than \n     in others:\n       (A) Employment opportunities in teaching special education \n     are expected to grow 21 to 35 percent through 2010, an \n     increase of over 150,000 positions.\n       (B) The most recent data from a 1994 General Accounting \n     Office report estimates a\n\n[[Page S13387]]\n\n     shortage of 100,000 to 200,000 bilingual teachers, even as \n     the limited English proficient student population continues \n     to grow.\n       (C) It is estimated that of the 2,000,000 teachers needed \n     over the next 10 years, almost 200,000 will be secondary \n     school mathematics and science teachers.\n\n                   TITLE I--ACCESS TO COLLEGE FOR ALL\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kennedy, \nBingaman, Reed, Clinton and Murray to introduce the Democratic proposal \nto reauthorize the Higher Education Act, the College Quality, \nAffordability and Diversity Improvement Act of 2003 (QUAD).\n  The Higher Education Act authorizes the Federal Government's major \nactivities as they relate to financial assistance for students \nattending colleges and universities. It provides aid to institutions of \nhigher education, services to help students complete high school and \nenter and succeed in postsecondary education, and mechanisms to improve \nthe training of teachers.\n  According to a recent CRS report, tuition went up last year at four-\nyear public universities from 1.9 percent in New York to 23.8 percent \nin Massachusetts. In Connecticut, tuition went up 8.1 percent. \nAccording to the College Board, the average cost of attending a public \nfour-year college including tuition, fees, room and board is over \n$9,000. For private four-year colleges, the average cost is over \n$24,000. Another study indicates that 29 percent of an average family's \nincome goes toward public university tuition payments and 41 percent of \nan average family's income goes toward private university tuition. In \ncomparison, the average family's mortgage payment represents 32 percent \nof the annual income.\n  The simple fact is that many parents are deeply worried about how \nthey are going to pay for their children's higher education. Constant \nhikes in tuition are not only a source of concern for parents, in some \ncases they are a source of panic. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday is an attempt to alleviate this worry and help working parents \nand working students afford the high cost of college. We do this in a \nnumber of ways.\n  The QUAD Act will increase the amount of Pell grants available to \nworking families. Two decades ago, Pell grants covered 84 percent of \naverage costs at four-year universities; today they cover less than 30 \npercent. This bill will reverse this downward trend by raising the \nmaximum Pell Grant for students by $450, from $4,050 to $4,500.\n  The bill works through the tax code and student loans to make sure \nstudents are getting the financial support that they need on the most \nfavorable terms. We eliminate origination fees on subsidized student \nloans, double the size of the Hope Credit, and allow college graduates \na chance to refinance their consolidated loans so that they can take \nadvantage of today's historically low interest rates.\n  QUAD works to level the playing field in admissions by requiring \nuniversities and colleges to be more up-front about their admissions \npolicies and by creating a grant program so that low-income students \nand minority students have available to them college test preparation \nprograms that on average increase a student's SAT score by 100 points.\n  The bill creates two new retention programs to ensure that students \nthat start college complete their degrees. Low-income students are half \nas likely as upper income students to complete a bachelor's degree in \nfour years. African-American students are half as likely as white \nstudents to graduate, and four in ten Hispanics who enroll in four-year \ninstitutions drop out within three years.\n  QUAD will improve opportunities for undergraduates and graduate \nstudents at Minority Serving Institutions by creating new grant \nprograms, removing regulatory burdens and increasing the funding levels \nof current initiatives. The bill also helps colleges and school \ndistricts recruit and train more highly qualified teachers and provides \nbetter training for principals and superintendents.\n  In addition to all of this, QUAD directly addresses the problem of \nrising college costs. This bill puts into place a requirement that \nstates maintain their portion of higher education funding at 90 percent \nfrom fiscal year to fiscal year. If the Federal Government is going to \nmake a commitment to providing more resources to higher education by \nincreasing monies for student aid, it is only fair that we require \nstates to maintain their current share of assistance. States should not \nbe using our proposed increases in federal aid as an excuse to decrease \ntheir own spending levels. The states and the Federal Government should \nbe working together on higher education, and not using one or the other \nas an excuse to reduce their share of the costs.\n  This bill also creates incentives for colleges to cut costs. QUAD \ncreates a demonstration program to provide seed money to colleges and \nuniversities that want to explore innovative ways to reduce costs and \npass savings on to students. This can be accomplished across \nuniversities by pooling resources, making joint purchase of supplies or \nemployee benefits, and creating joint degree programs.\n  Recently, a 20-member consortium of Wisconsin universities spent \n$285,000 on staff and resources to find a way to purchase health care \njointly. In the first year, they realized a savings of $3.8 million. \nThat is a pretty impressive return on an investment of $285,000. \nBuilding on this type of initiative, our bill provides grants of \n$200,000 to consortia in other states around the country to incentivize \nthese same kinds of cost-cutting measures, measures that have no effect \non academic mission or quality of student life.\n  In the end, it is essential in this reauthorization that we do \neverything we can to ensure that qualified students are not being \nlocked out of college. The economic costs for families would be \nimmense. A full-time worker with a bachelor's degree earns about 60 \npercent more than a full-time worker with only a high school diploma. \nOver a lifetime, the gap in earnings exceeds $1 million.\n  I hope our colleagues who are not cosponsoring this bill will give it \nserious consideration. By working together, I believe that the Senate \nas a body can act to ensure that every young person in our Nation has \nan opportunity to rise as high as their talents, dreams and \ndetermination will take them.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the College \nQuality, Affordability and Diversity Improvement Act of 2003, or QUAD, \nintroduced by Senator Kennedy and cosponsored by Senators Dodd, Murray, \nReed, Clinton, and myself.\n  Since 1998, when Congress last reauthorized the Higher Education Act, \nenrollment in institutions of higher education has risen to an all-time \nhigh, growing by nearly one million students. Half of these new \nenrollments are minority students, nearly 200,000 of which are of \nHispanic origin. Projections show that enrollment in higher education \nwill only continue to grow in the coming years. The increased demand \nfor a college degree is due much in part to the changing economy. Those \nwith a bachelor's degree now make 75 percent more than those without, \nand jobs requiring some post-secondary education are expected to \naccount for over 40 percent of total job growth this decade.\n  While the demand for a college degree has increased, so too has the \ncost of college, and rather drastically. These increases severely limit \naccess for many qualified students. For the 2002-2003 school year, \nfour-year public universities reported an average tuition increase of \nover 14 percent. This comes on top of an almost ten percent increase in \naverage tuition last year. Just three years ago the average increase \nwas just four percent. For families in the lowest income quartile, \naverage public university costs now consume 62 percent of their income. \nIn the\n\n[[Page S13407]]\n\nearly 1970's it was only 42 percent. What's more, the purchasing power \nof the Pell grant has declined. Today, Pell Grants cover only 40 \npercent of average fixed costs at four-year public colleges. Twenty \nyears ago, they covered 80 percent of costs.\n  Every American should have the opportunity to realize his or her full \npotential, regardless of the depth of their pocketbook or the size of \ntheir parents' wallet. It is time for Congress to step up and meet the \nchallenge: we must do more to help qualified students attend and finish \ncollege.\n  Currently, 40 percent of all whites ages 18-24 are pursuing post-\nsecondary education, compared with only 30 percent of African-Americans \nand 16 percent of Hispanics of the same age. Those disadvantaged \nstudents who do start college often do not finish: low-income students \nare half as likely as upper income students to complete a bachelor's \ndegree in four years; four in ten Hispanic students enrolled in four-\nyear institutions drop out within three years of initial enrollment.\n  The College Quality, Affordability, and Diversity Improvement Act \nwill help low-income and minority students get into college. QUAD \nincreases funding to critical programs including GEAR Up, TRIO and \nLEAP. It improves access for low-income students through the creation \nof a new grant program for proven-effective test prep programs to \nprovide free tutoring for college entrance exams to low-income \nstudents. It improves access and awareness for low-income students by \ncreating a partnership among the federal government, the states, \ncolleges, philanthropies, and corporations to provide low-income \nstudents with early information and an early assurance of financial \naccess to college.\n\n  But Mr. President, we cannot simply help a student get into and pay \nfor college, we must help them stay in college and earn their degree. \nOf the 16 percent of 18-24 year old Hispanics enrolling in college, a \nmere 40 percent actually complete their degree. Similarly, only 38 \npercent of African-American students that enroll in college complete \ntheir degree. QUAD will help low-income and minority students complete \ntheir education through the creation of two new retention programs. The \nfirst program provides grants to colleges and universities, which serve \nhigh-proportions of low-income students to implement innovative \nprograms to provide students with the support they need to persist and \ngraduate. The second program requires schools with large discrepancies \nin disaggregated graduation rates to increase their investment in \nsupport services to improve retention. QUAD also increases funding for \nminority serving institutions, and creates new grant programs to \nencourage minority students to pursue graduate education at minority \nserving institutions.\n  Minorities make up an increasing proportion of the United States \npopulation, but they continue to severely lag behind white students in \ncompleting both undergraduate and particularly graduate degrees. \nMinority Serving Institutions are serving an increasing proportion of \nminorities, and can help decrease this disparity. Among Hispanics who \nreceived master's degrees in 1999-2000, 25 percent attained them at \nHispanic Serving Institutions and in the past ten years, the number of \nHispanic students receiving master's degrees at HSIs grew by 136 \npercent, the number receiving doctoral degrees grew by 85 percent, and \nthe number earning first time professional degrees grew by 47 percent.\n  This past May, I proposed the Next Generation Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions Act, S. 1190. Under this act, the burdensome regulatory \nbarriers for the 18 Hispanic Serving Institutions in New Mexico and \nmore than 190 HSIs nationally would be removed and opportunities for \nstudents at HSIs would be greatly expanded. QUAD takes up this effort, \nincreasing funding for current grants to HSIs and creating a new grant \nprogram for graduate programs at HSIs. The grant program would \nauthorize a total of $300 million in fiscal year 2005 and such sums as \nmay be necessary in future years. Grants under this program would help \nschools improve instructional facilities, purchase instruction and \ntelecommunications materials, give support to needy post baccalaureate \nstudents, improve distance learning and other telecommunications \ncapabilities, collaborate with other institutions of higher education \nto expand programs, and support faculty and curriculum development.\n  QUAD will also help to attract and retain high quality teachers at \ntribal universities. This past February, Senator Daschle and I \nintroduced legislation that would create a loan forgiveness program for \nindividuals who choose to teach at tribal colleges and universities. \nQUAD includes this legislation, S. 378.\n  Another component of QUAD that I am proud to have worked on is the \nteacher quality provisions of Title II. Since my involvement in the \naccountability sections of Title II during the last reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act, we have worked to increase the bar for \nteacher quality. QUAD will greatly improve the training and recruitment \nof teachers by expanding and strengthening teacher-training programs to \nhelp teacher preparation institutions feed more qualified teachers into \nthe classrooms. These improvements will help States and school \ndistricts meet the goal outlined in the No Child Left Behind Act of \nensuring a highly qualified teacher in every classroom.\n  QUAD will help colleges and school districts recruit and train more \nteachers with higher quality programs, and provide better training for \nin-service principals and superintendents. QUAD strengths provisions of \nHEA to focus on improving the quality of programs and services to \nteachers by ensuring that teacher preparation courses provide teachers \nwith the specific skills and supports they need to succeed in the \nclassroom, such as training necessary to help all students achieve high \nstandards, including children with disabilities and limited English \nproficient students, and the integration of state standards and \naccountability in the classroom. QUAD supports innovation by \nestablishing new financial incentive programs to professionalize the \nfield of teaching, and attract and retain more individuals in the \nclassroom. QUAD will also help to attract teachers to where they are \nneeded most by increasing the amount of student loan forgiveness for \nteachers working in high-need, high-demand areas. And QUAD helps to \nbetter prepare teachers to use technology in the classroom by \nincreasing funding for the Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use \nTechnology program.\n  It is time for Congress to step up and meet the challenge: We must do \nmore to help qualified students attend and finish college. I know that \nmy colleagues will take this proposal under serious consideration and I \nlook forward to working with them on the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act this coming year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13407-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13407-S13409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 76--RECOGNIZING THAT NOVEMBER 2, 2003, \n SHALL BE DEDICATED TO ``A TRIBUTE TO SURVIVORS'' AT THE UNITED STATES \n                       HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nReid, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Smith) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 76\n\n       Whereas, in 1945, American soldiers and other Allied \n     forces, defeated Nazi Germany, ending World War II in Europe \n     and the systematic murder of Europe's Jews and other targeted \n     groups;\n       Whereas 6,000,000 Jews were killed during the Holocaust, \n     and after World War II hundreds of thousands of survivors \n     immigrated to the United States, where in spite of their \n     enormous suffering, they rebuilt their lives, and embraced \n     and enriched their adopted homeland;\n       Whereas, in 1978, President Jimmy Carter created the \n     President's Commission on the Holocaust to make a \n     recommendation regarding ``the establishment . . . of an \n     appropriate memorial to those who perished in the \n     Holocaust'';\n       Whereas President Carter said: ``Out of our memory . . . of \n     the Holocaust we must forge an unshakable oath with all \n     civilized people that never again will the world stand \n     silent, never again will the world . . . fail to act in time \n     to prevent this terrible crime of genocide. . . . [W]e must \n     harness the outrage of our own memories to stamp out \n     oppression wherever it exists. We must understand that human \n     rights and human dignity are indivisible.'';\n\n[[Page S13408]]\n\n       Whereas, in 1979, the Commission recommended ``a living \n     memorial that will speak not only of the victims' deaths but \n     of their lives, a memorial that can transform the living by \n     transmitting the legacy of the Holocaust'';\n       Whereas, in 1980, the United States Congress unanimously \n     passed legislation authorizing the creation of the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Museum as a ``permanent living \n     memorial'' on Federal land in the Nation's Capital;\n       Whereas, in 1983, Vice President George Bush designated the \n     Federal land on which the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum would be built;\n       Whereas Vice President Bush said: ``Here we will learn that \n     each of us bears responsibility for our actions and our \n     failure to act.

Mr. President, this year marks the 10th anniversary of the \nopening of one of this country's greatest museums and educational \ninstitutions, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. I have been \nprivileged to serve on the Council of this great institution since its \nfounding, and I have had no greater honor in the years I have served in \nWashington.\n  The Museum opened in April of 1993. Speaking in this chamber at that \ntime, I said that the reason we needed to support this institution was \nsimple: ``To remember, and by remembering, to strengthen America's \nmoral compass.''\n  The Museum has served as an institution of remembrance and study \nsince then, and its contribution has been immense. Over 19 million \nvisitors have gone through its doors in the past decade, making this \nmuseum one of the most popular in Washington, and in the United States. \nOf these 19 million, nearly six million of those visitors were \nchildren, who have seen and been moved by the exhibit ``Daniel's \nStory,'' which renders the story of the Holocaust from the perspective \nof a child.\n  Over two million international visitors have come to the Museum in \nthe past 10 years. This includes seventy-three heads of state have been \nincluded among those foreign visitors. I am heartened to imagine how \nthey have returned to their many nations with the striking impression \nof how profoundly this country considers the most cataclysmic human \nevent of the 20th century, the Holocaust, and how we demonstrate this \nby supporting this institution in the heart of Washington, D.C.\n  Not only have nearly 20 million people come to the Museum, but the \nMuseum, through its many traveling exhibits, has brought the story of \nthe Holocaust to many cities around this country. In 2002, the Museum \nbrought another exhibit, ``The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936'' to my home \nState of Utah, to show during our historic Winter Olympics. Over 20,000 \nUtahns and foreign visitors attended that exhibit, which demonstrated \nthe historic arc from an era of national fascism and barbaric racism to \nthe present day vision of tolerance and good will that my state showed \nthe world in the winter of 2002.\n  The Museum also serves as a educational center for Holocaust \nscholarship. The Museum's Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies \nsupports scholarship and publications at the Museum as well as in \nconjunction with universities throughout this country. In the short \nperiod of its existence, the Museum has already greatly advanced \nHolocaust studies and I say with confidence that future scholars of \nthis seminal event of the 20th century will all be influenced by the \nwork of this great Museum.\n  As I've mentioned already, this is not the first time I have taken to \nthe floor to laud the work of this great institution. In November of \n1995, concerned about a rise in episodes, both here and abroad, of \nHolocaust deniers perpetuating their grotesque perversions of history, \nI introduced S. Res. 193, a resolution denouncing Holocaust denial. \nRecognizing the scholarship already being promoted by the Museum, the \nresolution ``commended the vital, ongoing work of the United States \nHolocaust Memorial Museum, which memorializes the victims of the \nHolocaust and teaches all who are willing to learn profoundly \ncompelling and universally resonant moral lessons.''\n  I introduced that resolution on November 9, 1995, which was the 57th \nanniversary of Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, the notorious \n1938 pogrom of Jewish persecution by the Nazi regime, preparing the \ndark descent to the Holocaust that was to follow. In my statement, I \nsaid: ``Fifty-seven years after Kristallnacht, we are fortunate to \nstill have survivors of the Holocaust among us. I worry about the \nmemory of the Holocaust when the survivors will no longer be here. With \neach passing year, we have fewer survivors among us.''\n  The stewards and scholars of the United States Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum embody the recognition that the mission of the Museum is to \npreserve the memory of the victims. And for this reason, the Museum is \nmarking its 10th anniversary in the only way it could: By hosting a \nhistoric ``Tribute to Survivors,'' which will occur at the end of this \nweek, on November 1st and 2nd. It is fitting and proper that this would \nbe the way to mark this anniversary. To date, 6,500 Holocaust survivors \nand their families are scheduled to attend, making this perhaps the \nlast reunion of this kind. I urge all of my colleagues to review the \nschedule of events and, if at all possible, to go to the Museum to pay \ntribute to the survivors and this great institution.\n  To commemorate this event, and to honor the Museum on its 10th \nanniversary, I wish to submit this resolution\n\n[[Page S13409]]\n\nhonoring the victims of the Holocaust and recognizing the vital work of \nthe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n  I am most grateful for the co-sponsorship of Senators Voinovich, \nReid, Coleman, Collins and Smith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13409-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 77--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n     SUPPORTING VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF THE FEDERAL OBSCENITY LAWS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, but not \nbefore November 3, may turn to the consideration of S. 1753, the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, and that it be considered under the following \nlimitation:\n  The only first-degree amendments be the following and that they be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments, provided that where the \nterm ``relevant'' is used for a first-degree amendment it be construed \nto mean anything related to, pertaining to, or dealing with the subject \nmatter contained in either the Senate or House bill, or the substitute \namendment; textual reference is not required.\n  The amendments are: Cantwell, ID theft; Corzine, financial \ninstitutions to notify FTC of consumer data breach; Dayton, national \ninformation sharing standards; Durbin, student loan payment reporting; \ntwo by Feingold: buy American and data mining reporting; Kohl, student \nloans credit reporting; two by Senator Schumer: debit card fee \ndisclosure, economic policy; Senator Nelson of Florida, disposal of \nconsumer financial records; Senators Lincoln and Pryor of Arkansas, \nusury limit; three relevant amendments by Senator Feinstein; three \namendments by Senator Boxer: consumer protection from false affiliate \ninformation sharing, right to know what affiliates your company can \nshare information with, and tightening opt-out marketing loopholes; \nSenators Shelby and Sarbanes, a substitute amendment; relevant \namendments by Senator Brownback and Senator Specter; Senator Murkowski, \nsharing confidential information; Senator Sarbanes, two relevant \namendments; Senator Shelby, two relevant amendments; that upon the \ndisposition of these amendments, the bill be read the third time and \nH.R. 2622, the House companion, be discharged from the Banking \nCommittee and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that \nall after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1753, as \namended, be substituted in lieu thereof; the bill be read the third \ntime, and the Senate vote on final passage of the bill, with the \npreceding all occurring without any intervening action or debate; \nfurther, that upon disposition of the House bill, S. 1753 be returned \nto the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can just say this prior to the consent \nbeing entered into the Record, we have a number of amendments. It \nsounds like a lot. I have spoken to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe committee, indicating that I am not sure all of the amendments on \nthis side will even be offered. For example, Senator Feingold thinks \nthese will be accepted. If they are not, he will take a 10-minute time \nagreement.\n  I think we can move through these amendments quite rapidly. As I \nthink everybody knows at this stage, the vast majority of the Senate \nfavors this legislation. I think we should acknowledge that this \nagreement was reached with some effort today as a result of the \nadvocacy of the Senators from California. They did not want this matter \nto be brought up this week because the fires are raging as we speak in \nCalifornia. They are both scheduled to go out there sometime this week. \nIt would have been terribly inconvenient.\n  I appreciate everyone's cooperation. The majority and Senators on \nthis side had other amendments they wanted to offer. But understanding \nthe difficulty and the problems in California at this stage, we arrived \nat a point where I think it is fair to everybody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I certainly hope my friend from Nevada \nis correct, because it does list 25 amendments. I share his hope and \nexpectations that many of those will disappear and we will be able to \ndeal with this legislation, which is widely supported by an \noverwhelming majority of the Senate, in relatively rapid fashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/28/senate-section/article/S13419-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2800\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill on \nWednesday, tomorrow, Senator Dorgan be immediately recognized in order \nto offer an amendment related to the September 11 commission. I further \nask unanimous consent that there be 40 minutes equally divided in \nrelation to the amendment and that at the expiration of time I or my \ndesignee be recognized in order to make a point of order against the \namendment; further, that Senator Dorgan then be recognized in order to \nmove to suspend rule XVI with respect to his amendment. I finally ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate then proceed immediately to a vote on \nthe motion to suspend. I also ask consent that following that vote the \nSenate then proceed to consideration of H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forests \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I, along with Senator Leahy \nand others on this side, are terribly disappointed that the action on \nthe Dorgan amendment tomorrow will bring to a close, at least at this \nstage, further action on this most important appropriations bill. My \nmemory could be wrong, but not too wrong, that in the past we have \nmoved through this bill pretty quickly. The Senator from Kentucky has \nbeen involved in this for a long time, as either the ranking member or \nchairman of this subcommittee. I think he and Senator Leahy, who has \nbeen involved with this for many years, have done an outstanding job.\n  There is one issue that has held this up and that is getting more \nmoney for global AIDS. The President supports this effort to get more \nmoney for global AIDS, and I am disappointed he and his people have not \nweighed in more on this, although knowing the Senator who is wanting to \nslow this down, does not want this to move forward, I am not sure what \ngood it would do for anyone to talk to him knowing what an advocate he \nis and how strongly he feels about things.\n  The point I am making is I think we should have a vote on this, \nwhatever it takes, and move on. On this side, I think everyone would \nhave to acknowledge we have cooperated on these appropriations bills, \nbut we cannot go to other appropriations bills when we have an \nappropriations bill that is on the floor and somebody finds a tough \nvote. It is not right. We in good faith have had our Members not offer \nvarious amendments. We have been very discrete in the amendments we \nhave offered, and I would hope the night will bring more understanding \nto this most important issue of global AIDS.\n  It is not going to go away. It will appear on this bill or some other \nbill. I know my friend from Kentucky has worked very hard for hours \ntoday trying to move forward. This is his bill. Again, I express my \nconcern and disappointment but have no objection to the unanimous \nconsent agreement that has been suggested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nunanimous consent request is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may state briefly on the issue of \nfunding of global AIDS, I think it is important to remind our \ncolleagues it was the President who recommended $15 billion over 5 \nyears to attack this global public health crisis. Even without enacting \namendments that go above the budget, the $2 billion that is in this \nappropriations bill and another appropriations bill that has already \ncleared the Senate--between the two bills, $2 billion--provides for the \nadministration, even if we are unable through this process at some \npoint this year to provide additional appropriations, to spend all the \nmoney that the administration feels it can usefully spend in the first \nyear of the 5-year commitment.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering passage of S. 247, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia \nAmendments Act of 2003.\n  I must first thank my friend and original cosponsor, Senator Breaux, \nfor his commitment to taking action with me on these important issues. \nHe and I represent coastal States that are directly affected by harmful \nalgal blooms and hypoxia, and we see first-hand how these outbreaks \nhave harmful impacts on marine ecology, resource economics, and human \nhealth in our States.\n  For instance, during the past several weeks Maine has endured the \nmost toxic red tide to hit our coastline in decades. When humans, fish, \nand marine mammals eat clams, mussels, oysters, snails, and other \nshellfish that have fed on the algae that produced this red tide, they \nare exposed to accumulated toxins, which can cause harmful--even \nfatal--neurological problems. This phenomenon occurs along thousands of \nmiles of U.S. coastline, but it has increased dramatically in the Gulf \nof Maine in the last 20 years. In Maine this month, the most recent \noutbreak caused public health alerts and closed the entire coastline to \nshellfishing, and it may even be linked to the deaths of 21 large \nwhales, including humpbacks. As you can see, due to these events \npassage of this bill is extremely timely.\n  I must also thank Senators Voinovich, DeWine, and Levin for \ncosponsoring this bill and helping to expand its scope to include the \nGreat Lakes. Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia have increased in Lake \nErie and other regional waters in recent years, and Great Lakes-\nbordering States are struggling to identify the causes of these events. \nLike other coastal States, they need to be able to better predict, \nmonitor, and mitigate these events in order to protect their \nenvironment, economy, and human health.\n  This bill continues and builds upon the research efforts we \nestablished in 1998 through the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia \nResearch and Control Act. This original bill authorized a cross-section \nof research and monitoring activities on harmful algal blooms and \nhypoxia. However, algal blooms are still prevalent around the country, \nthe hypoxia ``dead zone'' still occurs each summer in the Gulf of \nMexico, and the management and mitigation measures set forth in our \n1998 bill still need to be realized. The amendments in S. 247 would \nauthorize the funding that will reignite these scientific activities \nand provide important new authorities.\n  This reauthorization continues to seek and utilize the valuable \ncontributions of the once-temporary Inter-\n\n[[Page S13422]]\n\nAgency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia by making it \npermanent. The bill would direct this Task Force to develop a response \nand prediction action plan to protect environmental and public health \nfrom the harmful impacts of harmful algal blooms. Through this plan, \ntask force members would review prediction techniques, develop \ninnovative response measures, and include incentive-based partnership \napproaches.\n\n  The bill would also authorize the task force and the Department of \nCommerce to develop local and regional assessments at the request of \ncoastal States, Indian tribes, and local governments, so they could \nobtain technical assistance in addressing their local hypoxia and \nharmful algal bloom outbreaks. The regional plans will help avoid a \none-size-fits-all approach to prediction and response, since local and \nregional variations in the types of land use, landscape geology, and \ncommunity input should be taken into account. By tailoring mitigation \nand management measures to each location, the overall approach can be \nmade more effective.\n  As for the Great Lakes, S. 247 would direct this task force to \nconduct a scientific assessment of Great Lakes harmful algal blooms, \nand it would direct them to conduct a scientific assessment of hypoxia \nin U.S. coastal waters, including the Great Lakes, not less than once \nevery 5 years. This amendment would authorize funding levels for these \nassessments at $2 million for fiscal years 2004 through 2006.\n  Overall, this bill would authorize $26 million in fiscal year 2004, \nand $26.5 million in fiscal year 2005, and $27 million in fiscal year \n2006. These funding levels reflect modest increases in some of the \nresearch and monitoring programs authorized in the 1998 bill and \nprovide funding for the new assessments and implementation of their \nrecommendations.\n  This reauthorization facilitates the continuation and expansion of \ncollaborative, science-based research efforts that can help us better \nunderstand how to predict and mitigate harmful algal blooms and hypoxia \nevents. The nation is well-served by legislation that seeks to protect \ncoastal ecosystems, resource-dependent economies, and human health, and \nI thank my colleagues for supporting this important bill. I look \nforward to sending this bill to the House of Representatives so that \nthey may undertake the next step in passing it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaty, transmitted to the Senate on October 28, 2003, by the \nPresident of the United States: Protocol Amending Tax Convention with \nSri Lanka (Treaty Doc. 108-9).\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the \nUnited States of America and the Government of the Democratic Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the \nPrevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income signed at \nColombo on March 14, 1985, together with an exchange of notes, signed \nat Washington on September 20, 2002 (the ``Protocol''). I also \ntransmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State concerning the Protocol.\n  The Protocol would amend the Convention to make it similar to tax \ntreaties between the United States and other developing nations. The \nConvention would provide maximum rates of tax to be applied to various \ntypes of income and protection from double taxation of income. The \nConvention, as amended by the Protocol, also provides for resolution of \ndisputes and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to \nresidents that are engaged in treaty shopping.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Protocol in conjunction with the Convention, and that the Senate \ngive its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.
