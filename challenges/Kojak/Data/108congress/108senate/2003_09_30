CRONE, OF TEXAS, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n                                 JUDGE\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Marcia A. Crone, of \nTexas, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of \nTexas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there are \nnow 2 minutes for debate equally divided prior to the vote on the \nnomination.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to speak in support \nof the confirmation of Judge Marcia Crone. She is a native of Dallas \nand alumna of the University of Texas. She will preside over a newly \ncreated seat\n\n[[Page S12146]]\n\nin Beaumont where she has agreed she will make her home and stay for \nthe duration of her term.\n  I know she will serve with distinction. Judge Crone is currently a \nU.S. Magistrate Judge in the Southern District of Texas serving in that \ncapacity since 1992.\n\n  Marcia was valedictorian of her high school, Hillcrest High School in \nDallas, a National Merit Scholar, and the valedictorian of the \nUniversity of Texas class of 1973. She also graduated first in her \nclass from the University of Houston Law Center in 1978.\n  Her outstanding educational accomplishments are also joined by \naccomplishments in her professional life. After graduating from law \nschool, she joined the Houston-based firm Andrews & Kurth. Her \nspecialities included product liability, breach of contract, oil and \ngas, and securities law. She became a partner in that firm where she \nremained until her appointment to the Federal bench.\n  Mr. President, is there another minute, or am I the only speaker?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute remains in opposition. \nThe Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if there is \nno opposition, to take the final minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as a U.S. Magistrate, Judge Crone has \npresided over a number of civil and criminal cases, ranging from \nemployment discrimination to pretrial arraignments and detention \nhearings in felony cases. In her more than 10 years on the Federal \nbench, she has authored approximately 700 opinions, over 130 of which \nare published. She is an active member of the Houston community and bar \nassociation. She serves on the board of directors of the Garland Walker \nInn of Court and is a mentor to Houston area law school students. She \nis also active in her church.\n  Marcia Crone meets the high standards to which we hold all Federal \njudges, and she has quite an impressive record. I am pleased that John \nCornyn, the other Senator from Texas, joins me in supporting the \nnomination of Marcia Crone, and I urge our colleagues to join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of Marcia \nCrone, who has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Texas.\n  Judge Crone received a bachelor of arts degree, summa cum laude, from \nthe University of Texas at Austin, graduating with a 4.0 grade point \naverage and as valedictorian in 1973. She then graduated first in her \nclass from the University of Houston Law Center in 1978, receiving a \njuris doctor degree, summa cum laude. After graduating from law school, \nshe entered private practice, first as an associate and later as a \npartner at the law firm of Andrews & Kurth, L.L.P. During her years in \nprivate practice Judge Crone represented both individuals and \ncorporations, litigating primarily in the areas of labor law, \nemployment law, products liability, and commercial litigation.\n  Judge Crone was appointed in 1992 as a Federal magistrate judge in \nthe Southern District of Texas. She has presided over numerous trials \nin civil cases involving a wide range of issues, including securities \nfraud, employment discrimination, intellectual property rights, \npersonal injury claims, contract disputes, admiralty, civil rights, \ninsurance matters, social security appeals, and prisoner litigation. In \nher more than 10 years on the Federal bench, Judge Crone has authored \napproximately 700 opinions.\n  Judge Crone devotes substantial amounts of time to programs mentoring \nstudents from the three local law schools, giving them the opportunity \nto serve as interns in her chambers, judging mock trial and moot court \ncompetitions, and participating annually in the American Bar \nAssociation's Minority Judicial Externship Program. She previously \nserved on the board of directors of the southeast Texas Chapter of the \nNational Multiple Sclerosis Society and has performed volunteer work \nfor a local adoption agency.\n  I have no doubt that Judge Crone's elevation to the district court \nwill greatly benefit the Eastern District of Texas. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting her nomination.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJudge Marcia A. Crone to serve as U.S. District Judge in the Beaumont \nDivision of the Eastern District of Texas.\n  Judge Crone is an outstanding nominee with a fine legal mind and fair \njudicial disposition. She has served as a U.S. magistrate judge in the \nSouthern District of Texas since 1992. During her tenure on the Federal \nbench thus far, she has already authored approximately 700 opinions, \nover 130 of which are published. Prior to her service as a U.S. \nmagistrate judge, she practiced law for 14 years.\n  She is an active member of several legal organizations in the Houston \narea. She is a native Texan and a mother of two. And she is an active \nparticipant in her community. She is a member of the Chapelwood United \nMethodist Church, the Houston World Affairs Council, and the P.T.A. at \nSecond Baptist School, and a former member of the board of directors of \nthe National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n  In short, Judge Crone is an outstanding nominee with solid \ncredentials and a reputation of fairness and impartiality. I support \nher nomination, and look forward to her distinguished service on the \nbench of the Eastern District of Texas, where the citizens of Beaumont \nneed her good legal judgment and wisdom.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired. The question \nis, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Marcia \nCrone, of Texas, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mr. Edwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nVermont (Mr. Jeffords), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

WHITE, OF OKLAHOMA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n          DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Under the previous order, the \nclerk will report the next nomination.\n\n[[Page S12147]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Ronald A. \nWhite, of Oklahoma, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to recommend, along with \nSenator Inhofe, the nomination of Ron White to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of the State of Oklahoma.\n  Ron White has been a partner in a prestigious law firm in Tulsa, OK, \nfor 17 years. He is eminently qualified.\n  He has considerable experience in major corporate litigation in Tulsa \nwith sixty percent of his court appearances taking place in Federal \ncourt. He is a man of outstanding individual character, and the \nPresident could not have picked a more qualified person for this job.\n  A native of Sapulpa, Ron is a 1983 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the \nUniversity of Oklahoma. He earned his Juris Doctorate (Cum Laude) from \nthe University of Oklahoma College of Law in 1986, where he was a \nmember of the Order of the Coif Honor Society.\n  Ron is also very active in his community as a member of both the \nPhilbrook Museum of Art Masters Society and the Tulsa Ballet Founders \nSociety. In addition, he is on the Board of Directors of the Margaret \nHudson Program, an organization that helps pregnant teens and young \nmothers finish high school.\n  Ron has been admitted to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the U.S. \nDistrict Court for Northern, Western, and Eastern Districts of \nOklahoma, and the U.S. Court of Appeals. Furthermore, he has been rated \n``unanimously qualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n  Ron is exceptionally qualified to serve as Eastern District Judge for \nthe State of Oklahoma. The judicial system and our nation as a whole \nwill benefit from his service. Senator Inhofe and I are pleased to \nrecommend confirmation of Ronald A. White to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't think there is any doubt but \nRonald White is one of the most qualified nominees that we have been \nable to act on and confirm.\n  In addition to that, he comes from my hometown of Tulsa. I know him \nwell and I know what he does. This is a generous person. He is famous \nfor taking indigent cases and not charging fees.\n  The Margaret Hudson Program is a program to give alternatives to \npregnant teens, and he gives his free legal counsel to that.\n  He is the type of person certainly deserving from his own personal \nlifestyle as well as his professional qualifications.\n  I heartily endorse him.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my unqualified \nsupport for the nomination of Ronald White to the Eastern District of \nOklahoma and to urge my colleagues to confirm this fine nominee.\n  Mr. White is a distinguished litigator. After graduating from the \nUniversity of Oklahoma law school in 1986, Mr. White joined the law \nfirm of Hall, Estill, Hardwick, Gable, Golden & Nelson in Tulsa. His \npractice has focused on litigation in the areas of tort and insurance \ndefense, medical malpractice, corporate litigation, ERISA, and \ntelecommunications. Mr. White is a well respected legal practitioner in \nhis home State and he will make a fine addition to the Federal bench.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with our votes on two more judicial \nnominees today, the Senate will have confirmed 60 judges in the 15 \nmonths that Republicans have controlled the Senate majority. In 17 \nmonths, when the Democrats were in the majority, we confirmed 100 \njudges. So that means between those confirmed under Republican \nleadership--60--and the 100 under Democratic leadership, we now have \nconfirmed 160 in less than 3 years.\n  Incidentally, it approaches the 4-year total of President Reagan's \nfirst term.\n  I have expedited confirmation of another Oklahoma nominee, as I \naccommodated Senator Nickles with four nominees when I was chairman, \nand I am happy to accommodate him now.\n  I hope the leadership will look to the two much needed nominees for \nthe Southern District of California. That is the most overworked \ndistrict in the entire Nation. For some reason, the leadership has not \nbrought them up.\n  I wish they would. They should be considered on an expedited basis.\n  Last night, the Senate unanimously confirmed Judge Carlos Bea of \nCalifornia to a lifetime position on the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit. He is the 29th circuit court nominee of \nPresident George W. Bush to be confirmed. With this number of \nconfirmations, we have reduced the number of vacancies we inherited in \nthe summer of 2001 in 8 of the 13 circuit courts and the number of \nvacancies in the other 5 courts has not increased, despite more than a \ndozen additional vacancies that have arisen since then. In contrast, \nduring the Clinton administration, Republicans allowed the number of \ncircuit court vacancies to more than double, increasing the number of \nvacancies on 9 of the 13 circuit courts.\n  As I mentioned last night, the Senate has confirmed 12 circuit court \nnominees of President Bush in this year alone, which is more circuit \ncourt confirmations than Republicans allowed in 5 of the 6 full years \nthey controlled the Senate during the Clinton administration. Last \nnight, the Senate confirmed the 58th judicial nominee of President Bush \nthis year, which is the same number as Republicans allowed in all of \n1995. With the two confirmations we expect this morning, we will have \nconfirmed more judicial nominees of this President this year than in 5 \nof the 6 years of Republican control of the Senate.\n  At the conclusion of the confirmation votes today, a total of 60 \njudicial nominees of President Bush will be confirmed this year, in \naddition to the 100 confirmations during 17 months of the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate. This number of confirmations, 160, is \nsignificantly higher than Republicans allowed by the third year of \nPresident Clinton's second term, the most recent Presidential term, \nwhen they allowed 135 judicial nominees of that President to be \nappointed from 1997 through the end of 1999. That year, because the \nRepublican chairman insisted that President Clinton nominate Utahan Ted \nStewart to the district court, no nomination hearings were even held \nuntil the summer. In all, during the prior 6 years of Republican \ncontrol of the Senate, 248 of President Clinton's district and circuit \ncourt nominees were confirmed but more than 60 were blocked form \ngetting confirmation votes.\n  Despite this recent history, Democrats have supported the \nconfirmation of 160 of President Bush's judicial nominees. As Senator \nFrist observed on the floor of the Senate last week when six additional \njudicial nominees were confirmed: ``Again, steady progress has been \nmade with respect to these judicial nominations.'' The number of \nconfirmations in the two home States of the nominees being voted on \ntoday supports that observation of the majority leader.\n  We have already confirmed 13 district court judges to the State of \nTexas and today we vote on the 14th judge appointed to the Federal \ntrial courts in Texas, Magistrate Judge Marcia Crone. Despite her 11 \nyears of service in the Southern District of Texas, Magistrate Judge \nCrone earned a partial ``Not qualified'' rating from the American Bar \nAssociation, ABA. In all, 23 of President George W. Bush's judicial \nnominees have received minority or majority ratings of ``Not \nqualified'' from the ABA, which is cause for concern. Sometimes we are \nable to deduce the basis of those ratings, but sometimes we cannot. It \nis too bad that the ABA will not provide us with the facts and factors \nbehind such ratings. Without that information and based on the record \nwe have before us, Magistrate Judge Crone garnered the bipartisan \nsupport of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Magistrate Judge Crone is nominated to 1 of the 15 new seats \nDemocrats created to address increased caseloads around the country, \nand once she is sworn in there will be no vacancies in the district \ncourts in Texas, a situation that Republicans would not allow when a \nDemocrat was in the White House. In fact, had Democrats not created 15 \nnew seats on the Federal courts when we\n\n[[Page S12148]]\n\nwere in the majority last year, there would be fewer than 30 vacancies \nin the Federal courts today. As it stands, with the confirmations \ntoday, there will be 44 vacancies on the Federal bench, the lowest \nlevel reached for this President and indeed the lowest number of \nvacancies since 1990.\n  Similarly, with the confirmation of Ronald White to the district \ncourt in Oklahoma, Democrats will have supported the confirmation of a \njudge to a vacancy that arose last Thursday. Senator Nickles has been \neager to fill this vacancy, which occurred just four business days ago \nand we are accommodating him. When I chaired the committee we similarly \nworked hard to confirm four judicial nominees to vacancies in Oklahoma.\n  I must express concern, however, that the Republican leadership has \nchosen to move Mr. White's nomination to such a short-lived vacancy \nahead of the nominees to the Southern District of California, seats \nthat have been greatly needed for years. During the last period of \nRepublican control of the Senate, they refused to create seats in \nCalifornia to address the growing crisis to that border court. As a \nconsequence, this Federal court in San Diego has the highest caseload \nper judge in the Nation, by a significant margin; senior judges have \nbeen called into continued service handling a large number of cases; \nand one retired judge even passed away in the midst of the stressful \nand pressing caseload of that court. Republican neglect was part of \ntheir efforts to deny a Democratic President and any opportunity to \nfill those much-needed judgeships. I hope that the Republican \nleadership will turn to the southern California nominees it has now \nskipped without more delay.\n  Finally, I note that Mr. White is receiving far more favorable \nbipartisan consideration than the last Ronald White to be nominated to \nthe U.S. District Court. Mr. White of Oklahoma is being confirmed \nwithin 4 months of his nomination, while Missouri Supreme Court Justice \nRonnie White waited 28 months for a confirmation vote. Justice White, \nwho now serves with distinction as the Chief Justice of the Missouri \nSupreme Court, was nominated by President Clinton to the Federal \ndistrict court in June of 1997. The White House consulted at length \nwith the home-state Senators and other officials in Missouri to find a \nconsensus nominee and chose Justice White who was the first African \nAmerican to serve on the highest court in Missouri. Senator Bond \nsupported Justice White's confirmation and then-Senator Ashcroft \nadvised that he would not hold his nomination.\n\n  However, the Republican chairman did not schedule a hearing for this \ndistrict court nominee for almost a year. Then, after Justice White's \nnomination was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, which \noccurred almost a year after his nomination, the Republican leader \nrefused to schedule a vote on the nomination. Justice White's \nnomination languished on the floor from May 1998 until the end of that \nyear. He was renominated by President Clinton in January 1999, and the \nRepublican chairman refused to place his name on the calendar for a \nvote for 6 months. Once his nomination was reported out favorably a \nsecond time the Republican leader again delayed a vote on his \nnomination for about 3 months.\n  Then, in a surprise move following a Republican caucus meeting in \nOctober 1999, Justice White nomination was defeated with every \nRepublican voting in lock-step against his confirmation, without \nwarning and even though some of these Senators had previously voted to \nreport his nomination favorably to the Senate. Senator Ashcroft \nmaligned Justice White as ``pro-criminal,'' even though Justice White's \nrecord in criminal and death penalty cases on the Missouri Supreme \nCourt was better than some of Senator Ashcroft's appointees to that \ncourt when he was governor. When President Bush nominated John Ashcroft \nto be Attorney General the outrageousness of the attack on Justice \nWhite was one of the issues we explored. Senator Specter apologized to \nJustice White for the way he was treated by the Senate.\n  Of course, more than 60 of President Clinton's other judicial \nnominees were never allowed a confirmation vote of any kind. Those 63 \nother nominations were scuttled by Republicans in the dark of night, \nthrough secret or anonymous objections. This was their preferred modus \noperandi. Republicans perfected the art of delay by defeat for \nPresident Clinton's circuit and district court nominees, blocked 63 \nwhile confirming 248 in the 6\\1/2\\ years of Senate control.\n  I think if is time that fair-minded Republicans acknowledge those \nClinton nominees who were blocked from getting votes, nominations that \nconstituted 20 percent of all judicial nominees in those 6 years. That \nrecord stands in stark contrast to ours, with 160 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees confirmed in less than 3 years, with only three \nblocked so far. The Senate's record on President Bush's judicial \nnominations is now 160 to 3. The Republican record on President \nClinton's judicial nominees is 248 to 63. The facts demonstrate how \neffectively Republicans prevented confirmation votes on judicial \nnominees, behind closed doors and in secret. Democrats have voted and \ncontinue to vote on President Bush's judicial nominees in the light of \nday, with full discussion of the serious concerns that surround the \nextreme nominees of this President.\n\n  With a Republican making nominations, the Senate votes today to \nconfirm Mr. White of Oklahoma to a seat that has been vacant for less \nthan a week. With the delay and attack on President Clinton's nominee \nJustice White, Republicans were content to allow the Missouri District \nCourt to remain vacant for 5\\1/2\\ years, like many other judicial \nvacancies that arose when a Democrat was in the White House and \nRepublicans last controlled the confirmation process.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, obviously one of the issues before us and \nthe issue we will be grappling with for the remainder of the week--\nperhaps longer--is the question of supporting our troops in Iraq and \ncontinuing to deal with the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nCertainly everyone agrees that these things have to be done. There are \ndifferent views as to how they should be done. All of us have to review \nin our minds where we are, what the basic issues are that have us \nthere, and certainly what is necessary to succeed in our efforts in the \nMiddle East, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We have before us a request for $87 billion for the war on terror. \nThat will be dealt with this week, the division there between what is \nrequired for the military aspect and then what is required to complete \nour job in terms of leaving Iraq and Afghanistan in the condition in \nwhich democracy and freedom and a lack of terrorism will be where we \nare in the future.\n  It is good to go back and review some ideas. I would like to talk \nabout where we have been, where we need to go to complete the task we \nundertook, and talk a little about what we are seeking to do in terms \nof leaving Iraq in a position to govern itself and to support freedom \nand peace, and about the fact that we hear all the time that there was \nno plan after combat was over. That is not true. There is a plan. The \nplan is in process. We certainly will continue to carry out that plan. \nWe need resources to do that.\n  All of us are concerned about spending. All of us are concerned about \nthe deficit. We find ourselves in a deficit situation for reasons that \nare fairly apparent. It started, of course, with September 11, which \nwas something we had no control over, which increased special spending \nwe would not otherwise have had. Then we were faced with an economic \nturndown which caused additional impacts on our deficit and the \neconomy. Then, of course, we continued to have more terrorism and our \ntroops in Iraq.\n  I guess probably no one in this body is more conservative than I am \nin terms of spending, in terms of government's role and what we ought \nto be doing, but I do recognize that when you have special things, \nwhether it is your business or your family or your government, then \nspending is done in a different way. That is where we are.\n  The stakes are high in Iraq, certainly. It is the center front now \nfor the war on terrorism. Critical work remains to be done in \nAfghanistan as well. Terrorists and regime remnants are making a \ndesperate attempt to maintain themselves and continue in these \ncountries. The U.S. and its allies are confronting them where they live \nand where they seek refuge, rather than leaving the terrorists in the \nsafe havens where they would like to gather strength and resources and \ncome back as they did before.\n  Our troops--no one would disagree, I am sure--have to have the \nnecessary resources for the war on terror, and the spending requests \nwill give our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan the equipment they need to \nincrease their safety and security, which happens to be the most \nimportant thing for us. This includes funding to replace equipment used \nthat was destroyed during combat operations, to protect our forces, \nbetter housing for our troops deployed overseas, and enhanced pay, \nreflected in the dangers that we face.\n  Of course, we have been through these things before. Stabilizing Iraq \nand Afghanistan will increase our security at home and certainly help \nwin the war.\n  As we understand, the war was not just combat but to change things in \nthat part of the world. The costs of fighting terrorists are \nsignificant, but they still are a relatively small percentage of the \noverall economy compared to that of previous conflicts. According to an \nanalysis done by USA Today, the cost of fighting the war is 5 percent \nof the GDP compared to 30 percent for World War II and 15 percent for \nthe Korean war. The $87 billion request is less than 4 percent of our \nentire Federal budget next year. Yet it is a critical part of this \nstabilization area we are in.\n  Initial estimates of Iraq's total need range from $50 billion to $75 \nbillion. The administration believes $20 billion represents our \nreasonable share as to what we ought to be doing to put the country \nback in reasonable shape, and we expect the rest of the costs, of \ncourse, to be filled by the international community, or by Iraq's own \nreserves, which are potentially very large.\n  So these funds will be carefully targeted to the immediate security \nneeds, as well as the share of the critical infrastructure that has to \nbe replaced in order to get the kinds of support there that we are \nlooking for.\n  Iraq oil reserves are estimated at approximately $12 billion in 2004 \nand $19 billion for each of 2005 and 2006. So unlike many of the \ncountries in that part of the world, there are sizable resources that \nwe hope will be part of this rebuilding exercise, and indeed should be.\n  President Bush has held the line on nondefense spending growth. In \n2001, the last budget before President Bush took office, nondefense \nspending grew nearly 15 percent. He cut that growth to 6 percent in \n2000, less than 5 percent in 2003, and 2 percent in 2004. Obviously, \nthere is always controversy and different views and things that we \nwould like to do in our home States and in our country. But, of course, \nobviously, they have to be balanced with our ability to pay and our \nwillingness to tax.\n  Today's deficits are larger than anybody wants. No one wants \ndeficits, but they are certainly still less than 5 percent of the GDP \nand are manageable if we put them into a steady downward path by strong \neconomic growth and spending restraints. These are the issues with \nwhich we have to deal.\n  Certainly, the war on terrorism has to be funded. Freeing Iraq is the \nkey to winning the terrorism war and vital to America. President Bush \nhas asked for $87 billion in emergency funding--a large amount, of \ncourse. The majority--$65 billion--will go to directly support troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, give them more resources that they need. \nAgain, no one would argue against giving our troops what is necessary \nfor them to go forward. And $21 billion would go to create a secure \nenvironment. It is high, but as I mentioned, things have changed and we \nneed to do the job right and continue to work at doing it.\n\n  From time to time we hear that there really wasn't a plan or there is \nnot a plan. There is a plan and we are following it. One of the issues, \nof course, is time. I don't know how you could plan that anybody would \nhave a definite timeframe in terms of a plan for a place such as Iraq. \nBut I think Secretary Rumsfeld covered it well when he commented some \ntime back, a few days ago. These are some of his comments that I think \nare correct. He said the coalition has certainly, in less than 5 \nmonths, racked up a series of achievements in both countries and civil \nreconstruction that may be without precedent. Today in Iraq virtually \nall major hospitals and universities have been reopened; hundreds of \nsecondary schools--until a few months ago many were used for weapons \nstorage--have been rebuilt and are ready for the start of the fall \nsemester. This is part of the plan to put these entities, of course, \nback into place.\n  Fifty-six thousand Iraqis have been armed and trained in just a few \nmonths. They are contributing to the security and defense of the \ncountry. Today a new Iraqi army is being trained, and 40,000 Iraq \npolice will join with that army to conduct joint controls with the \ncoalition. Contrast that to the 14 months it took to establish a police \nforce in postwar Germany and\n\n[[Page S12150]]\n\nthe 10 years it took to begin training a new German army.\n\n  Again, this is part of the plan to add stability and provide the \nopportunity for Iraqis to be able to control their own country and \ntheir own people and move forward. As security improves, so does \ncommerce. Five thousand small businesses have opened since the \nliberation on May 1. An independent Iraqi central bank was established \nand new currency was announced in just 2 months. These are \naccomplishments which took years before in Germany. The Iraq governing \ncouncil has been formed and they appointed a cabinet of ministers--\nagain, something that took years to do in other times.\n  So this is the plan and the movement to get government back into \nplace there, to have security for themselves, to have people trained to \ndo what has to be done in a country that is independent and standing \nalone. In major cities and most of the towns, villages, and \nmunicipalities, councils have been formed to make the decisions on \nlocal matters. That is something that it took a great deal of time to \ndo before, and you would imagine that it would.\n  But all this has taken place in just 5 months. Again, I don't think \nanybody can specifically say we are going to be done by the 14th of \nMarch in 2005, or whatever, but we are moving very quickly. There is a \nplan as to what needs to be in place. The Iraqi people are providing \nintelligence now for our forces every day. Division commanders \nconsistently report an increased numbers of Iraqis coming forward with \nintelligence that makes it more likely that we can find the terrorists \nand get them out of positions, and so on. So there has been a great \ndeal of advancement.\n  There has been great talk about the need for more troops. Those in \nthe military have declared that is not necessary. If we are going to \nhave more, they need to come from other countries that are involved. \nThe commander of the Marine division in the south area decided to send \nhome 15,000 troops and explained if there is a point when he needs \nthem, he can get them. So there hasn't been the shortage that is felt \nby the military.\n  Again, we are moving forward and making some progress in that area. \nThat is what it is all about--to continue to reach the visions that we \nhave for Iraq and against terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. We \nare beginning a very important week. We are going to be talking about \nwhat is happening in Iraq and the President's request for $87 billion \nand added funding.\n  A lot of people are saying: Wow, $87 billion. But it is important for \nus to look at what that $87 billion is going to do.\n  First of all, $66 billion is for our troops. That is for our troop \nprotection, equipment, making sure they have everything they need to do \nthe job we are asking them to do over the next year. I don't think \nthere is anyone in this Congress who would deny the President a dime of \nthe money that is going to our troops to make sure they have everything \nthey need to do one of the toughest jobs I have ever seen.\n  I was in Iraq and I was in Afghanistan in August. In Iraq and \nAfghanistan, our troops are in harm's way every day--every moment, \nreally. I just woke up this morning to the news that two of our \nwonderful military personnel have been assassinated in Afghanistan. It \nis a very tough place. We are having to deal with a Taliban that has \nrejuvenated its efforts, and they are now into drug dealing. They are \npreying on the police in Afghanistan. If somebody doesn't deal with \nthem, they are murdering them, assassinating them because they want the \ndrug trade.\n  Why do they want the drug trade? They want the drug trade because \nthat is how they are going to finance the terrorist operations around \nthe world. That is why they are trying to raise money in this illicit \nway. What could be more important to the security of our people than to \nstop the drug trafficking in Afghanistan and stop the resurrection of \nthe Taliban?\n  In Iraq, we see on a daily and weekly basis the harm our young men \nand women are in. We need to make sure they have the capability to do \nthe job we are asking them to do. That is what the President is asking \nfor, and that is what we will give him.\n  The other $20 billion is what most people are talking about. How much \nshould we be giving to rebuild Iraq and how should it be done? Those \nare the questions we are going to hear on the floor. The Appropriations \nCommittee right now is marking up the bill that will come to the floor, \nhopefully tomorrow.\n  This is a legitimate area of disagreement. Most certainly people can \nreasonably ask the question: Why are we putting $20 billion into Iraq? \nThere are things we need in America.\n  The first responsibility of the Congress of the United States and the \nPresident is to provide for the security of our people, to provide for \na national defense. This is national defense. If we can stabilize Iraq \nand stop Iraq from being a breeding ground for terrorism, that is a \nUnited States security interest. That is why putting the money into the \nrebuilding of Iraq so that the people will be able to start having an \neconomy, and if they have electricity, water, and basic living \nconditions, we also will begin to see the startup of business. We hope \nthe oilfield infrastructure will be repaired or rebuilt. It is in much \nworse shape than we ever thought it would be. We want to rebuild the \noil infrastructure so when the Iraqis get the oil out of the ground, it \nwill give jobs to the Iraqi people. They will be able to use it and \nexport it, but it also means other businesses will crop up to service \nthose oil wells and the delivery of that oil.\n\n  We are talking about the beginning of an economy for Iraq. If we \ndon't put $20 billion into the rebuilding of Iraq, what will those \npeople have to do? How can they start their economy from scratch? How \ncan they start the creation of jobs if the oil pipelines are being held \ntogether with rags and cannot deliver the oil?\n  It is a package of $87 billion that will be for the security and \nsupport of our troops, and for the rebuilding of Iraq which, in turn, \nwill allow our troops to leave earlier but with the knowledge that the \npeople of Iraq will have stability, that Iraq will not be a breeding \nground for terrorism, and that they will have a justice system and a \nsecurity system in place with their own policemen and their own army to \nprotect their borders from the terrorists who are infiltrating their \nborders from Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.\n  This is a very important bill, it is a very important request from \nthe President, and it is important that we give to the President what \nhe needs to do the job Congress has given him the authority to do. \nCongress gave the President the right to declare war on terrorism. \nCongress declared the war. The President is implementing that war, and \nwe are going to have to give him the support he asks us to give. It \nwould be unthinkable to walk away with the job not yet completed.\n  I am very pleased to be supportive of the President and this effort, \neven though it is a difficult situation and a lot of questions have \nbeen raised.\n  Mr. President, we have had a good beginning. We have had the \nbeginning of 6,000 individual reconstruction projects. Schools, \nuniversities, and hospitals have been opened. They are not up to the \nstandards we hope they will be, but it was important for the Iraqi \nchildren to start school; it was important they have health care \nservices. We have gone in to augment the opening of those facilities.\n  Iraq is also in the process of transitioning to a governing council. \nWe hope they will be able to form their own government, create their \nown constitution, have representatives of their people for whom they \ncan vote. That is what we hope to leave them.\n  We have made a very strong beginning. If we look at where we started, \nwhich was absolutely a deteriorating infrastructure, we are making \nprogress. What we hear about in the news is very disconcerting. We hear \nabout a terrorist putting a landmine in a road and it blows up one of \nour people or one of their people. We hear of terrorists tearing down \nthe electricity grids and cutting the water supply. This shows, if \nnothing else does, that this is the terrorists' last stand. They do not \nwant the United States to succeed. They do not want the Iraqi people to \nhave a stable lifestyle. They want there to be foment and unrest. They\n\n[[Page S12151]]\n\nwant people who are desperate for change. We are not going to let them \nwin. That is why this bill is so important.\n  I am pleased to talk about the important accomplishments and the \nimportance of what we are doing in Iraq. The President and Congress \nmust come together and do what is right for the security of the \nAmerican people, and doing what is right means we will give the \nPresident the money which he has asked for the rebuilding of Iraq and \nfor the protection and support of our troops in the field.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. She \ncertainly expresses the view of at least all of us on this side of the \naisle in terms of the challenge we have before us and our willingness \nto take on that challenge and to complete this task we have begun in \nthe protection of our country.\n  There are probably a number of questions that are frequently asked \nwith regard to this issue. They should be discussed, and indeed they \nhave been discussed. So, frankly, I hope we do not string this issue \nout any longer than it needs to be. We should have a reasonable debate \nand get on with what we need to do. I am very hopeful, as well, that \nthe idea of some of the discussion is not designed to be political. \nUnfortunately, many issues do that. These are genuine issues. They are \nnot political issues.\n  Some of the questions that are asked: Why can we not provide the \nresources for the troops and let the Iraqis do their own thing with \ntheir infrastructure? I think one of the differences we have, that we \nmight not have with some other place, is Iraq has suffered from decades \nof corruption and mismanagement from Saddam, where he built dozens of \nlavish palaces for himself and his family and funded destruction \nprograms. He involved himself in war in Kuwait, and he failed to invest \nin the country's critical infrastructure. As a result, more than $100 \nbillion in debt is unable to be tapped for their own resources. The \nstability of Iraq and Afghanistan is what is important so that they are \nno longer the breeding grounds for terrorism.\n  So it is important that we are helpful in restructuring the things \nthat have not been done for many years prior to our involvement there.\n  Some ask: Why is rebuilding Iraq costing more than the administration \nsaid it would? Has the administration been honest about their analysis \nof the costs?\n  Again, that is a legitimate question. Under Saddam, Iraq was one of \nthe most tightly controlled and secretive societies in the world. Until \nthe country was liberated, it was hard to know exactly how much \ninternal damage or neglect had been suffered in everything from the \nelectrical grid to water and sewage. In addition, rebuilding efforts \nhave been hampered, of course, by the remnants of the regime and \nforeign terror groups that are there. It has been very difficult, in \nthe long term, to understand what these costs would be.\n  What are other countries realistically going to contribute to the \nreconstruction effort, and what are the expectations for the Madrid \ndonor conference? It seems as if there is now more support for doing \nsomething in terms of restructuring than we had in the combat stage. We \nexpect that many members of the community will participate, as well as \nsome international financial institutions and organizations, such as \nthe United Nations. Quite frankly, when we start doing this I believe \nwe will see some of the European economic interests there. Some of them \nwere there before in a business sense, and they will return again. We \nhave had discussions with these donors individually, and they are \nplanned for the conference. We also need to review the assessments \nbeing done by the U.N.\n  What is our exit strategy? Again, that is a very difficult issue, \nparticularly on timing. We know what we want to accomplish, but it is \nnot always easy to know how long it will take to achieve those kinds of \nthings.\n\n  After 9/11, the President told the American people that he would \nconfront the threats to our Nation before they reached our shores. Our \ntroops are performing a vital task right now, and that is what they are \ndoing. They are liberators, not occupiers. We bring freedom to those \noppressed people and help the Iraqi people. It is interesting that all \nwe hear about are the difficult times--and there are difficult times, \nand I understand that. The media, or whoever it is, speaks of those \ndifficult and tragic things at the top of the news. The improvements \nthat are being made and the support that is there is not always as well \nunderstood as are the difficulties.\n  So I think we are making good progress. As we have pointed out, in \njust 5 months many things have happened that need to be done. The more \nthat happens, the more support we will have from the Iraqi people, and \nwe can begin to move rather soon.\n  We have enough forces in the region. That is always a question that \nis being asked. I mentioned it before, but in the professional judgment \nof the military commanders, who are the ones who really know, the \n130,000 troops recently in Iraq can carry out the mission. Some of the \nmarines have been sent back to the United States, knowing that if they \nare needed, of course, they could go there.\n  One of the last figures I heard was about 25,000 troops from other \ncountries are there, and that is a good thing. Of course, we are \ndealing with an action at the United Nations, so there will be more \ninput from the United Nations into what we are doing, and I think that \nis good.\n  So these are some of the questions that are asked, and I think they \nare indeed legitimate questions.\n  No one wishes we were there. We all wish the whole terrorism thing \nhad not happened, but it has, and the Senator from Texas mentioned why \nwe do not want it to happen in our country. We need to deal with \nterrorism where it exists and not to let it happen here. I am hopeful \nthat this is an issue we can deal with, and deal with it in a timely \nway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12151-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12151-S12152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE UNFINISHED AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. We have a lot of work to do. We have six or seven \nappropriations bills that we have passed. We have 13 total to do. This \nis the last day of the fiscal year. We will have to pass a continuing \nresolution to go on into October, but we certainly need to continue to \nwork on that and get that completed as soon as we can. It is very \nimportant we do that.\n  There are several other bills, of course, that are pending that all \nof us feel strongly about. The Medicare bill is pending and we need to \ndo something with pharmaceuticals. There is a great difference of \nopinion as to how we do that. The bottom line is that everybody knows \nwe need to do something for Medicare, particularly pharmaceuticals, to \nmake them available at a reasonable cost to as many people as we \npossibly can. So those issues are pending.\n  I have a particular interest in energy because of my committees and \nbecause of where I live. Wyoming is an energy-production State. We look \nforward to being able to do more of that. We are in the process of an \nenergy policy and had planned to get that completed this week. The \nHouse and the Senate have both passed energy bills. Most everyone knows \nwe need an energy policy. We have not passed one for a good many years, \nand things have changed substantially. So we really need to deal with \nit.\n  One of the issues I believe is important, that we are talking about, \nis an energy policy. We are not talking about every detail. We are not \ntalking about everything tomorrow. We are talking about an energy \npolicy that will give us some guidance into where we are 10, 15, 20 \nyears from now. Obviously, things are going to change and indeed have \nchanged. We have seen a number of the problems: the blackouts, the cost \nof gasoline, the shortage of natural gas, the things that happened in \nCalifornia. Those are part of what we are talking about, but we are \nalso talking about the future. In this bill, we have things that have \nto do with renewable energy, finding ways to use wind energy, finding \nways to use ethanol to extend the use of gas. We are talking about \nrenewables. We are talking about doing some things with hydro and \nmaking that more accessible to much of the country.\n  Obviously, one of the questions we have is how to move energy around \nthe country. It has to do with the blackouts and has to do with \nCalifornia. We\n\n[[Page S12152]]\n\nare talking about, how transmission can be operated, how to get new \ntransmission incentives to invest in transmission costs. We find \nourselves in a position of using more electricity, for example, but not \nreally keeping up production to meet our demands. In some parts of the \ncountry--for instance, Wyoming--where we have lots of coal, we could \ngenerate a great deal of electricity, but then there has to be a way to \nmove it to the market. Those have been very difficult things.\n  We have to have research. I mentioned coal. We ought to have more \nresearch so we can ensure that coal is clean and we can have clean air \nas we generate that fossil resource that is the most abundant resource \nwe have in fossil fuel. We need then, of course, in the shorter term, \nto continue to encourage production. We find ourselves almost 60 \npercent dependent on foreign oil. We have a good deal of oil in our \ncountry and we need to find ways to extract more of that, keeping in \nmind at the same time the protection of the environment.\n\n  We can do that. There is ample evidence we can do that. So we have to \ndeal with things such as incentives for unusual kinds of oil and gas \nthat are more expensive to discover and to produce. We have to look at \nwhat we can do with the potential resources in Alaska, for example, \nwhether it be having gas available from there, build a pipeline down so \nit is there, or whether we talk about ANWR. These are places where \nthere are substantial sources of energy but they are not really \navailable to us. These are some of the things we need to talk about.\n  We had a bill last year in both Houses. We had a committee working on \nit last year. We were not able to produce a policy. This year, the same \nthing is happening. We passed something in the Senate; there was \nsomething else passed in the House. We need to put together the \ndifferences, and there are differences, quite a few in terms of the \namount of ethanol we use and the subsidies that are there for ethanol.\n  We have been talking about what to do about electricity and how much \nauthority they have in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That \nis controversial--how we can develop techniques, given regional \ndifferences in energy, without having the Federal Government in charge \nof everything we do. These are called regional transmission \norganizations, where the States can make the decisions within that for \ninterstate movement. Then when you move between the RTOs, there has to \nbe some Federal involvement.\n  These are some problems that are not insurmountable. We can get them \ndone. Of course, not everyone is going to agree on every detail, but \nthat is not uncommon in the Senate. We have to give away some things. \nSome things are different in Alabama or Oregon, and we need to \nreconcile those differences and put together a national energy policy.\n  That is our challenge. I mention that to emphasize that hopefully we \nwill not be here forever. We will be able to adjourn this session, \nhopefully in November sometime--early November, if we are lucky, or \nlater. We have a lot to do prior to that time, but we can do it if we \nwill bring it to the floor, if we have our legitimate concerns voiced \nin legitimate debates, but not just hold up legislation for various \npolitical reasons. I think that makes us look inefficient and unaware \nof what we have to do, and we have a great deal to do.\n  I believe our time has expired.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \npending administration request for $87 billion, including some $20 \nbillion for the rebuilding of Iraq. At the present time, the \nAppropriations Committee is considering this request and soon the \nmatter will be on the floor. I urge my colleagues to give consideration \nto the proposition that the $20 billion to be advanced to rebuild Iraq \nought to be in the form of either a loan or a loan guarantee. I \nunderstand this is contrary to the administration's position at the \npresent time, but there may be some receptivity in the administration \nor, in any event, it is my thought that the Congress ought to consider \nthis as an alternative in the spirit of trying to be helpful to the \nadministration in working through the very difficult issues we are \nfacing at the present time.\n  There is no doubt that the appropriation for the military is a matter \nof necessity as it has been outlined by the President. There is a \nstrong universal commitment in the Congress to backing our troops. We \ncompliment them on the extraordinary job they have done in the military \nvictory in Iraq, and we compliment them further on their ongoing \nefforts to try to restore law and order, try to establish a peace to \nmaintain. It is a highly regrettable situation that our military find \nthemselves in a position of being police, responsibilities for which \nthey are not trained and responsibilities which ought to be undertaken \nby others.\n  It is my hope that there will be assistance from countries such as \nTurkey and Pakistan, Muslim countries, to give more confidence to the \nArab world, or that we will work through an arrangement with the United \nNations so that there will be some sharing of the burden of rebuilding \nIraq, so that when it comes to the funding for the military, there is \nuniversal agreement and certainly my support for that appropriation.\n  The issue as to rebuilding Iraq, I submit, stands on somewhat \ndifferent terms. As I think through the issue of funding the rebuilding \nof Iraq, I think about the analogy of a bankruptcy proceeding. There is \nno doubt that Iraq as a country is bankrupt. They have latent assets, \nsitting on the second largest oil pool in the world, but they do not \nhave a government in existence. They cannot function. They are \nbankrupt.\n\n  When the argument is made that we should not further burden Iraq \nbeyond the $200 billion in debts which they have at the present time, \nthe analogy to bankruptcy would say that those debts are owed to \ncreditors that are general creditors, unsecured. When there is a \nbankruptcy, there are no funds to pay those creditors. They come last \nin line. If there are no funds, they simply get no funds.\n  On that subject, while not dispositive and not critical, I think it \nought to be noted that some of these debts were incurred in a context \nwhere the lending parties knew they were supporting a totalitarian and \ndictatorial regime which had used chemical warfare on their own people, \nthe Kurds, had used chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, a regime \nwhich was brutalizing the Iraqi people.\n  In a very realistic sense, people who were loaning money to Saddam \nHussein in a context knowing that is where the funds were going were \naccessories before the fact to some very heinous conduct. In a very \nfundamental way, as a matter of public policy, they are not entitled to \nbe reimbursed for funds advanced in that context.\n  Some of those moneys are owed by way of reparations to Kuwait and \nothers. They stand on a somewhat different footing. But all of those \nfunds are in a category, if it were a bankruptcy proceeding, of \ncreditors that would take no assets when there are no assets to be \ntaken. There is a further argument advanced that if the United States \nmakes loans, then there would be no motivation or no leverage for the \nUnited States to get other donor nations to make contributions.\n  In a meeting, as I understand it, scheduled in Madrid for October 23, \nthe United States will be pressing other nations to make contributions. \nIf we are to have a chance to get contributions from other nations, it \nseems to me that we ought not to make a blanket grant at the present \ntime of $20 billion but ought to condition any such grant on getting \ncooperation and getting support from other countries. If the United \nStates is to put up the $20\n\n[[Page S12153]]\n\nbillion on our own without any commitments from other countries, there \nis the inevitable sense that the other countries say: Well, the United \nStates is doing it. They are putting up $20 billion. Let them put up \nthat money and whatever else is required.\n  So the argument that if we condition the loans on collateral security \nor if we condition the money on a loan situation and look for \ncollateral security that we will discourage other donors is essentially \nfallacious.\n  The argument is also advanced that if we make loans, we will be \nreinforcing the view of the Arab world that the only reason we went to \nIraq was for the Iraqi oil. We are not utilizing the Iraqi oil for U.S. \npurposes. We are not asking that the Iraqi oil be used to pay our \nmilitary expenses. We are asking only that the Iraqi oil be used to \nrebuild Iraq--that is, to rebuild Iraq for the Iraqi people. So that it \njust is not plausible that we could be legitimately charged.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate my colleague's courtesy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will make my points and conclude within \n10 minutes. I was on the point that some may charge the United States \nis there looking for the benefits from Iraqi oil. So long as we use the \nproceeds for the benefit of the Iraqi people, I don't think anybody can \nrealistically make that argument.\n  One factor is difficult, and that is, with whom would we contract to \nmake the loan? I must confess that gives me some pause. When a trustee \ntakes over, a trustee is appointed by the court. If a trustee takes \nover a company that has been mismanaged, or where the directors or \nofficers have committed fraud, the trustee has carte blanche to run the \ncompany--in this case, run the country. I believe it would be possible \nfor the United States to undertake what we are doing here, under the \nwatchful eye of others, because others will be watching--we can count \non the French for that, if for little else, and we can count on the \nGermans for that, if for little else. Under the watchful eye of others, \nwe can discharge the fiduciary duty as trustees, and we are good for \nour word, and we are honorable, and we are there to help the Iraqi \npeople.\n  While some may doubt that, we can prove it, so that what we do would \nbe used for the benefit of the Iraqi people. There are other ways we \nmight find somebody to contract with. It is my hope the efforts now by \nSecretary of State Colin Powell to bring in a U.N. resolution will be \nsuccessful. We have learned from our experience that it is regrettable \nwe could not get the U.N. Security Council to support our military \naction.\n  Going back to October 11 of last year, this Senator supported an \namendment that would have gone back to the U.N. to try to get more \nmultilateral action. It is true we led a number of nations--``the \ncoalition of the willing''--but it was essentially the U.S. and Great \nBritain. While it was not quite unilateral, it didn't have the level of \nmultilateral activity which would have been desirable. It is \nnonnegotiable that our troops would not be under any command other than \nthe United States. But when it comes to the reorganization of Iraq and \nto what is going to happen in Iraq with respect to how contracts are \ngoing to be disbursed and the administration of Iraq, it is my hope the \nUnited States can show sufficient flexibility to get other nations to \nparticipate. If the United Nations is in, there might be the structure \nof someone with whom to contract to have these loans instead of grants. \nI am exploring the issue as to whether the International Monetary Fund \nor the World Bank might be able to come into the picture at least to \nhave a quasi-trustee status, someone who could oversee the matter, \nperhaps even contract on behalf of Iraq. These are matters to be \nexplored.\n  I am advised that the International Monetary Fund is precluded from \ncoming in in the absence of a sovereign, but that if the U.N. passes a \nresolution, there might be a sufficient basis for the International \nMonetary Fund to come in. In any event, these are complexities. There \nare no easy answers.\n  It is my hope the Senate and the House will give consideration to \ntrying to structure something that would be on the basis of a loan, or \nperhaps a loan guarantee. We have the precedent with Israel. We are not \nmaking grants, we are making loan guarantees. Why should we do more for \nIraq than we are doing for Israel with the loan guarantees?\n\n  I know that time is a consideration and there is an effort to pass \nthis appropriations bill this week. That may or may not happen. At a \nmeeting of the chairmen yesterday, there was doubt expressed as to \nwhether it could be accomplished this week. We do know we have passed \nthe Defense appropriations bill so that the Department of Defense has \nsome $368 billion to operate. The aspect of this bill on funding the \nDepartment of Defense may not require immediate action, although I \nwould not delay it. I am prepared to move ahead this week and decide \nall of the issues if we can resolve it this week.\n  I think there is time to give consideration to a structure of the \nloan or a loan guarantee. I have consulted with a professor of \nbankruptcy to refresh my own recollection and my own knowledge on the \nsubject and have been told the concept, the analogy to a bankruptcy, is \nsolid; that there is another concept of ``creditor in possession,'' \nwhich would provide an analog in bankruptcy law for us to operate. And \nas we take a look and search through the possibilities of finding \nsomeone to act on behalf of the Iraqi government, I am not suggesting \nthe council that has been created has sufficient authority to contract; \nbut perhaps if we obtain a resolution from the United Nations, we might \nwork in the International Monetary Fund, or the World Bank, or we may \nbe able to structure some circumstance so the loan could be \neffectuated, or a loan guarantee could be effectuated.\n  My soundings in my State, and what I hear from colleagues around the \ncountry, is the American people have grave questions about our policy \nin Iraq at the present time, questions about our military being in \nharm's way, questions about the casualties and fatalities that are \noccurring, questions about the United States advancing $20 billion to \nIraq at a time when we have a very tight Federal budget.\n  There is talk about the $20 billion, some suggesting for additional \ndomestic programs to offset $20 billion. I do not think now is the \ntime, given the kind of national debt and deficit we are looking at, to \nbe adding more money to domestic spending. Within the past month, I \ndefended on the floor the $137 billion bill on Labor, Health, Human \nServices and Education and voted against many amendments I would like \nto have supported on increased education funding, health funding, or \nworker safety funding. But managing that bill, I opposed those \namendments to stay within the budget resolution.\n  When we talk about a grant to Iraq for $20 billion, there are \ninevitable questions on how much of that money will go for schools in \nIraq, contrasted with how much money is going to be going for school \nconstruction in the United States. So I think it would be an act of \ngenerosity to make loans, an act of generosity to make loan guarantees. \nI understand there is considerable support in this body to make an \noutright grant, but as we consider this issue for the balance of the \nday and the balance of the week, I ask my colleagues to give \nconsideration to the possibility of making a loan or making a loan \nguarantee.\n  As a matter of interest, how much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds remaining.\n\n[[Page S12154]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield back that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT OF A \n                   SPECIAL COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A FAIR, THOROUGH, \n                   AND INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO A NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY BREACH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the national security of the United States is dependent \n     on our intelligence operatives being able to operate \n     undercover and without fear of having their identities \n     disclosed by the United States Government;\n       (2) recent reports have indicated that administration or \n     White House officials may have deliberately leaked the \n     identity of a covert CIA agent to the media;\n       (3) the unauthorized disclosure of a covert CIA agent's \n     identity is a Federal felony; and\n       (4) the Attorney General has the power to appoint a special \n     counsel of integrity and stature who may conduct an \n     investigation into the leak without the appearance of any \n     conflict of interest.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Attorney General of the United States should appoint a \n     special counsel of the highest integrity and statute to \n     conduct a fair, independent, and thorough investigation of \n     the leak and ensure that all individuals found to be \n     responsible for this heinous deed are punished to the fullest \n     extent permitted by law.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now I am told the bill has been delayed \nbecause this amendment was going to be offered. I am going to talk \nabout the amendment and have a dialog with my colleague from \nCalifornia.\n  On July 23, I believe it was, when I read the Novak column that named \nhigh administration sources as revealing the wife of Ambassador Wilson, \nMs. Plame, as an agent--I hasten to add, I don't know if she is a \ncovert agent. That is classified. But that is what was in the paper--I \nwas outraged. I didn't know who had leaked the information. No idea. I \nam not an expert on the internecine rivalries among the various \nagencies, but the fact it was done just boiled my blood. So I wrote the \nFBI and asked Mr. Mueller to undertake an investigation of this act. \nThe act, make no mistake about it, is a very serious act. In fact, it \nis a crime, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n  Why is it a crime? Why have this body and the other body made this a \ncrime? For obvious reasons. Our covert agents put their lives at risk \nfor us every day. They are soldiers just like our brave young men and \nwomen in Iraq and around the globe. And in the post-9/11 world, the \nworld of terrorism, they are among our most important soldiers because \nwe have learned intelligence is key. When the name of an agent is \nrevealed, it is like putting a gun to that agent's head. You are \njeopardizing their life; in many cases, you are jeopardizing the lives \nof the contacts they have built up over the decades, and you are \njeopardizing the security of America. So the seriousness of this crime \nis obvious.\n  When, in addition, we learned that it was done in all likelihood for \na frivolous, nasty reason--namely, that somebody was angry at \nAmbassador Wilson for speaking the truth, at least as he saw it--I \ntended to agree with him. I don't think anybody disputes it. In fact, \nthe administration has admitted, the yellow cake sale from Niger to \nIraq and the documents were, in fact, forged and the President was \nincorrect to use them in his State of the Union Address. This was a way \nof getting back at him through his wife or perhaps to cower him to make \nsure he didn't speak any further. Nasty. Not just nasty, it was like \nkneecapping.\n  In fact, John Dean, who has been through this, just wrote an article \nin something called TruthOut Editorial. The title is ``The Bush \nAdministration''--that is assuming it was done by the administration, \nbut that is what all the reports are--``Adopts a Worse-than-Nixonian \nTactic: The Deadly Serious Crime of Naming CIA Operatives.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Dean's article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From TruthOut, Aug. 15, 2003]\n\nThe Bush Administration Adopts a Worse-Than-Nixonian Tactic: The Deadly \n                 Serious Crime of Naming CIA Operatives\n\n                           (By John W. Dean)\n\n       On July 14, in his syndicated column, Chicago Sun-Times \n     journalist Robert Novak reported that Valerie Plame Wilson--\n     the wife of former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, and mother \n     of three-year-old twins--was a covert CIA agent. (She had \n     been known to her friends as an ``energy analyst at a private \n     firm.'')\n       Why was Novak able to learn this highly secret information? \n     It turns our that he didn't have to dig for it. Rather, he \n     has said, the ``two senior Administration officials'' he had \n     cited as sources sought him out, eager to let him know. And \n     in journalism, that phrase is a term of art reserved for a \n     vice president, cabinet officers, and top White House \n     officials.\n       On July 17, Time magazine published the same story, \n     attributing it to ``government officials.'' And on July 22, \n     Newsday's Washington Bureau confirmed ``that Valerie Plame . \n     . . works at the agency [CIA] on weapons of mass destruction \n     issues in an undercover capacity.'' More specifically, \n     according to a ``senior intelligence official,'' Newsday \n     reported, she worked in the ``Directorate of Operations [as \n     an] undercover officer.''\n       In other words, Wilson is/was a spy involved in the \n     clandestine collection of foreign intelligence, covert \n     operations and espionage. She is/was part of a elite corps, \n     the best and brightest, and among those willing to take great \n     risk for their country. Now she has herself been placed at \n     great--and needless--risk.\n       Why is the Administration so avidly leaking this \n     information? The answer is clear. Former ambassador Wilson is \n     famous, lately, for telling the truth about the Bush \n     Administration's bogus claim that Niger uranium had gone to \n     Saddam Hussein. And the Bush Administration is punishing \n     Wilson by targeting his wife. It is also sending a message to \n     others who might dare to defy it, and reveal the truth.\n       No doubt the CIA, and Mrs. Wilson, have many years, and \n     much effort, invested in her career and skills. Her future, \n     if not her safety, are now in jeopardy.\n       After reading Novak's column, The Nation's Washington \n     Editor, David Corn, asked, ``Did senior Bush officials blow \n     the cover of a U.S. intelligence officer working covertly in \n     a field of vital importance to national security--and break \n     the law--in order to strike at a Bush administration critic \n     and intimidate others?''\n       The answer is plainly yes. Now the question is, will they \n     get away with it?\n       Bits and pieces of information have emerged, but the story \n     is far from complete. Nonetheless, what has surfaced is \n     repulsive. If I thought I had seen dirty political tricks as \n     nasty and vile as they could get at the Nixon White House, I \n     was wrong. The American Prospect's observation that ``we are \n     very much into Nixon territory here'' with this story is an \n     understatement.\n       Indeed, this is arguably worse. Nixon never set up a hit on \n     one of his enemies' wives.\n\n\n               leaking the name of a cia agent is a crime\n\n       On July 22, Ambassador Wilson appeared on the Today show. \n     Katie Couric asked him about his wife: ``How damaging would \n     this be to your wife's work?''\n       Wilson--who, not surprisingly, has refused to confirm or \n     deny that his wife was a CIA operative--answered Katie \n     ``hypothetically.'' He explained, ``it would be damaging not \n     just to her career, since she's been married to me, but since \n     they mentioned her by her maiden name, to her entire career. \n     So it would be her entire network that she may have \n     established, any operations, any programs or projects she was \n     working on. It's a--it's a breach of national security. My \n     understanding is it may, in fact, be a violation of American \n     law.''\n       And, indeed, it is.\n       The Espionage Act of 1917 and the Intelligence Identities \n     and Protection Act of 1982 may both apply. Given the scant \n     facts, it is difficult to know which might be more \n     applicable. But as Senator Schumer (D.NY) said, in calling \n     for an FBI investigation, if the reported facts are true, \n     there has been a crime. The only question is: Whodunit?\n\n\n                       the espionage act of 1917\n\n       The Reagan Administration effectively used the Espionage \n     Act of 1917 to prosecute\n\n[[Page S12155]]\n\n     a leak--to the horror of the news media. It was a case that \n     instituted to make a point, and establish the law, and it did \n     just that in spades.\n       In July 1984, Samuel Morrison--the grandson of the eminent \n     naval historian with the same name--leaked three classified \n     photos to Jane's Defense Weekly. The photos were of the \n     Soviet Union's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which \n     had been taken by a U.S. spy satellite.\n       Although the photos compromised no national security \n     secrets, and were not given to enemy agents, the Reagan \n     Administration prosecuted the leak. That raised the question: \n     Must the leaker have an evil purpose to be prosecuted?\n       The Administration argued that the answer was no. As with \n     Britain's Official Secrets Acts, the leak of classified \n     material alone was enough to trigger imprisonment for up to \n     ten years and fines. And the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Fourth Circuit agreed. It held that such a leak might \n     be prompted by ``the most laudable motives, or any motive at \n     all,'' and it would still be a crime. As a result, Morrison \n     went to jail.\n       The Espionage Act, though thrice amended since then, \n     continues to criminalize leaks of classified information, \n     regardless of the reason for the leak. Accordingly, the ``two \n     senior administration officials'' who leaked the classified \n     information of Mrs. Wilson's work at the CIA to Robert Novak \n     (and, it seems, others) have committed a federal crime.\n\n\n             the intelligence identities and protection act\n\n       Another applicable criminal statute is the Intelligence \n     Identities Act, enacted in 1982. The law has been employed in \n     the past. For instance, a low-level CIA clerk was convicted \n     for sharing the identify of CIA employees with her boyfriend, \n     when she was stationed in Ghana. She pled guilty and received \n     a two-year jail sentence. (Others have also been charged with \n     violations, but have pleaded to unrelated counts of the \n     indictment.)\n       The Act reaches outsiders who engage in ``a pattern of \n     activities'' intended to reveal the identities of covert \n     operatives (assuming such identities are not public \n     information, which is virtually always the case).\n       But so far, there is no evidence that any journalist has \n     engaged in such a pattern. Accepting Administration leaks--\n     even repeatedly--should not count as a violation, for First \n     Amendment reasons.\n       The Act primarily reaches insiders with classified \n     intelligence, those privy to the identity of covert agents. \n     It addresses two kinds of insiders.\n       First, there are those with direct access to the classified \n     information about the ``covert agents'' who leak it. These \n     insiders--including persons in the CIA--may serve up to ten \n     years in jail for leaking this information.\n       Second, there are those who are authorized to have \n     classified information and learn it, and then leak it. These \n     insiders--including persons in, say, the White House or \n     Defense Department--can be sentenced to up to five years in \n     jail for such leaks.\n       The statute also has additional requirements before the \n     leak of the identity of a ``covert agent'' is deemed \n     criminal. But it appears they are all satisfied here.\n       First, the lead must be to a person ``not authorized to \n     receive classified information.'' Any journalist--including \n     Novak and Time--plainly fits.\n       Second, the insider must know that the information being \n     disclosed identifies a ``covert agent.'' In this case, that's \n     obvious, since Novak was told this fact.\n       Third, the insider must know that the U.S. government is \n     ``taking affirmative measures to conceal such covert agent's \n     intelligence relationship to the United States.'' For persons \n     with Top Secret security clearances, that's a no-brainer: \n     They have been briefed, and have signed pledges of secrecy, \n     and it is widely known by senior officials that the CIA goes \n     to great effort to keep the names of its agents secret.\n       A final requirement relates to the ``covert agent'' \n     herself. She must either be serving outside the United \n     States, or have served outside the United States in the last \n     five years. It seems very likely that Mrs. Wilson fulfills \n     the latter condition--but the specific facts on this point \n     have not yet been reported.\n\n\n             how the law protects covert agents' identities\n\n       What is not in doubt, is that Mrs. Wilson's identity was \n     classified, and no one in the government had the right to \n     reveal it.\n       Virtually all the names of covert agents in the CIA are \n     classified, and the CIA goes to some effort to keep them \n     classified. They refuse all Freedom of Information Act \n     requests, they refuse (and courts uphold) to provide such \n     information in discovery connected to lawsuits.\n       Broadly speaking, covert agents (and their informants) fall \n     under the State Secrets privilege. A Federal statute requires \n     that ``the Director of Central Intelligence shall be \n     responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods \n     from unauthorized disclosure.'' It is not, in other words, an \n     option for the CIA to decide to reveal an agent's activities.\n       And of course, there are many good reasons for this--\n     relating not only to the agent, but also to national \n     security. As CIA Director Turner explained in a lawsuit in \n     1982, shortly after the Intelligence Identities Act became \n     law, ``In the case of persons acting in the employ of CIA, \n     once their identity is discerned further damage will likely \n     result from the exposure of other intelligence collection \n     efforts for which they were used.''\n\n\n      The White House's Unusual Stonewalling About an Obvious Leak\n\n       In the past, Bush and Cheney have gone ballistic when \n     national security information leaked. But this leak--though \n     it came from ``two senior administration officials''--has \n     been different. And that, in itself, speaks volumes.\n       On July 22, White House press secretary Scott McClellan was \n     asked about the Novak column. Offering only a murky, non-\n     answer, he claimed that neither ``this President or this \n     White House operates'' in such a fashion. He added, ``there \n     is absolutely no information that has come to my attention or \n     that I have seen that suggests that there is any truth to \n     that suggestion. And, certainly, no one in this White House \n     would have given authority to take such a step.''\n       So was McClellan saying that Novak was lying--and his \n     sources were not, in fact, ``two senior administration \n     officials''? McClellan dodged, kept repeating his mantra, and \n     refused to respond.\n       Later, McClellan was asked, ``Would the President support \n     an investigation into the blowing of the cover of an \n     undercover CIA operative?'' Again, he refused to acknowledge \n     ``that there might be some truth to the matter you're \n     bringing up.'' When pressed further, he said he would have to \n     look into ``whether or not that characterization is accurate \n     when you're talking about someone's cover.''\n       McClellan's statement that he would have to look into the \n     matter was disingenuous at best. This ten-day old column by \n     Novak had not escaped the attention of the White House. \n     Indeed, when the equation was first raised, McClellan \n     immediately responded, ``Thank you for bringing it up.''\n       As David Corn has pointed out, what McClellan did not say, \n     is even more telling than what he said. He did not say he was \n     trying to get to the bottom of the story and determine if it \n     had any basis in fact. He did not say the president would not \n     tolerate such activities, and was demanding to know what had \n     happened.\n       Indeed, as Corn points out, McClellan's remarks ``hardly \n     covered a message from Bush to his underlings: don't you dare \n     pull crap like this.'' Indeed, they could even be seen as \n     sending a message that such crimes will be overlooked.\n       Frankly, I am astounded that the President of the United \n     States--whose father was once Director of the CIA--did not \n     see fit to have his Press Secretary address this story with \n     hard facts. Nor has he apparently called for an \n     investigation--or even given Ambassador and Mrs. Wilson a \n     Secret Service detail, to let the world know they will be \n     protected.\n       This is the most vicious leak I have seen in over 40 years \n     of government-watching. Failure to act to address it will \n     reek of a cover-up or, at minimum, approval of the leak's \n     occurrence--and an invitation to similar revenge upon \n     Administration critics.\n\n\n         congressional calls for investigation should be heeded\n\n       Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) was the first to react. On July \n     22, he delivered a lengthy speech about how the Bush \n     Administration was using friendly reporters to attack its \n     enemies. He knew this well, because he was one of those being \n     so attacked.\n       ``Sadly, what we have here,'' Durbin told his colleagues, \n     ``is a continuing pattern by this White House. If any Member \n     of this Senate--Democrat or Republican--takes to the floor, \n     questions this White House policy, raises any questions about \n     the gathering of intelligence information, or the use of it, \n     be prepared for the worst. This White House is going to turn \n     on you and attack you.''\n       After Senator Durbin set forth the evidence that showed the \n     charges of the White House against him were false, he turned \n     to the attacks on Ambassador and Mrs. Wilson. He announced \n     that he was asking the chairman and ranking member of the \n     Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate this ``extremely \n     serious matter.''\n       ``In [the Administration's] effort to seek political \n     revenge against Ambassador Wilson,'' Durbin said, ``they are \n     now attacking him and his wife, and doing it in a fashion \n     that is not only unacceptable, it may be criminal. And that, \n     frankly, is as serious as it gets in this town.''\n       The House Intelligence Committee is also going to \n     investigate the Wilson leak. ``What happened is very \n     dangerous to a person who may be a CIA operative,'' \n     Congressman Alcee Hastings (D-FL), a member of the Committee, \n     said. And the committee's chairman, Porter Goss (R-FL), a \n     former CIA agent himself, said an investigation ``could be \n     part of a wider'' look that his committee is taking at WMD \n     issues.\n       In a July 24 letter to FBI Director William Mueller, \n     Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) demanded a criminal \n     investigation of the leak. Schumer's letter stated, ``If the \n     facts that have been reported publicly are true, it is clear \n     that a crime was committed. The only questions remaining to \n     be answered are who committed the crime and why?''\n       The FBI, too, has confirmed that they are undertaking an \n     investigation.\n       But no one should hold their breath. So far, Congress has \n     treated the Bush Administration with kid gloves. Absent an \n     active investigation by a grand jury, under the direction of \n     a U.S. Attorney or special prosecutor, an FBI investigation \n     is not likely to accomplish anything. After all, the FBI does \n     not\n\n[[Page S12156]]\n\n     have power to compel anyone to talk. And unless the President \n     himself demands a full investigation, the Department of \n     Justice is not going to do anything--unless the Congress \n     uncovers information that embarrasses them into taking \n     action.\n       While this case is a travesty, it won't be the first one \n     that this administration has managed to get away with. Given \n     the new nadir of investigative journalism, this \n     administration has been emboldened. And why not? Lately, the \n     mainstream media has seemed more interested in stockholders \n     than readers. If Congress won't meaningfully investigate \n     these crimes--and, indeed, even if it will--it is the press's \n     duty to do so. Let us hope it fulfills that duty. But I am \n     not holding my breath about that, either.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is serious stuff, and I was furious. \nI had no idea who had done it at that point in time. ``High \nadministration official'' can mean a whole lot of things. So I wrote \nthe letter to Mr. Mueller and publicly called on him for an \ninvestigation.\n  I learned shortly thereafter that for such an investigation to \nproceed, the CIA had to fill out, I think it is, an 11-point \nquestionnaire about the person named, what they did, and what was \nrevealed. Of course, last week it came out on television and in the \nnewspapers that the CIA had asked for an investigation. The logical, \nthough not certain, conclusion of that, of course, is that they believe \na crime might well have been committed; that Ms. Plame, indeed, was \nhurt by the revelation, and that it was illegal to reveal it.\n  I cannot tell you how many people I have talked with in this body and \nthroughout the country who are just outraged by this--just outraged. \nThe attitude that seemed to be indicated by the administration \nspokesperson yesterday--oh, we get plenty of leaks, and this is just \none of them, and we investigate all of them--is even more infuriating.\n  This is not an ordinary leak. I challenge any of my colleagues on \neither side of the aisle to bring to me the situation where someone in \na high administration position leaked the name of an agent and \njeopardized their life, their contacts, and America's security. This is \na totally different ball of wax. This is not just a leak. This is a \ncrime, plain and simple.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to my two \ncolleagues in just a minute.\n  Even the White House saying, ``We will fire whoever did it,'' is not \nsufficient. If you have a company and someone is suspected of murder \nand they say, ``If we find out they are convicted of murder, we will \nfire them,'' would that be a sufficient enough punishment? Absolutely \nnot.\n  What we have here is an attitude: Let's sweep this under the rug, \nlet's make sure nobody says much about it, and maybe it will go away.\n  I yield first to my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a question. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Nevada for \na question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New York, I have \nbeen at a meeting with the Iraqi Governing Council, and I was stunned \nwhen I came back to the Senate Chamber and was advised by my staff that \nwe are no longer on the DC appropriations bill. We are suddenly in \nmorning business until our weekly caucuses.\n  I say to my friend from New York, why in the world would someone be \nafraid to vote on an amendment the Senator from New York and others are \ngoing to offer that says: Let's take a look at this; let's find out \nwhat happened? We know there was a crime committed. I don't use those \nwords often. I know there was a crime committed. It is only a question \nof who did it. Why wouldn't our friends on the other side of the aisle \nallow a debate on this issue? It is not as if we are taking away heavy \nbusiness. We have been vouchered out from doing the DC appropriations \nbill.\n  I say to my friend from New York, what fear does the majority in the \nSenate have in allowing an amendment the Senator from New York wishes \nto offer? Why can't we debate this amendment?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for the question. I have asked \nmyself the same question. I was told first that the reason the DC \nappropriations bill has not been put forward is that they are afraid of \nthis amendment. This is a pattern. This morning--\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend--pardon the interruption, through the \nChair--afraid of what? Of the truth?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is what the signs seem to indicate. This morning, I \nwas asked to go on the ``Today Show'' and talk about this issue. They \nasked a whole bunch of Republican Senators. None would appear. They \nasked the administration to send somebody. No one would appear. Again, \nthe attitude seems to be: Let's shrug our shoulders and hope this goes \naway.\n  I will make one other point to our colleague. Our President has made \nit his hallmark of defending our troops. That is why we are debating or \nwe will be debating the money for them. That is why we will be debating \nall of this. Every CIA agent is one of our troops, and for the \nPresident to not address this directly, for the President to have his \nspokesperson say this is one of a whole lot of leaks, to say if they \nfind out who it is, they will be fired--well, I just ask my colleagues \nto think about this. Let us say they were certain it would cause no \ndamage to them, that these high administration officials were somewhere \nfar away. Do my colleagues think we would have the same attitude from \nour Commander in Chief, and one who correctly prides himself in \nprotecting our troops?\n\n  So it makes one scratch one's head and say, What are they worried \nabout? Why will they not get to the bottom of this? This, again, as my \ncolleague has said, is very likely a crime, and a serious crime.\n  I read my colleagues what President Bush, Sr., the 41st President, \nsaid about this type of crime. He ought to know because, of course, as \nwe all know, he was head of the CIA before he was President.\n\n       I have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray \n     the trust by exposing our sources. They are, in my view, the \n     most insidious of traitors.\n\n  Do we just answer, this is a leak like every other leak when dealing \nwith traitors?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I came in past the 11:30 hour. Is it true then that we find \nourselves in a situation, from a parliamentary standpoint, that the \nSenator cannot offer his amendment? Is that what the Senator is telling \nme?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague from Nevada will yield, that is exactly \nright.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has worked on this all morning, I know, as well \nas yesterday. I had a conversation with him yesterday. We were to go \nback into legislative business at 11:30. That right has been taken away \nfrom us by the majority. They will not even let the Senator offer an \namendment in legislative session. Is that true?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is exactly true.\n  I would be happy to yield to my colleague from California for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator so much for yielding. I have a few \nquestions. What I want to do is make a 4- or 5-minute statement and \nthen ask three or four questions and hope the Senator can answer them \nin his inimicable fashion.\n  First, I thank Senator Schumer so much for picking up on this issue. \nI remember reading about this in July and just scratching my head. I \nessentially thought: This cannot be true. I cannot believe that someone \nin the White House would reveal the identity of a person who is working \nat the CIA undercover. Whether she is an analyst, an operative, or an \nagent, it matters not, but certainly someone whose identity had never \nbeen revealed. I thought: This cannot be happening.\n  To be honest, I should have done more about it, but I did not, and \nthank the Senator for writing to the head of the FBI, for whom I have a \ngreat deal of respect, and letting him know this.\n  Here are my questions: As I look at this, I think, why would someone \ndo this? Well, clearly the idea behind attacking Ambassador Wilson's \nwife was that Ambassador Wilson gave the White House news they did not \nwant to hear, which was that there was really no proof that Saddam \nHussein was getting nuclear materials from Niger. They did not want \nthat answer; it was kind of a kill-the-messenger type of response; and \nin order to get back at\n\n[[Page S12157]]\n\nhim, they out his wife, which is despicable and a crime, but I think it \nis about arrogance and it is about intimidation.\n\n  We have seen the arrogance, but it is the intimidation factor I want \nthe Senator to comment on because this is not only about this one \nincident--in which clearly Ambassador Wilson was correct, by the way--\nbut it is a signal that is sent, really, frankly, to everyone in \npolitics that nothing is off limits if someone crosses us: We will go \nafter their wife; we will go after their kids.\n  I have to say to my friend, he is a family man, I am a family woman. \nWe are in this world--God knows how and why but we are in it--and we \nare willing to take the hits and everything else, but the lowest form \nof politics is if someone comes after your kids or your spouse. I \nresent it, and I want my colleague to comment on those two areas.\n  I also ask him to comment on a third one, and that is the whole \nstruggle that women are having in this world of ours to enhance our \ncareers, to break the glass ceiling, to go into fields that are maybe a \nlittle bit unusual. I do not have the statistics at my fingertips, but \nif we look at the number of women who are FBI agents, I can tell my \ncolleague that it is very few. I used to know the exact number. I do \nnot want to throw out a number, but it is way less than a third, as I \nremember.\n  So we have a circumstance where there is a woman in a nontraditional \nfield doing her work, obviously not getting credit for it. She is \nworking incognito at the CIA, whatever her work is, and she is going up \nthe ladder. Maybe she has a tremendous future. Well, probably the \nfuture in that field has been harmed, if not totally destroyed, and \nmaybe her life or other lives that she touched in her work are in \ndanger.\n  So we are talking about a number of issues--yes, the crime that was \ncommitted, but the whole idea of intimidation to people who might take \non this administration, the whole idea of going after someone's family \nwhen we know, as public servants, what our families mean to us and how \nwe protect them from whatever befalls us, the hits, the pain, and other \nthings that happen. We asked for it. We are in this arena.\n  So I hope my friend will perhaps talk about that. It is a human \ntragedy beyond the crime, and I ask my friend to comment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for her thoughtful, incisive, and \nfrom-the-heart-type comments. I will comment on them.\n  The one I would like to focus on a little bit is the intimidation. \nThe greatness of this democracy through the centuries has been the \nstructure the Founding Fathers set up which allows debate on the \nissues. It is wonderful.\n  If we had to think of a sentence at the core of America, it might be: \nWe believe in the competition of ideas, and the best idea will win out. \nFree speech, that is the competition of ideas in its pure form. Free \nenterprise, that is the competition of economic ideas. Freedom of \nreligion, that is the competition of spiritual ideas. Democracy is the \ncompetition of political ideas. When we no longer have that, the \ndemocracy frays.\n  When people are afraid to say what they think, not because their \narguments will be answered directly but, rather, because they will be \nhit below the belt, we have the beginnings of the fraying of the \ndemocracy, and that is what is happening.\n  I hate to say this, but this administration seems to have a peculiar \npenchant to attack someone's patriotism when they disagree. I have \nbasically been a supporter of the President on the war and foreign \npolicy, but for those who disagree, there has been not just, here is \nwhy you are wrong and let me tell you why--there has been some of \nthat--but in addition there is an impugning of motive, an impugning of \ncharacter, a kneecapping. One of the reasons this issue resonates so is \nthat it is the worst of that.\n  Now, about our families, of course, they should be off limits. I will \ntell a little story, and then I will yield to my colleague from Iowa. \nBut the points of my colleague from California are so good.\n  When I ran for the Senate in 1998, my daughter was starting ninth \ngrade in a new high school. My worry was she was going to start in \nSeptember. If, God willing, I won the primary, the next day I knew that \nmy opponent, who was known as a hardball political player, Senator \nD'Amato, my predecessor--with whom I now get along quite well, I am \nhappy to say--would go after me. My greatest worry, and the No. 1 \nreason I debated not to run, was that I thought she would be new in \nhigh school, with a whole bunch of new people, and she was going to a \ndifferent high school, not in Brooklyn but in Manhattan, and people \nwould not want to be friends with her because they would see these \nhorrible things being said about her father on television. Of course we \ntalked it over with Jessica, too, who was a mature 10th grader then--\nnow she is in college and doing great--and we decided to run. As it \nturns out, they did run all the nasty ads. The morning I won the \nprimary I turned on the TV and there they were. It didn't affect her or \nher friends. That is the worry we had.\n\n  What they are trying to do here is send the message that even your \nfamily is not off limits, perhaps. That is a horrible message. That \nfrays democracy, just as does the inability to dissent.\n  I respected Ronald Reagan. When you asked Ronald Reagan something, if \nhe disagreed with you he would say exactly why: Well, I am against Head \nStart because I think parents should be in charge of their children \nuntil they are 5.\n  All too often in this administration they don't answer directly. In \nfact, they will get up and say, ``We love Head Start,'' and then they \nwill cut the money.\n  So the candor, the debate on the merits, seems to be going away, and \nthat worries me about the future of this country. This incident is an \napotheosis of that, both in terms of intimidation, in terms of going \nafter family, in terms of being malicious, and in terms of saying our \npolitical agenda is more important than the lives of the people \nfighting for us--in this case, in the intelligence agencies.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague from Iowa for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from New York for yielding for a \nquestion. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment that the \nSenator is trying to offer. I came over to the floor from the \nAppropriations Committee meeting to speak on this amendment. Evidently, \nI now find out, I understand--am I correct, I ask my friend from New \nYork, that the majority, Republican side, has extended this period of \nmorning business which will keep you from offering this amendment? Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I am proud to cosponsor the amendment. I think it \ngets to the heart of the matter, and that is to try to get a special \ncounsel to look into these serious allegations.\n  I noted earlier the Senator from New York had quoted from former \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush on leaks. I think there is another \nquote from a former Senator, John Ashcroft, now Attorney General, in \nwhich he said:\n\n       You know, a single allegation can be most worthy of a \n     special prosecutor. If you are abusing government property, \n     if you are abusing your status in office, it can be a single \n     fact that makes the difference on this.\n\n  John Ashcroft, October 4, 1997, on CNN, Evans and Novak, ``A single \nallegation can be most worthy of a special prosecutor.''\n  As I understand it, the allegation here is not someone has abused \ngovernment property, not that someone has engaged in some murky real \nestate deal in timberland someplace, this is an allegation that someone \nhigh up in this Government--we don't know where, but someplace high up \nin the Government, having access to classified information, leaked to \none or more reporters, columnists, news people, the name of a CIA \nagent. That is the allegation, is it not?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is exactly the allegation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It would seem to this Senator that allegation is of such \nimport that everyone here ought to support the Senator's sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. I say to the Senator, I view it with nothing short \nof amazement that the other side would want to stop this. I would think \neveryone here would want to get to the bottom of this.\n\n  I ask the Senator, again, is it the Senator's judgment that somehow \nwe\n\n[[Page S12158]]\n\nare not being allowed to bring this up for a vote? Does the Senator \nintend to pursue this, to make sure we do speak as a Senate on this?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for asking that question. Indeed, \nwhenever the DC appropriations bill comes up, I am going to bring up \nthis sense of the Senate.\n  I thank him for bringing up something else. I don't want this to be a \npartisan issue. When I first wrote the Director of the FBI, I had no \nidea who put this in there. I just wanted to get to the bottom of it \nbecause I was so outraged at the tactic. What I think we ought to be \ndoing is getting the special counsel because the special counsel is the \nway to certainly remove any appearance of a conflict, and perhaps a \nconflict itself. Attorney General Ashcroft, whom you quoted, is known \nas a close political ally of the President's. There is an argument that \nthe Attorney General should be removed from the President and be a \nlawyer for the Nation. And there is an argument that the Attorney \nGeneral should be a close political ally of the President. Democrats \nand Republicans--it has not been a Democratic or Republican issue.\n  John Kennedy appointed his brother as Attorney General. But when you \nappoint an Attorney General who is a close political ally and friend, \nand when something sensitive with conflicts of interest occurs, then \nyou have an obligation, in my judgment, to move for a special \nprosecutor. You pay a price, in a certain sense. You gain things by \nhaving a political ally as Attorney General, but you also lose things, \nand you lose the guise of independence, the actuality of independence.\n  My colleague is so right. The best thing that could happen is we pass \nthis resolution unanimously, we all work together to get a respected \nindependent counsel--someone like a John Danforth or a Warren Rudman or \na Sam Nunn or a George Mitchell--and then they go forward with their \ninvestigation. I think every one of us on this side of the aisle, as \nwell as the other, would be content that the chips will fall where they \nmay so this dastardly crime, and that is what it is, will be exposed.\n  This idea of not bringing up such a resolution, of not wanting to \ndebate it, of, again, maybe casting aspersions on the motivation of \nthose who are for it--we have 14 or 15 of us, and we will have more--is \ngoing to make the American people think: Wait a minute, maybe they are \nworried; maybe there is something to hide--which there may or may not \nbe.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague for responding. I have a couple more \nquestions.\n  I appreciate what the Senator just said. There have been some \nallegations made. I don't know whether or not this is some partisan \neffort or something like that. We know that a law has been broken. \nThere is a clear law against leaking the names of our intelligence \nagents, and it is punishable by 5 years--or 10?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Ten.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Ten years or a $50,000 fine. A crime has been committed.\n\n  I say to the Senator, here we are going on day after day, and there \nis a lot of stuff going around the White House and the Attorney \nGeneral's office. Is it the judgment of the Senator that this could \nreally be brought to the forefront rapidly? I say because of a \nstatement that was made on ABC News--The Note. They had an interesting \nquestion. They asked: Has he [has the President] insisted that every \nsenior staff member sign a statement with legal authority that they are \nnot the leaker and that they will identify to the White House legal \ncounsel who is?\n  It seems to me the President of the United States can say: Sign this. \nAre you the one who called or not? And this will be over with by 4 \no'clock this afternoon.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for that. That is what the \nPresident ought to do. This President--I mentioned this earlier to my \ncolleagues, when I was having a dialog with my colleague from Nevada--\nis known for defending our troops. That is what we are talking about \nwith $87 billion. That is a good thing.\n  Our CIA agents are our troops, just as our soldiers are our troops. \nIn fact, after the war, after 9/11 and the global fight against \nterrorism, they are even more important because intelligence is so \nimportant.\n  It seems to me that it would be logical for this President to do just \nwhat the Senator said--to say: You know, yes, we have to have a legal \ninvestigation, but I want to get to the bottom of this immediately \nbecause this conduct is reprehensible.\n  I don't believe the President was involved in this. I disagree with \nhim politically. It doesn't seem part of his character. But he should \nsure want to get to the bottom. He does not address it at all. His \nspokesperson comes out there and says: Oh, these are leaks just like \nall the others. We will find out and we will fire him.\n  One wonders.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. One wonders. The President, it seems \nto me, would want to get this over with in a hurry by finding out who \nthe person is who leaked this and let the legal recourse then follow. \nBut at least expedite this right away and get rid of that person.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The 30 minutes allotted on this \nside has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent, since there is no one from the \nother side, that we be given an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know other Senators want to engage the \nSenator from New York. I thank him for his leadership on this. I know \nof the Senator's longstanding support for our law enforcement and for \nmaking sure that those who violate the trust of public office are \nbrought to justice. That is what this is about. This is a gross \nviolation. This is not some little real estate deal someplace.\n  I ask the Senator: Maybe it is not so much that the wife of Mr. \nWilson is identified, and she may be safe here in the United States. I \ndon't know about her travels abroad. That may be restricting her \nfreedom in the future. But what about the contacts she made and her \nsources around the world? What is going to happen then? What will \nhappen to our intelligence agents around the world today if they think \nthey are going to be ``outed'' sometime by this administration or some \nother administration? What happens to our war on terrorism?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I so much appreciate my colleague's \nintelligence and integrity and passion which he brings to so many \ndifferent issues. He is exactly right. Even if this agent should decide \nto retire, the damage would be great because other agents would think: \nMaybe I will get in trouble. What will I get in trouble for? Speaking \nthe truth?\n  We depend on truth in our intelligence services more than just about \nanything else. President after President has said one of the keys to \ngoverning well is good intelligence that will tell you when you are off \nbase as well as when you are on base. It is so serious. The Senator is \nexactly right. This transcends any one person. It transcends any \nspecific person because it goes to the integrity.\n  I say to my colleague one other thing: From what I understand, our \nintelligence services are livid because this happened.\n  Mr. HARKIN. They should be.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I don't know for a fact. But my guess is there was great \ndebate in the CIA because it was a tough thing to do given that ``high \nadministration sources'' were implicated. But the anger among the \nAgency is red hot, as I understand it, and with good reason.\n\n  I thank my colleague. I would be happy to yield to my colleague from \nFlorida for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to pick up on \nsomething the Senator from New York said. I can best illustrate it with \nVeterans Day and Memorial Day when we typically are commending those \nyoung men and women in uniform. We have to modify that now because of \nthe war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. We commend the young men \nand women not only in uniform but in the service of their country, \nbecause the CIA was the first to go into Afghanistan. They were all \nover Afghanistan before we ever went in with our military forces. They \nare\n\n[[Page S12159]]\n\nworking in conjunction with our military forces. Indeed, the first \nAmerican to be killed in Afghanistan was Mike Spann, a CIA agent.\n  What we are dealing with, lest folks get this all mixed up with \npolitics, is a crime of the most serious nature because it jeopardizes \nthe security of the United States and its people. When someone's \nidentity is suddenly revealed and is an agent of the U.S. Government, \ntheir life is in jeopardy and the lives of their contacts are in \njeopardy. That is the gravity of this leak. That gets lost in all of \nthis. He said, she said, and so forth is just branded as politics. But \nwe are dealing with the lives of people.\n  As in any normal criminal proceeding, if a violation of law is \nthought to have occurred, then let us allow the cops to investigate and \nlet us bring that person in front of the responsible judicial \ntribunals. The question is, which cops will be able to investigate and \nget to the truth? If you leave it to the professional law enforcement \npeople, they will. But isn't it sad that we have to be concerned that \npolitical influence will direct that investigation?\n  Whatever turn it takes, what the Senator from Florida is standing for \nis I know our people want to get to the truth, and it ought to be the \nprofessional law enforcement investigators who determine what is the \ntruth. That is why I wanted to come and support the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. Again, he is on the money. That is \nall we seek here now--the truth.\n  The spokesperson for the President, Mr. McClellan, said we are \nreferring it to the Justice Department and the professionals. If you \nlook at the chain of command, it goes right up to the Attorney General.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Attorney General is a close political \nally with the President. There is nothing wrong with that. That is one \nmodel of the Attorney General. But it certainly sacrifices the \nappearance of independence, and perhaps independence itself \nparticularly goes very high up.\n  Why we have asked for a special counsel is very simple: It is to \nallow professional law enforcement to do the job unfettered so they \nknow they will not pay a price if they pursue it completely and fully. \nThat would entail a special counsel of great legal background and \nsterling repetition for independence and integrity. I think it would \nbehoove the administration to do that.\n  There are all sorts of doubts now. Are they telling the truth about \nthis, that, or the other thing when it comes to foreign policy? Were we \nto appoint a special counsel, people would say: Yes, maybe they are.\n  But I will say this: The effort to sort of sweep this under the rug \nand say, oh, this is just one of the leaks that occurs every day, that \nmakes me angry, to be honest with my colleague. That is unfair not only \nto the CIA agent in question but to the thousands of intelligence \nagents across the globe who at this moment, as my good colleague points \nout so correctly, are defending just as our soldiers are defending us \nand are more needed than ever before.\n  That is why in the intelligence community there is such livid anger \nbecause this occurred. My guess is--this is just my guess--that is why \nMr. Tenet requested the investigation. My guess is that in his head he \nwas saying, Oh, boy, this is going to get me in trouble the way, say, \nJanet Reno may have gotten in trouble with the previous President, the \nAttorney General from the Senator's State. But he knows that the \nintegrity of the intelligence service is important. My guess is that is \nwhy he did it. Maybe that is why it took a bit more time than I had \nimagined when I first requested this on July 24. But he did request it.\n  Now our obligation to the thousands of brave men and women who are in \nour intelligence services and risking their lives is to get to the \nbottom of it with a fearless, complete, and thorough investigation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator further yield for an \nadditional comment? It is not only, interestingly, those who are \ndirectly in the services of the CIA now, but it is also the retirees.\n  I will never forget being in an almost deserted embassy in Islamabad, \nPakistan, after September 11. I heard my name being called. I turned \naround, and I saw an elderly looking gentleman, and he recalled how we \nknew each other back when I was in the House of Representatives.\n\n  I said: What in the world are you doing here?\n  We were getting ready to do a raid in 5 cities simultaneously that \nnight, of which we got 50 al-Qaida, and we got the No. 3 guy. And, lo \nand behold, he was a retired CIA agent they brought back in the \naftermath of September 11, when we were trying to catch up until we \ncould get the new guys trained. They reached out, and they got the old \nguys who had all the knowledge.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. So we are talking about the protection of the \ninterests of this country, and not only those in the active service \nright now but those who are retired who in times of emergency are \ncalled back as well.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. Well said. It is a tribute to how \nfamiliar he is with our intelligence services and how many from his \nState serve in the intelligence community.\n  I was glad to hear, for instance, that these days, on the college \ncampuses, signing up for intelligence is a coveted thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be given \nanother 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  There are lines to join the intelligence services, sort of as there \nwere after World War II, when some of our best and our brightest wanted \nto go into our services.\n  I will tell you, if politics can be played--and those of us asking \nfor an investigation are not playing politics; it was the people who \nouted this agent, if, indeed, that is proven to be true, who were \nplaying politics--but if that is allowed to prevail, it is going to \nhurt our intelligence agencies in many more ways than one.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I would just make two points. No. 1, I will continue \nto make an effort to bring up this amendment. It has now been printed \nin the Record. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to read \nit. We were judicious in our language. It does not have any kind of \npolitical language or diatribe. It just states the facts. I would hope \nwe could get colleagues from both sides of the aisle to sponsor it.\n  And I would hope we could move it forward--move it forward quickly--\nas a message because that is all it can be, but as a message to the \nPresident that we need a thorough, complete, and fearless \ninvestigation, and that only a special counsel can do that for us.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nAlabama, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12159-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress concerning the appointment \n   of a special counsel to conduct a fair, thorough, and independent \n             investigation into a national security breach)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT OF A \n                   SPECIAL COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A FAIR, THOROUGH, \n                   AND INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO A NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY BREACH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the national security of the United States is dependent \n     on our intelligence operatives being able to operate \n     undercover and without fear of having their identities \n     disclosed;\n       (2) recent reports have indicated that administration or \n     White House officials may have deliberately leaked the \n     identity of a covert CIA agent to the media;\n       (3) the unauthorized disclosure of a covert intelligence \n     agent's identity is a Federal felony; and\n       (4) the Attorney General has the power to appoint a special \n     counsel of integrity and stature who may conduct an \n     investigation into the leak without the appearance of any \n     conflict of interest.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Attorney General of the United States should appoint a \n     special counsel of the highest integrity and statute to \n     conduct a fair, independent, and thorough investigation of \n     the leak and ensure that all individuals found to be \n     responsible for this heinous deed are punished to the fullest \n     extent permitted by law.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, our leader from \nSouth Dakota, as much time as he wishes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank all of those involved in the \ndiscussion and the agreement we have just reached procedurally. This is \nan important issue and it deserves the consideration of the Senate.\n  I want to especially acknowledge the leadership Senator Schumer has \nshown on this matter, and I expressed the gratitude of our caucus to \nhim for providing this legislative leadership as we consider what to do \nin this particular case.\n  I think there are several facts we know for sure. We know the law was \nviolated. We know what the law says with regard to violations of this \nmagnitude. We know the chilling effect it has on our intelligence-\ngathering capability and on personnel involved in the front lines with \nregard to intelligence-gathering responsibilities.\n  We know, if we can believe the reports that have already been printed \nand reported, what motivated someone in the White House or someone in \nthis administration was retaliation, retribution for being critical of \nthe administration. Those things we know.\n  What we don't know is how it happened. What we don't know is who is \nresponsible. What we don't know is whether or not the perception that \nthe Justice Department can investigate this independently, objectively, \nand thoroughly is something we can answer today. I would say the answer \nis no. It would be very difficult to put John Ashcroft in the position \nof investigating the very people who hired him for the job. We no \nlonger have the independent counsel law. That has expired. I am on \nrecord as having said I support the expiration of the independent \ncounsel law because of the abuses that I believe have occurred. What we \ndo have is an independent prosecutor set up by regulation throughout \nthe Justice Department to create more of an independent review, an \noutside analysis of all of the outstanding questions regarding this \nparticular case.\n  So that is really what the Senator from New York is saying. Because \nthe law was violated, because of the perceptions created about the \ninability of this Attorney General to create an independent, thorough \ninvestigation, we have no choice. We have no choice but to encourage \nand to demand that a special counsel be appointed.\n  Mr. President, I don't know that there could be anything more \negregious--in fact, I thought President Bush's father said it about as \nwell as anyone can.\n  Anyone who is guilty of doing something such as this is what \nPresident Bush said, an insidious traitor. I believe those are strong \nwords, because they deserve the kind of repudiation that words such as \nthat connote.\n  The only way we can ensure that those responsible for insidious acts \ninvolving the very essence of our ability to stay strong is to ensure \nthat when we pass laws involving violations, we deal with them \neffectively and directly, regardless of who it may be.\n  Our country is based on the premise, on the foundation, of the rule \nof law. There can be no respect for the rule of law if laws as \nessential to our national security as this are violated and there is no \nfollowup, no responsibility, no actions taken.\n  I do not care how one connotes the importance of this law, one cannot \nminimize its impact in this country today, especially now. So all that \nthe distinguished Senator from New York is saying and what many of us \nare saying with him is let us uphold the law; let us say, as we demand \nof others that they respect the rule of law, that we set the example, \nand that in encouraging the rule of law and respecting the \nextraordinary consequences of the law those who violate it are held \naccountable.\n  I hope this Congress will act unanimously in this sense of the \nSenate, in this statement of purpose that the Senator from New York is \noffering today. Let us simply say with one voice that there can be no \nexcuses, there can be no explanation, there can be no other option than \npursuing the law vigorously. The only way to do that is to recognize \nthe importance of what the Justice Department itself recognized, that \nthere are times when conflicts of interest stand in the way of pursuing \njustice effectively. In those times, the only option we have available \nto us is the creation of an independent counsel.\n  In essence, that is what we are proposing today. I strongly support \nthe letter as well as the spirit and the intent of the resolution, and \nI hope my colleagues will do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, let me thank our leader from South \nDakota for his right-on-the-money words as well as his leadership on \nthis issue with so many others. I think I speak for every Member on our \nside when I say we are proud to follow his leadership, and every Member \nof the\n\n[[Page S12161]]\n\nSenate, that he is just a fine leader and fine man.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. As our distinguished \nDemocratic leader stated, it simply says that the rule of law should be \nupheld. When I read in the Novak column that an agent was outed, I was \njust furious. My first reaction was to call the FBI and send them a \nletter asking that there be a thorough investigation. I was told that \nbefore anything such as this could happen, the CIA had to answer 11 \nquestions on a certain form that would show the law was--and I am not \nsure of the standard; it might be probable cause but violated, or at \nleast the significant possibility of it being violated. Evidently, last \nweek the CIA sent those 11 pages back and asked for an investigation.\n  There are so many points to make, and I will make a few. First, the \ndastardliness of this act; it is despicable. I have been in Washington \n22 years. I have never seen anything quite like this. To reveal the \nidentity of an agent, or an analyst, the law does not matter--and I \nknow that it was said on television yesterday by Mr. Novak, well, she \nwas not an agent, she was an analyst and therefore it does not matter, \nbut the law is very clear, and if someone is covert, a member of the \nCIA, and their identity is revealed, that is a crime.\n  Furthermore, we do not know if she was an analyst or an agent. If we \nare going to believe Mr. Novak on this part of it, then maybe we should \nbelieve him on all the rest of it. Everyone would agree that some high \nadministration officials did a very terrible thing. To take this agent, \nanalyst, this covert individual, who has served their country, and \nexpose them, endangers them, endangers their sources and their \ncontacts. As my good colleague from California has said, it puts a halt \non their career and endangers the security of this country.\n  Furthermore, we have always felt that our intelligence agents are on \nthe front lines. I was told earlier today by my colleague from Florida, \nMr. Nelson, that the first American killed in Afghanistan was not a \nmember of the Armed Forces but a member of the CIA. In a post-9/11 \nworld, our intelligence sources are so important. What does it say to \nall of those thousands of men and women who serve us that if they tell \nthe truth and somebody high up does not like it either they or their \nfamily can be outed? It goes to the very heart of what that Agency is \nall about. It is no wonder that the CIA, its employees from top to \nbottom, were just furious about this activity.\n  I do not know where this will lead. Rumors abound. If the Washington \nPost is correct and six media outlets were called, it is going to be \npretty hard to keep it a secret as to who made the calls, where and \nwhen, but that is not the point. The point is, this crime demands a \nsolution. This outrageous act demands justice.\n  To hear Mr. McClellan of the White House say yesterday, first, there \nare 50 leaks every week, belittling this, made my blood boil. This is \nnot a typical leak. To reveal a covert operative's name is a crime, not \na leak.\n  Then second, to say, if we find them, we will fire them, well, that \nis like saying someone in your company is a murderer and all that \nshould happen is they should lose their job. There was a serious crime \ncommitted. What makes the crime worse is that it appears on its surface \nit was committed for reasons of malice, for reasons of stifling debate \nand dissent. As somebody who has generally been supportive of the \nPresident in Iraq, I find it just as outrageous as somebody who might \nbe opposed.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The reason I am doing this is because I am unable to stay \nand speak on the Senator's amendment but I wanted to make a couple of \ncomments and ask a question, if I can, through the Chair.\n  First, I again thank Senator Schumer for his leadership on this. We \nspoke about it this morning, the fact that he took action back in July \nand wrote to the head of the FBI. He knew immediately that this was \nsomething outrageous, and I do thank him for that.\n  I am also very pleased that we are able now to have the Senator's \namendment offered, to which I am a cosponsor. If I am not, I ask \nunanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The fact is, we now have the DC bill in front of us and \nwe have a legislative way to express ourselves. The thing I want to \npoint out is now there is an attempt to try to demean this incident by \nsaying that the fact that a CIA analyst or agent--we are not exactly \nsure--was revealed is not such a big deal and does not have much merit \nto it. I know my friend spoke about that, but I want to pursue a couple \nof questions.\n  Is it not the fact that the head of the CIA himself decided this was \nso egregious, to reveal the identity of Ambassador Wilson's wife, that \nthe head of the CIA, who really serves at the pleasure of President \nBush, asked for an investigation by the Attorney General? Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would assume that is correct. The bottom line is the \nCIA has asked for it. This is a very sensitive matter. He is the head \nof the CIA, so I think it is a pretty good assumption that he asked for \nit. I think another assumption, that he realized this would ruffle a \nwhole lot of feathers at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, at the White House, \nin the administration, is true. But from what I am told by sources who \nknow what went on there, the obligation to the men and women in the \nintelligence service transcended any feathers that might be ruffled. It \nis a pretty courageous act.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I just want to point out that to attempt to minimize \nthis crime by saying this woman was probably an analyst and not an \nagent is unbelievable to me. The fact is, whether she was an agent or \nan analyst or anything else, was she not undercover? Every time I see \nher on TV, they cover up her face. I say to my friend, let's not get \ninto the sideshow about was she an analyst or was she an agent. The \nfact is, she was in a covert situation, was she not, and it is safe to \nsay that the reason her face is covered up is that she was undercover; \nthe reason the CIA asked for an investigation is that they believe a \nlaw may have been broken because she was undercover.\n  I want to make that one point, in addition to the points we made this \nmorning, which is that I hope my colleagues will vote for this \namendment. I hope my colleagues on the other side will not have a dual \nsense of when an independent counsel should be appointed: There is a \nreal estate deal somewhere; there is an independent counsel. There were \nno lives on the line there. This is a situation where someone who is \nundercover has been revealed as a way to get back at her husband who \nhappened to bring back the news that the administration didn't want to \nhear--that in fact Iraq was not purchasing, at least in this particular \ncase, from Niger any nuclear materials.\n  We have a circumstance where, faced with this, the new defense is: \nShe was just an analyst; she wasn't an agent. I want to make the point, \nthis woman was in the CIA. Her career has no doubt been destroyed. She \nwas undercover. We do not see her face on TV. The fact is, the CIA \nasked for an investigation. And what my friend is saying today is, we \nneed a more independent investigation. We don't want politics to play a \nrole in this investigation. We want to remove it, even though the \nAttorney General will still be in charge of an independent or a special \ncounsel, as we call it. A special counsel will have a little more \nindependence than just getting it over to the Justice Department.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  I wish to clarify a few points that should be made to everyone. The \nreason there is a debate about an agent or analyst is that is what Mr. \nNovak said on one of the shows, that is what we were told earlier \ntoday.\n  I have something from CNN.com. They say that other sources told CNN \non Monday--yesterday--that Plame was an operative who ran agents in the \nfield. Let me repeat that. Other CIA sources told CNN on Monday that \nPlame was an operative who ran agents in the field. I don't know if \nNovak is right or if these other sources are right; that is the very \npoint. The issue of whether she was an agent, an operative, or an \nanalyst is beside the point. The law was broken.\n\n[[Page S12162]]\n\n  The law is clear, and while it says covert agent but defines agent as \nan officer--I am paraphrasing--employee, present or retired, of an \nintelligence agency whose identity has not been previously publicized, \nrevealed, that is the point.\n  Once again, my colleague from California makes a very astute point. \nNo one is revealing the face of this person. No one was revealing the \nname of this person. The bottom line is it is quite clear the law was \nbroken. The only question we don't know is who broke it. What we are \ntrying to do--and again the Senator from California is exactly right--\nis keep the politics out of this issue.\n  The idea that when a law is broken and someone calls for a full and \nthorough investigation, and the mechanism to do it, is politics is \nabsurd. I will tell you what politics is--despicable and nasty \npolitics. It was revealing this person's name because they did not like \nwhat her husband said. That is the politics of this issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend yield further?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to make a point to underscore this discussion. \nThis leaking of a name is, on its face, a crime. The person who did \nthis deserves to be punished because to think that someone would punish \nsomeone's family--they didn't like what Ambassador Wilson said: How can \nwe hurt him? How can we sting him? How can we burn him? We will hurt \nhis wife. We will out her; that will ruin her chances. And that will \nsend a chilling message to Ambassador Wilson: A, be quiet, maybe this \nwill go away; and, B, it sends a chilling message to everyone. That is \nwhy what you are doing is so important.\n  This is an incident that cannot be swept under the rug. Whether it is \na Democratic administration or a Republican administration matters not \nbecause this endangered someone, and it sends a chilling message to \nanyone who might bring bad news to this administration, who might \ndisagree with their policy in Iraq.\n  I say to my friend, he is right on target. If this does fail in a \nparty-line vote--and I pray it does not, but if this fails in a party-\nline vote, unfortunately, this will become a bigger and bigger \npolitical issue because I, for one, am not going to stop focusing \nattention on it. As a woman who has all my life been in jobs that are \nperhaps a little bit different than other women, I have tried to say we \ncan do it. This attack on this woman who was on the ladder, obviously, \nin the CIA, was not only a crime, it was unjustified, and it sends a \nterribly chilling message to other women out there that you can do the \ngreatest job in the world but, gee, if you are married to someone who \nmight say something controversial, you are going to be outed.\n  What about the message--I close with this--it sends to other agents \nout there, other agents who may be working on issues and bringing back \ninformation that the administration doesn't want to hear because maybe \nit does not comport with what they want to be known as the facts? What \nkind of message does this send? Are they going to take the risks? As \nSenator Harkin said, we are going to win this war against terrorism by \nthe quality of our intelligence. And here we have the White House \nitself that says it is leading the fight against terrorism. We stood by \ntheir side continually on this, as we should. Here they are, in \nessence, outing someone who could be working in ways to save our people \nfrom another terrorist attack, from al-Qaida, and whatever else.\n  I am so pleased my friend has been so stalwart on this issue. \nAnything he needs from this Senator from California to help him, I \nremain available to do whatever I can do to bring justice to this \nfamily.\n  I yield back the time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from California for her strong, \nintelligent, and heartfelt words.\n  I would like to make just one other point, and this is a very \nimportant point I have not talked about before, so I hope my colleagues \nwill listen. People ask, Why ought there be a special prosecutor? Why \nnot let Justice do the job?\n  There are obvious reasons. Attorney General Ashcroft is a close \npolitical associate of the President's. If this goes high up into the \nWhite House, there is obviously the appearance of a conflict, if not a \nconflict itself. There is nothing wrong with the President appointing a \nclose political associate as Attorney General. Some have. John Kennedy \ndid. Bill Clinton didn't. The other model is to appoint someone at some \ndistance, someone removed, a professional law enforcement person. But \nwhen you appoint someone who is close, you lose any vestige of \nindependence when something sensitive comes up, making the need for \nspecial counsel more important.\n  A special counsel is not a runaway counsel. The independent counsel \nlaw expired because people were worried about that. It is still \nappointed by the Attorney General. The differences are threefold. No. \n1, the day-to-day running of the investigation is not under the \nAttorney General or the staff that is directly under him with the chain \nof command going up.\n  Second, a very important prophylactic measure: Anytime the Attorney \nGeneral should reject the request of the special counsel--to subpoena \nsomeone or bring someone to a grand jury or file some charges--a report \nhas to be made to Congress. That is an extremely important and \nprophylactic measure.\n  Third, special counsel, when they have been appointed--and by the \nway, Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski, people like them, fell under a \nlaw very similar to the President's special counsel law because that \nwas before the independent counsel was allowed and after 1999. After it \nexpired, Justice passed this regulation allowing special counsel again. \nBut they have stature. They are not going to be pushed around. Everyone \nwill see who is appointed.\n  Obviously, if the Attorney General should appoint someone who doesn't \nhave the stature, doesn't have the political independence, they will \nnot be given the respect that someone of stature and independence \nwould. But because it is public, that is generally what happens. A \nWarren Rudman or a John Danforth or a George Mitchell or a Sam Nunn \nwould be ideal type candidates as independent counsel.\n  Let me show an example. This is the point to which I want people to \npay attention. We just had an example of why we need a special counsel. \nThis was reported, as I am told, by Mr. McClellan. We learned this \nmorning that the White House Counsel, Mr. Gonzales, had sent an e-mail \nto all White House employees to preserve all their records, their logs, \ntheir e-mails and things like that. It was a good thing to do.\n  But what Mr. McClellan just confirmed is that he was asked by the \nJustice Department to do it last night. He said: Can I wait until the \nmorning? And the Justice Department said yes.\n  Did anything happen between last night and this morning? I don't \nknow. Nobody knows. You can be sure, if it was a special counsel, that \nability to delay for several hours the sending out of this very \nimportant e-mail wouldn't have happened, or it only would have happened \nwith an extremely good reason.\n\n  But when you don't have a special counsel, when the White House \nCounsel makes the request, it is given the benefit of the doubt. \nFrankly, at least from the allegations we hear the White House Counsel \nis in the same place as the person or persons who did this dastardly \nact. So if there was ever an example of why we need a special counsel, \nit just came out when Mr. McClellan told us about this delay in sending \nout the e-mail. For all we know, and this is just hypothetical, rumors \nwent throughout the White House that there will be an e-mail this \nmorning--and this is just hypothetical and, hopefully, it didn't \nhappen--but maybe that somebody who did it didn't save what they were \nsupposed to save, inadvertently threw them out. Who knows?\n  Again, if the special counsel were there, it is likely not to have \nhappened. And if it did happen that the delay was sanctioned, people \nwould have more faith that there was a justification for it.\n  So we need a special counsel. It is not a perfect mechanism, but it \nis the only mechanism available that has some semblance of \nindependence, of fairness. Along with my 15 cosponsors, we are \nrequesting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that that be done.\n  I remind my colleagues, this is a sense of the Senate. It is \nbasically a\n\n[[Page S12163]]\n\nsense of the Senate that in a very real sense says: Do you want to get \nto the bottom of this, and do you want to do it fairly and not \npolitically? It doesn't require it to happen.\n  Excuse me, we have now 22 cosponsors.\n  It doesn't require it to happen, but at least we go on record, this \nbody, as saying there ought to be a full, fair, and independent \ninvestigation--and a fearless investigation, I would add, an \ninvestigation that will go wherever it leads.\n  I repeat, I have no idea who did this. There are names bandied about. \nIf it is true that six people in the media were called, this is not \ngoing to be a top secret, even though the media people will not want to \nreveal that they were called because of their sources. But a special \ncounsel should be able to get to the bottom of it. Any counsel should \nbe able to get to the bottom of it if, A, they really want to; B, they \ndon't fear getting to the bottom of it; and, C, they are not told by \nsomebody else not to, subtly or otherwise.\n  I guess that is another point I would make. What this case is about \nin many ways--not every way, there are so many ramifications to it \nalready--the reason it has resonance is not only that what was done was \ndespicable, but it relates to a methodology in Washington that has \nbecome too current lately, which is knee-capping people with whom you \ndon't agree instead of having an open debate, saying you think this; I \nthink that; let's see what the people decide. To call into question \ntheir character or patriotism or anything else--we have seen that in \nmany different areas in the last year or two.\n  So it has tremendous resonance, but ultimately one thing this is \nabout is the ability to tell the truth without being hurt for telling \nthat truth, hurt professionally. Isn't that, indeed, the reason we need \na special counsel? If there is a career diplomat in the Justice \nDepartment who is doing this investigation, maybe he or she, even if \ntold nothing, will say: Hey, if I bring this all the way to the top \nwhere I think it ought to go, it might hurt my career. Who knows? With \nthe special counsel, if it were a John Danforth or a Sam Nunn, they \nwould not worry about their career. Their integrity is rock ribbed, and \nthey will take it where it leads.\n\n  I hope we will allow a vote on this amendment. I don't know what the \nother side is afraid of, or whoever is afraid, to not allow a vote on \nthis amendment. It is a simple sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and I \nwould argue it will be more foretelling if this amendment is being \nblocked from being voted on. It will be very revealing if this \namendment is blocked because it is saying somebody, somewhere, is \nafraid of where this investigation would lead.\n  I think if a point of order is raised and not overturned in any way, \nthen--I guess it cannot be overturned. If the point of order is raised \nand a vote is prohibited, it is going to say something. It is going to \nsay those who raise the point of order are afraid of where the truth \nmay lead. That is one of the things we all worry about.\n  Once again, I say to my colleagues that the very fact that the e-mail \nwhich went out this morning was asked for last night, and delayed for \nseveral hours, raises questions. They may be answered; they may not be. \nBut that is the kind of question that will come up every day in an \ninvestigation if we do not have a special counsel.\n  I thank my colleagues from South Dakota and California and the so \nmany others who spoke this morning--the Senators from Nevada, Iowa, and \nFlorida.\n  All I can say is for the sake of this country, for the sake of \nfairness, and for the sake of the continuing rebuilding and the \nviability of our intelligence services, I hope this amendment passes. I \nhope no one will block it on a parliamentary procedure called ``a point \nof order.'' I hope we will get to the bottom of this dastardly act and \nfind out who put the integrity of the intelligence services and \npossibly the lives of people on the line for simply the purpose of \nmalice or the purpose of preventing the truth from coming out.\n  I am going to yield as much time as he would like to my colleague \nfrom Illinois, a member of the Intelligence Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Schumer for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  This is not a new issue. This article was written by columnist Robert \nNovak back in July. It is interesting at the end of September and the \nbeginning of October that it finally surfaces and is receiving the \nattention it deserves.\n  What Senator Schumer is asking is for the Senate to go on record in \ncalling on the Bush administration to appoint a special prosecutor, \nsomeone who will be independent enough to ask the hard questions and \ntry to find out who was the source of this very serious security leak.\n  Keep in mind what happened here. A decision was made by someone in \nthe administration--perhaps in the White House--to disclose the \nidentity of a woman working for one of our intelligence agencies. In \nand of itself, it doesn't sound like much to an outsider. But for many \nof the people working for those intelligence agencies in a covert \nstatus, the fact that their identity is not known is an important part \nof their job and an important part of their survival. As a result, the \ndisclosure of the identity of such a person is a Federal felony, the \nmost serious crime you can commit. We believe it undermines our \nintelligence-gathering capability and can literally endanger the lives \nof innocent, hard-working, patriotic Americans to knowingly disclose \ntheir identity. In this case, a decision was made within the Bush \nadministration to disclose the identity of this woman and jeopardize \nher future, her career, and maybe even her life. That is as serious as \nit gets in this business.\n  We can remember back in the Nixon administration the enemies list \nthat was generated--people the Nixon administration decided did not \nshare their views on foreign policy or domestic policy. They made a \nlong list of columnists and individuals across America who were their \nenemies. They looked for ways to hurt them.\n\n  In this situation, we have the equivalent of an enemies list in the \nBush administration--a decision by someone at the highest level of the \nadministration to declare that Ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife were \nenemies and at any cost they had to be silenced; they had to be \nstopped. What was the administration trying to silence? They were \ntrying to silence the fact that they sent Ambassador Joe Wilson, a \nformer Ambassador in the Clinton administration, on a special detailed \nassignment to determine whether some of the statements the \nadministration had made about the dangers of Iraq were true, \nparticularly the statement which was made in the President's State of \nthe Union Address that there had been fissile material that could be \nused to make nuclear weapons sent from the tiny African nation of Niger \nto Iraq.\n  Of course, the reason that was important was because it was the first \nissue raised by the Bush administration as to why we had to invade \nIraq. If they had nuclear weapons and the capacity to build them in \nshort order, they would be a threat not only to the region and to the \nworld, and so we had to stop Saddam Hussein in his tracks.\n  Evidence of the movement of this enriched uranium or fissile material \nfrom Africa to Iraq was critical. The President of the United States \nthought it was so important that he made reference to it in his State \nof the Union Address to the American people.\n  When Ambassador Joe Wilson was sent to Africa and began \ninvestigating, he returned and reported to the Bush administration they \nwere wrong. In his estimation, there was no evidence that this ever \ntook place. In fact, as I stand here today, President Bush has \napologized to the American people for including this statement in his \nState of the Union Address, and there is literally no evidence that \nthis took place.\n  Ambassador Wilson did his job, took his assignment for the Bush \nadministration, did it honorably, and came back and reported to them \nwhat he found. But there were some people in this administration who \ndidn't like his report. They didn't want to know the facts. They had \nalready created a scenario of nuclear weapons, and Joe Wilson's report \nwasn't consistent with it. They went forward and allowed this unproven \ntheory to fester and grow as they started talking about the danger of \nIraq to the world.\n\n[[Page S12164]]\n\n  Finally, Ambassador Joe Wilson, in desperation, published an article \nin a leading newspaper and said, I have to tell the truth. I went to \nAfrica on an assignment from the Bush administration. What I found was \ninconsistent with what they said to the American people.\n  This was an amazing development--an amazing disclosure. But I met \nwith Ambassador Wilson, and he felt he had no other choice. His \nintegrity was on the line. He decided to tell the truth to the American \npeople. But because he did and because that truth brought embarrassment \nto this administration, they struck back. But they didn't strike at \nAmbassador Joe Wilson. They went after his wife, a professional \nintelligence agent working in a covert capacity. That is what this is \nall about.\n  Who was behind this? I don't know. I do not know if it reaches to the \nWhite House. I can't say. Mr. Novak has only said ``administration \nsources.'' But what Senator Schumer brings to the floor today to really \nconfront is the fact that we cannot honestly expect Attorney General \nJohn Ashcroft to really treat this case in the manner it deserves to be \ntreated for the good of our intelligence gathering, for the integrity \nof the people who work at those agencies and, frankly, for justice to \nbe served.\n\n  Last year when I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee and \nthere was a disclosure of some classified information, Vice President \nCheney and Secretary Rumsfeld were adamant and vocal that the leaking \nof classified information, particularly in the runup to the war in \nIraq, was absolutely intolerable and unacceptable. No one questions \nthat premise. I certainly don't, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee. When this piece of information was leaked, they turned on \nthe Intelligence Committee and said we want to know which Senator--\nassuming it was a Senator, and it could have been staff or someone \nelse, for that matter--which Senator leaked the information.\n  Do you know what they did next? They sent an FBI agent to my office \nand to the office of every Senator on the Intelligence Committee--this \nAshcroft Department of Justice and the Bush administration. They asked \nme if I would submit to a polygraph--a lie detector--to determine \nwhether I was the one who leaked the information. I didn't leak the \ninformation. But I also feel, as most people do across America, that \nthose polygraphs are notoriously inaccurate. Most States don't even \nrecognize them in their courts. I have never counseled a client in my \nlegal practice to take one. I just do not think they can be trusted.\n  I said no, I am not going to submit to a polygraph. The next thing \nyou know is that in the course of my reelection campaign it was \ndisclosed to the public that I had turned down the request of the FBI \nagent for a polygraph test. I explained it as best I could to the \npeople of Illinois. They obviously accepted it, and gave me a chance to \nserve again in the Senate.\n  But isn't it interesting that this Bush administration and their \nDepartment of Justice, which obviously believes so passionately in \npolygraph tests, now is in a predicament where if they are going to \ninvestigate this leak, if they are going to try to find out which \nperson in the administration is responsible for calling Robert Novak \nand disclosing this, they are frankly going to be in a position where \nthey have to ask for polygraph tests.\n  You have to ask the obvious question. Is Attorney General John \nAshcroft willing to ask Karl Rove to submit to a polygraph and tell the \npeople whether he says yes or no? You could go through the list of \npotential people from the administration who need to be asked. I think \nthe answer is obvious. They are not going to do that. Attorney General \nAshcroft is not likely to ever do that.\n  What Senator Schumer and myself and others are saying is now is the \ntime to acknowledge the obvious. This administration is not up to the \ntask of dealing with such a disclosure so sensitive and so important at \nthe highest level of Government. It is time to give this responsibility \nto a special prosecutor, someone outside the administration, with no \nconflict of interest.\n  I will tell you, I did not think the day would come, or come soon, \nwhen I would come to the Senate floor and call for a special \nprosecutor. The gross abuse of independent prosecutors during the \nClinton era really, I guess, satisfied me once and for all that you \nhave to be extremely careful to put that much power in one individual. \nBut I do not know any other way out here.\n  I cannot imagine that leaving this in the hands of Attorney General \nAshcroft and the Department of Justice is really going to give us a \nsatisfactory conclusion to these critical and important questions: Who \nwas it who decided to put Ambassador Wilson's wife on this hit list, on \nthis enemies list? Who was it who was willing to risk prosecution of a \nFederal felony to embarrass her and compromise her as an analyst or an \nagent for America? Who was the person who decided that all bets were \noff and no holds were barred when it came to going after critics of the \nadministration?\n  Those are hard, tough questions, questions this President would not \nwant to face, no President would want to face, and certainly questions \nnot likely asked or answered if it is going to be done within the \nadministration.\n  So I certainly support my colleague from New York. I join with others \nwho believe the appointment of a special prosecutor is the only way to \nserve the needs of justice and to do it in a way where there is a \ncredible outcome.\n\n\n                       Lost Jobs And The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask, if I may, to step aside from this \nparticular issue for a moment and note the fact that the President of \nthe United States visited Chicago, IL, today. We were happy to see the \nPresident, whatever the circumstances. In this case, he came to raise \nmoney. Over $3 million was raised in Chicago for his campaign. But I \nmight also note that over 3 million jobs have been lost in America \nunder his administration. Both of these are historic records for \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  The real question that presents itself is this: Can all the money \nraised in Chicago and other places to buy media make America forget all \nthose lost jobs? Can $3 million raised today in Chicago make America \nforget the 3 million lost jobs under the Bush administration? More jobs \nhave been lost by this President than any other President since the \nGreat Depression--70 years ago. It is the worst record of job creation \nunder any President in modern history.\n  In Illinois, we know this too well. Working people in Illinois are \nnot going to forget we have lost 200,000-plus jobs since President Bush \nwas sworn in. And I just met with a group of small businesses, small \nmanufacturers. They are not going to forget we have lost over 123,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in my State of Illinois alone since President Bush \ntook office.\n  Our taxpayers in my State are not going to forget that President \nBush's unfunded school mandates in No Child Left Behind are going to \ncost our school districts millions of dollars at a time when they \nliterally cannot afford it because of our State's financial crisis.\n  Also, I do not think there will be a family in America who will \nforget the costly and dangerous occupation of Iraq, which President \nBush has obligated American families and taxpayers to bear. I do not \nthink there is enough spin in Washington or enough dollars in the \nPresident's campaign coffers to cover up these realities.\n  So, Mr. President, thank you for visiting Chicago. I am sure you had \na great day. But I think the total story is going to be considered by \nthe voters in Illinois before the next election. And when they look at \nthe economic record of this administration, they are going to realize \nwe have squandered a great opportunity. The economic expansion of the 8 \nyears before President Bush came to office has not been equaled or \nrivaled, and it is not likely to be in the future, as long as we have a \nPresident who is passing out tax cuts to wealthy people and generating \nthe largest deficits in the history of the United States, causing us to \ncut back in education spending and health care spending, causing us to \ncompromise the Social Security trust fund as the baby boomers come on \nline to receive their checks.\n\n  These are the realities that American families understand. And when \nthis President----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I was wondering if the Senator would yield \nfor a question.\n\n[[Page S12165]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be more than glad to when I have finished. On \nyour time, I would be happy to answer a question.\n\n\n                  The Supplemental Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. President, the other point I would like to make, before we return \nto the issue at hand, is this: People say, What has happened? It seems \nas if there is more criticism of the Bush administration in the last \nfew weeks. And I think that is true. I think once the President went on \nnational TV and announced that $87 billion pricetag for our continued \npresence and occupation of Iraq, the American people were awakened to \nreality. This $87 billion pricetag is a bone in the throat of America's \ntaxpayers and families. They understand that we are not cutting \nspending or raising taxes to come up with that money; we are, in fact, \nadding to the deficit--the biggest deficit in our history--and we are \ntaking it out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  I, for one--and I am sure I speak for every Senator--will not \ncompromise when it comes to our military. We will give them every \nsingle dollar they need to be successful and come home safely.\n  When it comes to spending billions of dollars in Iraq to do things \nwhich we obviously cannot do, according to the President of the United \nStates, hard questions will be asked, and the hardest question is going \nto be posed by my colleague from the State of North Dakota, Senator \nByron Dorgan. I think he has really touched a nerve because he has \nreminded this administration that time and again they told us this day \nwould never come, that Iraq was so bountiful in its oil reserves that \nit could finance its own reconstruction. Those are statements made by \nVice President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld, Assistant Secretary \nWolfowitz; the list goes on and on.\n  Now they come to us and say they need $20 billion that is going to \nrebuild Iraq. Well, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, raised the \nquestion earlier. It is clear that the money to rebuild Iraq is going \nto be borrowed. The question is, From whom will it be borrowed? From \nthe American people or the Iraqi people?\n  I agree with Senator Dorgan. Let's take this bountiful oil supply \nthat they have in Iraq and use that as security, as collateral for what \nthey need to rebuild their country. We can help them. I am sure we \nwill. But, honestly, shouldn't the Iraqi people and their future oil \nrevenues be on the line before our Social Security trust fund and \nour investments in education and health care? It is fairly obvious to \nme and to many of the people I represent.\n\n  Let me conclude and say again to Senator Schumer, thank you for your \nleadership on calling for this special prosecutor. It is my belief that \na special prosecutor at this point is the only way to make sure that \njustice is served. If we have in any way seen a compromise of \nintelligence gathering in the United States, it could not have come at \na worse time.\n  If we are going to successfully fight the war on terrorism, we have \nto stand behind the men and women at those intelligence agencies. We \nhave to support them. And in my oversight capacity with the \nIntelligence Committee, from time to time I am sure I will be critical \nof some of the things they will do, but we should never, ever \ncompromise their identity or professional integrity or ability to do \ntheir job.\n  Whoever decided to leak the identity of Ambassador Wilson's wife to \nRobert Novak, who writes a regular column, decided that the political \nprice they had to pay was worth it. They were going to make that family \npay a price that few others would be asked to pay because they were so \nbold as to criticize this administration's policy in Iraq. We have to \nget to the bottom of it. And I do not think Attorney General John \nAshcroft's Department of Justice is up to that job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nby Senator Schumer have added to it as cosponsors Senators Lieberman \nand Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois said he would \nrespond to a question on my time. And I will ask him a question and \nyield him 30 seconds to respond. It should not even take that long. But \nsince the Senator from Illinois wandered during his presentation on to \nground other than the actual amendment before us, specifically the \nissue of education, I was wondering when the Senator from Illinois \nintends to offer his motion to deny the children of Washington the \nopportunity to get a fair and reasonable education--something that is \nsupported by the Mayor of this city, something that is supported by the \npresident of the school council in the city, something that is \nsupported by 7,500 children who are on a waiting list to get a decent \neducation.\n  When does the Senator from Illinois intend to offer his motion to \nstrike the capacity of those children to get a decent education?\n  I yield to the Senator, oh, 10 seconds to answer that question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It will take 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask the Senator to clarify. Is he speaking about \nthe proposal to divert public funds to private schools, a proposal that \nhas been rejected by an overwhelming majority of people in the District \nof Columbia, the school board, and the city council, the proposal that \nwould send the money to schools without standards that the teachers in \nthese private schools even have college degrees? Is that the proposal \nabout which the Senator is asking?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am simply asking if the Senator ever intends to offer \nhis motion to strike.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The answer is yes, I do intend to offer it.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator intend to offer it today?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not today, but I intend to offer it.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator intend to offer it tomorrow?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It could be tomorrow.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's candor.\n  Mr. President, what is the time that is allowed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the amendment has 8 minutes 6 \nseconds. The opponents of the amendment have 58 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I ask the Chair to advise me when 3 minutes remain.\n  Mr. President, after I went home last evening, I couldn't stop \nthinking about a statement Senator Harkin had made regarding the leak \nof classified information about the identity of an undercover CIA \nagent. Like Senator Harkin, I also remember as a boy seeing those signs \nthat warned: Loose lips sink ships. Our Nation was at war then. Even \nthough the war was far away, every citizen was constantly reminded that \nthere might be spies among us and that the wrong information in the \nwrong hands could cost American lives. So here it is, 67 years later. \nOnce again we are at war and, sadly, it seems that the wrong \ninformation has been passed into the wrong hands--not by our enemies \nbut by someone who works at the White House.\n  By now I think we are all familiar with what happened. On July 14, \nthe political columnist Robert Novak, who I consider a friend and like \nvery much, disclosed the identity of a covert CIA operative. He wrote \nthat the information was given to him by ``two senior administration \nofficials.'' Yesterday the Washington Post reported that before Mr. \nNovak's column appeared, two top White House officials had called at \nleast six journalists, revealing the name of this undercover CIA agent.\n  The reason, of course, for the leak has been well established. It was \nto get back at the husband of the agent. He is Joseph C. Wilson, former \nU.S. Ambassador, who had publicly challenged President Bush's claim \nthat Iraq tried to purchase uranium from Africa. In retaliation for Mr. \nWilson's telling the truth as he saw it, two White House officials \napparently blew his wife's cover and, in the process, they threatened \nour national security. If you think that is overreacting, remember the \nold warning: Loose lips sink ships. Because that information was \nleaked, this agent's ability to gather intelligence has been destroyed \nand her safety has been put at risk.\n  Even more important, the leak of that sensitive information has \njeopardized the safety of every person in the\n\n[[Page S12166]]\n\nworld who had cooperated with her. Any person who was a known associate \nof this agent will now be suspected of cooperating with the CIA. Maybe \neven some innocent friend would be so thought. We might never know how \nmany people have been tortured or maybe killed as a result of this \nleak.\n  As terrible as that scenario is, it is not the worst consequence of \nthis leak. This leak of classified information will undermine our \nefforts to recruit people who can help us in the war on terrorism, \npeople who might be able to infiltrate terrorist cells and gain prior \nknowledge of deadly plots against our Nation. Because of this leak, \npeople who might be inclined to pass information along to the United \nStates will now wonder whether we can be trusted to protect their \nidentity. After all, if they can't trust those who work in the White \nHouse, who can they trust.\n  We are at war against terrorism. It is a war that will not be won \nwith our mighty arsenal of weapons. It is a war we can only win by \nobtaining good intelligence about the plots that these terrorists are \nhatching. Intelligence is our best weapon against terrorism. So loose \nlips not only sink ships, they might prevent us from stopping a future \nterrorist plot.\n  This is as serious as it gets. I used the word ``traitor'' yesterday \nin a colloquy with Senator Harkin. I know that is strong language, but \nI believe that about anyone who would leak this kind of sensitive \ninformation at a time when we are at war. This is a crime. It is a \nfelony punishable by 10 years in prison.\n  This morning we heard that the Justice Department has launched an \ninvestigation into this crime. Realistically, we not only have to do \naway with what is bad but what looks bad. To have John Ashcroft, former \nSenator, longtime political confidant of the President doing this \ninvestigation simply won't sell. Considering the grave nature of what \nhas happened, this case warrants an independent counsel, a special \ncounsel, someone who does not have political ties to the White House. \nIf we need an independent counsel to investigate a private real estate \ndeal, certainly a breach of national security deserves the same level \nof scrutiny. We must act quickly before memos and phone logs and \ncomputer records are destroyed.\n  We must find the source of this leak and send a message to everyone \neverywhere who betray the United States: Loose lips sink ships, and \nthey will land you in jail.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have cosponsored the Schumer sense-of-\nthe-Congress amendment which is before the Senate. The amendment calls \nupon the Attorney General to appoint an independent special counsel to \ninvestigate allegations that a high ranking official or officials \nwithin the Bush administration purposely disclosed to the media the \nidentity of a CIA agent involved in clandestine operations.\n  If these allegations are true, they are extremely serious. In fact, \nthe individual or individuals who provided this information to the \nmedia may well have committed a felony under federal law. Such a \ndisclosure could endanger the CIA operative involved, former Ambassador \nJoseph Wilson's wife, and makes it impossible for her to continue to \nfunction as a clandestine CIA operative. This act could also endanger a \nnumber of individuals, assets, contacts and even mere acquaintances of \nthe CIA operative. And, this act may send a cold shiver down the spine \nof every CIA employee and asset now operating under cover anywhere in \nthe world. If the administration itself will not safeguard their \nidentities, how can they feel secure? These are men and women playing \nabsolutely critical roles in the defense of our national security. The \nrole in our security of such individuals gathering intelligence around \nthe world has been all the more clear since September 11, 2001.\n  Mr. President, this amendment seeks to send a clear message that we \nbelieve that the American people deserve a credible and independent \ninvestigation not influenced by or even weakened by the perception of \ninfluence which results from an appointee of the President \ninvestigating high level administration officials. An appointment of a \nspecial counsel of unquestioned integrity and credibility is the only \nway to assure that independence. I hope the majority will permit a vote \non this sense-of-the-Congress amendment today and that the Senate will \nadopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 58 minutes. \nThe proponent of the motion has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we know that the time will just run out. \nSenator Schumer wanted to speak last. He is not here. So we have no \nalternative. If the Senator is going to yield back his time, there is \nno way to preserve our 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are ready to proceed. If we can have the \nclock run equally against both sides, I ask unanimous consent that that \noccur until the minority's time has run out, and then we will make a \nmotion, unless the minority wishes to yield back.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, because of the time constraints, I ask \nunanimous consent that a point of order not be taken in this matter and \nthat we have an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. That is really too bad. I say that because it would seem \nthat something this important to the American public should at least \nhave an up-or-down vote. All we want is a resolution from this body \nsaying it is appropriate that the Attorney General, in effect, recuse \nhimself and assign a special prosecutor to look into this most serious \nmatter.\n  There is no question that somebody committed a crime. We don't know \nwho it is or who they were, but leaking this information is a crime. It \nis a felony punishable by at least 10 years in prison. I think it is \nunfair. We know that Senate rules often don't appear to be fair. But in \nthis instance, it would certainly be the right thing to do to allow an \nup-or-down vote.\n  I yield back whatever time we have.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is being investigated by the FBI. It \nis not being investigated by the Attorney General. The FBI will be \ndoing the legwork and we will find out what happened as a result. \nClearly, if the allegations are correct that a crime has occurred, it \nshould be prosecuted.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I make a point \nof order that the amendment is not germane to the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the point of \norder not be laid before the Senate until 3:45 and Senator Schumer at \nthat time be allowed 5 minutes prior to the point of order being taken.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The point of order has \nbeen made. The amendment is not germane. The point of order is \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The DC appropriations bill is the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair. I want to return to the underlying \nbill, a bill that has been debated for 4 or 5 days. Regrettably, I was \nnot able to be here.\n  Returning to the underlying issue, which is the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill, and specifically the language in that bill which \ncreated new dollars at the request of the Mayor and the president of \nthe school board and members of the school council to fund three basic \nprograms, one is school improvement, the second is charter schools, and \nthe third is a choice program which would involve not only public but \nalso private schools within the city. Unfortunately, I was not here for \nall the debate, but it is important to talk about who is being \nimpacted.\n  Who is this debate really about? The District of Columbia has a very \nlarge school system. Unfortunately, it is one that has some very \nfundamental problems. Those problems have created an atmosphere where, \nregrettably, a large number of children cannot get a decent education. \nIn fact, this picture highlights it. Statistics show that 47 out of 100 \nchildren are being sent to failure by being required to go through the \nentire public school system in Washington, DC.\n  Essentially, the public school system in Washington spends a huge \namount of\n\n[[Page S12167]]\n\nmoney, but regrettably it doesn't educate kids very well. Seventy-five \npercent of the fourth graders in this city are reading below basic \nreading levels. Only 11 percent of the eighth graders in this city are \nproficient in math. That is 1 in 10, actually. Only 10 percent of the \neighth graders in this city are proficient in reading. One in ten \nchildren in this city can actually read at the level at which they \nshould be. And 42 percent--a staggering number--drop out of school in \nWashington. Over one-third of the District residents read below the \nthird grade level.\n  Yet this school system spends $11,000 per child--$11,000 per child--\nfor these results: 42 percent of the kids are dropping out of school, 1 \nin 10 children are not reading at the levels their peers read at across \nthe country in the eighth grade, and almost 1 in 10 are not able to do \nmath. That means if you go into the DC school system, you have at least \na 50-percent chance of either, A, not coming out of the system or, B, \nif you come out, you are not going to be able to participate in the \nAmerican dream.\n  A fundamental element of participating in the American dream, being \nsuccessful, having a decent income, raising a family, owning a home, \nhaving a great job, is your ability to read, write, and do basic \nmathematics. So we are talking about kids being left behind.\n\n  Let me just point to a couple specific children. These are children \nwho, without private school, would not have had the opportunity to \nsucceed.\n  How did they get into private school if there is no private school \nchoice program in the District of Columbia? There is something called \nthe Washington Scholarship Fund which is a program that has been set up \nbecause they recognized that Washington schools were working so poorly, \nand they have a lottery system. If you are a low-income child in \nWashington, your parents can put you into this lottery system. If your \nname is drawn, you get a choice--basically the same program that we are \nproposing to fund with this bill. But that waiting list is so large \nthat your chance of being picked--in other words, winning that lottery \nas a child in Washington--is only 1 in 10. For every child who gets \nchosen, 10 don't.\n  I want to read a couple of notes from two people who were chosen, who \nwere unfortunately locked into the public school system, and their \nparents knew they were going to fail. Their parents knew if they stayed \nin the public school system as presently structured, they were going to \nbe lost souls, lost as citizens of our country, productive citizens, \nbecause they were not going to be able to gain the skills they needed.\n  This is the first person I want to read about. This is a note from \nthis young girl in the photo, Lapria Johnson. She writes:\n\n       The Washington School Scholarship Foundation is the only \n     way I can read.\n\n  That is the group that has the lottery.\n\n       I am 8 years old. I have a lot of problems I was born with. \n     Public schools said I would not read.\n\n  This is Lapria writing:\n\n       I read and my math is great. My handwriting is not so good, \n     but I have an A in reading and an A in math.\n\n  She has had her hope restored as a result of having the opportunity \nof choice.\n  There is another group that I want to make a note of in the photo \nright behind me. This is Kevin and Kevona. That is who these two \nchildren are here in the photo. This is Mrs. Wilma Roberts writing, and \nthese are her husband's niece and nephew. She is writing and saying:\n\n       We wanted them to have a chance to advance to greater \n     heights. Kevin was put into special education, and all he \n     needed was help with his speech. He was put in a school that \n     did not help with speech or his emotional growth. The \n     Washington Scholarship Fund has been a godsend for these and \n     other children who have the potential to do good things with \n     their lives.\n\n  Doesn't that really say it all? ``The potential to do good things \nwith their lives.'' Yet 47 out of every 100 kids who go into the \nWashington school system--their capacity to do good things with their \nlives is dramatically undermined by the fact that the school system \nthey are in simply isn't working very well.\n  How do we react to this? How do we make sure the Laprias, the Kevins, \nand Kevonas of this city have a shot at a lifestyle that you and I \nwould want our children to have?\n  Well, the Mayor is concerned about it, and the head of the school \nboard is concerned about it. They are concerned enough that they were \nwilling to take an extremely imaginative and creative and, politically, \na very aggressive and dangerous step, from the standpoint of their \npolitical futures. They were willing to propose to the Congress, which \nhas a unique responsibility for the District of Columbia, that if we \nwould give them some extra money for their educational system, they \nwould take that money and set up three very creative programs.\n\n  The first program would be a school improvement program. The second \nwould be a program to help with the creation of charter schools, which \nthey already have a significant number of in this city. The third would \nbe a private school choice program patterned basically on the \nWashington Scholarship Fund Program that these three children have had \na chance to take advantage of.\n  Why would the Mayor and the head of the school board and a number of \nthe council members of this city who are responsible to their citizenry \nbe willing to make that sort of a step? It is because they believe it \nwill work for these kids. It is because they believe these kids should \nhave a shot at the American dream by having the skills they need to \nsucceed, by having the ability to do math and writing and reading at a \nlevel that is competitive with their peers across the country. They \nrecognize that not every child learns the same.\n  There are some schools that are going to help a Lapria or a Kevin, \nwho is coded incorrectly for special education, it appears from that \nstatement. Some of those schools are not publicly managed so they can \nhelp these kids. But they are there and they are in the private sector.\n  The opportunity should be given to these children to participate in \nthose schools that are going to give them the skills they need. And so \nthe Mayor, the head of the school board, and a number of city council \nmembers have come forward and asked for the funding proposal that is in \nthis bill, and the subcommittee is chaired by the Senator from Ohio, \nMr. DeWine. You would think it would be almost a no-brainer that if we \nas a Congress, who do not manage the city of the District of Columbia \nbut who by the nature of the Constitution have responsibility for it, \nare approached by the political leadership, which is taking this sort \nof a creative and imaginative step, that we would say, OK, that is an \nidea that you want to try, and we will do what we can to assist you.\n  The majority does take that position but, unfortunately, there is a \nworking minority on the other side of the aisle that does not believe \nthese kids should have a chance, that does not believe the Mayor and \nthe head of the school board should run their school system, that \nbelieves the 7,500 children who are low-income children, who are on a \nlist today for private school choice, should have no opportunity to \nfulfill their dream; that they should have to go every year to this \ngathering where 1 in 10 of those kids gets their name pulled out of the \nhat and the other 9 children are sent home in tears and their parents, \nin most instances--by the way, they are children of single moms. They \nobviously have a father, but the mother is managing the family.\n  In most instances, what we have is a mother who realizes that her \nchild, who she is raising by herself--she is working gosh knows how \nmany hours a week to do it--is not going to have a chance to succeed \nand get out of the cycle of poverty and dislocation she sees, because \nof the nature of her financial situation or the nature of her situation \ngenerally, without a better chance in education. It is usually that \nsingle mother who puts her child on that list.\n  The majority of those 7,500 children are children who have a single \nparent at home taking care of them and trying to raise them in very \ntough and challenging times. We have to admire those parents immensely. \nBut those 7,500 kids are being assigned to failure by my colleagues \nacross the aisle.\n  I suppose one could argue--and obviously my colleagues across the \naisle\n\n[[Page S12168]]\n\ndo--this is not right; that public schools should get all the money; \nthat there should not be any competition between public and private \nschools; and that choice just simply should not be allowed; that we as \nthe Federal Government should not be making that type of decision. One \ncan make that argument in theory, but one cannot make it as it applies \nto the District of Columbia because we are responsible for the District \nof Columbia, and the leadership of the District of Columbia has come to \nus and said they want this program.\n  Basically, they are saying no vote on this language; they are not \nallowing us to proceed to a vote. They are filibustering this proposal \nbecause they do not have the votes to defeat it. When our Democratic \ncolleagues run a filibuster from across the aisle, they are essentially \nsaying they can run the city of Washington better than the Mayor can \nrun it, better than the city council can run it, better than the \npresident of the school board can run it, and these kids who are on \nthis waiting list--and there would be a lot more, I suspect, if this \nprogram were to go forward--are just casualties of the politics of the \nSenate. Tough luck. Forty Senators on the other side of the aisle are \nsaying to 7,500 kids: Tough luck, we have a good life in the Senate. \nYou have no life, no chance to participate in the American dream. You \ncertainly have no chance to become a Senator because we are going to \nconsign you to a school system which, as far as your parents are \nconcerned, because they made the choice to put you on the list to opt \nfor choice, cannot take care of your need to learn and is not going to \ngive you the capacity to be successful.\n  It is an incredibly cynical act that is being pursued in the Senate \nby a minority when this appropriations bill is being filibustered on \nthis point.\n  One has to admire, though, the leadership of this city because the \nMayor has been incredibly aggressive in making this case. There has \nbeen no halfway commitment. This has not been a marginal undertaking on \nhis part. He has been calling Members. He has been making the case. And \nthe city has tried what they can try. They have tried public school \nchoice in this city. To some degree it has worked. In some instances, \nthere are just not enough functioning, strong schools to allow those \nkids who are locked in schools that do not do very well the opportunity \nto make that choice.\n\n  This city has tried charter schools. In fact, probably the fastest \ngrowing part of the school system is the fact they are setting up \ncharter schools throughout the city. Thus, we have parents pulling \ntogether to try to create entities that will work a little better.\n  What they are asking for is one more very important tool. There are a \nlot of private schools in this city. There are a lot of religious \nprivate schools, Catholic especially. There are a lot of nonreligious \nschools that are very good schools. Some of them are focused on unique \ntalent development and some are general in their educational approach. \nWhat the Mayor is saying is let's bring those schools into our mix as \nwe try to give our children a better shot at being successful at \nlearning what they need to know.\n  Remember, this program is not going to be for the wealthy or even the \nmiddle income. The way this program is structured is you have to be in \nan extremely low-income category before you can qualify for these \nchoice opportunities. In fact, the priority goes directly toward low-\nincome kids in schools that have already been designated as failing. We \ndo not limit it to that, but that is where the priority is. I suspect \nthat will absorb completely the available slots. So it is an attempt to \nget at the people who are most in need in the schools that are being \nleast responsive.\n  Yet the majority of Democratic Senators on the other side of the \naisle say: No, no, the kids are not going to be given that chance. The \nkids are going to be forced to stay in these schools which have such \nhorrific track records. It really is a startling level of arrogance and \nan incredible indifference to these children.\n  What drives it? What drives this attitude? Is it a belief that we can \nimprove the schools by putting more money into them? If we just put \nmore money into public schools in Washington, we can solve this \nproblem? We know that is not the case because in the last 3 years, we \nhave increased funding in the public schools in Washington by I think \n39 percent, and we have increased overall funding even more radically \nover the last 8 years in the public schools in Washington. Their \nsuccess rate has not improved at all. In fact, they continue to fall \nbehind.\n  As I said, they spend $11,000 per pupil in this city--$11,000 per \npupil. There isn't a school district in the State of New Hampshire that \nspends $11,000 per pupil, I don't think. The only other school district \nin the country which is even near Washington in spending is New York \nCity on a per-pupil basis. So it is not an issue of let's take this \nextra money and put it in the public school system and that will solve \nthe problem. That can't be where they are coming from, but that is \nactually one of their arguments. But it is a straw dog because it \ndoesn't stand up to any test of factual review.\n  Is it because they think these kids should just be left behind; that \nthey are simply willing to say 47 out of every 100 kids in this city we \ncan discard; we can say they can't have the ability to pursue their \ndreams? I doubt that. I don't think anybody on the other side of the \naisle is so cynical. But that is the practical effect of the \nindifference to the problem and their unwillingness to address it in a \ncreative way such as the Mayor has suggested.\n  Or is it there is force coming at them that is a special-interest \nforce known as big labor that is saying: This is the camel's nose under \nthe tent. If the city of Washington pursues a choice program, will \nchoice spread across the country? We know the leadership of the \nnational unions is adamantly opposed to any form of giving children \nchoice in our school systems.\n  That may be it. There has to be some reason, but it certainly is not \ntheir interest in the welfare of the children that causes them to reach \nthis conclusion that they are going to filibuster this opportunity for \nthese children that is requested by the Mayor, by the president of the \nCity Council, and by the parents of those 7,500 kids who are sitting on \nthat list and are running out of time.\n  Remember, these kids are being put through and pushed through the \nsystem. Every year we fail to give them adequate reading skills, \nadequate math skills, is another year they probably cannot recover. If \na child goes from the third grade to the fourth grade and they cannot \nyet read at the third grade level, how are they going to read at the \nfourth grade level?\n  Every year that we do not allow the city of Washington to pursue for \ntheir children options which may bring them up to speed, we lose \nanother large segment of children, 42 percent dropping out of the \nschool system. It is the parents and the kids who are being left behind \ntoday, who are being filibustered today, who are being strong-armed by \nthe minority today, and it is an act of crassness that is going to come \nback in the way of lost lives. Fortunately, not Lapria or Kevin or his \nsister but individuals such as these other children are going to end up \nwithout any hope because this Senate, and specifically the minority in \nthis Senate, has decided that they know more about the school needs of \nthese kids than the Mayor, than the president of the school board, the \nmembers of the City Council but, most importantly the parents of these \nchildren who have been willing to go make the effort and take the extra \ninitiative of trying to get their kids the type of education to give \nthem the skills they need to live in our country.\n  In my opinion, it is an incredibly cynical act that is occurring \ntoday, as I have mentioned, and I regret it. I hope Members on the \nother side of the aisle will get up, walk over to the mirror in their \noffice, and look in that mirror and say: Why am I doing this to these \nkids? At least as to the city of Washington, they ought to have the \ncourage to stand up and say it is right to give the city this \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New \nHampshire for his remarks and for his leadership on education, \nespecially for his leadership on this issue where he has shown his \ncharacteristic persistence over the years, and I hope he succeeds.\n\n[[Page S12169]]\n\n  Listening to him talk about the children today creates a whole new \nway of thinking about this. I have noticed in education meetings I have \nattended--and I have been going to them now for a good while--people \nlike the Senator from New Hampshire and I get up and make a speech, but \nif we sit down and invite a child to stand up and say something, it \nchanges the whole nature of the meeting because it puts in perspective \nwhat we are talking about.\n  I am glad the Senator talked about the children who are waiting in \nline for this opportunity to go to a better school because that is what \nwe are talking about.\n  All we are talking about is giving 7,500 of Federal dollars, new \ndollars--not taken from any other school but new dollars--to about \n2,000 poor families, disadvantaged families in the Washington, DC, our \nNation's Capital, families whose child is in an underperforming school, \nand giving them a chance to go to another school. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  Especially since September 11, we have talked a lot about the \nAmerican character. The American character has many aspects, but one \naspect of our country is that we dream great dreams, and we are not \nashamed of doing that. We say things like all men are created equal. We \nsay things like President Kennedy said one time, that we will pay any \nprice and bear any burden to defend freedom anywhere in this world. We \nsay things like leave no child behind. We say things like anything is \npossible because that is our goal. Europeans and others think we are a \nlittle goofy when we say things like that because they will say \nobviously we are going to leave some child behind, obviously we are not \ngoing to defend freedom everywhere in the world, obviously not every \nman is created equal. The answer is we know that, but our goal is the \ngreater goal. We really want to help every child succeed. We really \nwant to defend freedom wherever we can. We really want every American \nto be equal, and we are a work in progress toward those goals.\n  That is what makes this such a remarkable country. One of the \ngreatest of our challenges is to meet the goal of anything is \npossible--and I was thinking about those children--one of the surest \ntickets towards success in America, in fact the surest ticket, is a \ngood education.\n  We cannot legislate a good family. Families are varied. But if a \nchild has a great education, that child has a much better chance, to \nnot be left behind but to succeed. So one would think we would be \nbending over backwards, falling all over ourselves, to identify the \nchildren in America who are disadvantaged, who are not as likely to \nhave a good education, and giving them a chance too. That is what one \nwould think we would all be doing.\n  Is that not what we are talking about today? Are we not talking about \nidentifying a couple of thousand kids who are disadvantaged, going to \nschools that are not working, and giving them a chance to go to a good \nschool? What is wrong with that?\n  I would think it would be embarrassing for our friends on the other \nside of the aisle. They have spent a lot of time talking about helping \ndisadvantaged Americans. How can they say it is good for us Senators, \nour families, but we do not want to give these children that chance?\n  In the next few minutes, I will take three or four issues that have \ncome up in the debate, as I have listened to it, and discuss them. The \nfirst one was--When I listened to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois the other day, one of the better debaters in the Senate, as \ndescribed by Senator DeWine. The Senator from Illinois said this, and I \nwrote it down: This is a calamity. This will be the first diversion of \nFederal funds to private schools in our history, the first diversion of \nFederal funds to private schools.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator then, and I will ask today, if I may, I \nwonder if he has ever heard of the University of Loyola or DePaul or \nNorthwestern or Saint Xavier or Wheaton College or Illinois Wesley? \nThose are all private schools, private colleges, in the State of \nIllinois, and at least half the students at all of those schools and \ncolleges attend those colleges with a Federal grant or loan to help pay \nfor college.\n  In the case of the Pell grant, the Federal grant, which may follow \nthem to Loyola, DePaul, Northwestern, or Saint Xavier, that is a \nFederal voucher that follows them to the college of their choice.\n  Now, that is not just true in Illinois. It would be true at Fisk \nUniversity in Nashville. It would be true at Brigham Young out West. It \nwould be true at Yeshiva. As long as the college is accredited, whether \nit is private or parochial. This has been true from the beginning of \nthe GI bill for veterans, over the last 60 years, our country has \nallowed Federal dollars to follow students to a school of their choice.\n  Someone might say I am mixing things up; I am mixing up a college \nwith a high school. I do not think that is a real difference. At the \nUniversity of Tennessee, we have a school of law, as well as a school \nof architecture. Those are schools. They are educational institutions. \nFor 60 years Federal dollars have followed students to the school of \ntheir choice.\n  What has been our experience with that program? Most people who look \nat the Federal Government think the GI bill for veterans and the \nFederal scholarships and loans programs have been the most successful \nsocial legislation in the history of our country. Maybe Social Security \nstands up there with it. But it is hard to think of legislation that \nhas created more opportunity than the GI bill for veterans and the \nFederal Pell grants and the Stafford loans that help people go to \ncollege. No one says you have to go to the University of Tennessee or \nVanderbilt or the University of Rhode Island or any particular school. \nYou choose.\n\n  I remember when I was president of the University of Tennessee, I was \nsitting there during the last week of August when we would have about \n30,000 students, coming to our school. No one made them go there, they \nhad to choose to go there, and the money followed them to the school. \nIt never occurred to me to come to Washington and argue to the Senate, \nPlease don't allow any of these students to go to Vanderbilt or to Fisk \nUniversity because it might take money away from our school. We saw the \nvalue of giving Americans choices of colleges and universities. We saw \nwhat it had done for them.\n  We saw what it did for the colleges and universities of this country, \nwhat it specifically did for the public colleges and universities, such \nas the University of Tennessee. Let's just look at the record. In 1945, \nmaybe 8 or 10 percent of Americans had a college degree. Mr. President, \n80 percent of the higher education students in America at the end of \nWorld War II were in private colleges and universities. In fact, when \nthe GI bill for veterans came along, President Hutchins of the \nUniversity of Chicago was appalled by the idea. He said hoboes would be \ncoming to his distinguished university, the University of Chicago.\n  At that time, at the end of World War II, 20 percent of students \nattended public university. What is it today? Today it is just \nreversed: 80 percent of students who attend higher education in America \ngo to public colleges and universities, 20 percent go to private. So \nthe effect of the GI bill for veterans, this Federal voucher that \nfollowed students to the school of their choice in higher education, \nwhich has been the law of our land since right after World War II, has \nnot only created great opportunity, the effect of it has been to create \nthe greatest system of colleges and universities in America. The \nFederal Government helped to fund that.\n  We don't have just some of the best colleges and universities, we \nhave almost all of them. And the Federal voucher for higher education \nhas been a major source of that. So that was a really good idea.\n  It is rarely our experience in education to have such a close \nanalogy, to have a 60-year experiment with a Federal voucher for \ncolleges that has helped create the best colleges in the world. The \nquestion might be; If it did that over 60 years, why wouldn't we at \nleast try it to see if it created the best schools in the world?\n  We have tried it also before the first grade. We have a child care \nvoucher, which has been the law since 1990. It follows little children \nto the child care program of their parents' choice. So we would trust a \nsingle mom with the responsibility. She might be poor, she\n\n[[Page S12170]]\n\nmight not be very well educated herself, some might even say she's not \ncapable of making a good judgment for her children, but we trust her to \nchoose the daycare program for her child, and the Federal voucher \nfollows the child to the daycare program. It could be public, private, \nor religious. We permit her to enroll in a community college or \nuniversity in order to advance herself, and a Federal voucher follows \nher to a community college. But we say somehow there is something wrong \nwith allowing her to make a decision about where her child goes to \nschool from the 1st grade to the 12th grade.\n  Of course, we don't have that problem with those who are better off--\nSenators, for example. We assume we are really super parents and we \nknow a lot about schools and we are trusted to make choices. We are \nallowed to move to another part of town so our child will go to this \nschool instead of that school, and every real estate agent in America \nwill tell you that parents make moves in housing based upon where their \nchild will go to school. That is No. 1 for them. They have the money to \ndo it. They are free to do it. But the disadvantaged family is not free \nto do it.\n  I wonder what would happen if we were to pass a law that would be \nconsistent with our friends on the other side of the aisle--most of \nthem; there are some who agree with us--and just say there should be no \nchoice to anybody; let's be fair to the rich as well as the poor. It \nsounds like rhetoric that might be coming from over there. Let's say no \nchoice for school, the Government will tell you, no matter how much \nmoney you have, exactly where your child goes to school, and you may \nnot take that child anywhere else. The Government will decide. Since \nyour taking your child and your money to a Catholic school or private \nschool which might hurt a public school, therefore you are not allowed \nto go to a Catholic school or you are not allowed to go to a private \nschool.\n\n  In effect, that is what we are telling poor families in America. We \nare telling them: Because you are poor, you have no choice. Let's say \nit to the rich folks, too. Let's make it equal. Nobody has any choice. \nThat will help the public schools.\n  That wouldn't help the public schools. That is the way the Soviet \nUnion used to operate, one car for everybody, and by the time they got \nthrough, the car would barely run. Choice is an essential part of the \nAmerican system.\n  So, for the Senator from Illinois to stand up and say this is the \nfirst diversion of Federal funds to schools is just flat wrong. In \nfact, he is ignoring the most successful piece of Federal social \nlegislation we have ever had, which for 60 years has helped create the \nbest colleges in the world.\n  My question would be, Why not try it with at least 2,000 children who \nare poor, going to underperforming schools in Washington, DC, and let's \nsee what happens? Maybe it creates a better school.\n  There is another little historical fact that maybe the Senator from \nIllinois missed as well. Right after World War II, a lot of the \nreturning GIs didn't have a high school degree. Only maybe 5 percent of \nthem even had a college degree at the time. So what did they do with \nthe GI bill? They took it to high schools. There were thousands of \nreturning GIs after World War II who took their GI bill to the Catholic \nhigh schools of America. The sky didn't fall. A lot of them ended up \nbeing among the most successful leaders in our country.\n  A second comment I would like to make is sometimes I hear that this \nis a Republican idea, or a conservative idea. It really doesn't sound \nlike a Republican idea. Republicans are characterized sometimes by not \nbeing as interested in the disadvantaged, by not being willing to spend \nmore money, by not wanting to talk about education. I am glad that we \nare, in this case. But this ought to be a bipartisan idea. I am so glad \nto see the Senator from California has made this discussion a \nbipartisan idea because it deserves to be.\n  Let me go back in a little history and suggest how this idea has not \nalways been a Republican or conservative idea. Not long ago, someone \ngave me an article from the 1968 August issue of Psychology Today. The \narticle was entitled ``A Proposal for a Poor Children's Bill of \nRights.'' The proposal was this: To give a Federal coupon to perhaps up \nto 50 percent of American children, through their parents, to be spent \nat any school. Half the American children would get a Federal coupon, \nthey called it--voucher, scholarship--to be spent at any school--\npublic, private, religious.\n  By doing so, the authors of this proposal wrote, we might both create \nsignificant competition among the schools serving the poor--thus \nimproving the school--and meet, in an equitable way, the extra cost of \nteaching the children of the poor.\n  The idea here was to provide money on top of what is already being \nspent, because educating poor children costs more. The authors were not \nthe chairman of the Republic National Committee but a young man named \nTheodore Sizer, along with Phillip Whitten. Ted Sizer, of course, is \ntoday one of America's most respected and pioneering educators. He was \ndean of the College of Education at Brown University and a leader of \nthe Coalition of Essential Schools. He has been given about every major \naward American educators can give anyone, and 1968 was a long time ago. \nLyndon Johnson was President. ``Power of the people'' was the battle \ncry. Sizer and Whitten went back much earlier than that.\n\n  They said this:\n\n       The idea of such tuition grants is not new. For almost two \n     centuries various proposals for the idea have come from such \n     figures as Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, John Stewart Mill, and \n     more recently Milton Friedman. Its appeal bridges ideological \n     differences. Yet it had never been tried. Quite possibly \n     because the need for it has never been so demonstrably \n     critical as now.\n\n  This was in 1968.\n  The authors quoted Mario Santini of the Ford Foundation--hardly a \nright-wing organization--who spoke of:\n\n     . . . a parent's lobby with unprecedented motivation with a \n     tangible grasp on the destiny of their children. The ability \n     to control their own destinies definitely will instill in \n     poor people a necessary pride and dignity of which they have \n     been cheated.\n\n  Maybe those are the 7,000 parents in the District who are lined up \nwaiting for the other side of the aisle to quit filibustering and \nrelease $7,500 for each of those children so they can go to a good \nschool.\n  What about the argument that this poor children's bill of rights \nmight destroy the public schools? Here is what Mr. Sizer and Mr. \nWhitten said in 1969:\n\n       Those who would argue that our proposal would destroy the \n     public schools raise a false issue. A system of public \n     schools which destroys rather than develops positive human \n     potential now exists. It is not in the public interest, and a \n     system which blames its society while it quietly acquiesces \n     in and inadvertently perpetuates the various injustices it \n     blames for its inefficiency is not in the public interest. If \n     the system cannot fulfill its responsibilities, it doesn't \n     deserve to survive.\n\n  That is their word.\n\n       But if the public schools serve, they will prosper.\n\n  Just as our public colleges and universities have with students who \nbring a voucher to those schools. Those are my words.\n  Since 1987, we have watched in amazement how rapidly the rest of the \nworld is seeking to emulate the American way of life. Everywhere in the \nworld, freedom and choice and opportunity have become the principles \nupon which are built the answers to the most basic human questions. \nAround the world, nothing is in as much disfavor as government monopoly \nof important services. Yet that is what the other side is defending \ntoday.\n  I think it is important, as we go through this debate, always to \nremember exactly what we are talking about. Those in opposition have \nsuch poor reasons for opposition that they invent all sorts of \ncomplications and make it sound exceedingly impossible. We are talking \nabout this: Spending $40 million for students in the District of \nColumbia. The bill the Senate is debating today appropriates $13 \nmillion for scholarships for low-income children in underperforming \npublic schools to go to any accredited school. $13 million for DC \npublic charter schools and $13 million new dollars for the DC public \nschools.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire went into great detail on this. Let me \nsummarize a couple of points. In addition to the fact that the District \nof Columbia is different--and there would be\n\n[[Page S12171]]\n\nState money, if it were Rhode Island, or West Virginia, or Tennessee, \nthat we would be spending--but here we are spending $11,000 per \nstudent, which is among the highest in the country in the public \nschools. Class size is among the lowest, yet reading scores continue to \nbe at or near the bottom of every national assessment. Sixty-nine \npercent of fourth graders are reading below basic level. That means \n7 out of 10 fourth graders can't read. That means all educators and \nparents know that by the third grade, if they can't read, they are off \non a track that goes anywhere but along with the American dream that \nanything is possible.\n\n  DC students ranked last in the Nation in both SAT and ACT scores last \nyear. Forty-two percent drop out of school. Those are some of the \nstatistics here in the District.\n  Finally, I would like to call attention to an article by William \nRaspberry that appeared on Monday, September 29--yesterday--in the \nWashington Post. Mr. Raspberry concludes his article with this \nquestion:\n\n       If federally funded vouchers help a few hundred more local \n     students to find such an environment, how bad is that?\n\n  He was writing about the debate here in the District to create an \nacademic high school 20 years ago. Some people said: Well, that will \nhelp some children and not others. Mr. Raspberry thinks it will help \nsome children, and that will be good, and maybe that will help us find \na way to help others. That is the basic essence of his article today. \nIt is a good thing to use to conclude a discussion about the District \nof Columbia because it shows we all know that the children of the \nDistrict of Columbia can succeed, the schools can succeed.\n  This is the way he describes Washington's academic high school:\n\n       By the way, Washington's academic high school--Benjamin \n     Banneker--is not merely an established fact these days, it is \n     an important source of pride for both the school system and \n     the city. It was a Banneker student who a few years back \n     scored a perfect 1600 on her SATs. It was a Banneker team \n     that scored a record-setting total on the TV program ``It's \n     Academic.'' Banneker's students are smart, but not \n     necessarily that much smarter than students elsewhere in the \n     city. What they have is an atmosphere where academic striving \n     is the norm, where no one calls them ``nerds'' or \n     ``brainiacs'' or accuses them of acting ``white.''\n\n  The recent result of Leave No Child Behind shows us something we \nalready know--that we have a lot of good schools in America. But even \nin many of our better schools, there are some children--almost all \ndisadvantaged and many of them minority kids--who are not learning what \nthey need to know, all over America, and it starts right here in the \nNation's Capital. We have tried about everything. We tried charter \nschools. We tried more money. We tried smaller classes. There are a lot \nof wonderful people working hard.\n  What this debate is about is: Should we not take the idea which \nhelped create the best colleges and universities in the world and try \nit here in the District? Should we not help those 7,000 families \nstanding in line out there hoping anything is possible for their child? \nWhy not give 2,000 of them $7,500 a year and let them go to a better \nschool and have a brighter future? If we learn something about that \nwhich teaches us something about what to do about American education \nthat will improve and help these disadvantaged children, so much the \nbetter.\n  How embarrassing it must be to stand up and argue against giving \n$7,500 to 2,000 children in the Nation's Capital who deserve that \nbrighter future.\n  I hope this becomes an increasingly bipartisan discussion. The \nSenator from California has offered an amendment which improves the \nlegislation. Not every Republican supports this. Not every Democratic \nSenator opposes it. I hope over time we will see that choice as an \nessential part of the American system. We have had it for 60 years in \nour colleges. We have had it for 12 years in the Child Care Program. \nEvery family with money has it. Why not offer it to the disadvantaged, \nthe poor families of America, starting with 2,000 families in the \nDistrict of Columbia in this bill?\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very happy to point out that the \ngood Senator from Tennessee and I served as Governors together, and his \nemphasis was always education then and obviously still is. I respect \nhim greatly.\n  I would like to speak for a few minutes on Senator Schumer's \namendment to call on the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel, \nit having been laid aside on the basis of germaneness.\n  I rise in support of the erstwhile amendment--maybe it will come \nback--calling on the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to \ninvestigate allegations that senior Bush administration personnel--\nperhaps including those working at the very highest level of the White \nHouse--may have knowingly and deliberately revealed to the press the \nidentity of an undercover CIA agent.\n  I speak as a Senator from West Virginia and also as vice chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee. This is a matter of national \nsecurity. It is a matter of criminal law. It is a matter that demands \nthe most careful, impartial, and independent investigation possible. As \nI will explain shortly, it is actually a matter without legal \nprecedent.\n  The Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, should go on record \ntoday--which we have not--to demand the Attorney General not hold this \ntoo close within the administration family, where the investigation \nwill inevitably be questioned as raising conflicts of interest. This is \ngoing to happen. Forget the people involved. It is simply going to be \nan issue with the public. Rather, he should appoint a special counsel \nthat can assure the Nation that no person in the United States, no \nmatter where they work and what they do, are above the law in our \ncountry.\n  Twenty-one years ago after the tragic assassination of a CIA station \nchief and other attacks, Congress enacted the Intelligence Identities \nProtection Act of 1982 to punish the naming of covert agents. The act \naddressed essential appalling circumstances such as a private \nindividual or organization engages in a campaign to publicize the names \nof agents. Appropriately, Congress reserved the most severe \nconsequences--including imprisonment for up to 10 years, substantial \nsums of money--for unfaithful U.S. Government officials who \nintentionally disclose the identity of any of our country's own agents. \nTo date, that kind of betrayal is so far beyond the pale, so to speak, \nso incomprehensible, that as far as the Intelligence Committee has been \nadvised, there has never been a case prosecuted under it.\n  It is, therefore, with special sadness that our country now faces an \ninvestigation into whether the unimaginable has, in fact, happened; \nwhether at the highest levels of our Government there has been a felony \ndisclosure of the identity of one of our covert agents.\n  When the Senate Judiciary Committee reported the identities \nprotection bill in 1981, it made a number of findings which are as true \nnow as they were then. They found that it is essential for our Nation \nto have intelligence information that is timely, that is accurate, and \nthat human sources of intelligence are the key to that effort and that \nwe need and must be ready to rely on our own covert intelligence agents \nto gather information from our sources.\n  To quote our Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Without effective cover for United States intelligence \n     officers abroad and without assurance for anonymity of \n     intelligence sources, the United States cannot collect the \n     human intelligence which it must have to conduct an effective \n     foreign and national defense policy.\n\n  This was true in the cold war when this law was enacted, and it is \ncertainly no less true today in the war against terror.\n  The disclosure of our agents puts them at risk. It puts their sources \nat risk. And it puts our Nation, as a result, at risk.\n  In the case at hand, there is a further danger of immediate \nimportance: The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting an inquiry \ninto prewar intelligence about Iraq and how that particular \nintelligence compares with what is being found or is not being found on \nthe ground in Iraq. Two of the toughest questions we are asking are \nwhether any of the intelligence was exaggerated or distorted by the \npolicy- makers--that is, the users of the collected and analyzed \nintelligence--and\n\n[[Page S12172]]\n\nwhether any pressure was brought to bear on any U.S. intelligence \nanalysts to shape their prewar analysis.\n\n  I deeply hope the final answers to those questions is a no but the \njury is still out. The House has produced a preliminary report of \nseveral pages. The Senate Intelligence Committee is hard at work on a \nvery thorough, very profound effort.\n  I ask my colleagues, how can we possibly expect our intelligence \ncommunity to come forward to help us to get the truth in the matter if \nthey fear that retribution will follow? One has not had to raise this \nquestion before.\n  Since mid-July, our intelligence community officers have been reading \nthe same press reports that we have been reading. They are reading \nabout not just some inadvertent disclosure of a potentially covert \nagent but something far more insidious. If press reports are true, then \nthe allegation at issue is that there may have been a coordinated \neffort to release the name of a covert agent for the specific purpose \nof discrediting somebody who disagreed with the administration about \nthe fraudulent and much discredited claims of Iraqi purchases of \nuranium in Niger, a policy which never received virtually any credence \nat all.\n  If the U.S. intelligence community and its agents believe their \ncareers can be crushed by a phone call or by a couple of phone calls, \nhow can they be sure their candor will be protected? Why should they \nproduce candor? Perhaps they will be punished. They do not know. That \ndoes not happen, particularly in our world. It can happen sometimes in \npolitics, but this is an everyday part of their world. We rely on them \nfor accurate intelligence as they see it, as they believe it, that is \nthen gathered, analyzed, and passed on to policymakers for judgments.\n  How can the Congress meet our own investigation and oversight \nobligations, a committee in each body? How can we learn the true facts \nabout the conduct of government officials and inform the American \npeople? At this point, the prompt appointment of a special counsel is \nessential, the amendment being laid aside or not.\n  Under the Department of Justice regulation, the Attorney General is \nto appoint a special counsel when investigation or prosecution of the \nmatter would present a conflict of interest for the Department and it \nwould be in the public interest as a further matter to appoint an \noutside counsel to assume responsibility for the investigation in the \nmatter. Both tests are plainly met here.\n  The Attorney General faces a conflict of interest when an \ninvestigation leads into the White House. And it is unquestionably in \nthe public interest to assure confidence in such a critically important \ninvestigation.\n  The special counsel is admittedly not quite as independent as an \nindependent counsel--and we have had those--was under the former \nstatute. But the special counsel is our best and most impartial \nmechanism for difficult circumstances such as these. The regulations \nprovide the special counsel shall not be subject to the day-to-day \nsupervision of any official of the Justice Department. If the Attorney \nGeneral concludes any action sought by the special counsel should not \nbe pursued, the Attorney General is required to notify the Congress, \nand the Attorney General must report to the Congress if he or she wants \nto fire the special counsel and can only do so for good cause.\n  In closing, since joining the Intelligence Committee, I have had the \nhonor of meeting dozens of covert intelligence agencies working \noverseas in a variety of countries. These men and women make sacrifices \nthat few Americans even come close to understanding or know anything \nabout, which is as it should be. They live undercover, unable to tell \ntheir friends or even their family, what they do or where they are. \nThey work tirelessly with much of the operational activity conducted in \nthe evenings after regular working hours on other matters and on \nweekends when the rest of us are at home with our families. They put \nthemselves at literal risk almost every single day. And they love what \nthey do.\n  If the recent allegations are true, someone in this administration \nhas done these people a grave and lasting injustice. Our intelligence \nagents need to know we understand the sacrifices they make and that we \nwill come to their defense when somebody puts them at risk. An \nindependent investigation is the only way--and it is the only way--to \nrestore their faith in the Government they serve. Not to do so would \nhave a chilling effect on the recruitment of people to do this vital \nwork, in a time when intelligence may be beginning to surpass actual \nwar fighting in terms of its importance to something called the war on \nterror.\n  I regret this amendment has been ruled out of order on this bill. I \nhope we will again take it up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be \nconsidered as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I come to the floor to respond to some of \nthe comments that I have heard concerning the CIA's request that the \nDepartment of Justice look into the leak of the name of one of its \nemployees. My friends on the other side claim that a special counsel \nshould be appointed and that the Department should recuse itself from \nthe investigation.\n  Quite simply, the Department of Justice is the appropriate agency to \nlook into this matter. The CIA notifies the Department approximately 50 \ntimes per year to investigate complaints about the leak of classified \ninformation. The Department has career professionals that address \nmatters like these. This professionalism and experience is needed in \ninstances like these to ensure that the investigation is done in a \ncompetent and complete manner.\n  Some of my colleagues believe that a special counsel is needed \nbecause there has been a ``clear violation of the law.'' I respectfully \ndisagree. While I agree that this matter is a significant one and needs \nto be promptly examined, it is premature to conclude that the \nProtection of Identities of Certain United States Undercover \nIntelligence Officers, Agents, Informants, and Sources statute has been \nviolated based merely upon media reports. In fact, there is reason to \nbelieve that no violation of this statute has occurred. The \nintelligence statute prohibits the disclosure of the identity of a \nconvert agent whose identity and relationship to the United States the \nGovernment has affirmatively sought to conceal or that the defendant \ndisclosed the name of a covert agent with reason to believe that such \nactivities would impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities \nof the United States. Robert Novak, the reporter who wrote the story, \nhas since stated: ``Nobody in the Bush administration called me to leak \nthis.'' He also stated that, ``According to a confidential source at \nthe CIA, Mrs. Wilson is an analyst, not a spy, not a covert operative, \nand not in charge of undercover operatives.'' If that is true, there is \nno violation of this statute.\n  I would further urge those whose knee-jerk reaction is to call for a \nspecial counsel to step back for a moment. Political opponents of the \nPresident have charge that Karl Rove leaked this information. When \npressed for specific evidence about Mr. Rove's involvement, they are at \na complete loss. In fact, it is my understanding that former Ambassador \nWilson, who has also charged that Karl Rove leaked this information, \nrecanted when pressed for evidence on Karl Rove's involvement. This \nkind of speculation is unfounded. Unsubstantiated statements like these \nshould simply not take place on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Since the Independent Counsel Statute expired in 1999, the Justice \nDepartment, under former Attorney General Reno, promulgated new \nregulations when the Attorney General may appoint a special counsel. \nThe regulation allows the appointment of a special counsel when there \nis a need to investigate a unique case involving high-ranking executive \nbranch officials and/or there is a conflict of interest for the \nDepartment.\n  The regulations allow the attorney general to appoint a special \ncounsel\n\n[[Page S12173]]\n\nwhen he or she determines that a criminal investigation of a person or \nmatter is warranted and (a) that investigation or prosecution of that \nperson or matter by the Department would present a conflict of \ninterest, or other extraordinary circumstances exist, and (b) that \nunder the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint \nan outside special counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.\n  I have every confidence in Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI Director \nMueller's integrity and ability to investigate this matter. The FBI and \nthe Department have career employees with the skill, experience, and \nhonesty to look into this matter. For those who doubt this, I would \npoint out that similar skepticism was raised in the Department's \nability to investigate the complaints made against it by those detained \nfollowing September 11th. My colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \nknow, because I held a hearing on the report, that the Department's \nInspector General issued an exacting report on the 9/11 abuses. The \nreport shows that the Department's Inspector General, and career \nemployees within the Department, pulled no punches regarding the \ntreatment of the 9/11 detainees.\n  This is the nature of career employees within the FBI and the \nDepartment of Justice. The continuity of service within our law \nenforcement community is what makes our criminal justice system the \nbest in the world.\n  So I recommend to those who are recklessly casting aspersions about \nthe ability of the Department and the FBI to professionally conduct \nthis investigation to take a careful look at the facts.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I will take a moment to remind my \ncolleagues where we are today. We are now in the fifth day of debate of \nthe District of Columbia appropriations bill. I think we have had a \ngood debate, but this is the fifth day. Really, there is nothing \ncontroversial about this bill. Senator Landrieu and I have worked on \nthis bill. It is a good bill. The only issue really before us has to do \nwith the education scholarships, the school scholarships. There are \nthose who have raised questions about those scholarships. While \nquestions have been raised about them, we are still waiting for \namendments.\n  I have come to the floor time and again and said, bring down the \namendments.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. How many amendments are pending on the bill at this time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Despite the fact that we have had a lot of discussion, \nthere are no pending amendments to this bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then how many amendments have been filed? There must have \nbeen many amendments filed since we have been on it for 5 days. I \nwonder why we have not voted.\n  Mr. DeWINE. There was, of course, the Feinstein amendment that was \nfiled. We were able to debate that amendment. That amendment was passed \nby a voice vote. Other than the Feinstein amendment, there are no other \namendments that have been filed and there are no other amendments that \nare pending.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if the Senator will yield further for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield further to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is almost incomprehensible that we have been on a bill \nfor 5 days, that there are no amendments filed, there are no amendments \npending, and we cannot complete the bill. Why would the other side not \nwant to complete the bill since they are not filing amendments and \nthere are no amendments pending?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I would respond to my colleague that \nfrankly I do not know. We have had a good debate. Many of the issues my \ncolleagues have raised have to do with amendments they have said they \nare going to file. They have talked about amendments. They have talked \nabout actually several amendments that might be brought to the floor. \nYet despite the fact I have asked for amendments to be brought to the \nfloor, there have been no amendments brought. So I really frankly am at \na loss to explain to my colleague why we are seeing no amendments and \nwe are still now wrapping up our fifth day of debate on this bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. It seems to me in light of that history and in light of \nthe present status of the pending amendments, of which there are none--\nand there are none filed--it would certainly be appropriate to go to \nthird reading or in some other way bring closure to this bill so we \ncould make sure the city of Washington has the money they need to \noperate and has the money the Mayor has asked for to do some creative \nand imaginative things to improve the school system in the city.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I respond to my colleague that I agree \nwith him, it is time to go to third reading. If there are no \namendments, that is the normal procedure of the Senate. You look around \nand wait for amendments, and after a reasonable period of time if there \nhas been debate and there are, in fact, no amendments to be offered, \nthen we would normally go to a third reading.\n  As I look around the Chamber, I do not see any of my colleagues, and \nso out of deference to them I will not make any unanimous consent at \nthis point, but I say to my colleagues, in a short period of time I \nwould like to raise the issue with them. I will not at this point, but \nI would like to make a unanimous consent in regard to moving forward.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will further yield for a question, I note \nthe Senator from Connecticut is on the floor, as is the Senator from \nNevada. It might be appropriate at this time, if the Senator from Ohio \nis so inclined, to propound a unanimous consent that we complete this \nbill, having spent 5 days on it, with no amendments pending and no \namendments filed.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I do see my colleague from Nevada. I do not know if my \ncolleague had the opportunity to hear what I said when he was coming to \nthe floor, but to repeat it for my colleague, I said simply we have \nbeen on this bill now for 5 days. We have had the Feinstein amendment \nwhich was adopted. We have had a good debate. There really is no \ncontentious issue about this bill, other than the one issue that has \nbeen raised in regard to the school scholarships. We have had a good \ndebate about that. Really, it is time for the amendments to be offered. \nWe have had discussion about amendments. In fact, three of my \ncolleagues have come to the floor and talked about amendments they \nmight offer. We look forward to having those amendments offered and we \nlook forward to having additional debate on those amendments, although \nI will say we have already had some good debate. We look forward to \nadditional debate, but we look forward to having those amendments \noffered after having 5 days of debate.\n  In just a moment I will make a unanimous consent request. In fact, at \nthis point I will do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending substitute amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be read the third time, and the Senate now proceed \nto a vote on passage of the bill with no further intervening action or \ndebate; further, that following the vote the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have the \ngreatest respect for my friend from Ohio. I know his heart is in the \nright place, but I say respectfully to him and anyone within the sound \nof my voice, I, speaking for me, told the majority leader, privately \nand publicly, that going to this bill was a mistake; that this voucher \nissue was a contentious issue and would make it very difficult this \nlate in the session to complete the bill.\n\n[[Page S12174]]\n\n  The decision was made to go ahead with this legislation. We have been \non it now for 2 weeks. I say to my friend from Ohio, the manager of \nthis bill, along with the Senator from Louisiana, who has done an \noutstanding job, that this is something that is done only for fill. I \nthink everyone knows that this bill, as long as this voucher issue is \nin here floating around, is not going to go very far.\n  So I think the leader should bring up one of the other seven \nappropriations bills so we can move along. We have wasted 2 weeks. \nThere are appropriations bills we should all be dealing with. But it \nappears to me the decision has been made by the majority that they are \nnot going to do any more appropriations bills; they will all be lumped \ninto one big clump. I think that is unfortunate.\n  If, in fact, there is some prospect of taking the voucher provision \nout of this bill, we could finish this bill very quickly. So without \nbelaboring the point, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard, the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I regret that. I am sorry to hear that. \nBut the fact is, this bill could be finished very quickly. We have \nheard comments about several amendments. Frankly, it would not take \nlong to debate those amendments. We have already had a good debate \nabout those amendments. We pretty much know what is in those \namendments.\n  My colleagues could bring those amendments to the floor very quickly, \nwe could debate them, and we could dispose of them. We could have a \ngood debate, we could take whatever time that needs to be taken, \nMembers could come to the floor to debate the amendment, and we could \nmove on.\n  Let me ask my colleague this. In light of that objection, I wonder if \nwe could set a time certain at least to find out if they would be \nprepared to set a time certain for a vote on passage for later today or \nperhaps tomorrow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is clear that we have had a number of \ndays that have been wasted on this piece of legislation. As to whose \nfault it is, there is lots of blame to go around. I don't think we need \nto get into the blame game. But the fact is, we have 29 Members of the \nSenate who are ensconced in Dirksen 109 or 106, whatever the number--\nthat is where I was headed a few minutes ago--on the supplemental \nappropriations bill dealing with funding for the military in Iraq and \nthe reconstruction of Iraq. That meeting started at 10 o'clock today \nand is going as we speak. So we have approximately a third of the \nMembers of the Senate who are there, one of whom is Mary Landrieu, the \ncomanager of this bill. She indicated to me today, earlier today, she \nwanted to be there during the deliberations on that most important \npiece of legislation, some $87 billion that we have been asked to mark \nup and get to the Senate floor today. That bill will be on the floor \nthis evening unless something goes wrong. Otherwise, it will be here \ntomorrow.\n\n  So I understand, having managed a few bills in my day, how the \nSenator from Ohio would have loved to get this bill finished 2 days \nago. But under the present status of the Senate, with the total thrust \nfor the next 2 weeks being on the $87 billion that the President has \nrequested, I think we would all be better served if the DC bill were \ntaken from the calendar--which it will be just in a matter of hours. \nBut I would love to see the bill passed.\n  I, by the way, a number of years ago, 15 years ago or so, was the \nchairman of the DC appropriations committee. I know it is an \ninteresting subcommittee, and I enjoyed it very much. There is so much \nthat needs to be done for the District of Columbia--in education, \ncertainly. We just have a different outlook on what should be done to \nhelp education.\n  But separate and apart from that, I think if we would take the \ncontentious issue dealing with vouchers from this bill--and you can \nsugarcoat it and call it scholarships or whatever you want but we are \nboth talking about the same subject--this bill would pass in a matter \nof not hours but minutes. So I hope for the District of Columbia, that \nwe would do that as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If my colleague will yield for just a minute and I will \nfinish, I am sorry to hear that. I understand what the position of the \nSenator is. We will continue to move on and try to get this bill \npassed.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to hear from the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the good Senator, it is my understanding that, if \nwe did not have the issue of the imposition of vouchers on the District \nof Columbia, we could move right to third reading?\n  Mr. REID. In a matter of minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In a matter of minutes. Since this involves an education \nissue, and we on our side believe it is an extremely important \neducation issue, that it is appropriate we have a full discussion about \nwhat exactly are going to be the educational implications of a voucher \nprogram, I wonder if the Senator remembers that in 1996, the Senate \nvoted four times on the motion to invoke cloture on the DC \nappropriations conference report, and all four times the motion and the \neffort to impose vouchers on the District of Columbia failed?\n  We have never tried to have a voucher program in any other city of \nthe country since 1996. It is only the District of Columbia.\n  All four of those attempts in 1996 failed, and since 1996 have \nfailed. It is 2003 now. In 1997, the Senate voted 58 to 41 to reject \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the Coats amendment. Four times in \n1996, all imposing vouchers on the District of Columbia. In 1997, \nanother vote.\n  In the time from 1996 to 2001, not one of our colleagues--and this is \nmy question--not one of our colleagues who have been out speaking in \nfavor of vouchers have ever asked any city in their State to impose \nvouchers. Does the Senator find that this is somewhat peculiar? We have \nthese voices that are on the floor of the Senate: Let's rush this thing \nfor the District of Columbia. And yet over the last 7 years that we \nhave been voting on this, not one of them has asked to impose vouchers \non any one of the cities in any one of their States?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from Massachusetts, it is no wonder \nthat people who live in the District of Columbia have bumper stickers \nthat say, ``No Taxation Without Representation.'' It is no wonder that \nthe people, hundreds of thousands of people who are American citizens, \nwho live in the District of Columbia, are treated like second-class \ncitizens. They do not even have a Senator. They have a nonvoting \ndelegate.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, it is no wonder that people of \nthe District of Columbia believe they are being treated like a \nstepchild. Are they part of this great country? People who live in the \nNation's Capital can't do things that every other citizen in this \ncountry can do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this gets to the point. I don't know \nwhether he will agree with me. We don't try to impose this voucher \nprogram on the State of Nevada. We don't try to impose it on the State \nof New Hampshire or the State of Ohio or the State of Massachusetts. \nDoes the Senator not find--I think he will--it extraordinary that we \nare prepared to try to impose it on the almost 600,000 people who live \nin the District of Columbia, who do not have any representation here to \nspeak for them? Why aren't our friends on the other side of the aisle--\nmostly on the other side of the aisle--who oppose vouchers trying to \nimpose them on the State of California or Massachusetts or Nevada? They \ndon't ask for that. They take the District of Columbia, that doesn't \nhave a spokesperson out here to speak for them on this issue--though it \nhas been considered by the people of the District. It has been \nthoroughly and completely rejected by the majority of the school board, \nthe school council, and the majority of parents.\n  What is it about our friends asking my good friends tonight, Why are \nwe holding this up? Are they willing to accept the voucher program for \nthe State of Ohio or for some other State, rather than imposing it on \nthe District? I find this extraordinary.\n\n[[Page S12175]]\n\n  I don't want to delay the Senator. I know he has other business. I \nknow he will have some difficulty reading this chart. But it shows that \nthe majority of elected officials, community leaders, and organizations \nin DC oppose vouchers. This is the list of the elected officials. \nObviously, Eleanor Holmes Norton. And it goes down to the council \nmembers, the board of education, the local organizations, various \nchurch groups, parents groups, and all the rest.\n  It troubles me that so many of our colleagues are willing to try to \nimpose something on a particular community that doesn't have \nrepresentation here in the U.S. Senate, where so many are against it, \nand when it has such broad educational implications.\n  I know the Senator has responsibilities. If he has a moment, the \nSenator remembers our long and extensive battle to try to bring reform \nto our public schools. We understood that we needed two elements: \nReform and resources. We had the reform and the resources. Then the \nadministration backed out.\n  But this chart shows public schools are held accountable when \nstudents fail. Private schools are not held accountable. Public schools \nare required to see that every child is taught by highly qualified \nteachers. In the No Child Left Behind Act, that was the requirement for \n4 years. There has to be a highly qualified teacher in each classroom. \nThere is no such requirement here, in private schools. Public schools \nmust provide parents with report cards. Private schools don't have to \nprovide public report cards.\n  I ask unanimous consent this chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             DC PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE IMPROVING: TRANSFORMATION SCHOOLS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Read     Math    Total     Read     Math    Total\n                          School                             (2002)   (2002)   (2002)   (2003)   (2003)   (2003)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSimon ES..................................................       46       43       89       56       63      119\nNoyes ES..................................................       42       43       85       58       56      114\nDavis ES..................................................       45       51       96       50       59      109\nLaSalle ES................................................       47       51       98       47       54      101\nTurner ES.................................................       43       45       88       48       52      100\nCookie (H.D.).............................................       43       45       88       46       53       99\nWilkinson ES..............................................       35       38       73       42       48       90\nStanton ES................................................       39       40       79       38       44       82\nTerrell JHS...............................................       37       38       75       35       45       80\nEvans MS..................................................       36       40       76       38       41       79\nKramer MS.................................................       41       43       84       39       41       80\nWalker-Jones..............................................       41       42       83       37       39       76\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAverage scores on the SAT 9 Achievement tests.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, the public schools are required to accept and \nserve all students. Private schools are not required. As we understand, \nmany of the private schools can't do this because they don't have \neither the facilities for special needs children, or the trained \npersonnel. We understand that.\n  But, nonetheless, the Senator would agree with me that public school \nsystems have served our Nation well. They are taking all children. And \nthey would serve much better if we had an administration that would \nfulfill its commitment, in terms of supporting them and No Child Left \nBehind.\n  Mr. REID. My friend has been a longstanding Member of this most \nimportant committee where we have dealt with matters of education for \ndecades in the Senate. We know that private schools, most of the time, \ngive kids more attention. We have all heard these reports. But as the \nSenator from Massachusetts pointed out, they do not have to accept \nchildren who are physically or emotionally or mentally handicapped. \nPublic schools have to take all the kids. It makes it more difficult.\n  We should be devoting our attention to helping the District of \nColumbia have the resources so they can take care of all the problems \nthey have in public schools.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask the Senator a question on this? It is very \ninteresting. We will have a chance to get into this in more detail.\n  They say, yes. They say, well, Senator, kids will have some kind of \nlottery in terms of the selection, in terms of who will attend. But \nthere is nothing in here that requires the school to accept what the \noutcomes are. People run around saying: Oh, yes, we have a better \nsystem. But nothing requires them to take the children who go through \nthis process, unlike the public school system.\n  Mr. REID. Private schools can pick and choose who they want. They can \npick and choose the voucher kids who would be submitted to them from \nthe school district here in the District of Columbia. Of course, who \nwould not be accepted? A kid would not be accepted, of course, if the \nkid had a physical disability or a mental or emotional disability or \nhas maybe been unruly in the past.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator in effect assisting the debate \ntoday. It is not as simple as going to third reading and passing the \nbill. If we really care about the District of Columbia, let us give \nthem the resources they need, strip this voucher stuff off of it and \ncome back and take a look at it again some other time.\n  But I would resent this Senate forcing down the throat of the people \nof the State of Nevada a program dealing with vouchers in the State of \nNevada which the State of Nevada did not approve first. The voucher \nprogram for the District of Columbia has not been approved by the \nauthorities in the District of Columbia. You have an elected official \nor a mayor walk out and say: I like it. But if he looks at it, he has \ngotten a few other goodies for the District. You have to ask him. But \nit appears to me that a few other goodies are enticing him to go along \nwith this.\n  Regardless of that, he is in the minority because largely everyone in \nthe District opposes what he wants.\n  I deeply appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts joining with me on \nthe floor this afternoon.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Just to continue the observation, of course, if the District of \nColumbia wanted to go ahead with the program, there is nothing \nprohibiting them from going ahead and developing this program on their \nown. That is the extraordinary irony. That is what I say to those who \nsuggest we are holding this legislation up. We cannot pass this part if \nit has this mandated program in terms of vouchers which has very \nimportant educational implications, not only in terms of this bill, but \nin the broader sense in terms of our country.\n\n  If the District of Columbia wanted to develop a program, they could \ndo it themselves. They haven't, as has been pointed out. Effectively, \nwe are requiring them to do so.\n  I am going to have more of a chance to speak on this issue, but I \nwant to draw to the attention of the Senate the progress that has been \nmade in what we call the transformation schools in the District of \nColumbia. I will take time to go through the bill in detail when we get \na chance to return to it.\n  Some things just come out at you when you look at the District of \nColumbia schools. And I have had the opportunity to look. I have the \ngood opportunity to read at the Brent School. I will read there weekly, \nstarting in October again for this year. I have been doing that now for \n7 years--this will be my seventh year. I have also taken the \nopportunity to speak at graduations in the District of Columbia. I did \nthis this year. I look for that opportunity when I can, and will \ncontinue to do so.\n  The fact is, just a few years ago we passed the No Child Left Behind \nAct, with some rather basic and fundamental principles on this idea of \ndeveloping the curriculum that was going to be appropriate for these \nchildren, and which was going to require well-qualified teachers to \nteach the curriculum. We are going to examine the child as he or she \ngoes through the year, to find out what the child does not know. We are \ngoing to have support services for that child so they can keep up, and \nwell-trained teachers. We have accountability for the parents so they \nwill have information for accountability of the schools, and \naccountability for everyone, including the Federal Government. We are \nthe ones who failed in terms of providing the resources to which we \ncommitted, but the transformation schools in the District of Columbia \nhave followed many of these same principles as in No Child Left Behind.\n  We have made very important progress in these transformation schools. \nThey are demonstrating the essential elements of what was in the No \nChild Left Behind Act. We know what works. We don't have to rediscover \nand find out what works. That is what is so tragic because we know the \nprogress that has been made in these transformation schools. We know \nthe needs. We know the struggle those parents have keeping their \nchildren in the transformation schools. We know the pressures the \nteachers face.\n\n[[Page S12176]]\n\n  Although my chart is small, it shows the transformation schools. It \ncompares their scores in reading and math for 2002, and reading and \nmath for 2003. The progress is dramatic. We know what works.\n  We will have a chance to review this. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe progress of a number of these transformation school be printed in \nthe Record. One school is Simon Elementary School located in Ward 8, \none of the poorest wards in the city. It serves 400 students, almost \nentirely African Americans, with 10 percent special education. Last \nyear they raised assessment by 30 points in reading and math combined. \nReading scores rose 10 points and math scores rose 20 points. Noyes \nElementary School is another transformation school which is showing \nsignificant improvement.\n  With the resources we have available, invest in what we are doing \nrather than trying to superimpose another system on the District of \nColumbia.\n  I will elaborate later in the debate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the \nfollowing letter from Paul Strauss, District of Columbia ``shadow'' \nSenator.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                        Office of the U.S. Senator\n\n\n                                 for the district of columbia,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, Sub-Committee on \n         the District of Columbia, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Landrieu: As the United States Senator elected by \n     the voters of the District of Columbia, I have watched the \n     debate over my District's budget closely. In that capacity, I \n     appreciate all of your hard work on behalf of my community. \n     However, I also want to thank you, perhaps even more \n     significantly, as the parent of a little girl who attends our \n     local DC Public School.\n       This year, after two years of private religious Pre-K \n     education, my wife and I decided to enroll our daughter, \n     Abigail Lafleur Strauss, in our local public elementary \n     school. While many of DC's elected officials have weighed in \n     on this debate, I believe I am the only official who's child \n     actually is presently enrolled in our often unfairly maligned \n     Public School system.\n       Choosing to put my daughter in a DC Public School was not a \n     decision we made for financial reasons. We are fortunate to \n     have had options, but it is not a decision that we regret. I \n     must ask those Senators who have taken the floor in recent \n     days to broadly attack all of the District's Public Schools, \n     please consider the damage that this inflammatory and \n     insulting rhetoric causes. Like any public institution, our \n     schools thrive on their relationship with their community. \n     While DC, like many other urban areas have our share of \n     problems, significant numbers of DC Students get a quality \n     education in our public schools. When even our non-failing \n     schools are attacked, these children and the hard-working \n     teachers that serve them are done a great injustice.\n       The school voucher program that is currently included in \n     the District of Columbia appropriations bill (H.R. 2765) is a \n     further injustice to the District of Columbia public schools \n     and its pupils. I have heard the arguments advanced by the \n     supporters of the voucher program, who argue that this agenda \n     will grant low-income families a choice as to where their \n     children can receive an education. I have watched your \n     attempts to repair some of the major defects in the \n     legislation as it is presently written, and bring some \n     accountability to a program that has not been the subject \n     of any hearings, not been adequately studied. In its \n     present form, it is unlikely to achieve even partially the \n     objectives of its supporters, and if I had a vote, I would \n     support Senator Durbin's motion to strike this entire \n     portion of the bill.\n       After all of the hard work done by this Congress on \n     education, to go from a policy of ``Leave No Child Behind'', \n     and replace it with ``Leave All But Up to 7,500 Children \n     Behind'' is troubling to say the least. The reality is, that \n     vouchers discriminate, helping few students, as a vast \n     majority of students are left behind with a failing \n     education.\n       If this body decides to allocate federal funds to improve \n     the education of children of the District of Columbia, that \n     would be very appropriate. Please remember when you consider \n     the District of Columbia Appropriation, that while obviously, \n     all of the locally raised funds by their very nature come \n     from DC Citizens, a significant portion of those federal \n     funds come from the locally residing Federal taxpayers of the \n     District of Columbia as well. Those same Federal taxpayers, \n     whose sole representation in this body is limited to the \n     submission of written statements by a so-called ``Shadow \n     Senator'' who is forced to watch this debate from a seat in \n     the family gallery.\n       I urge that those funds be pumped into the public schools \n     where they will be most beneficial, and in that regard I \n     appreciate the committee's mark for Public and Charter School \n     improvements. All children will benefit from public schools \n     supplied with well-trained staff, school supplies, books, \n     secured facilities, and other needed resources. Even though, \n     these vouchers are to be funded with so called new or \n     additional federal money, in the end, the voucher program \n     will only drain resources and the funding for the Public \n     Schools. For one thing, there are no guarantees by this \n     administration to continue funding in the next fiscal year. \n     We could start this program in fiscal 2004, and then be \n     forced to drain local funds to sustain it in fiscal years to \n     come. Or, even more likely, the Senate may choose to fully \n     fund this three-tiered approach, only to have the additional \n     funds for Public and Charter Schools struck from the bill in \n     Conference.\n       I realize that my Mayor, Anthony Williams, is a supporter \n     of the voucher program. I respect Mayor Williams. I voted for \n     the Mayor the last time around, and I agree with him on a \n     great many issues. I disagree with him on this issue, but I \n     was nevertheless proud to welcome him to the Senate, when he \n     availed himself of his Rule XXIII privileges and certainly \n     envious that our local Chief Executive has this prerogative. \n     I ask you to consider for a moment the irony that the DC \n     Mayor has the privilege of the Senate floor, while DC's own \n     elected United States Senator does not.\n       I was even more astonished at the suggestions by some \n     members, mostly in the Majority but a few of my own \n     Democratic colleagues as well, that somehow, by imposing \n     vouchers on the District of Columbia, they are advancing the \n     cause of Home Rule. The Senate needs to understand that if \n     the locally selected Board of Education wanted to fund a \n     voucher program, they would do so. Instead, the fact that the \n     President of the Board of Education chose to bypass the \n     School Board, does not mean that the School Board wants \n     vouchers. It is also true, that one member of the Council \n     of the District of Columbia supports vouchers. However, \n     Councilmember Chavous did not introduce a bill to create \n     this program. He could have, he did not. The fact that he \n     chose to bypass his colleagues on the DC Council does not \n     mean that the DC Council wants vouchers. Nor does the fact \n     that this Mayor, the first DC Mayor to appoint half the \n     school board, the Mayor with more authority over local \n     education than any of his predecessors, wants vouchers \n     mean that the Senate is free to disregard the viewpoints \n     and wishes of a majority of DC's elected officials, and \n     ignore the due process system of checks and balances that \n     are part of our limited home rule government in the \n     District of Columbia. The reality is that, vouchers are \n     being advanced by the President, over the objections of \n     the majority of DC residents.\n       I know voucher proponents sincerely believe that they are \n     looking after the best interests of the students of the \n     District of Columbia; however, I urge them to consider the \n     negative effects that the voucher program will have on the \n     public school system and the pupils of the public schools. \n     Let us show our faith in the American public school system, \n     and let us not turn our backs on the children of the American \n     public school system.\n       To those Senators who claim that this is not about \n     vouchers, but claim only to be supporting Democracy by \n     promoting the objectives of our popularly elected Mayor, I \n     point out to you, Senator, that Mayor Williams also supports \n     budget autonomy and full voting representation in the Senate \n     for DC Residents. Where will these sudden champions of DC's \n     self-determination be when it comes to these issues? If the \n     Senate is sincere in advancing the so-called local agenda, \n     then all they need to do is simply support full Budget \n     Autonomy, and let the District decide on its own. Then we can \n     see where the District's officials really are on this issue.\n       I thank you for all your work on behalf of my constituents \n     in the District of Columbia.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Paul Strauss,\n\n                                                     U.S. Senator,\n                                    District of Columbia (Shadow).\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as Congress continues to debate \nPresident Bush's request for the massive sum of $87 billion as the next \ninstallment to pay for its flawed and failed policy in Iraq, the \nadministration frequently compares it to the Marshall plan,which was so \nsuccessful in rebuilding Europe after World War II and transforming \nthem into new democracies.\n  Sadly, the most obvious area in which the administration's proposal \non Iraq corresponds to the Marshall plan is its cost to the American \ntaxpayer. And the comparison here is hardly to the administration's \nadvantage. Under the Marshall plan, $88 million--in today's dollars--\nwas spent over 4 years. The Bush administration is now asking for $87 \nbillion for Iraq for next year alone.\n  There are many differences between the Marshall plan and the \nPresident's unprecedented $87 billion request on Iraq. The most \nimportant is that the Marshall plan deserved to be called a plan.\n  The Marshall plan was formally proposed in 1947 at Harvard in a \ncommencement address by George C. Marshall, the famous World War II \nGeneral who had become Secretary of State\n\n[[Page S12177]]\n\nearlier that year in the Truman administration. His proposal was \ndiscussed at an international conference in Paris that include 16 \nnations. More than a full month of congressional hearings were held in \nwhich over 90 witnesses testified.\n  At the conclusion of the extensive congressional debate, Senate \nArthur C. Vandenberg, who had been a leading critic of the Truman \nadministration's foreign policy, described the plan as ``the final \nproduct of eight months of more intensive study by more devoted minds \nthan I have ever known to concentrate upon any one objective in all my \ntwenty years in Congress.''\n  Compare that to what is happening today. Instead of a well-\ndeliberated and well thought-out plan, the Bush administration has \ngiven the Congress a 2-month-old, 28-page ``working document'' and \nasked us to write a blank check for $87 billion for Iraq. That request \ncame to Congress just 6 months after we had earlier provided $78 \nbillion for the war.\n  I doubt that at the end of this debate, any Senator would be willing \nto describe a 2 month old ``working document'' as glowingly as Senator \nVandenberg characterized the Marshall plan.\n  In the 13 days since the administration presented this proposal to \nCongress, we still have not been able to obtain answers to critically \nimportant questions. How will the administration involve the \ninternational community in a genuine way in the rebuilding of Iraq? Can \nwe count on additional foreign troops to share the burden or not? How \nlong will American troops and foreign troops remain in Iraq?\n  It has become increasingly clear that the President and the Pentagon \nnever had any idea about the cost of what they wanted to do in Iraq. In \nthis arrogant go-it-alone attitude toward other nations, they thought \nthey could plan Lone Ranger in the world, and instead they have become \na very lonesome cowboy.\n  Now our troops are paying for it with their lives.\n  In its rush to war, the administration failed to recognize the danger \nand complexity of the occupation. They repeatedly underestimated the \nlikely cost of their enormous undertaking.\n  Opposing voices in the administration were ignored. Last September, \nchief presidential economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey said that the \ntotal cost of the Iraqi war might be as much as $200 billion. His \nestimate was quickly refuted by White House Budget Director Mitch \nDaniels, who said Lindsey's estimate was ``very, very high'' and \nsuggested the cost would be a more manageable $50 to $60 billion.\n  Independent analyses at that time indicated that the cost might \napproach $300 billion. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld called them \n``baloney.''\n  Last spring, as part of a broader effort to win the support of the \nAmerican people for the military operation, the administration began to \nargue that ``Iraq can pay for its own reconstruction.'' The war might \nbe costly, we were told, but it would be quick and decisive. The \nfinancial obligation of the United States would be limited, because the \nliberated Iraqi people would use their extraordinary wealth from the \nworld's second largest reserves of oil to finance the reconstruction.\n  In a February 2003 White House briefing, Ari Fleischer argued that \n``Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country. Iraq has \ntremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people. And so there are \na variety of means that Iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the \nburden for their own reconstruction.\n  In March, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld told the House Appropriations \nCommittee, ``I don't believe the United States has a responsibility for \nreconstruction, in a sense . . . [Reconstruction] funds can come from \nthose various sources I mentioned: frozen assets, oil revenues, and a \nvariety of other things, including the Oil for Food program, which has \na very substantial number of billions of dollars in it.''\n  At the same hearing, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said, \n``The oil revenues could bring in between $50 and $100 billion over the \ncourse of the next 2 years . . . We're dealing with a country that can \nreally finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.''\n  Also, at that same hearing, Deputy Secretary of State Richard \nArmitage said, ``This is not Afghanistan . . . When we approach the \nquestion of Iraq, we realize there is a country which has a resource. \nAnd it's oil. And it can bring in and does bring in a certain amount of \nrevenue each year . . . $10, $15, even $18 billion . . . this is not a \nbroke country.''\n  What the Nation heard was clear: Don't worry about the cost. Iraq can \nfinance its own reconstruction.\n  In fact last March, the administration was so confident of this that \nit put a $1.7 billion price tag on the reconstruction effort in Iraq. \nShortly after the war began that month, Administrator Andrew Natsios of \nthe Agency for International Development confidently proclaimed:\n\n       The rest of the rebuilding in Iraq will be done by other \n     countries who have already made pledges--Britain, Germany, \n     Norway, Japan, Canada, and Iraqi oil revenues . . . The \n     American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans \n     for any further-on funding of this.\n\n  The administration embraced the Iraqi self-sufficiency argument as \nrecently as the end of July, when OMB Director Josh Bolten testified \nthat the administration did not ``anticipate requesting anything \nadditional for the balance of this year'' with regard to Iraq \noperations or reconstruction.\n  Just 5 weeks later, President Bush stunned the Nation by saying that \n$87 billion in additional funding--including $20 billion for \nreconstruction--was needed.\n  Why the change? Ambassador Bremer says Iraq has an unsustainable \nlevel of foreign debt--nearly $200 billion--left over from Saddam which \nwould prevent use of Iraq's oil wealth to pay for the reconstruction.\n  Iraq's enormous debt was already well-known. But the administration \nchose to ignore it in order to convince the public that the costs of \nreconstruction would be low.\n  The architect of much of the Iraqi war plan, Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Paul Wolfowitz, is now saying that we knew all along the war \nwould be expensive. Despite earlier claims that Iraq could pay for its \nreconstruction and relatively soon, Secretary Wolfowitz told the Senate \nArmed Services Committee on September 10: ``No one said we would know \nanything other than this would be very bloody, it could be very long, \nand by implication, it could be very expensive.''\n  Secretary Wolfowitz never told the American people it could be very \nexpensive. Until this month, no one in the administration--other then \nLarry Lindsey--said it would be expensive.\n  This is worse than fuzzy math, and the American people have a right \nto be furious about it.\n  And they will be even more furious about it as they learn what we are \nbeing asked to fund: $400 million for maximum-security prisons. That's \n$50,000 a bed; $800 million for international police training for 1,500 \nofficers, that's $530,000 an officer; Consultants at $200,000 a year. \nThat's double normal pay. It is double their profit margin too? And \n$164 million to develop a curriculum for training Iraqi soldiers. Why \ndoes it cost that much to develop a curriculum? And $1.4 billion to \nreimburse cooperating nations for logistical, military and other \nsupport provided to U.S. military operations; $100 million for the \n``United States Emergency Fund for Complex Foreign Crisis''; $15.5 \nmillion to the European Command for countries directly supporting the \nwar on terror.\n  Before Congress rubber-stamps the administration's $87 billion \nrequest, we need answers. We need accountability. We need the truth. \nThe amount of money is huge. It is more than the combined budget \ndeficits of all 50 States for 2004. It is 87 times what the Federal \nGovernment spends annually on afterschool programs. It is 2 years worth \nof unemployment benefits. It is enough to pay each of the 3.3 million \npeople who have lost their jobs in the past 3 years more than $25,000.\n\n  It it seven times what President Bush proposed to spend on education \nfor low-income schools in 2004--seven times the amount. It is nine \ntimes what the Federal Government spends on special education each \nyear. It it eight times what the Government spends on Pell Grants to \nhelp middle and low-income students go to College. And it is larger \nthan the total economy of 166 nations.\n  Clearly, we need to require competitive bidding for Iraqi contracts. \nLeft to\n\n[[Page S12178]]\n\nits own devices, the administration will continue to make sweetheart \ndeals with American contractors at the taxpayer's expense.\n  A third of the $3.9 billion monthly cost of the operations in Iraq is \nquietly flowing to private contractors. Halliburton alone has already \nreceived more than $2 billion in contract awards--an amount that \nexceeds Administrator Natsios' original $1.7 billion estimate for the \ntotal U.S. cost of the reconstruction of Iraq. More than $1.2 billion \nwas awarded in noncompetitive bidding. The Iraqi people deserve the \nbenefits of peace, but instead, the administration's friends in \ncorporate America are divvying up the spoils of war.\n  Is Halliburton the company best able to get the job done efficiently \nfor the U.S. in Iraq?\n  In 1997, the General Accounting Office found that Halliburton's \nconstruction subsidiary in the Balkans had billed the Army $85 a sheet \nfor plywood that actually cost $14 a sheet; In 2000, the agency found \nthat the company was charging the Pentagon four times what it should \nhave been charging for office cleaning; In 2002, the company paid the \nU.S. ``$2 million to settle fraud claims at Fort Ord.'' At a minimum, \nall contracts should be provided on a competitive basis--no exceptions.\n  Why not scale back the lavish resources being provided to contractors \nand consultants and provide larger sums directly to the Iraqi people? \nIt is their country. They have the greatest stake in the success of \ntheir reconstruction, and involving them will enhance the prospects for \nsuccess.\n  In some areas of Iraq, military officials have already been able to \nachieve impressive results with small amounts of money. One former \nmilitary official told me that the U.S. military funded the building of \na cement factory for just $100,000. The bid by an American contractor \nfor the same project was in the millions.\n  Iraq has many of the best trained oil engineers in the world. Why not \ngive them--rather than large American companies--a larger role in \nrebuilding the industry?\n  As the Congress debates this funding, we will be looking for answers \nfrom the administration to these questions. We will be insisting on \naccountability. The administration cannot continue to low ball the cost \nand make up its plan day by day. It can no longer cook the books.\n  The administration's failure to have a plan is costing too many lives \nand too many dollars. It would be irresponsible for the Congress to \nwrite an $87 billion blank check for the administration, without \ndemanding an honest plan to achieve stability in Iraq, involving the \ninternational community in the rebuilding, and preventing the disaster \nin the making we have caused.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, within the past hour or so the Senate \nAppropriations Committee finished its work on the supplemental \nappropriations request that President Bush has made for Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We had a rather lengthy session today starting at 10 this \nmorning. We had a series of votes on a range of important issues. I \nwanted to comment about what we can expect on the floor of the Senate. \nI offered some amendments. I want to describe one of them for a moment \nbecause I intend to offer it tomorrow morning.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill that is necessary for Iraq is an \nimportant issue. The President has asked for $87 billion in additional \nfunding, immediate and urgent funding on an emergency basis for Iraq. \nRoughly $65 billion, close to 66, is for the military, and another \n$20.3 billion is for reconstruction in Iraq. I want to talk about the \nreconstruction issue because that is critically important.\n  The question is this: Should the United States taxpayer bear the \nburden of $20 billion for reconstruction of Iraq? Among the list of \nitems of reconstruction in a 55-page document from the administration \nare the following: $9 million to create a ZIP Code system, the purchase \nof a fleet of garbage trucks at $50,000 a truck, creating 2 prisons \nwith 4,000 beds at $50,000 a bed, and the restoration of marshlands--\nand I could go on.\n  Many of these things may be desirable, but they are not urgent.\n  Let me also say that in our recent military campaign in Iraq, the so-\ncalled Shock and Awe campaign--a devastating military campaign that \nvery quickly crushed Saddam Hussein's army--we deliberately avoided \ndamaging the infrastructure of Iraq. We deliberately did not target the \nelectric grid, the powerplants, roads, dams.\n  So while reconstruction for Iraq may be necessary, it is not because \nthis country damaged Iraq's infrastructure. Instead, Saddam Hussein for \nmany years took from the economy of Iraq and provided to his military. \nHe starved Iraq's economy, and the economy is in pretty tough shape.\n  Now, Iraq is a country of about 24 million people, something close to \nthe size of the State of California. It is not an impoverished country \nflat on its back with no hope and no resources. This is a country that \nhas the second largest oil reserves in the entire world, with liquid \ngold under its sands. It has the capability, Ambassador Bremer said, of \npumping 3 million barrels of oil a day beginning in July next year. \nThree million barrels a day means Iraq will produce $16 billion a year \nof net export value of oil, conservatively. That is $160 billion in net \nexport of oil in the next 10 years or $320 billion in 20 years.\n  Members of the Iraq Governing Council were in town today, and the \nchairman of the Iraq governing authority said: It is not 3 million \nbarrels, we are going to produce 6 million barrels a day, and we have \nthe largest oil reserves in the world.\n  Now, I don't know who is right about that. But this country of 24 \nmillion people has massive oil reserves, the pumping of which will \nproduce substantial revenue that ought to be used to reconstruct Iraq.\n  So it is incomprehensible to me that the Administration would be \nrequesting that the cost of reconstruction be born by the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Do you want to know who said it was not the American taxpayers' job \nto reconstruct Iraq? Paul Wolfowitz, the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense.\n  He said: This will be paid for with oil revenue.\n  Vice President Dick Cheney also said: Oil revenue will help pay for \nthe reconstruction.\n  Mr. Natsios, the head of USAID, said reconstruction in Iraq would \ncost $1.7 billion, and that would be the total cost to the American \ntaxpayers for the reconstruction of Iraq. He said this 5 months ago, \nand he said it three times on the same Ted Koppel program.\n  To a person, the folks in this administration who spoke to this issue \nhave said the reconstruction of Iraq should be done with the use of \nIraqi oil proceeds.\n  Now, I offered an amendment in committee today. It lost by a vote of \n14 to 15. It lost by just 1 vote. My amendment directed Ambassador \nBremer, working in consultation with the Iraqi Governing Council, to \nestablish an Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority. The amendment said \nthat this Authority's mission would be to sell securities against \nfuture oil revenues, to raise the money to reconstruct the country of \nIraq. I mentioned that Iraq could earn $160 million from oil over 10 \nyears. If that Reconstruction Finance Authority would borrow $30 \nbillion at 6 percent for 10 years, they would repay it at $4 billion a \nyear.\n  That is an easily achievable goal for the country of Iraq. And it \nwould mean, simply, that Iraqis would use their oil to finance the \nreconstruction of their own country.\n  When this amendment failed in committee today, we were told that, \ninstead, the American taxpayers should pay this bill.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about how my amendment--which I will \noffer again on the floor of the U.S. Senate--would work. I am not \nsuggesting we loan money, I am not suggesting we have a guaranteed \nloan, I am not suggesting the American people take the Iraqi oil and \nsell it and use the proceeds. I am suggesting the Iraqis construct an \nIraqi-controlled authority,\n\n[[Page S12179]]\n\ncalled the Reconstruction Finance Authority, and that that authority \nuse Iraqi oil as collateral for loans, or as security for bond issues. \nThat financing would then be used to reconstruct Iraq. This is Iraqi \npeople, using Iraqi oil, to invest in Iraq. It has nothing to do with \nthe United States getting its hands on Iraq oil. But it does have to do \nwith relieving the burden on the shoulders of the American taxpayers, \nthe responsibility to pay $21 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  When I asked Ambassador Bremer about this, I said: Mr. Ambassador, \nwhy can we not collateralize or securitize Iraqi oil, and let Iraq oil \npay for the reconstruction of Iraq? His answer was: Senator, Iraq has a \nvery substantial foreign debt. It owes a lot of money to other \ncountries, such as Russia, France, and Germany, he said. Therefore, it \ncan't pay for the reconstruction.\n  After the hearing, I did some research on Iraq's debts. I discovered, \nin fact, that Iraq does owe a fair amount of money. It was Saddam \nHussein, of course, who committed his people to those loans and other \nthings. Saddam Hussein's government doesn't exist now; he is not there; \nhe has vanished. But it is true that Saddam Hussein had foreign debt. \nThe largest debt, however, is not--as Mr. Bremer suggested--to Russia, \nFrance, or Germany. The largest debt the country of Iraq owes is to \nSaudi Arabia and Kuwait. Oh, they owe some to Russia, France, Germany, \nand others, to be sure. But the largest debt is to Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait.\n  Wouldn't it be perverse if, as Ambassador Bremer suggested, Iraq oil \nhad to be pumped out of the ground to provide the cash that would allow \nIraq to send money to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait--two of the wealthiest \ncountries in the world--so that the U.S. taxpayer could come in on the \nback side and reconstruct Iraq? In other words, does it make sense for \nthe American taxpayer to ante up the money to reconstruct Iraq because \nIraq's oil has to be used to send checks to the Saudis?\n  I am sorry, I came from a really small town, but I recognize \nsomething really stupid when I see it. Has this town lost all common \nsense?\n  Perhaps we can pump a little common sense back into this system when \nwe have this debate on the floor of the Senate tomorrow. I intend to \noffer the same amendment tomorrow on the floor of the Senate, and I \nintend to get a vote on it. I know it will be second-degreed and we \nwill have all kinds of machinations. I intend to hang in there and get \na vote eventually on the amendment I offered in the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n\n  I intend to ask this question on behalf of the American taxpayers: Do \nyou really think this burden ought to belong to the American taxpayer? \nDon't you believe a country with the vast resources that exist in Iraq \nought to be able to produce these resources from their oil and invest \nback into that country? The answer is clear to me, and I think it is \nclear to a lot of Americans.\n  We have debates on a lot of issues here, and I find it interesting \nthat sometimes there is an issue of $2 million, sometimes $20 million, \nsometimes $200 million, or perhaps $2 billion, and we spend countless \nhours debating that. Well, this is $20 billion. This is a $20 billion \n``urgent emergency'' that is being moved without a lot of debate.\n  The Administration has proposed a whole list of things for Iraq as \npart of this $20 billion request, including English as a second \nlanguage training, advanced business classes, computer literacy \ntraining. The Administration wants to improve Iraq's sewer systems, \nbecause only 6 percent of Iraqis have good plumbing. Under the \nAdministration's proposal, about 12 percent of Iraqis would have good \nplumbing.\n  Another interesting item the Administration is proposing is marshland \nrestoration in Iraq. I find it really interesting that they would \ndescribe marshland restoration as an ``emergency.''\n  There are so many things in this 55-page document, that I hope all of \nmy colleagues will read, which represent the urgent menu for \nreconstruction in Iraq, and the question that will be asked, or should \nbe asked, is: who bears the burden?\n  I am not suggesting reconstruction is not necessary. It is very \nlikely that when Iraq has this reconstruction--and perhaps that should \nhappen sooner than later--Iraq will be a safer and a better place with \nan expanded economy, and perhaps we will be able to bring our troops \nhome earlier. And I obviously want American troops to be able to come \nout of Iraq as soon as possible and let Iraq control Iraq's destiny.\n  I believe reconstruction will be a part of the key to doing a lot of \nimportant things in the future of Iraq.\n  But I believe the question of how do you function with this \nreconstruction issue hanging over our head, as to who should finance \nit--I think that is a critical question.\n  I cannot tell you how many times we have come here to talk about \njoblessness in this country, people losing jobs. My colleague, the \nother day, talked about Huffy bicycles. I went to one of these big \ndepartment stores--I will not describe the one I was at--and I saw a \nbig row of Huffy bicycles. They used to be made in Ohio. Not anymore. \nAll of those jobs are now Chinese jobs. They flat out moved all of \nthose jobs. So if you buy a Huffy bicycle, you are buying a Chinese \nbicycle. Why? There are lower wages over there.\n  We have all these issues about job training, joblessness, trade, \npromotion of U.S. products and commodities, and so on. But when we \noffer an amendment, we are told we just don't have the money, we are \ndeep in debt. But all of a sudden, when it is Iraq reconstruction, it \nis Katie bar the door; we have as much money as you need; it doesn't \nmatter. All of it has to go for that; you cannot take one piece out \nbecause it is part of a package, it is symmetrical. Boy, it is one of \nthese things where, when you pull a loose string on a cheap suit, the \narm falls off.\n  So I think we need to rethink the Administration's request with \nrespect to reconstruction.\n  Now, let's make sure we support our troops. This country should not \nsend its sons and daughters to war and then say we won't support them.\n  But on the issue of reconstruction of Iraq, let's make a better \ndecision and a different decision, especially with respect to the use \nof oil revenues and the resources that exist in Iraq.\n  I will speak tomorrow on that amendment. I see my colleague from \nAlaska is here. He sat in the chair from 10 o'clock to 5 o'clock this \nafternoon chairing the Appropriations Committee. While we had some \ndisagreements and perhaps raised our voices a couple of times today, he \nis a chairman for whom I have the greatest respect. The way he handled \nthat committee today demonstrates his skill in this Chamber. I only \nwish he would support my amendment. It would be a whole lot easier to \nadopt it. It probably would not even have a recorded vote if he were \nsupporting it.\n  I thank him for his leadership in the committee. I hope we will have \nan aggressive and full debate about these issues tomorrow when he \nbrings the bill to the floor. I will pledge this: I know they want to \nmove along to deal with these issues, so I will come to the floor early \nand offer my amendments. I want to have a full opportunity to discuss \nand debate them. The chairman will not have to inquire about whether I \nam going to come to the floor at some point soon. I will be here when \nwe bring the bill to the floor tomorrow and hope to play a constructive \nrole in improving the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after a lot of discussion over the course \nof the day, a lot of progress having been made due to the chairman and \nranking member on the Appropriations Committee, the Democratic leader \nand I wanted to come to the floor and clarify and share with our \ncolleagues how we see the next several days, and actually the first few \ndays after our recess, play out in the sense that our mutual goal is \nthat we address the Iraq and Afghanistan emergency supplemental bill in \na\n\n[[Page S12180]]\n\nway that allows adequate time, appropriate time for debate, discussion, \namendments, and voting.\n  Knowing this Iraq supplemental would be delivered to us about a week \nand a half ago, we set out with the plans of last week being very \nintensive in terms of hearings, the flow of information, with the goal \nthis week of addressing this bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  Today, a few minutes ago, the chairman and ranking member reported \nout the supplemental bill through the Appropriations Committee and thus \nit is ready to be brought to the floor, which we expect to be tomorrow. \nWe will be propounding a unanimous consent here shortly in that regard.\n  We would see that bill be debated on tomorrow, the next day, and \nFriday--for the next 3 days--again with adequate time for amendment and \ndebate. Then at the close of business Friday we would begin our recess \nand spend that next week on the recess, which is through the 13th, and \non Tuesday the 14th return and continue with that debate over that \nweek.\n  The agreement is essentially that we would complete action on that \nsupplemental bill by the end of that week, the week of October 14th \nthrough the 17th, by close of business October 17.\n  In coming to this agreement, it is with a lot of good faith on \neverybody's part that we will be able to consider all amendments that \npertain to the supplemental request, recognizing there will be a lot of \namendments on both sides of the aisle and that we deal with those in a \nway that is fair to both sides. That is the general framework, and I \nwill turn to the Democratic leader to further elucidate on what this \ngeneral understanding is.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would simply acknowledge that the \nmajority leader has described our understanding very accurately. I \nbelieve we are in a position now to agree to the motion to proceed. It \nwould be our expectation we could take the bill up tomorrow morning. I \nunderstand the majority leader has suggested maybe an hour of morning \nbusiness and then we would take up the bill and begin the debate with \namendments to be offered by colleagues on both sides.\n  It is our expectation that we will have an opportunity to offer these \namendments and get votes, either on or in relation to--that is a \ntabling or an up-or-down vote--on these amendments. But it is also our \nunderstanding that we will work to finish this bill, as the majority \nleader has described, by I believe it is October 17, which is that \nFriday after we return. I think that gives the Senate adequate time to \naddress the bill, to consider amendments. Obviously we need cooperation \nfrom Senators on both sides of the aisle with regard to the time \nrequirements because, as the majority leader noted, there are a number \nof amendments to be offered. The only way we can assure Senators have a \nvoice and have the opportunity to be heard is to accommodate all of \nthose who wish to offer amendments by limiting some of the time that \nwill be required for the debate on these amendments.\n  So it is my hope that working through our managers and my \nextraordinary partner, the assistant Democratic leader, we can \norchestrate the debate with amendments in a way that will accommodate \nthis schedule.\n  But it is a fair schedule, it is an appropriate schedule, and I think \nwe have the basis of experience now from which to draw the confidence \nthat we can make this work. We have tried this now on several \nappropriations bills with success without exception. I am hopeful we \ncan demonstrate once again that we can be successful in this--I think \nthe majority leader used the right phrase--good-faith understanding of \nthe way this bill is going to be considered.\n  I strongly support the effort and hope we can have the good debate we \nanticipate and expect the cooperation of all Senators as we enter into \nthis arrangement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will simply close and say it is important \nfor our colleagues to understand that the Democratic leader and I and \nour assistant leaders and the managers have all worked very closely to \ncome to this understanding, working with good faith as we go forward. I \nappreciate the cooperation on both sides of the aisle in that regard.\n  With regard to tomorrow, I do ask unanimous consent that on \nWednesday, October 1, at 10:30 a.m., the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the supplemental appropriations bill for Iraq and \nAfghanistan, provided further that it be for debate only until the hour \nof 12:30, and that the time be equally divided until that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, with that being the case, I think we have a \ngood outline and good plan to address this very important issue, where \nthe difference in philosophies will be expressed and where we can \nimprove where this particular bill needs to be improved.\n  With that understanding, I think we could announce no more votes for \ntonight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Congress, through legislation, has \ndemanded that airport baggage screeners must be public employees. That \nwas a conscious decision made by this Congress, and it was signed by \nthe President.\n  As a government, we should be equally clear that air traffic \ncontrollers should also be public employees accountable to the people \nthey serve.\n  Acting responsibly, the House and Senate both passed provisions in \ntheir respective FAA bills that would retain the inherent \n``governmental function'' of the FAA air traffic control towers and \nemployees. But instead of affirming that the safety of air travelers is \nthe responsibility of the U.S. Government, members of the conference \ncommittee, at the urging of this administration, passed a conference \nreport that allowed for immediate privatization of 69 air traffic \ncontrol towers, some of them among the busiest in the country. This was \na failure of policy and a failure of process.\n  Recognizing the committee's mistake, the House of Representatives has \nnow moved to recommit the bill to conference. Hopefully, the conference \ncommittee will follow the mandate of the Senate and House and restrain \nfrom trying to privatize air traffic controllers.\n  This is something that boggles the mind of the people of Nevada and I \nam sure the people of Tennessee and around the country. When the House \nand the Senate pass a measure by large votes and it goes to a \nconference committee, which is made up of just a few members, they \nshould not completely change what the Congress did. That is what they \nhave done here, and it is wrong.\n  In addition, it will be important for the conference committee to \nreaddress issues dealing with the essential air service, cabotage, and \nflight attendant security training.\n  It would be a mistake for the House to hastily convene a conference \ncommittee that simply strips language dealing with privatization. The \nconference report must contain language that blocks an administration \ndirective to reclassify air traffic control services as ``commercial.'' \nThis simply clears the way for private contractors to take over.\n  Keep in mind that private contractors putting things out for bid at \nthe lowest possible price and looking for profit are going to be \ncontrolling air traffic in and out of airports. I don't think that is a \ngood idea.\n  The people who direct air traffic in and out of our airports are \nperforming critical public safety functions. I hope our colleagues in \nthe House will understand that a conference report that simply strips \nprivatization language will not pass the Senate.\n  This is in no way to threaten or cajole. In fact, it is just the \nopposite. It is an effort to beg the House of Representatives to do the \nright thing.\n  This FAA bill is important. We want to pass an FAA bill. But the \nconference\n\n[[Page S12181]]\n\nreport will not come out of this body if it doesn't have privatization \nlanguage in it.\n  This will only lead to further delays in funding essential airport \ninfrastructure and security programs so vital to the safety of the \nflying public and our economy.\n  The FAA bill is a jobs and air safety bill, which Congress must pass. \nWe can do this the hard way or the easy way. Of course, I prefer the \neasy way because it is the right answer for America.\n  I urge our colleagues to work with us to craft a revised FAA \nconference report that honors the overwhelming sentiment in Congress \nagainst privatization of air traffic control operation and maintenance, \nprotects the U.S. aviation industry from unfair foreign competition, \nand ensures that the Nation's flight attendants receive mandatory \nantiterrorism training.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later today, or at some point, I gather that \nthe Defense Production Act reauthorization bill will be before the \nbody. It expires today, so there is a sense of urgency, I gather, in \ngetting this bill done.\n  When the bill comes up, my intention is to offer an amendment to the \nDefense Production Act, the reauthorization bill, for the consideration \nof my colleagues. I gather from conversation my staff and others have \nhad that there will be possibly some objections to this amendment over \njurisdictional grounds.\n  My hope is something can be worked out on this amendment, so that we \ncan avoid that particular situation. Let me tell you why I say that. \nThis bill, if reauthorized, would reauthorize the Defense Production \nAct for 5 years.\n  Presently there is a system in place which allows defense contracts \nto go to prime contractors, where, as a result of a provision that \nexisted since World War II, offset agreements are permitted in such a \nway that despite the amount of money we will allocate for these defense \ncontracts, these offset agreements basically wipe out the dollar \namounts that would go to subcontractors and others. The net result is \nthat each year we are losing about 10,000 jobs in the manufacturing \nsector because of these offset agreements, which were written \nprimarily--I am almost quoting--to provide assistance to war-torn \nEurope at the end of World War II. It made a lot of sense to try to get \nresources into those struggling countries so they could get on their \nfeet after the devastation that occurred during World War II.\n  So these offset agreements were principally designed to assist \nstruggling nations to get back on their feet. There are a lot of ways \nyou might want to describe the European Community today but ``war-\ntorn'' is hardly one we would use to describe it. These provisions have \nexisted for almost 50 years, and their usefulness is long over.\n  This really hurts smaller contractors in the U.S. I want to lay out \nwhat this amendment will do, if I get a chance to offer it today. I \nwould have offered it in committee but I was told to wait until we got \nto the floor to have an opportunity to offer it here. Now I am being \ntold I cannot offer it here because we must get the bill done, it \nexpires today, and we don't have time to deal with it.\n  If I have to wait 5 more years to bring this up, and if we are losing \n10,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector each and every year as a result \nof that, not to mention the dollar loss, and losing subcontractors on a \nmanufacturing base, then I am hard pressed to understand why we would \nnot find a way to accommodate that which is rather modest language here \nin this proposal. I will explain why.\n  The amendment is about one thing--saving jobs. Since the Banking \nCommittee began consideration of this important legislation, I have \nbeen discussing an issue of great importance to manufacturers in my \nState of Connecticut and around the country.\n\n  I am referring to the issue of foreign offset contracts. Under these \narrangements, a foreign nation will agree to buy products from U.S. \ndefense companies only if our manufacturers outsource a considerable \namount of work to that country's labor force. This goes back to the end \nof World War II, as I mentioned. On the face of it, these arrangements \nmight seem relatively benign, promoting a prosperous defense trade \namong the U.S. and its military allies.\n  However, as I have learned over the last number of months, these \narrangements may, in fact, be weakening the U.S. defense industrial \nbase and producing considerable job losses throughout our Nation. These \narrangements are a relic of World War II, when our Nation decided that \noffset arrangements were one aspect of rebuilding war-torn Europe. I do \nnot think anybody could call me bold or rash if I were to say that the \neconomic infrastructure of Europe as a whole is no longer war-torn in \nthe beginning of the 21st century. On the contrary, it is highly \ndeveloped and very advanced.\n  Yet some of our allies on that continent continue to insist that \noffset arrangements remain a condition of contracting with American \nfirms, particularly defense firms. This is not an issue of trade or \nprotectionist policies. As most colleagues are aware, I have long \nsupported both bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, such as the \nratification of GATT and the establishment of fast-track authority for \nthe American President. I am a believer in international trade. That is \nnot what this amendment is about.\n  This amendment is about outdated practices that, by and large, have \ncaused needless transfer of a countless number of U.S. jobs to our \ntrading partners and our allies, particularly in Europe.\n  I must confess that when I first began to look at this issue, I was a \nskeptic. I thought this migration of American jobs abroad was simply \nthe painful but unavoidable byproduct of international trade, and I \nthought these losses were outweighed by the benefits of trade. But upon \nfurther study, I have come to the conclusion that these offset \nagreements are resulting in the needless loss of American jobs with \nlittle or no compensating benefits. Let me explain why.\n  What impact do these agreements have on our country, on our \nbusinesses, and on our workers? The answer is, by and large, a highly \nnegative one. This is not just the opinion of this Senator. It is the \nwell-considered conclusion of nonpartisan, highly informed sources at \nthe General Accounting Office and the Department of Commerce under this \nadministration, I might add. It is also the opinion of business \nleaders, many of whom think offset agreements are little more than a \nform of coercion. Business leaders in my own State have told me they \nsee offsets as no better than a necessary evil, a tax on their ability \nto export their goods and services.\n  The Commerce Department recently reported that in the year 2000--I \nhope my colleagues will listen to this--the Commerce Department \nreported in the year 2000, out of $5.6 billion exported by the U.S. \naerospace and defense industries, $5.1 billion was offset by these \narrangements. In other words, offset arrangements imposed on contracts \nwith American firms amounted to nearly 90 percent of their export \nvalue.\n  In the year 2002, 2 years later, and 2003, this year, the total value \nof offsets is projected to be close to 100 percent by the Department of \nCommerce on the value of these contracts, virtually eliminating any \ngains from U.S. exports of these goods.\n  Moreover, the Commerce Department says offsets are displacing between \n9,000 and 10,000 American workers annually, and that is a conservative \nestimate, I might add. With these kinds of figures, it is difficult to \nsee how the United States could benefit at all from these offset \ncontracts.\n\n[[Page S12182]]\n\n  Let me repeat the numbers. According to the Department of Commerce, \nof the $5.6 billion exported by the U.S. aerospace and defense \nindustries, $5.1 billion was offset by arrangements to these countries. \nLately, in 2002 and 2003, the Department of Commerce estimates that \nclose to 100 percent of the value of these contracts will be \neliminated, the gains will be eliminated from the export of these \ngoods, and losing almost 10,000 jobs a year is something that ought to \nconcern each and every Member.\n  What makes this issue even more distressing is that as a result of \nthese arrangements, we are not only losing these jobs unnecessarily, in \nmy view, given the long outdated necessity for offset agreements with \nthe European Community, but we are losing our Nation's military \nindustrial capacity, and that ought to be a serious matter to all of us \nhere. We need to be vigilant in maintaining an industrial base when we \ncan in these critical industries.\n  Essentially, U.S. contractors are helping other nations build up \ntheir strategic industries at the expense of the United States's \ndefense manufacturing base, and the U.S. Government is doing nothing, \nunfortunately, to stop this from happening. Our prime contractors admit \nthis is an unfortunate trend and insist they are being forced to follow \nthese arrangements to stay competitive in their foreign contract bids.\n\n  As I see it, these offsets amount to unfair trade practices, plain \nand simple. While U.S. prime contractors may be selling their defense \nsystem abroad, they are being coerced--against their wishes--into \nlaying off U.S. workers and domestic suppliers in favor of foreign \nworkers and suppliers. In turn, as the U.S. Defense Department decides \nto buy these same weapons systems, we are now even more frequently \nturning to these newly established foreign suppliers.\n  In several recent reports, the General Accounting Office and the \nCommerce Department have repeatedly tried to alert Congress to the \ndisastrous effects these arrangements are having on America's economic \nand defense security, but their warnings have gone unheeded. In fact, \nthe two major governmental bodies established by the Defense \nProcurement Agency to monitor and coordinate U.S. policy on foreign \noffsets have been effectively dissolved. The most important of these \nbodies is the interagency team on foreign offsets whose job it was--is \nor was--to engage with foreign countries in an effort to mitigate the \neffects of these offsets.\n  My colleagues should be alarmed to know that this interagency team, \nheaded by the Department of Defense, has reported no activity since the \nyear 2000. In fact, this team has been stripped of resources and staff. \nThey don't exist.\n  Certainly, we all understand that the Defense Department has been \npreoccupied with other priorities--I understand that--over the last \ncouple of years; namely, the effort to wage and win wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. No one can seriously claim the Department of Defense should \nhave any higher priorities than those. That is not my point. That is \nwhy I think this amendment is critically important to shift to the \nDepartment of Commerce the principal responsibility of monitoring and \nmitigating these offset arrangements.\n  It is an economic issue fundamentally, and the fact the Defense \nDepartment has not financed or staffed this interagency team says to me \nwe ought to shift that responsibility, considering the economic \nimplications of not trying to reduce these archaic and outdated offset \narrangements with the European nations and others.\n  For this reason, my amendment would transfer the authority over the \ninteragency team--this is what the amendment does; it is not a radical \namendment at all. The amendment would transfer the authority over the \ninteragency team to the Commerce Secretary and would require the \nSecretary to negotiate with foreign countries toward the reduction and \neventual elimination of all foreign offsets.\n  In addition, it would expand the Commerce Department's data \ncollection system to include the effects of offset on America's second- \nand third-tier subcontractors. I believe these provisions would greatly \nenhance America's response to the growing specter of foreign offset \narrangements and provide a clear picture of the total impact these \narrangements are having on our economy. But I think we ought to do \nsomething more.\n  As I said before, offset arrangements have essentially allowed \nforeign governments to coerce U.S. contractors into laying off American \nworkers and shifting their jobs to foreign employees. This is an unfair \ntrade practice, in my view, and must be addressed as such. For this \nreason, this amendment further directs the U.S. Trade Representative to \ndesignate offsets that exceed the total value of the underlying \ncontract as unjustifiable and burdensome on U.S. commerce, subjecting \nthe country to U.S. sanctions accompanying such a designation.\n\n  Already various important policy and trade organizations and \nassociations have expressed their support for the proposal I wish to \noffer to the Defense Production Act, including the International \nAssociation of Machinists and Auto Workers, the American Shipbuilding \nAssociation, the AFL-CIO, the Manufacturing Alliance, as well as the \nAerospace Components Manufacturers. This is a unique combination of \nindustries, business, and labor saying this World War II proposal is no \nlonger justified.\n  Let me explain how it works. These offset agreements they insist on--\nHolland is the biggest offender, by the way. They say to a corporation \nin the United States: You want to sell your products. Fine. But you \nhave to provide a certain amount of workers here. So instead of looking \naround for the best subcontractor to provide, say, ball bearings by a \nfirm in Ohio or Connecticut, they then have to hire the firm in Holland \nor some other European country. This was designed, as I say, to help \nEurope at the end of World War II. It made a lot of sense. But 70 years \nlater, the idea that I have to say to a manufacturer in the United \nStates you cannot get this bid because I have to do it to win the \ncontract in Holland--if it was 5 percent or 10 percent, I might think \nthat is unfair. But they are getting 300 percent in Holland--300 \npercent.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, the average is now between \n90 and 100 percent in every European country. If I thought this bill \nwas going to be authorized for 3 months, I would wait and try to build \nsupport. This bill is a 5-year authorization bill. Almost 10,000 jobs a \nyear are going to be lost, not to mention small manufacturing firms \nthat go out of business.\n  Then when we need those ball bearings, to use that example, we no \nlonger have a firm in Ohio or Connecticut, and I have to deal with a \nfirm in Holland or Sweden or some other place. It is dangerous to lose \nthat industrial base in critical technologies.\n  This provision of offset contracts has no relevancy in today's world, \nparticularly with the European community. It did maybe 50, 60, or 70 \nyears ago, but not today. I am being told I cannot offer the amendment \nbecause I am dealing with a proposal on trade, but if I do not do it \nhere, where do I do it? I have to wait until some trade bill comes \nalong?\n  Normally, a Senator cannot offer amendments on trade bills. So when \ndo I do it and where do I do it, if I want to make a point? Maybe the \nproposal will get defeated, but at least I would like to raise the \nawareness of my colleagues. If there are provisions that do not make \nsense, let somebody bring up a better idea, but I think it is wrong to \ncontinue a situation where 10,000 American jobs get lost because we are \nsitting around with an archaic idea that has no value and no relevancy.\n  The manufacturers will tell us that and labor tells us that. They do \nnot like doing it. It is like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act where \nwe were told over and over we have no choice, but our firms in the \nUnited States do not like having to do this. They are being forced to \ndo it in order to win these contracts.\n  We need to have some ability to negotiate the elimination of these \ndeals, and when they cannot get rid of them, at least to consider it as \nan unfair trade practice so we can try to work it out so we do not have \nto rely on them any longer. That is really what the amendment would do.\n  Again, this whole Defense Production Act goes out of existence \ntonight, I am told. As I said earlier, I wanted to offer\n\n[[Page S12183]]\n\nthis amendment in the committee, but I was told not to do it there, to \nwait until we go to the floor. Now I am on the floor and I am being \ntold do not do it here. So I am sort of stuck in a way. I do not want \nto tie up a bill. I think defense production is important, but to have \nto wait 5 more years to come back with this idea is something I do not \nwant to do, either. So I am using this time to encourage people who may \nhave a better idea on how we can resolve this to make some suggestions \nso we can avoid holding up this legislation.\n  I do not need to remind my colleagues, I would just say at the end of \nall of this, that since 2001 we have lost 2.7 million manufacturing \njobs in the United States. In Connecticut, we have lost more than 14 \nout of every 100 manufacturing jobs in the past 3 years. I have 5,400 \nsmall manufacturers in my State of over 240,000 people. A lot of them \nare what we call mom and pop, with 5, 6, 8, 10 people. Some of them are \nsecond and third generation.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire, as well as my colleague from \nOhio. They have similar situations with small firms in their own \nStates. Many of them provide critical technologies to our major defense \ncontractors. If I thought the offset agreements had some great \nrelevancy today, I would be the first to say we have to live with this; \nit is an unfortunate reality. But taking an idea we used at the end of \nWorld War II to help our allies get on their feet and to still \nperpetuate it in the year 2003 I think is wrong.\n  We better say something about it soon and try to do something about \nit before we just continue the way we are going and seeing a further \nloss of jobs and a loss of a manufacturing base in critical \ntechnologies which I think we will regret deeply in the years to come.\n  When this bill comes up, if it does come up, I would like to offer \nthe amendment or have someone work out something so we might address \nthis issue in some way that would not delay the enactment of the \nDefense Production Act but would give me some sense of hope that we \ncould resolve this kind of problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12183-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BIRTHDAY WISHES TO GEORGE GOLSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my congratulations \nand best wishes to George Golson on the occasion of his 90th birthday. \nA devoted husband, a father of four children, an industrious \nbusinessman, an accomplished jurist, and a veteran of World War II, \nGeorge Golson has led a distinguished life.\n  Born on October 24, 1913, George received his undergraduate education \nat the University of Columbia, NY, and his legal education at St. \nJohn's University. After practicing law for several years in New York, \nhe served his country proudly for 4 years during World War II in the \nJudge Adjutant General office in Liverpool, England.\n  Upon his return from military service, George Golson built a new home \nin Columbia, SC, and launched a new career in business. He returned to \nlegal practice in 1958 as a member of the South Carolina Bar, and in \n1973 was admitted to serve as Attorney of Law in the Supreme Court of \nthe United States.\n  In 1980, George Golson established an office in Las Vegas to provide \nconsulting services on legal matters in the field of real estate \nplanning. He became a respected and beloved member of the southern \nNevada community, and his work contributed to the dramatic growth and \ndevelopment of the State.\n  Throughout his long and productive life, George has made the most of \nhis free time. He has challenged himself both intellectually and \nathletically by writing short stories, composing ballads, music, and \nlyrics, fishing, and playing racquetball.\n  Please join me in wishing George Golson the happiest of birthdays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12183-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Houston, \nTX. On May 25, 2003, a Houston high school student was attacked by a \nteacher's aide in class because he is gay. The teacher's aide, also an \nassistant coach at the school, allegedly taunted the student with \ncomments about his sexual orientation over the course of the school \nyear. The incident was in full view of the class and was later \ncorroborated by seven or eight other students.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12183-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12183-S12184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE ERNEST F. HOLLINGS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that Mr. Mark \nShields, whose syndicated column appears in more than 100 newspapers, \nincluding The Washington Post and the St. Petersburg Times, paid \ntribute in a recent column to our dear friend and colleague, the \nHonorable Ernest F. Hollings.\n  That column was most insightful, as it examined the character of \nSenator Fritz Hollings, who, unfortunately, has announced that he will \nnot be seeking reelection to the U.S. Senate after nearly four decades \nof service in this Chamber.\n  I hope that throughout the history of our Nation there will always be \na Fritz Hollings. As Mr. Shields noted in his column, Fritz Hollings \n``was a leader of uncommon courage and uncommon candor.'' Indeed, Fritz \nHollings' leadership, courage, and candor will be sorely missed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Shields' column, as it appeared on \nSeptember 5, 2003, in The State, one of the newspapers in Senator \nHollings' home State of South Carolina, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           A Candidate With That Rarest of Attributes: Candor\n\n                           (By Mark Shields)\n\n       On Oct. 6, 1983, in a televised debate among Democratic \n     presidential candidates, one candidate said the following \n     about the 1,800 U.S. Marines whom the Reagan administration \n     had then sent to warring Lebanon: ``If they were sent there \n     to fight, they were too few. If they were sent there to die, \n     they are too many.''\n       Less than three years later in Beirut, just before dawn on \n     Oct. 23, a terrorist driving a truck loaded with thousands of \n     pounds of explosives plowed into the Marine barracks and \n     killed 241 Americans.\n       That same presidential candidate went on Nov. 4, 1983, to \n     Dartmouth College, a prestigious Ivy League school with an \n     advantaged student body, and shocked the undergraduates: ``I \n     want to draft everyone in this room for the good of the \n     country.''\n       He was not advocating the ``old Vietnam-style draft, where \n     if you had enough money, you were either in college or in \n     Canada.'' His campus audience gasped at the man's \n     discomforting bluntness: ``Conscience tells us that we need a \n     cross-section of America in our armed forces. Defense is \n     everybody's business . . . everybody's responsibility. A \n     professional army is un-American. It is anathema to a \n     democratic republic--a glaring civil wrong.''\n       You like candor in your political leaders? This Democrat \n     truly brimmed with the stuff.\n       That July, to a Washington gathering of the National \n     Council of Senior Citizens--a group with political clout in \n     its membership and Social Security and Medicare benefits on \n     its agenda--he refused to coddle.\n       Instead, in the face of runaway federal budget deficits, he \n     reminded the seniors, not of the obligations owed to them, \n     but of the seniors' own obligation ``to your children and \n     grandchildren.'' He, alone, would say, ``If I'm elected, I \n     will freeze your cost-of-living adjustments for a year.''\n       To a Capitol Hill meeting of defense contractors, pleased \n     and prosperous with President Reagan's doubling of the \n     Pentagon budget, the candidate, himself a combat veteran of \n     World War II, had been frank: ``If I'm\n\n[[Page S12184]]\n\n     elected president, I will freeze the defense budget at 3 \n     percent real growth and do away with the MX (missile) and the \n     B-1.''\n       Exempted from his proposed spending freeze? Food stamps and \n     assistance to the disabled.\n       We in the press corps are forever lamenting the lack of \n     candor in our political debates and the lack of courage in \n     our presidential candidates, who are unwilling to ask us to \n     sacrifice even the slightest personal comfort for the \n     national well-being.\n       But when we do encounter the brand of straightforwardness \n     that this 1984 Democratic candidate practiced, we do not \n     applaud or praise it. Doubts are predictably recorded about \n     ``the discipline,'' the ``presidential temperament,'' even \n     the rashness of the fellow.\n       That's mostly the press treatment Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' \n     Hollings, D-S.C., received when he ran for president and \n     publicly said all of the above and again, earlier this month, \n     when he announced that he would retire after 38 years in the \n     Senate.\n       True, Hollings gave us a lot to work with. While President \n     Bush was furiously trying to publicly distance himself from \n     the disgraced chief of Enron, Hollings quipped, ``I did not \n     have political relations with that man, Ken Lay.''\n       That was a take-off on a discredited disclaimer by \n     President Clinton--of whose then-improving poll ratings, \n     Hollings had quipped, ``If they reach 60 percent, then he can \n     start dating again.''\n       When his own presidential campaign failed, Hollings \n     reported that ``Thomas Wolfe was wrong--`You can go home \n     again.' I know. That's what the people of New Hampshire told \n     me to do.''\n       But let it be recorded that in 1963, when the states of \n     Alabama and Mississippi, governed respectively by George \n     Wallace and Ross Barnett, were battlefields of bloodshed and \n     bayonets in the struggle for civil rights, a young South \n     Carolina governor delivered a much different message to his \n     state and its Legislature: ``(T)his General Assembly must \n     make clear South Carolina's choice, a government of laws \n     rather than a government of men. . . . We of today must \n     realize the lesson of 100 years ago, and move on for the good \n     of South Carolina and our United States. This should be done \n     with dignity. It must be done with law and order.''\n       Fritz Hollings was no plaster saint. His tongue was \n     sometimes too sharp. His temper was sometimes too short. But \n     his departure will leave a lonesome place against the sky. He \n     was a leader of uncommon courage and uncommon candor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12184-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I have risen on numerous occasions in \nthe past 6 months to pay tribute to the men and women who are fighting \nin Iraq and elsewhere in the war on international terror. Today I rise \nonce again to pay tribute and to honor a young man who was recently \nkilled in action in Iraq--Master Sergeant Kevin Morehead, a native of \nLittle Rock, AR, and a soldier in the U.S. Army 5th Special Forces \nGroup. MSG Morehead was killed September 12 in the early morning raid \nin Ar Ramadi, an Iraqi city about 70 miles west of Baghdad.\n  Keven Morehead graduated from Central High School in Little Rock in \n1987. After attending the University of Arkansas, Kevin opted for a \nmilitary career, enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1989. In 1994, he joined \nthe elite Special Forces. His service over his 14-year career in the \nArmy was exemplary, earning him a number of commendations, including \nthe Bronze Star, the Silver Star, and the Purple Heart. In the last 2 \nyears, he served with distinction in the Middle Eastern theater, first \nin Afghanistan, where he served as an adviser to the Northern Alliance \nin the fight against the Taliban extremists. In Afghanistan from \nOctober 2001 to February 2002, MSG Morehead called in airstrikes on \nTaliban positions, and his actions reportedly saved the lives of \nhundreds of men. MSG Morehead was sent to Iraq in January of this year, \nwhere he served with further distinction. Although his unit had already \nreturned from service in Iraq, MSG Morehead had stayed behind to help \nwith orientation for his unit's replacements.\n  Keven was buried on September 21 in Bald Knob, AR, in a grave on a \nhilltop next to that of his grandfather. Our condolences and our \nprayers go out to Kevin's wife Theresa; to his stepdaughters, Kirsten \nInman and Kaylyn Council, to his sister, Kristen Wright; to his \ngrandmother, Zelda Guthrie; and to his parents, James and Jeanette \nMorehead, of Benton, AR.\n  One attendee at his funeral was quoted in our State's newspaper, the \nArkansas Democrat-Gazette, as saying that Master Sergeant Kevin \nMorehead ``did not die in vain. Hopefully, by his actions the world \nwill be a better place for all mankind.''

I am especially pleased with title I of the \nbill--the Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog Elimination Act, which \nmirrors the bill of the same name that I introduced earlier this year. \nThe purpose of this title and our original bill is to extend more \nFederal funding to States and localities to fight crime with DNA \ntechnology, expand our national database of DNA profiles from \ncriminals, and train sexual assault examiners.\n  While the overall violent crime rate has decreased in recent years, \nthe occurrence of rape has only increased. Tragically, somewhere in \nAmerica, a woman is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes. In other words, \nby the time I conclude my remarks, at least five women will have been \nassaulted. It has been estimated, as well, that 1 in 6 women and 1 in \n33 men in the United States have been the victim of a completed or \nattempted rape. These statistics are truly staggering, especially \nconsidering that rape is a chronically underreported crime. Experts \ncontend that rape could be much more prevalent than even these \nstatistics reflect.\n  The majority of sexual assault victims who report their crimes do so \nin a hospital emergency room, where they frequently wait hours for \ntreatment--in many cases, to see doctors or nurses who have not \nreceived specialized training in dealing with assault victims and who \nlack the proper forensic tools for evidence collection. As you can \nimagine, the collection of forensic evidence can be a very invasive \nprocess for a rape victim. But in many cases, this is where the \ninvestigation stops. In cities across the country, hundreds of \nthousands of rape kits are sitting untested in police department \nevidence rooms. While these kits contain vital DNA evidence that could \nlead to the arrest of rapists, many rape kits have gone untested for \nmore than a decade due to a lack of funding.\n  In my own home State of Ohio, officials estimated in May 2002 that at \nleast 3,000 kits with rape evidence--and maybe even more--remained \nunanalyzed, despite recent strides in science that allow DNA evidence \nfrom rapes and other violent crimes to be compared against DNA profiles \nin the Combined DNA Index System, CODIS, our national DNA database. \nLaboratory researchers at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification \nand Investigation report that they have a high success rate in matching \nunknown DNA collected from crime scenes to either the DNA of offenders \non file or to other crime scenes. That would mean that if all 3,000 \nunexamined Ohio rape kits contained extractable DNA, several kits very \nlikely could yield evidence leading to the identity of rapists.\n  We now have both the technology to analyze DNA evidence and a growing \ndatabase of DNA profiles with which to compare this evidence. This \nsystem works, and it catches criminals. Let me share an example of how \nevidence from rape kits has led to the arrest of a rapist in Ohio. Last \nyear, a Hamilton, Ohio man was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in \nprison for an April 1998 attack on a woman in a grocery store parking \nlot. Although a DNA sample from this rape was sent to the State crime \nlab 3 days after the attack, it took until November 2001--nearly 3\\1/2\\ \nyears later--for scientists to analyze the sample and add it to the \nState's DNA database. Once this sample was added, a positive match was \nmade and this rapist was prosecuted and put behind bars. Unfortunately, \nthis victim had to wait 3 years for justice, while her rapist remained \non the street. While this is an excellent example of how DNA has been \nused successfully to catch rapists, it also shows the critical need to \npromptly analyze the kits we have on hand. The longer this evidence \nsits around unanalyzed, the longer sex offenders will remain free--and \nfree to potentially harm more victims.\n\n[[Page S12185]]\n\n  The Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog Elimination Act would help to \naddress the issues I have just outlined, particularly those involving \nthe collection and processing of DNA evidence. We owe it to rape \nvictims, as well as to our society as a whole, to do all we can to \napprehend and prosecute sex offenders. To this end, title I would do \nseveral important things. Specifically, and perhaps most importantly, \nthis bill would extend the authorization for the DNA Analysis Backlog \nElimination Act of 2000. This law, of which I was one of the chief \nSenate sponsors, aims to reduce the backlog of unanalyzed DNA samples \nin forensic laboratories across the United States. Unfortunately, the \nauthorization for the grant programs established under the act will \nexpire soon, but many States still have a long way to go to clear their \nDNA evidence backlogs. The Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog \nElimination Act would extend that authorization, while also increasing \nthe funds authorized for grants under the Act. This would help States \nto further reduce their DNA evidence backlogs, processing crucial \nevidence that could bring criminals to justice.\n  Furthermore, title I would expand CODIS, our national DNA database. \nThe expansion of this database is important, since the larger the \ndatabase, the more likely it is that State crime laboratories will be \nable to match DNA evidence to offenders. Under the Rape Kits and DNA \nEvidence Backlog Elimination Act, the FBI could accept for inclusion in \nCODIS any DNA sample submitted by the States for inclusion in the \ndatabase, including DNA samples from all felons convicted of Federal \ncrimes. Given the high rate of recidivism among sexual offenders, this \nlast addition may prove very useful to law enforcement as they utilize \nCODIS. The U.S. Department of Justice has expressed support for \nexpanding the DNA database in this manner.\n  In addition to providing funds to help States and localities process \nevidence, we also must improve the way that DNA evidence is collected \nand used. To this end, title II of the Advancing Justice through DNA \nTechnology Act also contains many components of the bill I introduced \nearlier this year involving important training programs. This title \nwould provide Federal resources to support a new training program for \nSexual Assault Forensic Examiners, known as SAFEs. This program is \nmodeled on a separate bill that Senator Schumer and I introduced during \nthe 107th Congress. As I discussed before, many rape victims first \nreport their crimes in a hospital emergency room, where they are \ntreated by inexperienced staff, many of whom have no training in the \nproper use of a rape evidence kit. SAFEs, by contrast, are well-trained \nin the collection of forensic evidence and are able to give competent \nand sensitive treatment to rape victims at a time when they are most \nvulnerable--immediately after their attack. Furthermore, the \nintervention of SAFEs in a sex crime case bolsters the odds of \nprosecution and conviction of offenders, as their expertise generally \nrenders them better witnesses than most emergency room personnel during \ntrials. While these programs have proven to be effective, only a few \nhundred SAFE programs currently exist in the United States, treating a \nminute number of sexual assault victims. These nurse examiners provide \nan important service, both to the victim and to justice system, and I \nstrongly advocate funding more training programs for them.\n  Finally, title II would make two changes in the criminal code to \nbetter protect victims of crimes in which DNA evidence is recovered. It \nwould extend or ``toll'' the statute of limitations under Federal law \nfor prosecuting many crimes in which DNA evidence is recovered, but the \nidentity of the perpetrator is unknown. Also, this title would amend \nthe Violence Against Women Act to include legal assistance for victims \nof dating violence.\n  In closing, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the \nAdvancing Justice through DNA Technology Act of 2003. This bill is a \ngood one, and one deserving of the Senate's support. It can do a great \ndeal to help rape victims, as well as to prosecute sexual offenders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12185-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12185-S12186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FREEDOM'S ANSWER\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, just recently the Senate approved the \nLabor, HHS Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004. During the same \ntime period we paused to remember the tragic events of September 11. So \nit is a good moment to bring to the attention of my Senate colleagues \nand of the Department of Education the nonpartisan, nonprofit Freedom's \nAnswer project which is a direct result of the 9/11 experience--and \nwhich seeks to engage high school students across America in the \nelections process even before they are old enough to vote.\n  At a time when Senator Kennedy and I, along with many other Members \nof the Senate, are convinced that restoring civics education to schools \nshould get a high priority, Freedom's Answer is one effort that is \ndoing just that. It should have the highest priority for funding by the \nDepartment of Education within the discretionary funds of the Fund for \nInnovation in Education, the Character Education Program, the Civics \nEducation program, or the Fund for Improvement in Post-Secondary \nEducation.\n  Freedom's Answer is a totally nonpartisan program, begun by long-time \npolitical professionals Mike McCurry and Doug Bailey. Its National \nAdvisory Council is co-chaired by the Republican Leader in the Senate, \nBill Frist, and the Democratic Leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi. The \nchairs of the Republican and Democratic National Committees both sit on \nits National Advisory Council.\n  Started after the 9/11 tragedy, Freedom's Answer urged high school \nstudents in over 2,500 high schools throughout the country to seek 10 \nvoting pledges each in the 2002 election, not for any particular party \nor candidate, but rather to honor the servicemen and women serving our \ncountry and risking their lives daily for our freedom.\n  These students didn't just help set a mid-term voter turnout record--\nnationally and in 27 different states--they learned first hand the \npower of political involvement. Even before they could vote, they \nlearned the power not just of each and every vote, but also of \ncollective involvement in the political process. It may well have been \nas good a civics lesson as they could ever receive--one certain to make \nthem voters in the years ahead.\n  Our young people owe it to us to be part of America's democracy. And \nwe owe it to our young people, regardless of party, philosophy, \nreligion, income, race or State to enable them both to know how the \nsystem works and how to be part of it. Freedom's Answer is a powerful \nway we can meet that commitment, and I join my colleagues in \nencouraging the Department of Education to consider using discretionary \nfunds in the 2004 budget we will pass to help make this wonderful \ncivics lesson come alive in every high school in the land.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend the leadership of my colleague from Tennessee. \nHe's a strong advocate for better education in both history and civics. \nWe need to do much more to broaden students' understanding of American \nhistory and encourage them to participate in the democratic process.\n  Freedom's Answer is an excellent model. It is a nonpartisan program \nfounded by Mike McCurry and Doug Bailey to involve high school students \nin elections. The mission of Freedom's Answer is ``to turn today's \nstudents into tomorrow's voters.''\n  The program was launched after the tragic events of 9/11. It was \norganized in over 2,500 high schools across the Nation, asking each \nstudent to line up 10 pledges from others to vote in the 2002 \nelection--not for a particular candidate or party, but in tribute to \nthe servicemen and women serving abroad whose commitment to our country \nis safeguarding our national security.\n  Their participation was a worthwhile factor in enhancing voter \nturnout in the 2002 elections. These young students learned the power \nof each individual vote, as well as the importance of greater \ninvolvement in the political process. It was an extraordinary civics \nlesson for them and for their families and neighbors, too, and it will \nencourage them to vote as soon as they become eligible to do so.\n  I'm confident that this program will generate even greater election \nparticipation in coming years. Their participation will enrich our \ncountry and help to inspire the next generation of leaders.\n\n[[Page S12186]]\n\n  Freedom's Answer is the kind of innovative and practical idea that \nwill strengthen our democratic process and the Nation as a whole, and \nit deserves our strong support. I commend Senator Alexander for his \nimpressive leadership on this impressive initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12186-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NOMINATION OF JOSEPH KELLIHER TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY \n                               COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, earlier this year, I announced my intention \nto object to any unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up \nthe nomination of Joseph Kelliher to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. I did this because at the time, Mr. Kelliher had not \nconvinced me that he fully understood the impact of west coast market \nmanipulation on northwest ratepayers or the problems that the \nCommission's standard market design proposal could create for the \nnorthwest electric power grid.\n  Today I received a letter from Mr. Kelliher expressing his views on \nthese subjects. It is clear from his letter that Mr. Kelliher has done \nhis homework about energy issues critical to the west in general and \nthe northwest in particular. From opposing a final standard market \ndesign rule to supporting voluntary regional transmission organizations \nand making market manipulation illegal, Mr. Kelliher's letter reflects \nhe now has a better understanding and appreciation of the northwest \nenergy markets and transmission systems and the particular challenges \nnorthwest ratepayers face.\n  Based on his letter, I will no longer object to any unanimous consent \nrequest for the Senate to take up Mr. Kelliher's nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Kelliher's letter to me be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: I am writing to clarify my views on two \n     issues of importance to you: Standard Market Design and \n     market manipulation.\n       You have forcefully stated your opposition to the \n     Commission's Standard Market Design. In particular, you have \n     expressed concern that market rules developed in other \n     regions of the country may not work in the Pacific Northwest, \n     and emphasized the potential economic impact of the proposal \n     on your region.\n       I recognize electricity markets are not national, but \n     regional. There are significant differences among the \n     regions--the transmission grids are different, the generation \n     mixes are different, and the market structures are different. \n     There are also significant legal differences--the role of \n     nonjurisdictional utilities such as the Bonneville Power \n     Administration and municipal utilities is more significant in \n     the Pacific Northwest than other regions. It is essential \n     that market rules reflect these important regional \n     differences.\n       For these reasons, I do not believe imposition of uniform \n     national market rules on your region is appropriate. I \n     support regional flexibility, and if confirmed by the Senate \n     I would give great deference to the views of your region. \n     Further, I am not convinced there is a need for a final rule \n     on Standard Market Design. A better means of achieving \n     regional flexibility may be through regional proceedings.\n       Because of the unique regional characteristics in the \n     Pacific Northwest, I believe any effort to form a regional \n     transmission organization should be voluntary. In my view, \n     the Commission could not successfully mandate the \n     establishment of a regional transmission organization for the \n     Pacific Northwest, nor should it attempt to do so.\n       Markets that are subject to manipulation cannot operate \n     properly. For that reason, I believe there is an urgent need \n     to proscribe manipulation of electricity markets. There is no \n     express prohibition of market manipulation in the Federal \n     Power Act. That stands in contrast with the regulatory laws \n     governing other industries, such as securities and \n     commodities. Market manipulation should be expressly \n     prohibited.\n       In addition, penalties must be sufficient to discourage \n     market manipulation. Well before the Western electricity \n     crisis I advocated tougher criminal and civil penalties. In \n     my view, the penalties set by Congress in the Federal Power \n     Act are no longer adequate to discourage criminal behavior. \n     They need to be increased.\n       The Commission has some ability to address market \n     manipulation absent Congressional action. In my opinion, the \n     Commission has legal authority to proscribe certain market \n     manipulation practices by jurisdictional utilities. The \n     Commission also has discretion to revoke authorization of a \n     public utility to sell power at market-based rates as a \n     remedy for market manipulation. I would support exercise of \n     this authority.\n       In the past, you discussed the relationship between spot \n     markets and long-term markets. As you know, in its ``Final \n     Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets'' the \n     Commission staff concluded spot prices influenced forward \n     prices. As a general matter, I acknowledge there is a \n     relationship between spot markets and forward markets.\n       There is no question the Commission has legal authority to \n     reform contracts. In the right circumstances, contract reform \n     is appropriate. If it can be demonstrated that any Pacific \n     Northwest contracts impose an excessive burden on consumers \n     or are unduly discriminatory, or that fraud or duress were \n     present at the time of contract formation, then I believe \n     contract reform would be appropriate. You have expressed your \n     strongly-held view that the just and reasonable standard \n     should govern in contract reform cases. I respect your view, \n     and note there is legal precedent supporting your position. I \n     have not prejudged which legal standard should govern in \n     contract reform cases, and Federal courts have applied both \n     the public interest standard and the just and reasonable \n     standard. As you know, the Commission applied the public \n     interest standard in recent contract reform cases. I have not \n     prejudged whether these cases were correctly decided.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share my views with you on \n     these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph T. Kelliher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12186-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12186-S12187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ON THE PASSING OF JOJI KONOSHIMA, PRESIDENT, U.S.-ASIA INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on September 17, 2003, America lost one of \nits true Ambassadors of Friendship, Mr. Joji Konoshima, President and \nco-founder of the U.S.-Asia Institute.\n  Mr. Konoshima was well known at home and abroad for his efforts to \npromote understanding and dialog between the United States and East \nAsian nations. His career as an educator, labor organizer, political \nadvisor, and diplomatic mentor spanned more than 40 years.\n  Born in Tokyo, Japan, Mr. Konoshima immigrated with his family to the \nUnited States at the age of six years and settled in California. He was \na student at the University of California, Berkeley, when he and his \nfamily were evacuated during World War II to the Heart Mountain \nRelocation Center in Wyoming. After the war, he received a Bachelor of \narts degree in Political Science from the University of California, \nBerkeley, in 1953, and a Master of Arts degree in Education from New \nYork University in 1960. Mr. Konoshima taught social studies and \nJapanese language in New York City, and was an adjunct assistant \nprofessor at New York University for more than a decade.\n  In 1973, Mr. Konoshima organized the Manhattan teachers' union in \nbacking the successful candidacy of Mayor Abraham Beame. He then served \nas the labor coordinator for New York gubernatorial candidate Hugh \nCarey in 1974, and was the union liaison for Governor Carey after his \nelection. In 1974, Mr. Konoshima traveled to Hawaii to organize the \nteachers' union. In 1976, he became the New York labor coordinator for \nthe Presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter, and went on to join the \nnational Carter-Mondale campaign as labor liaison. After the election, \nMr. Konoshima became the National Director of the Asian Pacific Affairs \nUnit of the Democratic National Committee. He accompanied Vice \nPresident Walter Mondale to Japan, and traveled to Japan and Korea with \nPresident Carter. He played a key role in the historic visit of Chinese \nPremier Deng Xiaoping to the United States in 1978, traveling with him \nto New York, Houston and San Francisco.\n  In 1979, Mr. Konoshima co-founded, with his colleague Esther Kee, the \nU.S.-Asia Institute, an organization dedicated to fostering better \nrelations between the U.S. and the countries and people of East Asia. \nDuring his tenure as President of the U.S.-Asia Institute, Mr. \nKonoshima personally escorted Members of Congress on visits to the \nPeople's Republic of China, as well as delegations of Congressional \nstaff. Mr. Konoshima led more than 85 Congressional staff and trade \ndelegations to China, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Korea, \nMalaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei. He also hosted seven \ninternational conferences in cooperation with the U.S. Department of \nState, and a multitude of briefings on issues of interest and concern \nto the U.S. and East Asian nations. Mr. Konoshima was an advisor to \npolitical,\n\n[[Page S12187]]\n\nbusiness and diplomatic leaders on both sides of the Pacific.\n  Joji Konoshima will be missed by all whose lives he touched, but his \nextraordinary efforts in support of U.S.-Asia relations shall never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12187-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ON THE COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to speak today on the Community \nOriented Policing Services, or COPS, program. In my twenty years as a \npublic servant, I have seen only a very small number of federally \nfunded programs that have had such a measurable and immediate effect on \nlocal communities as the COPS program.\n  The Community Oriented Policing Services Program, commonly known as \nCOPS, was established in 1994, due in large part to the efforts of my \ndistinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, and the support \nof then-President Clinton. Since its inception, the program has greatly \nenhanced community oriented policing across the Nation, resulting in \nreal, tangible crime reduction in cities such as Green Bay, Wisconsin's \nthird-largest city, as well as in small, rural areas across Wisconsin \nand the country. This program has been a shining example of an \neffective partnership between local and Federal governments. It \nprovides Federal assistance to meet local objectives without imposing \nmandates or interfering with local prerogatives. It also provides \nFederal dollars directly to police departments and local communities.\n  To date, the COPS program has facilitated the hiring and training of \nover 118,000 police officers who help keep our communities safe. In the \nState of Wisconsin alone, COPS has funded over 1,330 new officers by \ncontributing over $100 million to communities. COPS funds have also \nprovided over $20 million worth of crime-fighting technologies to \nWisconsin law enforcement agencies. As Green Bay Police Chief Craig Van \nSchyndle told me last week, these funds have had a very positive and \nmeasurable impact on policing in Green Bay. Crime rates have gone down, \nschool security has been enhanced, and more officers have gotten out \nfrom behind their desks and into the communities they protect.\n  But the Chief also expressed his fear that proposed cuts to the COPS \nprogram will result in devastating consequences for the Green Bay \nPolice Department. The proposed drastic funding cuts will set many \npolice departments back decades. Already outdated equipment will become \nthe norm, and what's worse, our communities will see a reduction in \nofficers patrolling our neighborhoods. The Green Bay Police Department \nand so many other local law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin and \nacross the country are already crunched for resources due to the \nstressed state budgets in many of our home States. Due to these fiscal \nconstraints, COPS funds that we have praised as beneficial have become \nabsolutely crucial. If we allow the proposed cuts to the COPS program, \nmany departments will have no choice but to cut wages and reduce \npersonnel.\n  It is important to note in the post-September 11 world that when we \nlose our community-oriented officers, we lose first responders. This \nyear, for the first time, COPS dollars are being used to hire community \npolicing officers who will be engaged in homeland security efforts, and \nto pay for overtime costs associated with homeland security. They are \nalso helping to provide inter-operable communications technology in \ncommunities to better help our first responders communicate during \ntimes of crisis. Many of us have heard from first responders in our \nhome States about how important, and how lacking, this communications \ntechnology is on the front lines of the fight against terrorism.\n  The administration and Congress simply cannot tell the American \npeople that we want them to feel secure and tell our local law \nenforcement officers how they are, while at the same time cutting \nfunding for those officers. We must not short-change our police \nofficers. As the tragic events of September 11th reminded our Nation, \npolice officers play a vital role in protecting and securing our \ncommunities. In the past 2 years, the words ``security'' and ``safety'' \nhave taken on new significance for Americans. The COPS program helps to \ngive those words meaning. The officers who are hired and trained and \nfunded by the COPS program are our neighbors, our first responders, our \ndrug educators, and, in some cases, as in the COPS in Schools program, \nthe mentors for our children. We must give them the support they need \nso that they can continue to keep us safe and secure.\n  No police department should have to choose between having up-to-date \ncommunications devices and having sufficient law enforcement officers \nin its community, or decide whether to continue its school crossing \nguard program or to fund its successful crime-reduction programs. And \nyet, that is exactly what is happening to local law enforcement \nagencies in Wisconsin and across the country as they watch funding \nlevels for the COPS program drop.\n  I might add that unlike other important law enforcement grant \nprograms, COPS delivers grant funding directly to chiefs and sheriffs. \nThere are no overhead costs for States because the grant administration \nis facilitated directly by the Federal Government. Communities of all \nsizes are eligible to apply for COPS grants, and the payoffs are \ninvaluable. Ensuring funding in the COPS program is an investment in \nour Nation's security, an investment in our children, and an investment \nin community safety.\n  As we consider appropriations for the many Federal programs that make \na difference at home, I urge my colleagues to send a strong message of \nsupport to our local law enforcement officers: As we ask more of them, \nwe must understand the fiscal pressure they face and help them bridge \ntheir funding gap so they can continue the level of excellence at which \nthey operate. There is no question that community-oriented policing is \nintegral to the protection and safety of all Americans.\n  Again, I want to applaud Senator Biden for his leadership on this \nissue.

Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for \na woman who was recently named the American Trucking Association's \nNational Driver of the Year, and resides in Lavina, MT.\n  Since Doris Hansen started driving semi trucks in 1967, she has \nlogged more than 3 million miles. Beginning at the age of 19 as a \ndriver for her father-in-law, Doris has preserved an accident-free \ndriving record, with a personal commitment to safety for over 35 years. \nWhile Doris and her husband John sometimes drove as a sleeper team, she \nhas logged most of her hours as a solo driver at a time when women were \nrare in the business. When Doris began her career, some companies did \nnot offer separate shower facilities and break rooms, while others \ndenied women access altogether.\n  Doris is currently leased to Quality Transportation, Inc. stationed \nin Baker, MT. Since signing with Quality in 1987, she has never lost a \nsingle cargo or filed a damage claim. She currently operates a \nconventional three-axle tractor and a 48-foot flatbed trailer, hauling \ngeneral freight in ``the lower 48.'' She has also logged the last 13 \nsummers in-State pulling belly-dump trailers on road construction \nprojects, winning numerous safety and industry awards, including \nMontana Motor Carriers 2002-03 Driver of the Year. Although her job \nkeeps her on the road, she and John have raised two children. Danielle \nis now a nurse in Big Sandy, MT, and J.J., who shares Doris' love of \nthe road, is a truck driver as well.\n  Doris has been named American Trucking Association's first woman, and \nfirst Montanan, National Driver of the Year for 2003. Doris will be \nhonored at American Trucking Association's 2003 Safety and Loss \nPrevention Management Council's Fall Conference in Jacksonville, FL \ntomorrow, and again at the American Trucking Association Management \nConference and Exhibition in San Antonio, TX on October 20. I applaud \nDoris for her continued\n\n[[Page S12188]]\n\ncommitment to safe driving, and hope that she will keep up the good \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12188-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN CELEBRATION OF PHILLIP C. SHOWELL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nselection of Phillip C. Showell Elementary School as a No Child Left \nBehind-Blue Ribbon Schools Award recipient. This prestigious honor is \nawarded to schools that meet one of two criteria. The nominated school \nmust have at least 40 percent of their student population from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds and have each segment--including whites, \nblacks, Hispanics, low-income and special education students--show \nscholastic improvement, or the school must score in the top 10 percent \non State assessment tests in reading, writing, math, social studies and \nthe sciences. Phillip C. Showell Elementary School was successful in \nmeeting both of these criteria. Not only did each segment show adequate \nyearly progress, but the scores of students from Phillip C. Showell's \nhave shown steady improvement on State assessment tests over the past \nseveral years. This is a remarkable honor for Phillip C. Showell \nElementary School, attesting to the many achievements and the \ncommitment this school, as well as the First State, has for educating \nour youth.\n  Located in the small town of Selbyville, DE, Phillip C. Showell \nElementary School is home to many low-income and disadvantaged \nstudents. Approximately 47 percent of Phillip C. Showell Elementary \nSchool students come from a disadvantaged socio-economic background. \nMany students come to the school with English as a second language. To \nmany teachers and faculty, these factors can be extremely frustrating. \nHowever, the dedicated staff at Phillip C. Showell Elementary School \nprides themselves on their commitment to successfully educating and \nimpacting the lives of these underprivileged children.\n  Known as ``The little school that's big on learning,'' Phillip C. \nShowell Elementary School provides an environment that allows its \nfaculty to work closely with students. As one of the smallest \nelementary schools in the State, Phillip C. Showell Elementary is \ndescribed as a close-knit family. The welcoming atmosphere makes \nstudents feel accepted and special.\n  As a title 1 school, Phillip C. Showell Elementary is able to receive \nfunding and resources which allow them to provide for students. A \nteacher who specializes in writing and reading provides Early Success \nand Soar to Success programs for additional support to students. There \nare after school opportunities for identified students who can benefit \nfrom extra reading and math help. In addition, a reading specialist \ncoordinates with other faculty members to identify kindergarten and new \nstudents who are in need of extended kindergarten. This extra half-day \nof learning provides language, arts and reading skills that will be \nessential to these students throughout their academic career. These \nprograms were created to identify and assist students in need of extra \nhelp. The committed faculty, staff, and administrators offer students \nthe chance to fulfill their potential. These children are inspired not \nonly to reach their potential, but to strive for excellence.\n  Delaware is a small State, but we are building a growing record of \nachievement in public school education. The students at Phillip C. \nShowell Elementary School set the standard for elementary school \nstudents across the country. They truly are an inspiration to other \nschools and communities throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12188-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER ELIZABETH McDONALD MOORING\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ngreat American and a true military heroine who has honorably served our \ncountry for over 22 years in the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps: Commander \nElizabeth McDonald Mooring. She was born in Rahway, NJ, and grew up in \nBridgewater, NJ. CDR Mooring began her military career as a staff nurse \nat National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD. She quickly rose \nthrough the ranks and served at naval bases throughout the world, \nincluding Naval Hospital Newport, RI; Naval Hospital Okinawa, Japan; \nBranch Medical Clinic, Sewells Point, Norfolk, VA; and varied \nassignments at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, VA. Following in \nher father's footsteps, Seaman Eugene Bernard McDonald, CDR Mooring and \nher sister, Patricia, joined the Navy Nurse Corps, while her brother \nSean joined the Seabees in the Naval Reserve.\n  CDR Mooring adeptly served as the medical officer recruiter at the \nCommander Naval Reserve Force, Philadelphia, PA. For 2 years she \nconsistently achieved her medical recruiting goal for the States of New \nJersey and Pennsylvania. For 2 years CDR Mooring served in the Naval \nReserve and drilled at Naval Air Station, Willow Grove, NJ. She was one \nof the first women to serve aboard the USS John F. Kennedy, CV-67, and \nprovided medical support during the rededication of the Statue of \nLiberty. Because of her clinical excellence and professionalism she was \nassigned to the presidential support team for President Ronald Reagan.\n  It is only fitting that for her final assignment, she came home to \nNew Jersey. CDR Mooring served as the Officer in Charge of the Branch \nMedical Clinic at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst, NJ, and \nAssistant Officer in Charge at the Branch Medical Clinic, Naval Weapons \nStation Earle, Colts Neck, NJ. She was integral to the critical medical \nsupport mission of the Naval Weapons Station during Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, 83 \npercent of all weapons used, were loaded from the Naval Weapons Station \nEarle, NJ.\n  In each assignment, CDR Mooring excelled and met every challenge, and \nwas rewarded with greater responsibilities and opportunities. She is an \nexperienced leader, administrator, clinician, educator, and mentor. \nThroughout her career she has been instrumental in providing navy \nmedicine with the fine cadre of navy nurses, physicians, Medical \nService Corps officers and hospital corpsmen serving today.\n  Above all, she is a stellar officer and leader who always put the \nwelfare of her staff and patients first. CDR Mooring always went the \nextra mile to serve her country and her fellow man. Her performance \nreflects greatly on herself, the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense, \nand the United States of America. I extend my deepest appreciation to \nCommander Elizabeth McDonald Mooring, on behalf of the United States, \nfor her over 22 years of dedicated military service. Congratulations \nCDR Mooring and let me be one of the first to welcome you home to the \nState of New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12188-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12188-S12189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL TIMOTHY W. COY\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on the occasion of his retirement \nfrom the U.S. Air Force, I wish to recognize LTC Timothy W. Coy for his \n27 years of dedicated service to our country. In his most recent \nassignment he served as the Chief, Congressional Inquiry Branch, \nCongressional Inquiry Division, Secretary of the Air Force Office of \nLegislative Liaison, where he served as liaison between the Air Force \nand Congress on their constituent issues.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Coy was born in 1958 at Bolling AFB, Washington, \nDC. He graduated from Tabb High School in Yorktown, VA, in 1976. He \nholds a masters degree in public administration from the University of \nWyoming, a bachelor of arts degree from Saint Leo College, and a \ncertificate in legislative studies from Georgetown University. He is \nalso a graduate of Air Command and Staff College, the Armed Forces \nStaff College, Squadron Officers School, Noncommissioned Officer \nLeadership School, and the Air Force Legislative Fellowship program.\n  In August 1976, Lieutenant Colonel Coy enlisted in the Air Force and \ncompleted basic training at Lackland AFB, TX, in September 1976, and \nperformed duties as an administrative specialist. During his 7-year \nenlisted tour, he attained the rank of technical sergeant, and was \nassigned to headquarters, Tactical Air Command, TAC, where he held \npositions in the TAC Directorate of Administration and the TAC Command \nSection. In 1981, he was selected as one of the first members of the \n4450th Tactical Group, Nellis, AFB, NV, the unit responsible for the \noperation of the ten-top secret F-117A ``Stealth Fighter.''\n\n[[Page S12189]]\n\n  In 1982, following a short stint as noncommissioned officer in \ncharge, NCOIC, of the Tactical Fighter Weapons Center, TFWC Command \nSection, then-Staff Sergeant Coy was selected for assignment to the \nUSAF ``Thunderbirds'' Aerial Demonstration Team, where he performed \nduties as NCOIC of Thunderbird administration. After attaining the rank \nof technical sergeant in 6 years, he received his commission through \nOfficers Training School (OTS) in 1984.\n  Following OTS graduation, Lieutenant Colonel Coy completed Minuteman \nIII training at Vandenberg AFB, CA, as a ``Top Performer,'' and was \nassigned to the 320th Strategic Missile Squadron at F.E. Warren, AFB, \nWY. He performed duties as a standardization and evaluation missileer, \nand following his upgrade to crew commander, was selected to become the \naide-de-camp for then BG Arlen D. Jameson, commander of the 4th Air \nDivision. This job took him back to Vandenberg AFB as aide-de-camp and \nexecutive officer for Maj. General Jameson at the 1st Aerospace \nDivision. In January 1990, he was selected as one of Strategic Air \nCommand's top missileers for assignments to the TOP HAND Program. \nLieutenant Colonel Coy served as launch director and test manager, and \nwas involved in 20 Minuteman III and Peacekeeper test launches.\n  In June 1992, he was selected as part of the initial cadre of \npersonnel in the newly established Headquarters Air Combat Command at \nLangley AFB, VA, where he served in the deputy chief of staff, Plans \nand Programs as chief of the ICBM Plans Section. When the ICBM mission \nmoved to Colorado Springs, CO, at the Air Force Space Command in June \n1993, Lieutenant Colonel Coy became the force applications mission area \nplanner for the Directorate of Plans. In June 1966, he moved to the \n21st Space Wing Plans Office where he became the chief of the Future \nSystems Branch. His office was responsible for SBIRS planning, the \nClear Radar Upgrade, and conducted planning in support of National \nMissile Defense and other programs totaling over $14 billion.\n  He was then selected for assignment to the Joint Staff J-3 Defense \nSpace Operations Division, DSOD, in December 1997. Lieutenant Colonel \nCoy assumed his duties in the Theater Missile and Air Defense branch, \nwhich included the National Missile Defense program, and participated \nin development of a common operating picture for the warfighter. He was \nalso a qualified space surveillance officer in the National Military \nCommand Center.\n  In 1998, Lieutenant Colonel Coy was selected as one of nine Air Force \nlegislative fellows, and served as my Air Force fellow in my \nWashington, DC office. He worked defense issues, specifically space \nissues. His insight and knowledge was invaluable as a new member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  In November 1999, he returned to the Pentagon as the chief of \nlegislative affairs for the United States Joint Forces Command, where \nhe advocated JFCOM programs on Capitol Hill. In July 2001, Lieutenant \nColonel Coy was given the additional responsibilities as the director \nof the Washington Liaison Office, and U.S. liaison officer to the \nSupreme Allied Commander, Atlantic. On November 1, 2002, he assumed his \ncurrent position as the chief of the Congressional Inquiry Branch.\n  A master space and missile operator, Lieutenant Colonel Coy's \ndecorations include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, five \nMeritorious Service Medals, the Air Force Achievement Medal with two \noak leaf clusters, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, and the Air \nForce Commendation Medal with four oak leaf clusters. Additionally, he \nwas awarded the Colorado Meritorious Service Medal by the Adjutant \nGeneral, Colorado National Guard.\n  Tim was married for 20 years to the late Barbara L. Suiter and has \ntwo children; Brian, a sophomore at James Madison University in \nHarrisonburg, VA, and Laura, a senior at Woodbridge Senior High School. \nHe has proven himself to be a top officer, loving husband, and a caring \nfather. I am very proud to call Tim ``one of my own'' and wish him the \nbest as he moves on to his next journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12189-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PAUL STACKE\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize Paul Stacke, a widely respected figure of Minnesota radio who \nis retiring today after 48 years in the business.\n  Paul began his broadcasting career in 1955. Since that time, he has \nworked at radio stations in cities throughout Minnesota, including \nAlbany, Morris, Duluth, and St. Cloud, where he was a member of the \naward-winning news staff of AM 1240 WJON.\n  While he has had a few different responsibilities over the years, \nPaul's most notable contribution was at WJON as the station's political \nreporter. In this position, Paul brought the latest to his listeners by \ncovering the senators, governors, and State and local leaders in \nMinnesota politics and asking them the tough questions people wanted \nanswered.\n  Paul also brought national politics back home through interviews with \npolitical figures who serve the people here in Washington, from a \nspeaker of the House to a President of the United States.\n  There are many people in the media who have the skills to take \nthemselves to a successful career. Paul is qualified in this way, but \nhe is also more. Besides being a professional, Paul is genuine.\n  Bringing this quality into an interview is what makes him a one-and-\nonly. In doing so, he compels the people he is interviewing to show the \nsame side of themselves.\n  In interviews with political leaders, the result is that his \nlisteners got to hear the ``real'' person who represents them.\n  This is why Paul is a respected man in Minnesota, and why his \ncontribution to Minnesota radio will be missed. The entire State of \nMinnesota--especially the St. Cloud area--was fortunate to have him on \nthe air.\n  Unfortunately, our work here in the Senate keeps me from attending \nhis retirement party this evening back in St. Cloud, MN. But if I were \nin attendance there tonight--among Paul, his wife Carol, and his \nfamily, friends, and colleagues--I would thank him for his inestimable \ncontribution to keeping me and so many other Minnesotans \ninformed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12189-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12189-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12189-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURES REFERRED--September 29, 2003\n\n  The following bill was reported from Committee and referred as \nfollows:\n\n       S. 150.

A bill to provide for the establishment of the Uintah \nResearch and Curatorial Center for Dinosaur National Monument in the \nStates of Colorado and Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Uintah Research \nand Curatorial Center Act. This bill would authorize the National Park \nService, NPS, to construct a research and curatorial facility for \nDinosaur National Monument and its partner, the Utah Field House of \nNatural History Museum (Museum), in Vernal, UT. The facility would be \nco-located with the Museum while helping to preserve, protect, and \nexhibit the vast treasures of one of the most productive sites of \ndinosaur bones in the world.\n  Since the first discovery of Jurassic era bones by the paleontologist \nEarl Douglass in 1909, and the subsequent proclamation as a national \nmonument in 1915 by President Woodrow Wilson, the Dinosaur National \nMonument has been a haven for both amateur and expert dinosaur \nenthusiasts. At present, Dinosaur National Monument has more than \n600,000 items in its museum collection. Unfortunately, these items are \ncurrently stored in 17 different facilities throughout the park. Many \nof these resources are at risk due to the failure of the scattered \nfacilities to meet minimum National Park Service storage standards. A \nnew research and curatorial facility is greatly needed to bring the \npark's collections up to standard and to ensure its protection.\n  The curatorial facility will also fill a critical role as a \ncollection center for the park and partners' fossil, archaeological, \nnatural resource operations and collections, and park archives. \nMoreover, in these days of limited budgets, the decision to co-locate \nthis facility with the State's museum will also save taxpayer dollars. \nThe State of Utah is nearing completion of their new Field House Museum \nat a cost to the State of $6.5 million dollars. Because of the co-\nlocation, NPS staff, visiting scholars, interns and volunteers would \nhave access to the State museum's space for exhibit, classroom, \nconferencing, education, restrooms, public access, parking, and other \nneeds not included in the curatorial facility.\n  The 22,500 square foot facility will be built outside the boundaries \nof the park on land donated to the Park Service by the City of Vernal \nand Uintah County. The legislation will also permit the Park Service to \naccept the donation of the land, valued at approximately $1.5 million \ndollars. The Park Service estimates the total cost of adding the \nresearch and curatorial center to be $8.7 million dollars.\n  Other Federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management and the \nForest Service, who are also in need of collections storage, have \nbecome minor partners and would utilize a small portion of the storage \nfacility. An additional partner in the project, the Intermountain \nNatural History Association, has agreed to fund and carry out the soil \nand environmental testing necessary to permit the Park Service to \naccept the donation.\n  It is imperative that we care for these paleontological resources and \nensure their availability to future generations, both for scientific \nstudy and the enjoyment of the public. This legislation is a proactive \napproach to accomplishing those objectives and is an excellent example \nof a cost effective partnership between the National Park Service, the \nState of Utah Department of Natural Resources, the City of Vernal, and \nUintah County of which this Congress ought to applaud and support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING:\n  S. 1679. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe depreciation recovery period for roof systems; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Realistic \nRoofing Tax Treatment Act of 2003 which would amend the Internal \nRevenue Code to provide a more realistic depreciation schedule for \ncommercial roofs.\n  In 1981, Congress eliminated component depreciation and put into \nplace a general depreciation period of 15 years for all building \ncomponents. In 1993, the recovery period for nonresidential property \nwas extended to 39 years in order to raise revenue. The current 39-year \ndepreciation period is not a realistic measure of the average life span \nof a commercial roof. It is a disincentive for building owners to \nreplace non-performing roofs, because replacing failing roofs more \nfrequently than 39 years means carrying the burden of roofs that no \nlonger exist on the books.\n  A study by Ducker Worldwide, a leading industrial research firm, \nfound the current aggregate commercial roof life span is 17.45 years. \nDucker estimates that a shortened depreciation schedule will stimulate \neconomic activity and generate 30,000 new jobs in a two-year period. I \nam particularly concerned that we help America's manufacturers and this \nlegislation will provide them immediate tax relief. It will also \nprovide relief to America's small businesses, which find it more \ndifficult to absorb the impact of capital improvement expenditures than \nlarger entities.\n  Congressman Foley will shortly be introducing similar legislation in \nthe House of Representatives. I am pleased that this proposal has the \nsupport of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied \nWorkers, and I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation when it comes before the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING.\n  S. 1681. A bill to exempt the natural aging process in the \ndetermination of the production period for distilled spirits under \nsection 263A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat will address an issue of inequity in the U.S. Tax Code. Current \ntax law requires that certain production expenses of a product for sale \nby a manufacturer be capitalized into the inventory cost of that \nproduct. One such expense is the allocable portion of interest expenses \nthat are attributable to equipment used in that production. However, \nthis capitalization requirement only applies when the product being \nproduced has a production period in excess of 2 years.\n  The bill I am introducing today will clarify that, for the production \nof distilled spirits, the production period for purposes of this \ncapitalization rule includes only the distilling of the liquor--it does \nnot include time that the liquors are naturally aged following the \ndistillation.\n  This is an important clarification to insure that distilled spirits \nthat are aged for long periods of time--in some cases many years--do \nnot face adverse tax consequences merely due to this aging process.

A bill to provide for a test census of Americans residing \nabroad, and to require that such individuals be included in the 2010 \ndecennial census; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I want to introduce legislation \nto direct the Census Bureau to develop a test census of Americans \nliving abroad in 2004. The long-term goal is to develop methods to \ninclude Americans living overseas in our next decennial census in 2010.\n  There are approximately 3 million to 6 million private American \ncitizens living and working overseas, and many of them continue to vote \nand pay taxes in the United States. These citizens help increase \nexports of American goods, because they traditionally buy American, \nsell American,and create business opportunities for American companies \nand workers. Their role in strengthening the U.S. economy, creating \njobs in the United States, and extending U.S. influence around the \nglobe is vital to the well-being of our Nation.\n  I believe that Americans abroad deserve to be counted, and to achieve \nthis goal we must begin with a test census next year.\n  For many years, I have been proud to work on policies to ensure that \nAmericans living abroad are treated fairly.\n\n[[Page S12195]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 1683.

A bill to reauthorize the adoption incentive payments \nprogram under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Landrieu, Senator Bunning and I \nare happy to introduce the Adoption Promotion Act of 2003, a bill that \nwould extend and improve the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. \nAcross the country there are thousands of children of all ages and \nneeds who are waiting to be adopted into stable families. This \nlegislation provides a reward to States that place an emphasis on \nfinding loving homes for children who are in foster care.\n  The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 rewarded States with cash \nincentives for increasing the number of adoptions of children in foster \ncare, concentrating on children with special needs. Adoption levels \nwere on the rise before the introduction of this legislation, but grew \neven faster after implementation of the program. Studies project that \nan additional 34,000 children were adopted during the first 3 years of \nthe program. Currently each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, \nand Puerto Rico have received incentive payments from the increased \nnumber of adoptions. My home State of Iowa just received a payment of \n$524,000 because of its success in finding children in foster care \npermanent homes. The results are clear, adoption incentives are \nworking.\n  There are many people in this country who have opened their arms to \nchildren that do not fit the typical mold. The Lippert family of \nCouncil Bluffs, IA is just one example. Over the last 25 years, they \nhave adopted 16 children, in addition to their two biological children. \nTheir doors are still open to children in need. Within the next 6 \nmonths their nest will become even larger; they have three teenage \ngirls who are in the process of being adopted. All but one of these \nchildren have special needs, ranging from emotional to physical \ndisabilities. None of these challenges have stopped the Lippert family \nfrom helping their children become successful members of the community. \nThe Lippert family has given these children a chance to be part of a \nloving and permanent family, an opportunity they would otherwise not \nhave had.\n  But much remains to be done. While adoption incentives have helped \nstates place a large number of children in families, there are still \nthousands of children without such luck. The incentive program helps to \npromote the needs of children for whom it is challenging to find an \nadoptive home. Take for example, children over the age of 9. The \nprobability that these children will ever find a permanent home exceeds \nthe probability they will be adopted into a loving family. This \nlegislation adds an incentive for States to increase the number of \nolder children adopted out of foster care.\n  Adoption is a positive life-changing experience. My bill builds upon \nthe success of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. It \nrecognizes these successes and continues to challenge States to remove \nchildren from foster care and place them with a permanent family. \nAdoptions give children a loving home and families an opportunity to \nshare their love with a child in need. I encourage the Senate to \nconsider this important piece of legislation and continue to reward \nStates that are working to place children in permanent homes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1686\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Adoption Promotion Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1997, the Congress passed the Adoption and Safe \n     Families Act of 1997 to promote comprehensive child welfare \n     reform to ensure that consideration of children's safety is \n     paramount in child welfare decisions, and to provide a \n     greater sense of urgency to find every child a safe, \n     permanent home.\n       (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 also created \n     the Adoption Incentives program, which authorizes incentive \n     payments to States to promote adoptions, with additional \n     incentives provided for the adoption of foster children with \n     special needs.\n       (3) Since 1997, all States, the District of Columbia, and \n     Puerto Rico have qualified for incentive payments for their \n     work in promoting adoption of foster children.\n       (4) Between 1997 and 2002, adoptions increased by 64 \n     percent, and adoptions of children with special needs \n     increased by 63 percent; however, 542,000 children remain in \n     foster care, and 126,000 are eligible for adoption.\n       (5) Although substantial progress has been made to promote \n     adoptions, attention should be focused on promoting adoption \n     of older children. Recent data suggest that half of the \n     children waiting to be adopted are age 9 or older.\n\n[[Page S12196]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n        The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on \n     October 1, 2003.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Grassley \nand a bipartisan coalition in sponsoring the Adoption Promotion Act of \n2003. This legislation will reauthorize and expand on the adoption \nbonuses created as part of the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act.\n  The Adoption and Safe Families Act stated clearly that a child's \nhealth and safety are paramount, and that every child deserves a \npermanent home. Key policy changes were made to promote permanency, \nincluding streamlining the process and creating incentives for \nadoption. Since 1997, the number of adoptions from foster care \nincreased by 64 percent, and the number of adoptions of children with \nspecial needs increased by 63 percent. This is wonderful news for the \nchildren and families. But over 500,000 children are still in foster \ncare, and 126,000 of those children have adoption as a goal.\n  This legislation would reauthorize the existing adoption bonuses, and \nit would create a new bonus for children over the age of 9 who \nrepresent almost half of the children waiting for adoption. The \nAdoption Promotion Act is an important next step to improving our child \nwelfare system.\n  In West Virginia, over 900 children have been adopted from the foster \ncare system since enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. This \nis good news for the children and families, but many more children in \nmy State and across the country are waiting for a safe, permanent home.\n  Adoption is a wonderful event that changes a child's life and creates \na special family. Today, in addition to introducing this legislation, \nthe Congressional Adoption Caucus will celebrate its Angels in Adoption \nAward, including an award to a very special West Virginian, Millie \nMairs, who has worked on adoption issues in my State for almost 30 \nyears at the West Virginia Children's Home Society. Her work has helped \nto change many lives.\n  This legislation is key, but it is only part of the puzzle to \nimproving our foster care system which, according to the findings of \nthe Child and Family Service Reviews, needs to be strengthened. As more \nchildren move into adoption, especially older children, we must become \nmore aware and respond to the needs for post-adoption services. I hope \nthat future action on child welfare reform will be bipartisan, like the \nAdoption Promotion Act. It is encouraging to know that the Pew \nCommission on Children in Foster Care is working to develop \nrecommendations regarding child welfare financing and the role of the \ncourts in child welfare policy. Hopefully, these recommendations can \nhelp forge bipartisan consensus for future changes that will enhance \nthe lives of our most vulnerable children, those in foster care.\n\n[[Page S12197]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this bill to reauthorize the Adoption Incentives Program.\n  The Adoption Incentives Program was created in 1997 as a part of the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act to encourage and expedite adoptions for \nchildren in foster care.\n  Under the current program, States are given incentive payments for \nincreased adoptions of all foster children, as well as for adoptions of \nchildren with special needs. This reauthorization bill will continue \nthat program, while offering new, targeted incentives for adoptions of \nolder children.\n  There is an overwhelming need for adoption of foster children. Over \n550,000 children are currently languishing in foster care in the United \nStates. Of this number, more than 165,000 are children who will never \nbe adopted.\n  Only half of the children in foster care graduate from high school \nand only 11 percent of that number go to college. Within 1 year of \nleaving foster care, 49 percent of these young people are unemployed \nand within 3 years of leaving foster care, up to 45 percent have been \narrested and almost 75 percent have been arrested at least once.\n  Providing these children with a permanent, stable family helps them \nbecome successful, contributing members of society. I am proud to lend \nmy support to this important legislation that will help give these \nyoung people a home.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like the opportunity to talk for \na few minutes with my colleague from Iowa about the important role of \nadoption and foster care. Today, I am proud to be supporting \nlegislation that the Senator from Iowa is introducing to reauthorize \nthe Adoption Incentive Program. This is an important program that \nencourages States to do all they can to find permanent homes for \nchildren in foster care.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate that the Senator from Kentucky has worked \nso hard with me on the reauthorization of the Adoption Incentive \nProgram. I also appreciate the lead the Senator took several months ago \nwhen he introduced the original legislation to reauthorize this \nprogram, which was based on the administration's proposal. This was an \nimportant step to help get the ball rolling on this program's \nreauthorization.\n  Our legislation builds upon the Adoption Incentive Program created in \nthe Adoption and Safe Family Act of 1997. This bill sets the \nauthorization level for this program at $43 million for each of fiscal \nyear 2004 through fiscal year 2008. Through this legislation, States \nwould continue to be rewarded for all increased adoptions of children \nin foster care.\n  States that earn incentive payments for increased adoptions of foster \nchildren would also continue to be rewarded for increased adoptions of \nspecial needs children. However, the special needs payment would be \nlimited only to adoptions of special needs children who are under age 9 \nat the time the adoption is finalized.\n  Senator Bunning, as you well know, our bill would create a third \nincentive payment, for each increased adoption of all children in \nfoster care who are age 9 or older at the time of adoption. This is \nimportant because children over the age of nine are less likely to find \na permanent adoptive home. In fact, the probability that these children \nnever find a permanent home exceeds the probability they will be \nadopted into a loving family.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I am pleased that we are continuing the bonuses for \nStates that increase the number of adoptions each year, along with \nkeeping the additional incentive for adoptions of special needs \nchildren and providing a new incentive for States to focus on the \nadoptions of older children.\n  I am proud to say that Kentucky has also done fairly well under the \nAdoption Incentive Program over the years, and I am glad we are \ncontinuing the program. From 1998 to 2001, Kentucky received $1.6 \nmillion adoption incentives. For 2002, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services recently announced that my State will receive $204,000 \nin adoption incentives.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. My home State of Iowa and its child welfare program has \nalso benefited from this program. Last year, Iowa received a payment of \n$524,000 because of its success in finding children in foster care, \npermanent homes. Our States' successes underscore the results of this \nprogram; adoption incentives are working.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I am sure the Senator from Iowa will agree with me that \nwe need to make it as easy as possible for loving families to either \nadopt or become foster parents for children in need. There is nothing \nmore special than a family opening up their home to a child and \nproviding a safe and supportive environment. This is why I have worked \non adoption and foster care issues for so long in Congress.\n  In fact, last year I was pleased that one of my foster care \ninitiatives was passed as part of the 2002 economic stimulus bill. Many \nfamilies who take in foster care children receive stipends from the \nplacement agency which helps pay for food, clothes and other expenses.\n  In the past, some of these stipends were tax-free for families, while \nothers were taxable. I didn't feel that was fair, so my provision made \nall stipends that foster care families receive to be tax free. This \nprovision corrected an inconsistency in the tax code that unfairly \npunished foster care families and the children for whom they care, and \nI was happy we could finally correct this problem.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In the recent past, Congress has also taken some \npositive steps to promote adoption through tax credit. In 2001, as \nchairman of the Finance Committee, I extended and expanded two \nimportant provisions which provide tax relief for adoptive families.\n  The 2001 tax bill ensured that neither adoption tax credit, nor the \nexclusion from income for qualified employer-paid adoption expenses \nexpired. In addition, the amount of each of these benefits was \ndoubled--i.e., from $5,000 to $10,000 per qualifying child. Finally, in \nthe case of special needs adoptions, Congress eliminated expense \nreporting requirements thus ensuring that the families who take special \nneeds children into their homes receive the maximum relief possible \nunder these provisions, while minimizing their administrative burdens.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I certainly agree with you that the adoption tax credits \nare good policy, and I am very familiar with them. In fact, back in \n1996, I worked as a Member of the Ways and Means Committee to pass the \noriginal legislation providing for the tax credits to help families \nafford to adopt children. We finally got this credit passed as part of \nthe Small Business Job Protection Act which passed over seven years \nago. I was very supportive of the provisions in the 2001 tax bill to \nexpand these credits, but would like to take them one step further.\n  Within the next couple of weeks, I will be introducing legislation to \nmake these tax credits permanent. If we don't eliminate the sunset \nwhich was built into the tax bill, then the current maximum credit of \n$10,000 will be reduced back down to $5,000 in 2010. To me, this seems \nlike a common-sense change that needs to be made.\n  I introduced a similar bill in the 107th Congress, and I am hopeful \nthat we can get this bill passed before the end of the 108th Congress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I look forward to working with you on this issue in the \nnear future.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the \nimportance of promoting interracial adoptions. In the past, many times \nthere were barriers to families adopting minority children. This isn't \nfair to the family or the child. That is why in 1996, I pushed for \nlegislation stopping discrimination against minority children in order \nto make it easier for them to move from foster care into a loving, \npermanent home.\n  All of these initiatives are designed to help find permanent or \ntemporary homes for our Nation's children. Today, we are taking another \nimportant step by reauthorizing the Adoption Incentive Program, and I \nhope that we can get this bill through the Senate and onto the \nPresident's desk soon.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is also my hope that we can get this bipartisan bill \nthrough Congress and allow it to become law. I would like to thank you, \nSenator Bunning, and the other members of the Senate who have worked so \nhard on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Cantwell,  and Mrs. Murray):\n\n[[Page S12198]]\n\n  S. 1687. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nstudy on the preservation and interpretation of the historic sites of \nthe Manhattan Project for potential inclusion in the National Park \nSystem; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Manhattan \nProject National Historical Park Study Act. This bill authorizes the \nNational Park Service, in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy \nand Defense, to undertake a special resource study to assess the \nnational significance, suitability, and feasibility of designating \nvarious Manhattan Project sites and their facilities as a National \nHistorical Park. Specifically, the study will evaluate the historic \nsignificance of the Manhattan Project facilities of Los Alamos and the \nTrinity Site in the State of New Mexico, of the Hanford Site in the \nState of Washington, and of Oak Ridge in the State of Tennessee. I am \npleased that my distinguished colleagues from the States of Washington, \nSenators Cantwell and Murray, are cosponsoring this bill.\n  The significance of the Manhattan Project to this Nation--and indeed \nthe World--would be difficult to overstate. The project was initiated \nas a desperate effort in the middle of World War II to beat Nazi \nGermany to the construction of the first nuclear bomb. The effort was \nof a magnitude and intensity not seen before or since: in a mere three \nyears, 130,000 men and women went to work on a $2.2 billion mission \nthat furiously pushed science, technology, engineering, and society \ninto a new age.\n  The magnitude of the effort is easily matched by its legacy. This \nlegacy includes an ending to the Second World War, as well as the \nfoundation for nuclear medicine and great advances in physics, \nmathematics, engineering, and technology. A number of scholars have \nargued that it also includes a dramatic change to a sustained era of \nrelative world peace. But this legacy also includes the deaths of \nhundreds of thousands of Japanese, and the sacrifices of the \nhomesteaders that were forced off of the sites to make way for the \nproject, its thousands of workers and their families, and the uranium \nminers, ``down-winders'', and others. This legacy has been the subject \nof hot debate for decades, and this debate continues today--as it must.\n  There are historic facilities at the four Manhattan Project sites \nthat are absolutely essential resources for informing this important \ndebate, and there should be no question that they are of great national \nand international significance. Pulitzer Prize-winning Manhattan \nProject author Richard Rhodes has said that ``the discovery of how to \nrelease nuclear energy was arguably the most important human discovery \nsince fire--reason enough to preserve its remarkable history.''\n  But while the enormous significance of the Manhattan Project makes \nour obligation to preserve and interpret this history abundantly clear, \nit makes it equally challenging. The greatest challenge has been--and \nwill continue to be--interpreting this history in a sensitive and \nbalanced way. This Nation is blessed with historic assets that praise \nthe best of humanity and some that mourn the worst, some that grace us \nwith glory and some that humble us with anguish, some that impress us \nwith brilliance and some that embarrass us with senselessness, some \nthat manifest beginnings and some that mark ends, some that inspire us \nwith awe and some that fascinate us with curiosities, and some that \ngrip us with the fear of destruction and some that give us the hope of \ncreation. But I don't know of any others that challenge us with \nlegitimate passions for all of these.\n  Preserving and interpreting this history also includes the challenge \nof respecting the ongoing missions and responsibilities of the \nDepartment of Energy and the Department of Defense at the Manhattan \nProject sites. Access to some of the historic facilities must be \nrestricted--to some prohibited--and other precautions also may be \nnecessary. The Departments of Energy and Defense have begun to take on \nthese challenges, and they deserve much credit for doing so. The \nBradbury Museum in Los Alamos is a good example, as are the biannual \ntours of the Trinity Site on White Sands Missile Range. They have \nrecognized that preserving this history offers great opportunities not \nonly for the public, but for their employees. Employees who better \nappreciate this history will be more likely to appreciate their \ncareers, and they certainly will appreciate the boost interested \ntourists give to their local economies.\n  This bill asks the question whether we will do better to preserve and \ninterpret the important history of the Manhattan Project by unifying \nand promoting the various efforts at these sites as a National \nHistorical Park. It is appropriate that our Nation's leader in historic \npreservation and interpretation--the National Park Service--lead the \neffort to answer this question. In doing so, they will consult with the \nSecretaries of Energy and Defense, as well as State, tribal, and local \nofficials, and representatives of interested organizations and members \nof the public. The Park Service's expertise, experience, and enthusiasm \nis critical to the endeavor.\n  In asking this question we are neither celebrating the Manhattan \nProject nor lamenting it. But we are recognizing our responsibility to \nsociety to ensure it is neither forgotten nor misunderstood.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1687\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor, along with \nmy colleagues, Senators Bingaman and Murray of the Manhattan Project \nNational Historical Park Study Act.\n  This bill authorizes a special resource study to determine the \nsuitability and feasibility of developing a national park site at one \nor more of the facilities that playing a major role in the Manhattan \nProject--the Federal Government's top-secret effort during World War II \nto develop nuclear weapons before its opponents, an initiative that \nchanged the course of world history. I believe it is tremendously \nimportant for the citizens of our Nation to learn about the important \nfunctions the various Manhattan Project sites served in defending our \nNation, from World War II through the cold war, and to recognize and \nunderstand the complicated and weighty issues arising from the \nproduction and use of nuclear weapons, their impact on world history as \nwell as their human and environmental costs.\n  In January of 1943, Hanford, WA was selected by the War Department to \nserve as a part of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Manhattan \nProject plan. The site was selected for several reasons: It was \nremotely located from population centers, which fostered security and \nsafety; the Columbia River provided plenty of water to cool the \nreactors; and cheap and abundant electricity was available from nearby \nFederal dams.\n  The history of this era is a complicated one--as farmers and tribes \nwere displaced, given 30 days to move from their homes in central \nWashington. By March 1943, construction had started on the site, which \ncovers about 625 square miles. At the time, the priority facility on \nthe Hanford Reservation was the B reactor. Built in just 11 months as \nAmerican scientists and their allies engaged in what was then perceived \nas a race with the Germans to develop nuclear capability, B reactor was \nthe world's first large-scale plutonium production reactor.\n  The need for labor for the project turned Hanford into an atomic \nboomtown, with the population reaching 50,000 by the summer of 1944. \nWorkers at the sprawling Hanford complex were not even sure of what \nthey were producing, and tales of German rockets used during battles \nled many workers to believe they were producing rocket fuel. In fact, \nthis secrecy continued even after the atomic bombs were dropped. One \nworker recalled that many children who lived in the area didn't even \nknow what their parent who worked at Hanford did on the job.\n  Clearly, the B reactor at Hanford made significant contributions to \nU.S. defense policies during its production run, from 1944 through \n1968. Plutonium from the B reactor was used in the world's first \nnuclear explosion, called the Trinity Test, in New Mexico on July 16, \n1945. B reactor plutonium was also used in the ``Fat Man'' bomb dropped \non Nagasaki, Japan on August 9, 1945. The blast devastated more than \ntwo square miles of the city, effectively ending World War II. The B \nreactor also produced plutonium for the cold war efforts until 1968.\n  The B reactor is simply a stunning feat of engineering. Built in less \nthan a year, the reactor consisted of a 1,200-ton graphite cylinder \nlying on its side, which was penetrated through its entire length \nhorizontally by over 2,000 aluminum tubes. Two hundred tons of uranium \nslugs the size of rolls of quarters went into the tubes. Cooling water \nfrom the Columbia River, which first had to be treated, was pumped \nthrough the aluminum tubes at 75,000 gallons per minute. Water \nconsumption approached that of a city with a population of 300,000. The \nB reactor was one of three reactors that had its own auxiliary \nfacilities that included a river pump house, large storage and settling \nbasins, a filtration plant, huge motor-driven pumps for delivering the \nwater, and facilities for emergency cooling in case of a power failure. \nIt was the first of an eventual nine nuclear reactors that remain on \nthe banks of the Columbia River--a potent reminder of both the war \neffort and the environmental burden with which we must contend.\n  The people of Washington State, and especially the residents of the \ntri-cities, are proud of their contributions to the World War II and \ncold war efforts. We are left with these irreplaceable relics of the \nManhattan Project--such as the B reactor--which are incredibly \nimportant in understanding the engineering achievements that propelled \nthis country into the nuclear age, with all of the complicated moral \nissues it poses for the possessors of such technology. As the \nDepartment of Energy continues its work to clean up the Hanford site, \nthe country's most contaminated nuclear reservation, it is important \nthat we also honor the achievements of the important work done here, as \nwell as commemorate the tremendous sacrifices made by workers, \ndisplaced families and tribes, and this era's environmental legacy.\n  There is already strong support in the communities that surround \nHanford for preserving the history of the Manhattan Project, and I \nwould like to commend the B reactor Museum Association and Bechtel \nHanford, Inc. for all this work to date. In recent years, they have \nworked hard to decontaminate, clean, inventory, and spruce up B \nreactor's interior so that people can walk in to see three chambers. \nBut more work needs to be done if we want to preserve the reactor for \nfuture generations, which must learn about the Manhattan Project and \nits impact on world history.\n  One such way to do that is to look into the possibility of adding the \nB reactor as well as Manhattan Project sites in other parts of the \ncountry as a new National Park unit.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure passage of \nthis bill, as the study it authorizes is a much-needed first step in \ndetermining the best options for preserving this important piece of \nAmerican history.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1688. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe exclusion for extraterritorial income and provide for a deduction \nrelating to income attributable to United States production activities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S12200]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to draw your attention \nto a few very troubling statistics. Manufacturing employment in the \nUnited States has now fallen to its lowest level in 41 years. In the \nlast five years, we have lost 16 percent of all our factory jobs. In \nthe last 2 years alone we have lost approximately 2.5 million \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  These are frightening statistics. They ought to jolt every Member of \nthe Senate and prompt an urgent call for action. A vibrant \nmanufacturing base is essential to our standard of living. For \ngenerations, factory jobs have been the path to the middle class, \nproviding good wages, health insurance, and pension benefits. Advances \nin manufacturing technology accounts for most of our economy's \nincreased productivity. And every dollar spent on finished manufactured \ngoods is estimated to produce $2.43 of economic activity. Simply put, \nwe cannot become a service-only economy and expect to maintain our high \nstandard of living. We ought to act swiftly to ensure that Americans \nstill produce steel and computers and cars and pharmaceuticals.\n  We ought not be timid in the face of the devastating statistics I \ncited. Piecemeal efforts will not revitalize our industrial base. \nTherefore, today I am introducing the Securing America's Factory \nEmployment (SAFE) Act. This bill will offer relief to American \nmanufacturers on several fronts. First, my legislation would provide a \ntax deduction to any company that offers manufacturing jobs in the \nUnited States. Second, this bill helps companies cover the cost of \nproviding health care for retirees, a crippling obligation for many of \nour once proud industries. And third, I propose that we strengthen our \ntrade laws to ensure that they offer the protections that our domestic \nindustries deserve from unfair and illegal trade practices.\n  Let me take a moment to explain in greater detail how these proposals \ncan help our domestic manufacturing base. This Congress is compelled to \nrepeal the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income provisions \nof the U.S. Tax Code in order to avoid $4 billion in trade sanctions \nauthorized by the World Trade Organization. Regardless of my opinion of \nthe WTO's decision in this matter, I recognize that it may be that to \nprotect our economy from a trade war we must update our Tax Code. We \ncan do so and still encourage manufacturing by reducing the overall \neffective corporate income tax rate on domestic manufacturing.\n  The SAFE Act provides a 9-percent deduction for profits derived from \nmanufacturing activities in the United States; this is the equivalent \nof lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 32 percent \nfor the portion of profits that can be directly linked to U.S. \nfactories, mining operations, and the like. This straightforward tax \nbreak will lower the cost of doing business in the United States and \nwill help companies that employ Americans compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  In addition, this bill includes a tax credit to employers to \nencourage them to retain their retiree health insurance coverage. As \nyou know, employers and other health plan sponsors continue to \nrestructure how they provide health care benefits for both workers and \nretirees. The percent of employers offering retiree health benefits has \ndeclined substantially over the past 15 years. Two-thirds of all firms \nwith 200 or more workers sponsored retiree coverage 15 years ago. \nAccording to the most recent data, only 38 percent of such employers \nprovide retiree benefits today. Despite these reductions, the employer-\nsponsored health care system is the largest source of health care \ncoverage in this country today. The SAFE Act would provide employers \nwith a tax credit to cover 75 percent of the costs associated with \nproviding health care coverage to their retirees in order to protect \nexisting coverage and reverse the current trend.\n  Finally, my legislation would strengthen our trade protections. Our \nantidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) trade law are often the \nfirst and last time of defense for U.S. industries injured by unfairly \nor illegally traded imports. These laws are absolutely essential to the \nsurvival of our manufacturing sector in an increasingly global market--\nbut some of their provisions have become antiquated by recent changes \nin our global economy and the new structure of international trade. The \nAmericans steel crisis has made it clear that these trade laws need to \nbe strengthened. Companies, workers, families and communities rely \nheavily on these laws to prevent the ill-effects of unfair trade. Our \nantidumping and countervailing duty laws need to be updated and amended \nso they work as intended, and as permitted, under the rules of \ninternational trade.\n  For example, the SAFE Act includes a provision that allows us to \nconsider whether or not an industry is vulnerable to the effects of \nimports in making antidumping and countervailing duty determinations. \nAnother provision in this bill will make it tougher for our trading \npartners to circumvent antidumping or countervailing duty orders by \nclarifying that AD/CVD orders include products that have been changed \nin only very minor respects. This will help prevent foreign nations \nfrom making slight alterations to products that they are exporting to \nus to in order to skirt existing AD/CVD orders.\n  Another clear problem under our current trade laws is that foreign \nproducers and exporters of subject merchandise may avoid AD/CVD duties \nby using complex schemes that mask payment of countervailing duties \nresulting in the understatement of duty rates. My legislation would \nrestrict such practices by requiring the importer, if affiliated with \nthe foreign producers or exporters, to demonstrate that the importer \nwas in no way reimbursed for any AD/CVD duties paid. There are \ncertainly other changes we should consider to update our trade remedy \nlaws. These provisions are by no means an exhaustive list of needed \nreforms. But we do need to get the debate started, and I offer this \nbill as a way to re-energize the debate.\n  The SAFE Act addresses several of the most dire needs of our \nmanufacturing companies. It improves our trade laws, helps with the \nburden of retiree health care costs, and effectively lowers the \ncorporate tax rate on manufacturing activities. This package of reforms \nis an effective plan to stem the flow of good manufacturing jobs \noverseas. If we are serious about revitalizing our economy and \nmaintaining our standard of living, we must act quickly to shore up our \nmanufacturing base. I hope that my colleagues will join me in this \neffort.\n  I ask that the text of my legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1688\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n1925 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1925) to reauthorize programs under the \n     Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and Missing Children's \n     Assistance Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I urge the Senate to take up and pass H.R. 1925, the \nRunaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection Act. The Senate \nversion of this bill--which was identical--passed unanimously in the \nJudiciary Committee last Thursday, and this bill deserves the support \nof every Senator. I joined with Senator Hatch in introducing the Senate \nlegislation to reauthorize and improve the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct, and to extend the authorization of the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act. This bill follows in the footsteps of the recently \nenacted PROTECT Act legislation and presents another milestone in our \nefforts to safeguard all of our children.\n  In the 29 years since it became law, the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct has helped some of the most vulnerable children in our country. I \nhave worked in the past to extend the program, most recently in the \n106th Congress, when I cosponsored S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and \nRunaway Children Protection Act, which extended the Act through this \nyear. I am pleased to help extend it once again.\n  A Justice Department report released last year estimated that 1.7 \nmillion young people either ran away from or were thrown out of their \nhomes in 1999 alone. Other studies have suggested an even higher \nnumber. This law and the programs it funds provide a safety net that \nhelps give these young people a chance to build lives for themselves. \nIt is slated to expire at the end of this fiscal year, and we should \nnot allow that to happen.\n  In my State, both the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless \nYouth and Spectrum Youth and Family Services in Burlington receive \ngrants under this law, and they have provided excellent services both \nto young people trying to build lives on their own and to those who are \nstruggling on the streets. Reauthorizing this law will allow them to \ncontinue their enormously important work.\n  This bill would improve the law by extending the period during which \nolder homeless youth can receive services under the Transitional Living \nProgram, to ensure that all homeless youth can take advantage of \nservices at least until they turn 18. The bill would also make \npermanent the Secretary of Health and Human Services' authority to make \ngrants explicitly to help rural areas met the unique stresses of \nproviding services to runaway and homeless youth. Programs serving \nrunaway and homeless youth have found that those in rural areas are \nparticularly difficult to reach and serve effectively, and this bill \nrecognizes that fact.\n  The improvements proposed in this bill to the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act build on provisions included in the PROTECT Act \nlegislation that we enacted earlier this year. In that bill, we \nauthorized National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, \nactivities through 2005 and authorized the center to strengthen its \nCyberTipline to provide online users an effective means of reporting \nInternet-related child sexual exploitation in distribution of child \npornography, online enticement of children for sexual acts, and child \nprostitution. This bill would extend NCMEC through 2008. Now more than \never, it is critical for Congress to give the Center the resources it \nneeds in order to pursue its important work. A missing or abducted \nchild is the worst nightmare of any parent or grandparent, and NCMEC \nhas proved to be an invaluable resource in Federal, state, and local \nefforts to recover children who have disappeared.\n  Although this is a good bill on the whole, I am disappointed that it \nincludes a provision that prohibits grantees from using any funds \nprovided under this program for needle distribution programs. This is a \nsuperfluous provision that simply repeats what is already law. In \naddition, it is unnecessary because no grantee under this program \noperates needle exchange programs or has expressed interest in doing \nso. I ask Senator Hatch to leave it out of the Senate version of this \nbill, and was disappointed when he refused. The inclusion of this \nneedless provision, however, does not change the fact that this is \nstill a very good bill.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs have received tremendous \nbipartisan support over the years. The House passed this bill by a vote \nof 404-14, and the Senate bill passed by unanimous consent last Friday. \nI urge the Senate to pass H.R. 1925 and send it to the President today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1925) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/30/senate-section/article/S12206-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12206-S12208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEFENSE PRODUCTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1680, an original bill \nreported by the Banking Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1680) to reauthorize the Defense Production Act \n     of 1950, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n[[Page S12207]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of passage of the \nDefense Production Reauthorization Act of 2003. This bill will \nreauthorize the Defense Production Act of 1950 for an additional 5 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, the Defense Production Act of 1950 was originally \npassed in response to the outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula. The \nU.S. defense industrial base that had provided the fighter planes, \ntanks and ships that were so crucial to the outcome of World War II had \nbeen largely scrapped following the end of that horrific conflict. The \nprevailing view, of course, was that such an industrial base was no \nlonger needed in light of the defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan \nand the introduction into the American arsenal of atomic weapons.\n  As we learned literally within hours of the crossing of the 38th \nParallel by the first North Korean Army units, that view was \ncatastrophically wrong. The Defense Production Act was the recognition \nby the executive and legislative branches of Government that a large \nindustrial base oriented toward national defense was still vital to our \nnational security and that the usual process by which weapons and other \nequipment are procured would not suffice in a genuine crisis.\n  As in June 1950, the United States remains dependent upon the ability \nto respond to crises in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. That \nis where the Defense Production Act of 1950 continues to play a vital \nrole in providing for the national defense. Its authorities allow the \nPresident to prioritize and reallocate contracts when the United States \nis confronted by an imminent threat to its well-being, and to respond \nto those threats after they've materialized. It provides the authority \nfor the Department of Defense to go into factories that can not afford \nto maintain a critical capability due to insufficient demand and \nprovide the means for that factory to continue to produce the required \nitem. It indemnifies contractors against legal actions taken as result \nof U.S. Government directives issued under Defense Production Act \nauthorities, as was needed during the first Persian Gulf War when Civil \nAir Reserve commercial aircraft were drafted into the war effort at the \nexpense of their commercial obligations.\n  Over time, the Defense Production Act has been expanded to include \nnatural disasters as well as man-made events like terrorist attacks, \nand disasters resulting from accidents and equipment failures that can \nresult in large sections of the United States being blacked-out by a \nmajor utility failure. In short, it is an emergency capability that we \nkeep in our back pocket and hope it is never needed.\n  But the Defense Production Act is routinely needed. I have alluded to \nthe Transportation Security Administration's use of it in the wake of \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It has also been used by \nthe Department of Defense in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan to procure vital military equipment like Predator UAVs and \nmilitary satellite communications technology vital for the conduct of \njoint operations. And with the scale of contraction in the U.S. defense \nindustrial base over the past decade, the act's authorities will remain \nas vital as ever for the foreseeable future.\n  In drafting reauthorizing legislation, it was the committee's intent \nto modernize the Defense Production Act to take into account the \ndramatic changes that occurred since the act's last update in 1994. The \nemergence of terrorism, evident in the U.S. Embassy bombings in East \nAfrica, the attack on the USS Cole in the Gulf of Aden, and the tragic \nevents of 9-11, as the central focus of U.S. national security planning \nhas created an imperative that the Defense Production Act be adapted to \nthat reality. That is why the Banking Committee-passed bill includes \nnew findings and a declaration of policy: because the war on terrorism \nand the growth in scale of threat to the nation's critical \ninfrastructure of telecommunications, transportation, energy, banking, \nand other sectors of society the security of which are vital to our \nnational security and our economic and social well-being.\n\n  The committee-passed bill, in line with the recommendations of the \nPresident's Report to Congress on the Modernization of the Defense \nProduction Act and the Report of the President's Commission on Critical \nInfrastructure Protection, included in its findings and declaration of \npolicy this emphasis on the war on terrorism and critical \ninfrastructure protection. In addition, language was added intended to \nfurther strengthen the linkage between critical infrastructure and the \nauthorities provided by the Defense Production Act during committee \nconsideration of this bill.\n  Unfortunately, this modernization of the act was more than the other \nchamber could swallow right now. That is why the ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, and I will offer an amendment in \nthe nature of a substitute. Because the Defense Production Act expires \ntoday, there would be no time for a protracted conference. \nConsequently, the Banking Committee and its House counterpart have \nagreed to a more modest update of the Act. The amendment by the ranking \nmember and me does the following:\n  Reauthorizes the Defense Production Act for five years, as requested \nby the Defense Department;\n  Provides funding the department requested for hardening electronics \nagainst the effects of radiation;\n  Clarifies the President's authority to obtain information needed for \nthe performance of assessments of the U.S. defense industrial base--a \nprovision requested by the Department of Commerce; and\n  Formally incorporates the concept of critical infrastructure \nprotection under Defense Production Act authorities by including it \nunder the definition of ``national defense.''\n  Mr. President, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the Senate \npassing the amendment in the nature of a substitute and then voting on \nfinal passage as soon as possible. The minute the Defense Production \nAct lapses, vital authorities for the conduct of military operations in \nAfghanistan and Iraq disappear. I urge my colleagues' support for the \namendment and for final passage of the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Defense \nProduction Act Reauthorization of 2003.\n  The Defense Production Act provides the President with important \nauthorities to ensure the availability of industrial resources to meet \nnational security needs and to deal with domestic civil emergencies. \nThis is obviously a period in which the authorities of the DPA are \nbeing actively utilized. The DPA expires today, September 30. The \nAdministration has made clear that the reauthorization of the DPA is a \nhigh priority.\n  The Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs marked up and \nreported out this bill last week by unanimous consent. The House \nFinancial Services Committee, our counterpart Committee, has also \nreported out a reauthorization of the DPA that is pending on the House \nfloor. Both bills are essentially simple extensions of the DPA with \nminor changes requested by the Administration. The imminent expiration \nof the authorities of the DPA led the staff of the two committees to \nmeet last week to reconcile the few differences between the two bills. \nThat has been accomplished, and Senator Shelby and I will shortly offer \nan amendment in the nature of a substitute reflecting that agreement.\n  Both bills contained provisions requested by the Administration to \ncorrect the industrial resource shortfall for radiation-hardened \nelectronics, and to clarify the President's authority under the DPA to \nobtain information in order to perform industry studies assessing the \ncapabilities of the United States industrial base to support the \nnational defense.\n  The Senate bill also contained a provision sponsored by Senator \nBennett, which makes explicit that the authorities of the DPA can be \nused to protect and restore critical infrastructure. This authority \ntakes on a heightened sense of importance in the aftermath of 9/11, and \nis retained in the substitute amendment with the strong support of the \nAdministration. The Senate bill provides for a 5 year authorization, as \nrequested by the Administration, and the House bill provides for a 4 \nyear authorization. Senator Dodd has raised a concern about the need to \naddress the issue of offsets, which falls under the authority of the \nDPA. As a result, the\n\n[[Page S12208]]\n\nsubstitute will provide for a 1 year authorization. This is essentially \nthe package.\n  I would like to commend Chairman Shelby and his staff for working \ncooperatively to bring this bill and the substitute amendment before \nthe Senate today. I hope the Senate can act promptly to pass this \nlegislation and send it over to the House. I believe the House will \nthen be in a position to take up the Senate bill, pass it, and send it \nto the White House for the President's signature. That would ensure the \ncontinued availability of the important authorities of the Defense \nProduction Act.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBanking Committee for all his efforts to bring the reauthorization of \nthe Defense Production Act to the floor. It is excellent legislation, \nand I support it wholeheartedly. I particularly want to express my \nappreciation for the agreement that was reached to reconsider this \npiece of legislation in 1 year. That will allow the Defense Production \nAct to continue uninterrupted, while also providing us with the \nopportunity to address the very grave concerns that are shared by many \nSenators about the issue of foreign offset arrangements over the next \nyear.\n  According to the General Accounting Office and Department of \nCommerce, these arrangements serve no positive purpose. And yet, \noffsets are displacing 9,500 American workers annually. In 2000, the \nCommerce Department reports that out of $5.6 billion exported by the \nU.S. aerospace and defense industries, $5.1 billion was ``offset'' by \nthese arrangements. In other words, offset arrangements imposed on \ncontracts with American firms amounted to nearly 90 percent of their \nexport value. And in the years 2002 and 2003, the total value of \noffsets are projected to be close to 100 percent of the value of those \ncontracts--virtually eliminating any gains from U.S. exports of these \ngoods.\n  Once again, I appreciate the willingness of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee for agreeing to work with me on this \nissue as we assess additional reauthorization legislation for the \nDefense Production Act in the coming months.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut and look forward to continuing \nwork with my colleagues on these important issues concerning the needs \nof our military industrial base. The Defense Production Act is an \nimportant piece of legislation that provides vital authorities to the \nDepartments of Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy to \nprepare for and respond to crises. These provisions are particularly \nimportant during this time as the nation prosecutes its war on terror. \nThe act's authorities allow government agencies to allocate contracts \nand re-prioritize contracts to meet emergency requirements. And it also \nprovides authority to these agencies, especially the Defense \nDepartment, to work with private industry to ensure they have the \nindustrial capabilities required to meet national security requirements \nthat economics alone would otherwise allow to atrophy.\n  I am pleased the Senate will act on this legislation before it \nexpires at midnight tonight.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3146, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3146) to extend the Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families block grant program and certain tax and trade \n     programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his work \non the extension for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \nprogram. Unfortunately, this program has had to be extended several \ntimes while the Senate finance Committee worked to complete a very \nambitious agenda.\n  Happily, though, the Senate finance Committee was able to report a \nwelfare reauthorization bill on September 10, 2003. I plan to file the \ncommittee bill shortly. It is critical that the Senate act swiftly to \ncomplete action on this legislation. This program has languished, \nunauthorized, for a year. States need to make plans to adjust to the \nnew provisions. Recipients need some assurances that the program will \ncontinue.\n  It was my preference that Senate action on the welfare bill take \nplace this fall, but I understand that the time frame for adjournment \nis fluid and this impacts what the Leader is able to bring to the \nfloor. Additionally, I would have preferred a shorter extension, in \norder to keep the process moving forward. I do not want to send the \nsignal that since we are passing a 6-month extension, this means that \nthere will be no action on this legislation until March next year. If \nthat should occur, we would find ourselves in the position of having to \nseek yet another extension. This is a situation which can only be \navoided, in my view, by prompt action on this legislation.\n  I understand why the majority leader wants a 6-month extension \nbecause I recognize that it is nearly impossible to envision a scenario \nin which the Senate passes a bill, the House and Senate have a \nconference, a conference report is drafted and filed and the measure \ngoes back to both houses for a final vote, prior to a possible \nadjournment date in late November. But if it becomes at all possible \nfor the Senate to act on the legislation in what remains of this \nsession, leaving conference committee consideration for early next \nyear, we should certainly do that.\n  It is my intention, if a window of opportunity does open up before we \nadjourn for the year, to work with the Leadership to bring this \nlegislation up for consideration. In the event that such a window of \nopportunity does not open up in what remains of this session, I am \nconfident that this bill will be among the first pieces of legislation \nbrought up for consideration as soon as we reconvene next year.\n\n\n                        montana's welfare waiver\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as we have worked over the last 2 years to \nreauthorize the 1996 landmark welfare reform law, I have often talked \nwith pride about the welfare reform program in my own State of Montana. \nMontana was a welfare reform pioneer, embarking on reform under a \nwaiver before 1996. We have continued to operate a program under that \nwaiver and it has served us well.\n  The number of Montana families receiving monthly welfare checks is \ndown sharply since the early 1990s. Under the waiver program, Montana \nachieved a participation rate of 84 percent in fiscal year 2002, \ndespite a struggling economy. Montana is a regular recipient of ``high \nperformance'' bonus awards, especially for the key criteria of moving \nwelfare recipients quickly into jobs. An independent study by Abt \nAssociates concluded that under Montana's program ``a Work First model \nhas been implemented effectively in varied rural settings, including \nIndian reservations and remote areas'' and that it reflects an \n``efficient and successful'' strategy. In other words, we're on the \nright track.\n  However, the waiver expires on December 31. We would like it \nextended. Given our track record, we think it is only common sense to \ncontinue a successful model. Others, unfortunately, have opposed such \nan extension. It is an issue we expect to be debated during \nconsideration of the full 5 year reauthorization bill.\n  As we extend the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, \nprogram for 6 months, I want to confirm with the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee, that he is willing to work with me to ensure \nthat the welfare reauthorization bill allows Montana to maintain the \nsuccessful direction of the program it has operated under its waiver. \nGiven his efforts to work in a bipartisan manner, I am optimistic we \nwill be able to reach an understanding on these policies.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I understand the concerns of the Senator \nfrom Montana, and look forward to continuing to work with him to \nreauthorize the TANF program in the coming months. I appreciate his \nconcern for the need for Montana to pursue welfare policies it believe \nmake sense in that State. I agree that we will discuss these and other \nissues as we reauthorize the TANF program and am also optimistic we \nwill be able to reach an understanding on these policies.\n  Mr. President, current law penalizes rural and small urban facilities \nby paying them 1.6 percent less on every inpatient discharge than their \ncounterparts in urban areas of a million or more people. This is one \nreason for MedPAC's finding that Medicare inpatient profit margins are \nsubstantially worse for rural and small urban facilities than for those \nlocated in large urban areas.\n  The provision raises the inpatient base rate for hospitals in rural \nand small urban areas to the same rate as that in large urban areas \nfrom October 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004. Every State except Rhode \nIsland has rural or small urban hospitals, so 49 States will benefit \nfrom this provision.\n  The fiscal year 2003 omnibus Appropriations bill included a 6-month \nversion of this policy. The policy ends on September 30, 2003. A \npermanent version of this policy was included in the Senate- and House-\npassed prescription drug bills this summer. MedPAC has endorsed a \npermanent version of this policy in its 2003 recommendations.\n  The cost of the provision is $300 million, for the 6-month period \nbeginning October 1, 2003 and ending March 31, 2004, according to \npreliminary scores from CBO.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the preliminary CBO \nestimates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  PRELIMINARY CBO ESTIMATE OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET EFFECTS OF H.R. 3146--BASED ON DRAFT LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE, THOMAS.068, DATED SEPTEMBER 29, 2003 (11:22\n                                                      AM)--ESTIMATED USING CBO MARCH 2003 BASELINE\n                                                        [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     2004    2005    2006    2007    2008    2009    2010    2011    2012    2013   2004-2008  2004-2013\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \n      Title I: Family assistance Provisions\n \nFund Supplemental Grants for 2 quarters:\n    Budget Authority.............................      191       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       191        191\n    Outlays......................................       96      38      19      19      19       0       0       0       0       0       191        191\nIncrease Transfer Authority to 10 percent for 2\n quarters:\n    Budget Authority.............................        0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0         0          0\n    Outlays......................................       77     -14     -28     -15     -15      -5       0       0       0       0         5          0\nExtend TMA through March 2004:\n    Budget Authority.............................       86     135      19       4       0      -1       0       0       0      -1       244        242\n    Outlays......................................       83     130      20       5       0       0       0       1       0       0       238        239\n\n[[Page S12210]]\n\n \nExtend Abstinence Education Grants for 2\n quarters:\n    Budget Authority.............................       25       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0        25         25\n    Outlays......................................        7       9       3       2       1       0       0       0       0       0        22         22\nExtend TANF Research Funding for 2 quarters:\n    Budget Authority.............................        8       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0         8          8\n    Outlays......................................        1       3       4       0       0       0       0       0       0       0         8          8\nExtend Child Welfare Research Funding for 2\n quarters:\n    Budget Authority.............................        3       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0         3          3\n    Outlays......................................
