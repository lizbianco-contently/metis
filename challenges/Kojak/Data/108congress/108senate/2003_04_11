Mr. President, as I have said before, every day our \ntroops have been in the field the Senate has opened with a tribute to \nthem. We have had Members from both sides, from many States, talk about \ntheir own Members and colleagues. We have talked about different groups \nin the field. I begin today giving a tribute to a group of Navy \nreservists from Texas who are making history in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  The unit is the Strike Fighter Squadron that hails from the Joint \nReserve base at Fort Worth. As we speak, the members of this \noutstanding unit are flying jet fighters in combat against Saddam \nHussein's evil regime. They are best known by their nickname the \n``Hunters.''\n  When President Bush ordered the Hunters to active duty last October, \nthis distinguished squadron joined the crew of the aircraft carrier USS \nTheodore Roosevelt for duty in the Persian Gulf--the first time since \nthe Korean War that an entire Naval Air Reserve squadron has deployed \naboard an aircraft carrier.\n  Since then, the Hunters have exceeded all of the Navy's requirements. \nThe 12 Hornets that comprise the squadron have flown 1,500 sorties over \nIraq. The air crews have made more than 500 landings aboard the \nTheodore Roosevelt at night and nearly twice that number during the \nday.\n  But it takes more than just remarkable statistics to truly tell how \nwell the Hunters are serving our Nation. You can hear the pride in \ntheir voices. One crew member described the personal sacrifices his \ncomrades were making when he said, ``Some of us are taking pay cuts of \n$50,000 to $100,000 per year to be out here and make this happen. We're \nhappy to be a part of this ship and this air wing, and we're ready to \ndo our job.'' Many of the pilots left their jobs as civilian airline \npilots to fight for our country.\n  These brave Naval reservists also are facing what many feel is the \nworst part of a deployment: being away from family. That means missing \nbirthdays, anniversaries, and other important family obligations that \nare gone forever. Yet they are undaunted. One proud member said, \n``We're leaving our jobs and our families behind until this \nmobilization is done. Several members of the squadron are also \ngeographic bachelors who don't live in Fort Worth, which means that \nthey'll still be away from their loved ones after we've come back to \nbase.''\n  The feeling among members of the squadron is that each volunteered to \nserve in the operation they describe as ``America's Big Stick.'' One \nofficer pointed out, ``If our country needs us, we're going to step up, \nbecause this job is about something that's bigger than all of us.''\n  Mr. President, with volunteers like the Hunters, this operation and \nthe future of our national security is in good hands. We owe them and \ntheir families a debt we never can repay.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the world has been watching images from \nIraq, of the Iraqi people celebrating the end of a brutal tyranny, and \nof the American soldiers who have given the Iraqi people hope for a new \nbeginning.\n  Over the past 3 weeks, the men and women of America's Armed Forces \nhave shown a degree of precision and professionalism unprecedented in \nmilitary history. Their commitment to their country builds on the \nexpectations, traditions and character of those who have gone before \nthem. It builds on the traditions of over two centuries of American \ncourage and sense of honor, built by people such as Dan Inouye, Bob \nDole, Charlie Rangel, John McCain and millions of other American \nveterans.\n  The end of Saddam's regime does not end our commitment in Iraq. It is \nonly the beginning. America's soldiers will continue to face great \nrisks in Iraq. Lives will continue to be lost.\n  Restoring order, peace-keeping, and rebuilding in Iraq are the tasks \nahead, and our men and women in uniform will be asked to risk their \nlives to meet these challenges, as they have in bringing an end to \nSaddam Hussien's tyranny.\n  Among the many brave men and women who have sacrificed in Iraq, I \nwould like to acknowledge the contributions and sacrifices of those men \nand women in uniform from my State of Nebraska.\n  Thousands of Nebraskans are on active duty in the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marines and Coast Guard. Their stories are the stories of \nAmerica's courage, achievement, and sacrifice in Iraq.\n  On Monday, Army LTC Mike Presnell phoned his mother in Grand Island, \nNE. He placed the call on a reporter's phone from the gold-plated \nbathroom in one of Saddam Hussien's Baghdad palaces, now under \ncoalition control.\n  Colonel Presnell told his mother about his historic experience and \nhow proud he was of his colleagues.\n  Nearly 60 years after the first American landed at Omaha Beach, a \ncourageous Omahan landed the first coalition aircraft at Baghdad \nInternational Airport.\n  Piloting an Apache helicopter disabled by enemy gunfire unable to \nradio for help, CWO 4 Greg Inman, Of Omaha, NEB, touched down shortly \nafter U.S. forces staked claim to the airport. Warrant Officer Inman's \nlanding was the standard for the courageous service that we have come \nto expect from our forces in Iraq.\n  CPT Travis Ford, a 30-year-old Marine from Ogallala, NE, lost his \nlife in service to his country. Captain Ford was killed on April 4 when \nhis Cobra helicopter crashed during combat operations near Ali \nAziziyal, Iraq. He leaves behind a wife and 2-year-old daughter. He \nwas, in the word's of his father-in-law, a ``Marine's Marine.''\n  I spoke to his mother and wife yesterday. His mother, Josie Ford \nsaid, ``Senator, Travis did something very important for his country. \nI'm proud of him.'' Mrs. Ford, we're all proud of him.\n  Our military men and women are the Nation's quiet heroes, for there \nis no glory in war.\n  Behind headlines and beyond breaking news, there is the human \nstruggle and the human tragedy. Lives are risked and lost.\n  The experience of war reinforces the desire for peace. General \nDouglas MacArthur once said:\n\n       The soldier above all other people prays for peace, for he \n     must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.\n\n  Our sacrifices in Iraq, we pray, will make a better and more secure \nlife for the people of America, Iraq and the world.\n  For their service, bravery and sacrifice, in this noble cause of \ndefending freedom and making a better world, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing--in honoring--the men and women of the United \nStates Armed Forces. They have always been America's quiet heroes. Upon \ntheir sacrifice and courage we are inspired to build a more noble and \njust world.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle for coming down and being a part of what we have to do \nhere in the Senate. It is incredibly important that we pay tribute to \nour troops. We see much progress over recent days in the conflict in \nIraq, in our efforts to topple a totalitarian regime that has been \nincredibly harsh on its people. The progress we have seen is \nincredible, and it is due to the unbelievable professionalism and \ntraining of the service men and women in the Armed Forces of the United \nStates. They have done an incredible job. They have had the best \ntechnology. We have had the best individuals, professionally trained, \nout there making an enormous difference.\n  I think all you have to do is look at what we have done in Baghdad on \nthe Iraqi regime's strategic sites, where we have tried so diligently \nand our forces have been so successful in minimizing what has happened \nto the civilians in Iraq. We have also seen the joy on the faces of the \nIraqi people as they have seen the liberation from a regime that has \nbeen so daunting to them.\n  I come from a rural State. It is most important, certainly when you \nlive out\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\nin the rural areas, to have good neighbors because you depend on your \nneighbors for a lot, whether you need to borrow a cup of sugar or you \nneed someone to help you bring your crops in from the field or, more \nimportantly, the way we depend on our neighbors to help us as a \ncommunity in raising our families, making sure we are safe.\n  We are in a global community now. Our actions in Iraq that will \nfollow--and in neighboring countries--in rebuilding not only Iraq but \ncertainly the alliances we have with other countries, are going to be \nso important. These are our neighbors in the global community.\n  I think we are all anxious to see other nations join, those that may \nnot have been there during the war, in making sure those alliances will \nbe made and that we will have a concerted effort globally in rebuilding \nIraq and the total of the Middle East because we all understand how \nimportant it is in the global community for us to have good neighbors. \nThere is no doubt the Iraqi people, with the assistance of the U.N., \nthe United States, and other alliances and neighbors, can build a very \nstrong democracy which will be a guidepost as well as a good example \nfor others.\n  I, too, want to reach out to our soldiers, our men and women in the \narmed services. One of the most important thoughts I have heard from \nsome of our service men and women is for us here in the States and at \nhome to reach out to their families. We have an incredible opportunity, \nas Senator Hutchison has said, to recognize those missed birthdays--\nthey have missed births altogether--important dates, and other events. \nLet's make sure in our communities we reach out to those families; that \nwe lift them up in our prayers and reach out in ways in which we can be \nhelpful. I think one of the greatest ways we can honor the men and \nwomen who are serving us in the Armed Forces is to reach out to their \nfamilies and make sure we are supportive.\n  I know we have a medical unit out in Jonesboro, AR, that is headed \nnow to Washington to finish up training in Walter Reed. They will be \nshipped out shortly after that to Kuwait. We are seeing new families \nwho are obviously having their loved ones shipped out. We want to make \nsure we continue the process of supporting them.\n\n  As we look to that rebuilding, we know the reconstruction in Iraq is \ngoing to be challenging. But because of the professionalism, because of \nthe technical aspects of the Armed Forces of the United States, the \nrebuilding will be not nearly as challenging as that of past wars \nbecause we have been able to determine where we wanted to make the \nbiggest impact and target that without disturbing, as much as was \npossible, the overall community in Iraq, particularly civilians.\n  We pay tribute once again to the troops, to our service men and \nwomen. We are very proud of their professionalism, their technical \ncapabilities. We lift up their families once again as a body in prayer \nfor all of them.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to honor the \ncontributions of Montanans serving overseas. There are thousands of \nMontanans in harm's way. Today I would like to mention a few.\n  Army SGT Charles Horgan is a soldier with the Army's 1st Battalion, \n30th Infantry Scout Platoon of Fort Benning, GA. Many of you \nundoubtedly heard the stories of battle outside of the Iraqi city of An \nNasiriyah. Sergeant Horgan was a Humvee gunner in the lead scout unit. \nHis vehicle encountered a group of Iraqis in Bedouin robes running the \nother direction.\n  A wire-guided missile struck the bridge, blowing him from his gunning \nposition. Shrapnel from the rocket tore open his leg and foot and \nwounded the driver, SSG. Jamie Villafane. For the next 10 minutes, \ntheir unit was engulfed in a shootout with enemy troops. Charles \nHorgan, part of his right heel blown off, crawled to safety. Horgan is \ncurrently recovering at Walter Reed.\n  It is not known if Horgan will ever walk again unaided. He is 21 \nyears old from Helena, MT, and a graduate of Helena High--my alma \nmater. He is an aspiring artist who loves drawing. I wish him the best \nas he recovers, and I take my hat off to him.\n  I talked to him on the phone the night before last. I have talked to \nhis parents a couple of times. He will be on his way home to Montana \nvery shortly. He is a terrific young man.\n  Navy E3 Phillip Lance Stewart, 20, a 2001 graduate of Great Falls \nHigh in Great Falls, MT, is a firefighter aboard the USS Abraham \nLincoln in the Persian Gulf.\n  Lance, the son of Chuck and Gail Stewart and grandson of Delphine \nMurphy, all of Great Falls, told his family in a short phone call \nrecently that the letters and boxes from family and friends is what \nkeeps all of them going.\n  He also really misses his brothers and sister--and that is a lot to \nmiss because Lance has six brothers and sisters, including a twin \nbrother.\n  Lance's family has decorated his house with big yellow ribbons and \ncan hardly wait until Lance is home again, safe and sound.\n  Army PFC Sedar Steinert, 19 a former North Middle School and Skyline \nAlternative School student from Great Falls, MT, was deployed to Iraq \nwith the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, with headquarters at Fort Polk, \nLA.\n  Sedar's unit is providing artillery and scout support on the road to \nBaghdad. We all hope for his safe return.\n  SP Ryan Richard Carpenter was born in Dillon, MT. His family \ncurrently resides in Belgrade and Dillon, MT. His parents are Richard \nand Julie Carpenter. Specialist Carpenter joined the Army Reserve in \n1997 and met his wife in 2001. His wife is also in the Army Reserve, \nthe couple met while serving an Army Reserve drill weekend that was \nfocused on night vision goggle training.\n  During the drill weekend the couple's squad's call name for the \ntraining exercise was Ammo 3. That is what they called it: Ammo 3. From \nthat chance encounter, the couple soon realized that they signed up for \nthe Army Reserve in the same month of the same year, but met by chance \nroughly 4 years later. The couple was married later that year\n  Specialist Carpenter was called up to active on February 7, 2003, and \nis serving with the 811th Ammunition Ordnance Company, based out of \nWest Virginia. The unit has been stationed at Camp New York since \narriving in Kuwait and will soon be going into Iraq to provide \nammunition support for the 101st Airborne. Specialist Carpenter was \nable to contact his wife from Kuwait and let her know that he had \narrived safely and was in good health.\n  During the conversation, Specialist Carpenter explained to his wife \nthat he was assigned night vision goggles for use while driving his \nHumVee, and every time he picks them up, he thinks of the weekend he \nmet her, both doing such training. Hearing this, his wife smiled and \ntenderly cried over the telephone, ``Ammo 3!'' The couple then \nreminisced about the weekend they met and then came to a joint \nresolution: It was the United States Army that brought them together, \nand it was the only entity that could temporarily separate them.\n  Specialist Carpenter is deeply loved and missed by his wife, family \nand friends, and they pray for his safe and expedient return.\n  PFC Jeremiah Coyne of Dillon, MT, went to boot camp during the summer \nbetween his junior and senior year of high school. He entered the \nNational Guard after graduation. Not content simply to serve as a \nguardsman, he went to Active Duty and is now serving proudly in the \ngulf region. We pray for his safety.\n  PFC Adam Eversole recently celebrated his 22nd birthday in Kuwait, \nwhere he was deployed on March 15 as an ambulance nurse. After losing \nhis mother, this caring, religious young man enlisted, following in the \nfootsteps of his father who served and was wounded in Vietnam.\n  After receiving the news that he was headed for Kuwait, he wrote his \nGrandmother, ``Let's remember, I have Jesus with me always, and He will \nlook over me and keep me safe. When I get back, I hope to come and see \nyou and visit Montana.'' It will be a grateful Montana that greets him.\n  Marine CPL Patrick O'Connell is serving in the Unit Fox 25, attached \nto the Second Tank Battalion in Iraq. He is a committed public servant \nwho has already been of great service to our\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\nState, both as a community lifeguard and as a wildland firefighter. He \ncourageously helped battle the devastating wildfires of 2000. Now he \nhas extended that generosity of character to serve our entire Nation, \nand he deserves the gratitude of us all.\n  Brock Patera of the Army's 40th transportation company will undergo \nreview on April 15 to become a Sergeant in the U.S. Army. He is busy \nearning that rank in the desert. He spends long, difficult, dangerous \nhours behind the wheel of a Humvee. His platoon has been sleeping on \nthe ground and unable to receive mail, but like so many countless \nothers around him, he remains committed to the task at hand. We wish \nhim luck in his coming review and a safe return to his wife Cassandra \nand his 15-month-old son Devin, who miss him dearly.\n  John Falconer of the 7th Marines Motor T surprised his parents on the \nmorning of April 1 with a phone call from the front lines.\n  The phone call was made on a cell phone borrowed from CNN \ncorrespondent Martin Savage. Savage is imbedded with John's unit. John \nhad repaired the fuel pump on Savage's Humvee, and the phone call was \noffered in thanks. This was the first time his parents had heard the \nsound of their son's voice in almost a month. When asked what he needed \nthe most, John told his mother, ``a mattress.'' He told his mother that \nbecause he slept on the ground, the dirt was so embedded in his pores \nit would never come out. In the face of hardship, John has remained \nstrong and committed to the task before him. He is in our prayers, and \nwe all hope for his safe return.\n  Mr. President, this is not a complete list of folks from Montana \nserving our Nation. There are many, many more. I do not plan to return \nto the Senate floor every day to give stories, but I do plan to return \nfrequently with more stories. I believe that the job our troops are \ndoing is a dangerous one and that they are upholding the freedom we, as \na nation, hold so dear. We honor them and wish then continued success \nand a safe return.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last Saturday I visited Fort Campbell, \nwhich is on the line between Kentucky and Tennessee. It is the home of \nthe famous 101st Airborne Division. It is also the home of a couple of \nArmy Special Forces units we don't hear so much about. Almost all of \nthem are in Iraq today. Some have been there for a long time.\n  What was nice about Saturday was the Secretary of the Army was there \nand held and attended a luncheon in honor of the families. Awards were \ngiven to members of the families of the service men and women who were \nthere and those who support our troops at home.\n  I heard a great many stories, as you might imagine, about bravery, \ndedication, and professionalism. One was a story about a major whose \nunit was advancing on a mosque when a crowd of Iraqis thought there was \nabout to be some damage done to the cleric. The major had the presence \nof mind to order all of the men and women in his unit to go down on one \nknee and point their guns to the ground. It signaled to the Iraqis that \nthey were there to help them, not to hurt them.\n  But one of the most interesting stories that came out of the 101st \nAirborne Division in Fort Campbell is one I would like to report this \nmorning to the Members of the Senate. It is about a special group of \nTennesseans who embody the qualities that make our Nation exceptional. \nYou may have seen the piece on the news about them on CBS News last \nweek. They exemplify why our State is called the Volunteer State. It is \nour nickname. More importantly, their story reminds us of the meaning \nof family.\n  These men belong to a Tennessee Army National Guard artillery unit \nfrom Chattanooga. The Secretary of the Army reminded me that more than \nhalf of our National Guard men and women and reservists have been \ndeployed in one way or another since 9/11. They are a big part of what \nwe are doing today. We have one integrated army, as he says.\n  But these men whom I am talking about are part of an Army National \nGuard artillery unit from Chattanooga that is training at Fort \nCampbell. Like many units, they may be deployed any day.\n  While I have endless gratitude for all of the men and women who are \nserving, this unit is special. There are seven fathers and sons in this \nunit; that is, two generations of seven families who are willing and \nready to fight for the United States.\n  They are SSG Rick Mullins and his son SP Jeff Mullins; 1SG Cody \nMosier and his son SP Tim Mosier; SSG Jasper Ellis and his son SSG Mike \nEllis; MAJ Paul Ballinger and his son PFC Ryan Ballinger; SGT James \nKittle and his son SP Jeb Kittle; SSG Roy Ware and his son, SP Jeff \nWare; SFC Jimmer Bolden and his son, SP Corey Bolden.\n\n  SP Jeb Kittle got out of the Army last summer but signed on recently \nwith the Reserve battalion to serve with his father, James. In an \ninterview, Specialist Kittle said it would be a once-in-a-lifetime \nexperience to go into battle with his father beside him. He said, \n``Everyone feels confident that we can complete the mission and bring \neverybody back alive.'' That is what we pray for every day, that the \nconflict is swift and the troops will come home safely.\n  SSG Jasper Ellis and his son, Mike, said they hope for the best; that \nthey go in and come back together. And while none of these father-son \nguardsmen are assigned to fight side by side, SSG Rick Mullins said no \nmatter what, he and his son will take care of each other. He recalled, \nwith tears in his eyes, when he told his wife that he would give his \nlife before anything would happen to their son.\n  To hear the love and respect these men have for each other is \ninspiring and reminds us that we are all in this together. It reminds \nus of the respect we have for the men and women of our Armed Forces. \nThat seven fathers and sons from one National Guard unit in Chattanooga \nwould be training together at Fort Campbell to defend our country in \ncase they are deployed is something of which I am very proud. I wanted \nto call the attention of the Senate to it today for my home State of \nTennessee.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the brave \nmen and women from New Jersey, and from throughout the United States, \nserving our Nation overseas.\n  Mr. President, words cannot adequately express the debt of gratitude \nthat Americans throughout our country feel for the sacrifices made by \nthe brave men and women serving in the Middle East, and by their \nfamilies. Many of these families are anxiously awaiting the return of \nloved ones from overseas, while others are grieving the loss of loved \nones who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n  At this moment, several thousand News Jerseyans are deployed in Iraq \nand the surrounding region to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nThey deserve our support and our prayers. The people of my State are \nhonored by their service.\n  New Jersey, like many other States, has unfortunately experienced the \ngrim realities of war. On march 29, Cpl Michael Edward Curtin became \nthe first New Jersey resident killed in battle in Iraq. Earlier, Sgt \nJames Riley, another New Jerseyan, was captured by Iraqi forces in an \nambush near Nasiriyah.\n  Mr. President, Cpl. Michael Curtin was only 23 when he was killed in \na suicide bombing at a checkpoint in Iraq. His parents, Michael and \nJoan, had to endure the most terrible loss any parent can imagine: the \ndeath of a child--their son. They should take comfort, along with his \nbrother, Daniel, and his three sisters, Katherine, Jennifer and \nStephanie, that all of New Jersey mourns with them. The family is proud \nof Michael and knows he did not die in vain.\n  Mr. President, Michael Curtin graduated from Howell High School in \n1998, where he was a standout on the football team. He then worked at \nthe Petro-Packaging Company in Cranford before joining the Army. He was \nposted with the Army's 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, where he was \npart of the spearhead that led the invasion in Iraq. Although I did not \nknow him personally, from those who did, he was an impressive and \ncourageous young man--committed to his family, committed to his \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, along with Senator Lautenberg, I joined Michael's \nfamily, friends and community this morning to\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\nattend his memorial. It was a sad and moving experience. I saw a family \ndeep in mourning. A community deep in mourning. And it was hard not to \nbe overwhelmed by the terrible loss they have endured. The love they \nhave for Michael.\n  At the same time, through all the sadness and the tears, there also \nwas a certain sense of pride. A well-deserved sense of pride. Because \nas tragic as their loss is and forever will be, it was a loss that was \nnot in vain. It was a loss fought on behalf of an ideal. It was a loss \nthat reflected Cpl. Curtin's commitment to his community. And his \nsacrifice on behalf of his country.\n  That commitment represented the best of America. And his family and \nfriends should know that all Americans share in their grief and honor \nthem for their sacrifice, as well.\n  Mr. President, while the family and friends of the late Cpl Curtin \nremain in mourning, the family and friends of Sgt James Riley also are \nsuffering, though not without hope.\n  Mr. President, Athol Riley describes Sgt Riley, his son, as \npractical-minded, strong and stubborn. And we pray that these traits \nwill fortify him during his captivity in Iraq. James was with the 507th \nMaintenance Company where he repaired tanks and serviced Patriot \nmissile batteries for the Army. His unit was ambushed near the \nEuphrates River and he, along with four other soldiers, were taken \ncaptive. I know I speak for all of New Jerseyans when I express our \ndeepest hope for his swift and safe return to New Jersey. We pray for \nhis safe return.\n  Mr. President, Sgt Riley was born in New Zealand and moved to \nPennsauken, a town in South Jersey when he was ten years old. He joined \nthe military immediately after high school and has spent the last \nthirteen years serving his country. Sgt Riley is a man of many talents. \nHe is known as a science fiction buff and has taught himself to play \nthe guitar. We all hope and pray that he will return to his family very \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, Cpl Michael Curtin and Sgt James Riley are just two of \nthe outstanding individuals serving in our armed services who have made \ntremendous sacrifices and paid a tremendous price for their country. \nAll of our troops, and all of their families, deserve the thanks of our \nentire Nation. I know I join all New Jerseyans in praying for our \nwarriors' continued safety, and for a swift, decisive and successful \nend to the war.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks, and the \nthanks of all the citizens of New Hampshire, to the amazing men and \nwomen of our United States Armed Forces, and to our coalition partners. \nWe all are very impressed with the incredible success of our military \neffort in Iraq, especially the professionalism, discipline, and \nexpertise of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.\n  George Washington said, ``Discipline is the soul of any army. It \nmakes small numbers formidable.'' And truly, our relatively small force \nhas been very, very formidable. In about twenty days, they advanced \nsome five hundred miles, while engaged in combat, and have taken \nBaghdad. They have fought with great skill and have acted \nprofessionally throughout, and they have accomplished this feat, with \njust slightly over a hundred deaths--that is an extraordinary act of \nmilitary expertise.\n  Our reserve forces, the American citizen soldiers, have been major \ncontributors in this effort. Patriots from New Hampshire have served \nour Nation with honor and distinction from Bunker Hill, to \nAfghanistan--and now they continue to carry on that tradition, serving \nin support of our nation's war on terrorism and in support of the \ncoalition's Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  While New Hampshire is a small state, over 1,000 members of our \nReserves and National Guard have been called to active duty. Those \ncalled include: 290 Air National Guardsmen from the 157th Air Refueling \nWing; the 260th Air Traffic Control Squadron; the 157th Security Group; \nand 39 Army National Guardsmen from the 1st Battery of the 172nd Field \nArtillery; the 114th Public Affairs Detachment; and 526 Army Reservists \nfrom the 94th Military Police Company; the 368th Engineer Battalion; \nthe 362nd Public Affairs Detachment; and 167 Marine Reservists from B \nCompany, 1st Battery, 25th Marines; and 13 Navy Reservists from the 4th \nMarine Division 125th Battery; the Amphibious Construction Battalion 2, \nDetachment 101; the CINC US Atlantic Fleet, Mobile Ashore Support \nGroup; and the Submarine Support Facility, HQ Detachment 101.\n  They have left their homes and are serving as military police, \nengineers, air traffic controllers, pilots, public affairs specialists, \nand in other specialties, both within the United States, and abroad, in \nSouthwest Asia, Cuba, Kosova, and the Middle East. I especially want to \nthank our citizen soldiers, their families, their employers--each in \ntheir own way, is making a sacrifice for our nation.\n  We can take tremendous pride in what our military has done, and \nespecially in what our soldiers, marines and special forces have done \non the ground, and in the fact that the results have turned out \nextremely positive. We have freed a people who have been oppressed by \nan extremely criminal regime that has killed literally tens of \nthousands of Iraqi people over the years. We are now seeing the people \nof Iraq suddenly freed, and their reaction to that freedom is so \npositive, and genuine. They are realizing that finally Saddam Hussein \nis not going to rule them any longer.\n  So, many are justifiably excited that we have had success up to this \npoint--but there is still a long way to go in this war. There are many \npockets of resistance still to be addressed. But as we move forward \ntoward Tikrit and other parts of Iraq, I would expect that Saddam \nHussein's evil regime will continue to collapse. Hopefully we are \nlooking at better days for the Iraqi people.\n  Abraham Lincoln said, ``Let us have faith that right makes might, and \nin that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand \nit.'' Now, 143 years later, another president, George Bush, has also \nclearly seen our nation's duty--and he has demonstrated the courage to \npursue it to a just end.\n  We are a nation which goes into an event like this for good purposes. \nI believe the world will see that we have delivered a country into \nfreedom--and provided their people an opportunity for a better life. We \ncan take pride in that as a nation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my sincere thanks \nto the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families.\n  Last October, I voted against the resolution authorizing the use of \nforce in Iraq and believe it was right that in recent months the \ncountry debated the wisdom of using military action against Iraq at \nthis time. But the military action that is now underway unites us as we \nfocus on our ongoing support for our troops. I am confident in their \nabilities, and I hope for their safe and quick return to their \nfamilies. Even more so now that this action has begun, my thoughts, and \nthe thoughts of all Americans, are with our service men and women, and \nwith their families.\n  The dedicated men and women of our military spend time away from \ntheir homes and families in different parts of the country and the \nworld, and are placed into harm's way in order to protect the American \npeople and our way of life. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and members of the Coast Guard for \ntheir selfless service.\n  These brave individuals have volunteered to place themselves into \nharm's way on our behalf. Too many of them have made the ultimate \nsacrifice on the battlefields of Iraq. Many others have been injured. \nSome have been taken prisoner by our adversaries, while others remain \nunaccounted for.\n  We honor the memory of those who have given their lives and pray for \ntheir families, we wish a speedy recovery to the injured, call for the \nprompt and safe release of those taken prisoner, and call for an \naccurate accounting for those listed as missing.\n  Each person serving in our military has his or her own story and \nreasons for enlisting. All of them are brave, dedicated men and women \nwho have made tremendous personal sacrifices on our behalf.\n  Young men and women who at this time last year were looking forward \nto their senior proms and high school graduations are now half way \nacross the world protecting our country.\n  Parents who a year ago worried if their children would make their \ncurfews now fear for their safety in a far off land.\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\n  Our thoughts are with these brave young men and women as we see and \nhear reports of their acts of heroism and patriotism.\n  One such brave young man is Petty Officer Third Class Scott Wickland \nof Spooner, WI. This 20-year-old sailor, who is serving aboard the USS \nConstellation in the Persian Gulf, was an integral part of the April 1 \nrescue of two Navy pilots whose plane ended up in the water after a \nsuspected malfunction while taxiing on Constellation's flight deck. It \nwas Petty Officer Wickland's job to be lowered into the water from a \nrescue helicopter and to swim out to the pilots and make sure they were \nbrought aboard the helicopter and then returned to the carrier. All \nthree returned to the Constellation safely.\n  This story is all the more poignant because Petty Officer Wickland's \nuncle, his mother Mary's 20-year-old brother, drowned just a year \nbefore Scott was born. This accident affected Mary Wickland deeply, and \nshe named her son Scott Daniel in memory of her brother, Daniel \nOsborne. She also saw to it that all of her children learned how to \nswim. More than two decades later, Petty Officer Wickland used his \nswimming skills to save two lives.\n  Petty Officer Wickland and his fellow military personnel represent \nthe best among us, and serve as examples of the dedication to others to \nwhich all of us should aspire.\n  MAJ Kevin G. Nave, a former resident of Port Washington, WI, was \nanother example of the best whom America has to offer. Major Nave, who \nwas assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine \nDivision, Camp Pendleton, CA, was tragically killed on March 26 in a \nvehicle accident in Iraq. He leaves behind a wife, two young children, \nand many other grieving family members and friends.\n  Major Nave and his family lived in Port Washington for about 3 years \nprior to his transfer to Camp Pendleton last year. While in Wisconsin, \nMajor Nave served as an inspector instructor with Fox Company, 2nd \nBattalion of the 24th Marine Combat Infantry unit. In addition, he \nserved his local community as an adviser to the Southeast Wisconsin \nYoung Marines, a coordinator for the Marine Corps Toys for Tots \nprogram, a member of the Milwaukee Armed Services Committee, and as a \nMarine community outreach coordinator for area schools. Friends say \nthat he loved his family, being a marine, and his Harley-Davidson \nmotorcycle. He organized the first local Armed Forces Week Harley Ride \nlast year, and he and his fellow service men and women will be honored \nfollowing this year's event.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to the Nave family and to their friends \nin Port Washington and elsewhere.\n  I also extend my best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have \nbeen injured while serving in the Persian Gulf.\n  LT Terence W. Bacon of Allenton, WI, was one of the members of the \n101st Airborne Division's 1st Brigade injured at Camp Pennsylvania, \nKuwait, on March 22. He is currently recovering from the wounds he \nsustained in this incident.\n  SP Patrick McDermott, who was called to active duty as a member of \nthe Madison-based 1st Battalion of the 147th Aviation HHSc of the Army \nNational Guard, was wounded in the Persian Gulf and is currently \nrecovering.\n  Marine Cpl Bret Woolhether from Fond du Lac, WI, suffered shrapnel \nwounds in fighting near Nasiriyah on March 27. Despite his injuries, \nCorporal Woolhether is eager to return to duty.\n  The servicemen about whom I have spoken today are just a few examples \nof the many Wisconsinites and hundreds of thousands of Americans who \nserve our country in the Armed Forces.\n  The war in Iraq and the fight against terrorism are turning upside \ndown the lives of Active-Duty, National Guard, and Reserve personnel \nand their families. These men and women seek to do their duty to our \ncountry and honor commitments to their families, and, in the case of \nthe National Guard and Reserves, to their employers. As of April 9, \nmore than 221,000 National Guard and Reserve personnel were serving on \nactive duty, and many more can be expected to be called upon in the \nfuture.\n  Some Wisconsinites are facing the latest in a series of multiple \nactivations and deployments for family members. Others are seeing their \nloved ones off on their first deployment. All of these families share \nin the worry and concern about what awaits their relatives and hope, as \nwe do, for their swift and safe return.\n  We owe it to our military personnel and their families to do \neverything we can to support them in this difficult time. I will \ncontinue to work to ensure that our troops and their families have the \nresources that they need, both to combat our adversaries and to provide \nfor their families, during this tumultuous time and when they return \nhome.\n  We hope for a quick and decisive victory for our troops, and look \nforward to the day when we can welcome them home into the embrace of a \ngrateful Nation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, over the past few days we have seen \ndramatic proof that the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein is nearing its \nend. Like many Americans, I have been thrilled and heartened by the \ndramatic images of United States troops helping Iraqi citizens tear \ndown statues and paintings of this brutal tyrant. For the first time in \ntheir lives, many Iraqis are tasting freedom, and it is beautiful. I am \nproud of our military and America's commitment to make the people of \nthe Middle East more free.\n  While our fighting men and women will surely face more difficult days \nahead, the end of this war is in sight, and I rise to honor four men \nwho made the ultimate sacrifice one can make for their country. One of \nthem was a native Oklahoman, and three were adopted Oklahomans by \nvirtue of their service at Fort Sill in Lawton. I consider each of them \nheroes.\n  LCpl Thomas Alan Blair was Oklahoma's first known casualty in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. This 24-year-old Broken Arrow native was \nkilled on March 23 in a fierce battle near Nasiriyah when an enemy \nrocket propelled grenade hit his amphibious assault vehicle.\n  Tommy graduated from Broken Arrow High School in 1997, but had \ndecided long before then that he would be a marine. He chose his career \nnearly a decade ago when he watched his older brother, SSgt Al Blair, \ngraduate from boot camp. In a way, he followed in his brothers's \nfootsteps, but his family will tell you that he would have been a \nmarine no matter what. ``He truly wanted to help people,'' said his \nbrother.\n  SFC Randall S. Rehn, 36, was a veteran of the first gulf war. His \nwife and baby daughter expected him to come home to Lawton in August. \nIn his last known contact with his family, Rehn expressed his desire to \ncome home quickly and his hope that ``this is the last time I'm leaving \nmy family for so long.'' Friends testify that Randy's greatest passions \nin life were people, family, and friends.\n  Randall Rehn died April 3 amid fierce fighting for control of what is \nnow Baghdad International Airport. He is survived by his wife Raelynn \nand daughter Megan, of Lawton, as well as his family in Colorado.\n  Two fellow members of his Multiple Launch Rocket System of C Battery, \n3rd Battalion, 13th Field Infantry Regiment from Fort Sill died in the \nsame fight: SGT Todd Robbins and SP Donald Oaks.\n  One of eight brothers and sisters, Todd Robbins, 33, served in the \nNavy for the first gulf war before joining the Army. He leaves behind a \nwife at Fort Sill and a 13-year-old son. ``He always wanted to be in \nthe Army,'' said his father Dale Robbins. ``He lived, ate, and slept \nthe Army. He loved it.''\n  Donald Oaks would have turned 21 on April 26. He was a bright young \nman who was good at math and computers. Also, he enjoyed playing \nbaseball and fishing with his dad. He joined the Army to get money for \na college education after his service. His mother Laurie Oaks said, \n``He was my best friend and was always my hero. He still is.'' He was \nengaged to be married.\n  Tragically, the deaths of SGT Robbins and SP Oaks were said to be a \nresult of friendly fire in the form of coalition bombs. While our \nmilitary always works to prevent such accidents, they always occur \nduring war fighting.\n  The fact that their deaths were accidental in no way diminishes their \nsacrifice. They gave their lives to protect us, our freedoms, and to \nmake people they had never met, half-way around the world, free in \ntheir own country.\n  As reports from Iraq begin to tell the story of Iraqis enjoying their \nlong-\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\nawaited freedom, it is important that we remember men like these who \npaid for that freedom with their blood.\n  Before our troops so bravely put their lives on the line, there was \nno such freedom in Iraq. Iraqi citizens were subject to the cruel and \nbrutal whims of a mad dictator. They lived every moment in the \noppressive grip of a regime whose power knew no limits. They lived in \nfear with rape, torture, and murder always in their minds.\n  Because LCpl Blair, SFC Rehn, SGT Robbins, and SP Oaks were willing \nto lay down their lives for freedom, many citizens of Iraq are awaking \nto a new day, and the world is now a safer place.\n  As we watch the final days of Saddam Hussein's evil regime unfold, \nlet us never forget that the freedom we enjoy every day in America is \nbought at a price.\n  LCpl Blair, SFC Rehn, SGT Robbins, and SP Oaks did not die in vain. \nThey died so that many others could live freely. And for that \nsacrifice, we are forever indebted. Our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem and their families today and with the troops who are still \nfighting to liberate Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness, but greater \npride, that I rise today to recognize a true warrior and Colorado \nnative who gave of the ultimate sacrifice. SFC Randall Rehn, of Niwot, \nCO, served with honor and distinction.\n  Sergeant Rehn was killed during one of the most significant events of \nthis war. His vehicle was destroyed during the fight to take Saddam \nInternational Airport. It is because of sacrifices such as Sergeant \nRehn's, a tyrant and his oppressive regime will be defeated.\n  While I grieve for the loss of Sergeant Rehn, my pride and respect \nabound. I know that Colorado, as Gov. Bill Owens said, ``has gained a \nhero.'' My prayers go out to the family of this fallen hero and hope \nthey know this country honors Sergeant Rehn's sacrifice and recognizes \ntheir loss.\n  Mr. President, I wish to salute a fallen soldier of the great State \nof Colorado. Capt. Russell Rippetoe gave the greatest sacrifice in the \nservice of his country and for the freedom of his fellow Americans.\n  Captain Rippetoe joined an Army ROTC unit while he attended Metro \nState College in Denver. He entered the Army's elite Ranger unit and \nserved in Afghanistan before being deployed to Iraq. Captain Rippetoe \ncontinued his family's proud tradition of serving his country. His \nfather retired as a lieutenant colonel.\n  I think his family said it best when they said, ``Russell loved this \nnation and America has lost a true American hero.'' I want to echo that \nsentiment by saying that Colorado has lost a warrior, a great citizen, \nand a son.\n  Mr. President, I also stand today to acknowledge a true hero. \nColorado said farewell to one of its own. Marine Cpl Randall Rosacker \nwas laid to rest, as he requested, in a Colorado veterans graveyard \nwith full military honors.\n  Corporal Rosacker served this great Nation proudly in Afghanistan and \ngave the ultimate sacrifice in the war with Iraq. He was killed in a \nfirefight early in the war, but paved the way to future success on the \nbattlefield. His service to the country will always be remembered and \nappreciated.\n  Corporal Rosacker was born in Alamosa and still has strong Colorado \nroots with grandparents and great-grandparents still residing in \nColorado. My prayers go out to the family of this fallen hero and hope \nthey know this country honors Corporal Rosacker's sacrifice and \nrecognizes their loss. Today I ask the Senate to recognize this great \nAmerican as Colorado has.\n  And I ask we recognize one of the heroes of the war in Iraq. LCpl \nThomas Slocum of Thornton, CO, was killed in action while defending the \nprinciples of freedom and justice against a brutal dictator's regime.\n  Corporal Slocum's unit was ambushed by a group of Iraqis who cowardly \nindicated they were surrendering and then opened fire. He was a brave \nand patriotic son of Colorado. He will be remembered by all as ``proud \nto be a marine.'' He believed in what he was doing over there.\n  Though any loss of life is tragic, we as Americans can hold our heads \nhigh because of the sacrifices of our servicemen such as Thomas Slocum. \nMy prayers go out to the family of this fallen hero and hope they know \nthis country honors Corporal Slocum's sacrifice and recognizes their \nloss.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SP James \nKiehl, who gave his life for his country as part of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, and to express my deepest sympathy to his family. SP Kiehl was \npart of the 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company, which was ambushed in \nsouthern Iraq. While we still don't know for sure what happened that \nday, U.S. forces later recovered his body during an operation in which \nthey rescued another member of James's company, PFC Jessica Lynch. My \nprayers are with James's father in Comfort, TX and James's wife, Jill, \nDes Moines, IA. Since James left their home in Texas to go to war, Jill \nhas been staying with her parents in Iowa where she is expecting their \nfirst child. I can only imagine how difficult this time must be for \nher. Although their child will never meet James, the child can take \ncomfort knowing that SP Kiehl died a hero and a patriot.\n  James Kiehl will be missed by a great many people who were a part of \nhis life. I know I join all Iowans in expressing my support for Jill in \nher time of loss. Just as she will keep James's memory alive, it is our \nduty to recognize and remember James's sacrifice. In fact, I understand \nthat James Kiehl spoke to his father about his military service saying \nthat he did not want to raise his son in a world of terrorism; and so \nhis service has helped to make us all safer. We must not forget those \nwho have paid the immeasurably high price in the name of freedom. \nLiberty-loving Americans like James Kiehl deserve our unending \ngratitudes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary status of the \nSenate as we speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate has no business pending.\n  Mr. REID. We hate to admit that is the way it is. I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5265-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5265-S5266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had in our cloakroom numerous phone \ncalls. I have spoken to a number of Senators. We have military funerals \ngoing on around the country people wish to attend. We have two Senators \nnow in attendance at a military funeral. We need to move on with the \nbusiness of the Senate. We are here, ready to go.\n  The reason I say this is that throughout the day I will get inquiries \nfrom Senators about why can't we move along more quickly. We are going \nto ask that our member of the Budget Committee go forward with his \nstatement on the budget. If there is no one here from the other side, \nthat would be unfair. But I hope we can get to this soon because if we \nuse all 10 hours on the budget alone, we are not going to finish until \napproximately 10:15 tonight--I am sorry, 8:15 tonight. There will be a \nlot of concern about that.\n  We still have the supplemental. We are going to conference at 10:30. \nWe have a lot of work to do. I am disappointed that we are not on the \nbudget now. Senator Conrad is ready to go. As I have said two times \nalready in my brief discussion, we are having a lot of inquiries about \npeople wanting to go home for the work period that we have scheduled.\n  We hope everybody understands that 10 minutes this morning is 10 \nminutes lost this afternoon. Airplanes need to be made.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I inquire of the distinguished leader, on \nour side, we are quite anxious to act on the nomination of MG Steven \nBlum to become the National Guard Commander. All 50 States are \ninvolved. The Armed Services Committee unanimously voted him out \nyesterday.\n  Mr. REID. We will be happy to look at that. Maybe if we get on the \nbudget--if it is cleared--we can get off the\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\nbudget for a short time and clear that. I think we need to get the time \nrunning on the budget.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the assistant leader. He represents so many \nguardsmen who are now fighting valiantly. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Some of whom, from Nevada, have been killed in combat in \nthe war in Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5266-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5266-S5293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FISCAL YEAR 2004 BUDGET--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany \nH. Con. Res 95, the concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report the budget resolution conference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res 95), establishing the Congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2004, \n     and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal \n     years 2003 and 2005 through 2013, having met, have agreed \n     that the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment \n     of the Senate, and agree to the same with an amendment, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Budget Committee chairman if he \nwill yield for a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. As I said a few minutes ago, on our side there is real \nangst as to when we might finish this budget conference report. We have \n5 hours on our side. At this stage, we have the intention of using most \nall of that time. I am wondering, from your perspective, how much of \nyour time are you going to use? It is important for people who are \nbouncing around the country.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did the Senator say they have the intention of yielding \nmost of their time?\n  Mr. REID. Using the time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to work with my colleagues to find a mutually \nagreed upon time for debate and for final passage. We have up to 10 \nhours, as my colleague knows. That would have us voting at 8 o'clock \ntonight. I hope we can reduce that. I will work with colleagues on both \nsides to make it mutually agreeable.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I \nurge our colleagues to stay in town today on this particular Friday \nbefore an April Easter recess. We have a vote on the Senate budget \nconference report, which we are now debating. We have a vote on the \nurgent DOD request, the war supplemental. That will be voted on today. \nI expect we will also have a vote on debt limit extension. Maybe that \ncan be done by voice, maybe not. I urge colleagues to be here today.\n  Those are the three very important issues to be resolved today. We \nwill try to work with all of our colleagues to expedite consideration \nof all three measures, and I will be happy to accommodate and yield \ntime and work with people. We need to pass all three bills. I look \nforward to working with all involved Senators to come to the conclusion \nof all three bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may direct a question to the chairman, \nwe are willing to work in any way possible to get the budget passed and \nthe supplemental passed.\n  I think the Senator should be forewarned that I doubt very seriously \nif there will be a debt extension passed today. We spoke at some length \na week ago with the majority leader. We will be happy to work with the \nleader on a freestanding bill. We need a day on that, but that doesn't \nmean 30 minutes or an hour. We have a number of people who have \nindicated to us that they want to offer amendments on the budget \nextension.\n  The majority leader is quoted in the press as saying he thinks we can \ndo the supplemental and the budget resolution, but he doesn't think we \ncan do the debt limit. I want the chairman to know we agree with the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nand friend from Nevada. I will bump that up to a higher level between \nthe majority leader, minority leader, and my friends. It was my \nunderstanding it needs to be done this week before we left. I have not \nconsulted with Treasury--the Secretary of the Treasury in the last week \nor so. It was my understanding it really needed to pass before the \nApril break. Maybe that is not the case. It may be my friend from \nNevada and others have done their tax returns and paid such enormous \ntaxes that we are in great shape. There is usually an April bump in \nrevenues. That is my main concern. We don't like being in the situation \nwhere we are borrowing funds from civil service retirements and so on, \nwhich has happened in the past, and may be happening now. I will be \nhappy to bump that up to the majority and minority leaders. It was my \nunderstanding it needed to be done prior to our leaving for this break.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, very briefly, if I may, I think every time a \ndebt limit extension has come before the Congress, I have voted for it. \nI believe we have debts and we should pay them. I will likely vote for \nthis one. But there are some people who don't think as I do and they \nwant some time to talk on this.\n  The majority leader has the commitment of Senator Daschle and myself \nand Senator Conrad that we will work with them to get the debt limit \nextension passed. We need a little bit of time to do that.\n  Just on a personal note, I have been checking my banking on line \nevery morning to see if my return is back. I am expecting that money to \ncome back soon. It has been 4 weeks now and it is not here. I am a \nlittle disappointed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, as we begin the debate on the budget for \nfiscal year 2004, I will make a couple of comments. One, I compliment \nmy colleague, Chairman Nussle, in the House. It has been a pleasure to \nwork with him.\n  Passing a budget is never easy. I have been critical in the past, \nsuch as when last year we did not get a budget passed, but I have a \nbetter appreciation for how difficult it is. Particularly when we have \na great big number of 51 on our side, it is not an easy job. So I \ncompliment Chairman Nussle and thank him for his work and cooperation.\n  We had many hours working together trying to formulate a budget that \nwould pass both the House and the Senate. It is a great deal easier \nsaid than done. We have come forward with a budget this year that \naccomplishes a lot of major objectives. We balance the budget. We \nbalance the budget in 9 years, not 10. When we brought it before the \nSenate, it was balanced in 10 years, in 2013. Now we balance it by the \nyear 2012.\n  It is a budget that allows and encourages growing the economy. The \neconomy has not been growing. Frankly, we will never balance the budget \nif the economy is not growing. This budget allows and provides for a \ngrowth package.\n  This is a budget that will help us win the war on terrorism. We fully \nfund the President's request for national defense and homeland defense.\n  It includes the war supplemental that Congress is going to pass \ntonight. The Senate passed it a week ago, and we will end up passing it \nas well today. It fully funds homeland security and the President's \nrequest.\n  It also is a budget that allows us to modernize Medicare. We did not \nget that done last Congress. We should have, but we did not. Almost \neverybody says they are in favor of it, but because we did not have a \nbudget, we did not have protection on the floor. We did not even have \nmarkup in the committee. We did spend some time on it on the floor, but \nwe were not successful. This is a bill that says we will\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\nspend up to $400 billion not just to provide a drug benefit but also to \nstrengthen and improve Medicare, not just for the current beneficiaries \nbut for future generations as well.\n  It is a budget that maintains spending discipline. It grows domestic \nnondefense discretionary, but barely--about 2.3 percent over 2003 \nlevels before the supplemental. We limit spending with enforceable caps \nfor the next 2 years.\n  Budgets are not easy. They are not pretty. The process is difficult. \nIt is long. It is tedious. It is tough. It is not the easiest committee \nof which to be a member. I thank all members of the Budget Committee \nwho helped us build this budget.\n  When we convened early this year, we had seven Budget Committee \nhearings. The President submitted his budget on February 3. We passed a \nlarge appropriations bill, the 2003 appropriations bill, on February \n13. These were appropriations from the previous year. We did not get a \nbudget last year, and we did not get appropriations last year.\n  Why did we not get the appropriations bills done? Because the House \nand the Senate were arguing what the appropriate level would be. There \nwas never a budget, so this was not an agreement on how much we should \nspend. And because we did not have the agreement, we could not manage. \nIt just did not work. And the Congress did not work. Last year was a \nvery frustrating year, largely because we did not have a budget. In \nFebruary of this year, we ended up passing last year's appropriations \nbill. Eleven of the thirteen bills passed in February. On March 7, CBO \nsubmitted the reestimate of the President's budget, and then on March \n12 and 13, the Senate Budget Committee marked up the President's \nbudget. We had 2 days of markup. We had 32 amendments considered, 23 \nrollcall votes, and we passed it out of the committee on March 13.\n\n  Then we had the longest consideration of the budget maybe in Senate \nhistory. I will have to look back, but we had 7 days of debate on the \nfloor. The Budget Act provides for 50 hours, but we had 50 hours plus \nmany more hours because we had a very extended number of rollcall \nvotes. We had 81 amendments considered on the floor. Fifty-one were \ndecided by rollcall votes, and 31 by voice votes which adds up to 82, \nincluding final passage.\n  We have had a challenging conference. We had a very challenging \nconference, after both the House and Senate passed a bill, because we \nhad differing expectations of what could pass, particularly as it \nrelated to the growth package. The House wanted, and they passed, a \ngrowth package of $726 billion. The Senate passed a package of $350 \nbillion. The Senate could not pass more than $350 billion, it looks \nlike, and the House would not accept $350 billion. It is kind of hard \nto have reconciliation in a conference agreement if there are \nirreconcilable differences.\n  What did we do? Well, we were a little innovative and we came up with \ngiving different instructions to the House and the Senate, certainly \nlegitimate in parliamentary procedure. It has not been done before, so \nwe gave an instruction to the House. The House has an instruction of \n$550 billion on the growth package. The Senate has an instruction of \n$350 billion on the growth package. The difference is to be decided by \nthe conference. I think I know where the votes are. I will tell my \nfriends and colleagues, I know Chairman Grassley very well. I expect \nthat I will be a conferee, and we do not expect to bring a bill out of \nconference unless it will pass the House and the Senate. We want it to \nbecome law. We do not want to make political statements. We want to \nhelp the economy grow. That is our objective.\n  So hopefully we will have a budget and a growth package. I think it \nis more important to have a budget than even having a growth package. I \nthink we have to have fiscal discipline. The budget amounts to $2.2 \ntrillion. The growth package is somewhere between $350 billion and $550 \nbillion over 10 years. Over 10 years, we are going to spend about $30 \ntrillion. I think we have to have some management of that $30 trillion \nin the next 10 years.\n  If we did not pass a budget last year and we do not pass a budget \nthis year, then we have really no budget. The former Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office said the budget process is dead. I called \nhim and told him: I beg to differ with you, but if we were not \nsuccessful in passing a budget this year, it would be dead. If we had 2 \nconsecutive years and Congress did not pass a budget, then certainly it \nwould be dead, for all practical purposes. There would be no budget \nenforcement. There would be no pay-go. There would be no rules against \nspending on extraneous measures. This budget has enforcement.\n  I will mention a couple of other things. We have inherited a very \ndifficult thing. A lot of people are going to come to the floor today \nand they are going to decry how large these deficits are and say: Woe \nis me, how come we have all of these deficits? It is because of the tax \ncuts.\n  That is not actually factual. The fact is we have large deficits \nbecause revenues have declined dramatically--not because of tax cuts \nbut because of the economy. Revenues fell 2 years ago, 1.7 percent. \nLast year, they fell 7 percent. Combined, that is about a 9-percent \nreduction in revenues in the last 2 years. Simultaneously, spending \nwent up 12 percent; revenues went down 9 percent. Spending went up 12.2 \npercent, and we went from a surplus of $129 billion to a deficit of \n$159 billion in 1 year.\n\n  What caused that? A soft economy, a stock market collapsing. People \nwill later say that is because of President Bush's policies. That is \nnot correct. The NASDAQ fell 50 percent between March of 2000 and \nDecember of 2000, so the market started collapsing under President \nClinton. I want to make sure people know where this collapse came from. \nRevenues started falling like a rock because the stock market started \ncollapsing. Maybe the stock market had irrational exuberance going up, \nbut it fell dramatically and that cut off revenues. A lot less capital \ngains, less personal income tax, and revenues declined to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Also, we had something called a terrorist attack on the United States \non September 11 in the year 2001. That has cost this economy and it has \nbrought a lot of outlays to the Federal Government--outlays to respond \nto terrorism, outlays to protect us against terrorism, outlays to \nrebuild both New York and Washington, DC. As a result, outlays have \ngone up and expenses to the economy have been dramatic. It is hard to \ncalculate how significant it has been.\n  So we have the confluence of several things. We already had a stock \nmarket declining dramatically, we had a soft economy, then we had \nSeptember 11 on top of that, which has made revenues go down and \nexpenditures go up.\n  What can we do? We have to show fiscal discipline. We have done that \nin this budget. Despite attempts by many to increase spending by over \n$1 trillion, we held the line on nondefense spending. It will only grow \nby a couple of percentage points. That is compared to spending that has \nbeen growing at dramatic increases in past years. The year before last, \nit was 12 percent alone in discretionary spending. When I talk about \nspending, sometimes we talk about discretionary and sometimes we talk \nabout entitlements, but discretionary spending, the amount of money we \ncontrol, had been increasing at enormous levels. We contained that \ngrowth. In nondefense, as I mentioned, spending growth has been limited \nto a couple of percentage points.\n  We do a couple other things. We reinstill discipline. We have caps on \ndiscretionary spending. We have enactment of changes. If you want to \ncall something emergency, you have to have 60 votes. We prohibit \nadvance funding which was done more often than it should have been, \nadvance funding where you not only appropriate for the next fiscal year \nbut maybe for the next couple of years. We prohibit that.\n  Let me mention a few more. Spending growth in 2004 will be 4 percent. \nDefense spending in 2004 is 2.4 percent in budget authority. The last 5 \nyears it has been 7.6 percent; nondefense spending growth in 2004, 2.9 \npercent. The average was 7.9 percent. In defense, I mentioned we fully \nfund the President's request to fight the war on Iraq. We have included \nthe war supplemental. We fully fund homeland security. That is an \nincrease of 18.4 percent in 2004. We have a $3 billion increase over \nthe President's request in 2000 for the Department of Education. Those \nare programs such as IDA, title I, No Child Left Behind. Veterans \nhealth\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\ncare is the largest increase ever, 14.7 percent. I have mentioned \nMedicare and our efforts there. We also have a pay-go point of order, \nto limit mandatory increases or revenue decreases in excess of those \nprovided in the budget.\n\n  We did something else, and I want to make sure my colleague from \nNorth Dakota listens to this because we can work together on this. The \nHouse--to their credit, I would say--proposed hundreds of billions of \ndollars in savings in entitlements. The President did not propose \nthose; we did not propose those. I had to think maybe we need to be \nlooking at entitlements. We did not get that done in this budget when \nwe had the opportunity. We did not do it. And I did not call for it to \nbe done because I didn't think Congress was ready. I want Congress to \nget ready. I want the authorizing committees to start doing oversight.\n  We require in this resolution the House and the Senate authorizing \ncommittees to submit findings to the Budget Committee identifying \ninstances of waste and fraud and abuse in programs within their \njurisdictions. There are a lot. We have not had extensive oversight on \na lot of programs in years, for whatever reason. Blame me, blame all of \nus; we need to do more. We are requesting and actually directing each \nof the committees to give us identified areas where they think we can \nmake savings. Those need to be submitted by the authorizing committees \nby September 2 of 2003, and we will use those in the Budget Committee \nto develop future budget resolutions. We do not want to dictate to the \nauthorizing committees, but we want to work with the authorizing \ncommittees to get real results, real savings, real oversight.\n  It bothers me a lot when we find out we have actually hundreds of \nbillions of dollars estimated to be lost in errors or waste--in some \nprograms it is 20 or 30 percent.\n  Regarding the earned-income tax credit program, I believe CBO did a \nstudy, and it was something like an error rate of close to 30 percent. \nThat is not acceptable. We need to make sure Government is more \nefficient and more effective.\n  I look forward to the debate on this resolution. I hope our \ncolleagues consider it vitally important to pass a budget. We will be \ngrossly irresponsible if we do not. It is easy to throw stones and \nsticks and say I don't like this so we will just vote no. But, \nconversely, we have to govern. We considered alternatives, and they did \nnot pass. I urge our colleagues to consider this budget. I urge Members \nto vote for final passage some time later this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that quorum calls be charged \nequally from now on during the course of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is, I believe, the worst budget this \nChamber has considered perhaps in its history. It is radical, reckless, \ndangerous, and extreme. At a time of record budget deficits, it \nproposes to cut revenues by over $1.3 trillion and increase spending by \nover $1.1 trillion, driving us deeper into deficits and debt.\n  It explodes deficits when we are at war, the cost of which is \nunknown, and right on the eve of the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration which will dramatically increase the cost of Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  Make no mistake, the cost of the massive tax cuts in this budget \nexplode at the very time the cost to the Government of the baby boom \ngeneration's retirement explodes. There can only be one result, and \nthat is to drive this country off the cliff into deficits and debt on a \nscale and magnitude never seen in this country's history. That is not \njust irresponsible, it is wildly irresponsible.\n  This budget is not a document that represents a conservative approach \nto governance. It is radical and it is extreme. It says deficits do not \nmatter, that taking virtually every penny of the Social Security trust \nfund surpluses to fund tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, is the \npriority for this Nation.\n  This budget flunks every test of fiscal responsibility and basic \nfairness. This budget proposes taking trillions of dollars raised from \nthe payroll taxes of middle-class Americans, generated to support \nSocial Security, and uses them to fund an income tax cut overwhelmingly \nfor the benefit of the most wealthy among us.\n  The President's proposal, which this budget resolution seeks to \nsupport, would give a $90,000 tax reduction to those earning over $1 \nmillion a year and funds it by taking the payroll tax money of middle-\nclass Americans to pay for it. To the extent it is not paid for by that \nmechanism, it borrows the money and charges the cost to future \ngenerations. That is class warfare of an extreme nature. It takes from \nthe many to give to the few.\n  The proponents of this budget claim it contains a growth package. It \ndoes not. It contains a radical expansion of deficits and debt that can \nonly undermine our long-term economic strength and security. Oh, yes, \nit will give a momentary and modest lift to the economy. But like the \ndrug addict who gets a momentary high, it will be inexorably followed \nby the lows brought on by the deadweight of deficits and debt.\n  The best economists in America tell us that this budget proposal \nhurts long-term economic growth and threatens our economic security \nbecause it is all financed by borrowed money. It is a borrow-and-spend \nphilosophy that doubles our gross national debt over the next decade, \nright before the baby boom generation retires. This is the time we \nshould be paying down debt or prepaying the liability we all know is to \ncome. Instead, this budget says: Forget about what we know is happening \nand what is about to happen; let's live for the moment and not worry \nabout the future.\n  As bad as this budget is--and it is bad--the process that brought it \nhere is even worse. I believe it represents an attack on the \nConstitution itself. Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be the \nplace where a determined minority could slow down and perhaps even stop \nmeasures that the minority believed could damage our country. So the \nSenate adopted the right to unlimited debate and the ability to offer \nunfettered amendments. The budget process used in this conference \nreport has never been done before and fundamentally denies Senators \nthose basic rights. The process, called reconciliation, which restricts \nSenators' rights to debate and amend, has been twisted like a pretzel \ninto something unrecognizable from what was intended.\n  Reconciliation was meant to provide a fast-track process to reduce \ndeficits, and now it is being used to explode them. Understand that \nthis budget says both bodies, under the reconciliation provisions, are \ninstructed to cut taxes by $550 billion. If anybody believes this is a \nmeasure to cut taxes by $350 billion under reconciliation, that person \nis profoundly misled. The instruction says clearly: Cut taxes by $550 \nbillion under these fast-track procedures that mean Senators are denied \nthe basic protection of unlimited debate and amendment.\n  In the next breath, the Senate is told to forget that instruction \nbecause there will be a supermajority point of order in the Senate if \nit is followed. But in the conference committee, the higher tax cut can \nbe adopted and come back to the Senate and be passed on a simple \nmajority vote under special time limits and with restrictions on \namendments that deny every Senator their most basic rights.\n  All this was made possible by a procedure never considered or debated \nin either body. This scheme was concocted in the conference committee \nwithout a single member of the minority present--not one. We were \nlocked out. So four members of the Senate majority, with two members of \nthe House majority, have constructed a procedure, never contemplated in \neither Chamber, which allows the special restrictions and limitations \nof reconciliation to apply to a tax cut that never passed this Chamber.\n\n  This stands the plain meaning of reconciliation on its head. No true \nreconciliation between the House and the Senate has ever occurred. \nThere was no true meeting of the minds. So they conjured up a new point \nof order in the conference committee as a figleaf to hide their \nfailure.\n  Colleagues should understand the extreme nature of what is being \ndone. If a conference committee can add new provisions never debated or \ncontemplated in either Chamber, and do so without the minority, where \ndoes it end? Could an abusive minority of the\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\nmajority, in a conference committee, decide that a supermajority point \nof order would apply to an individual Senator's right to offer an \namendment? Could just a handful of Senators and House Members in a \nconference committee create a supermajority point of order against \namendments on a particular subject? What is to prevent a minority of \nthe majority in a conference committee from fundamentally altering the \nrights of individual Senators?\n  This way lies chaos and a descent into unconstitutional government. \nMark my words, the Senate will live to regret this day. Unintended \nconsequences, we have seen in the past, flow from very little things.\n  In 1975, a tax cut of $6 million was used as precedent for using the \nreconciliation process that was designed for deficit reduction. It was \nused as a pretext to allow tax cuts of over $1 trillion, tax cuts that \nhave pushed us now into deep deficit and growing debt.\n  This is what has been agreed to in the conference committee. The \nreporting has been almost uniformly wrong.\n  They say the tax cut permitted is $550 billion. That is not true. The \ntax cut in this budget resolution is $1.3 trillion, and that does not \ncount the associated interest costs. It is only one part of the tax cut \nwhich is $550 billion. That is the so-called reconciled amount. Those \nare the amounts that will move under special protection, that will \nrestrict Senators' right to amend, restrict Senators' right to \nunlimited debate, fundamentally restrict the determined minority's \nability to stop what they believe will damage this country in a \nfundamental way.\n  I hope anybody voting on this understands. If you vote for this \nbudget resolution, you are voting for $1.3 trillion of tax cuts, of \nwhich $550 billion is reconciled, moving under special protection that \nfundamentally restricts the Senators' basic rights to amend and debate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If you count in the additional interest costs which \nwould have to be incurred to do this tax cut because of the borrowing \nthat would be necessary to fill the deficit gap created by the loss of \nrevenues from the tax cut, what would the cost of this tax cut be?\n  It seems to me eminently reasonable that one also ought to factor in \nthe interest costs associated because you have to borrow money in order \nto do the tax cut. Am I correct that we would have to borrow money in \norder to do the tax cut?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is on to something very important. Really, \nthis understates the cost of the tax cut. The tax cut that is in this \nresolution, $1.3 trillion, has an additional cost, the associated \ninterest cost, because this is all borrowed money. That would be \nanother about $300 billion.\n  So the total cost goes to $1.6 trillion--truly stunning when we are \nalready at record budget deficits, when we are at war, the cost of \nwhich no one knows, and when we are on the eve of the retirement of the \nbaby boom generation. So there can only be one result; that is, to \ndramatically explode deficits and debt.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. May I ask the Senator one more question about his chart \nbefore he puts it down?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is all this focus about this $550 billion figure \nbeing the amount of the tax cut. But as I understand it, the $550 \nbillion figure is only part of the tax cut that is in the budget \nresolution. This is the part that would proceed under the special \nprocedures, the so-called reconciliation, which prevents extended \ndebate in order to address the issue. The budget resolution provides \n$550 billion there, but it also provides an additional $725 billion in \nadditional tax cuts. Now, they would have to go through the regular \nprocedure, but, nevertheless, that is $1.3 trillion. And then you add \nthe interest, and you are talking about $1.6 trillion tax cuts, at a \ntime when we are in budget deficit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Record budget deficit.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand. In fact, I understand that the budget \ndeficit for this year is now projected to be twice as much as it has \never been before--an absolute record budget deficit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. We now estimate the budget deficit, under this \nbudget resolution, will be between $500 and $600 billion for this year \nalone on a $2.2 trillion budget. Some have said these deficits are \nsmall. There is nothing small about them. They are massive. They are \nrecord. They are the biggest we have ever had in dollar amount.\n  If we look back to 2 years ago when we were told that we could \nexpect--instead of deficits--nearly $6 trillion of surpluses, we now \nknow, if we adopt what is before us, instead of $5.6 trillion of \nsurpluses--if we adopt the budget resolution before us--we will have \nover $2 trillion of deficits over that same period.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that chart?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In January of 2001, when this administration first came \nin, we were projecting out, over the 10-year time period, a surplus of \n$5.6 trillion. At the time, President Bush, and his Republican \nsupporters, said: Well, we are going to run this huge surplus. We \nshould do a tax cut because we don't want to be taking taxes just to \nbuild up a surplus.\n  Well, a lot of people said: Don't be so sure about that. Let's not \nrush into it. Why don't we pay down the debt some more? We are finally \ndoing that.\n  No, no, they wanted to do this big tax cut because we had a projected \nsurplus. Well, they did their tax cut. They rammed that through here.\n  Now we are projecting big deficits, and they want to do another big \ntax cut, even though they are projecting big deficits.\n  Whatever the fiscal situation is--big surpluses or big deficits--it \nmakes no difference; they are bound and determined to do tax cuts for \nvery wealthy people.\n  As I understand it, analysis of the President's tax proposal shows \nthat almost 50 percent of the benefits of that tax cut go to the top 1 \npercent of the population. Almost 75 percent of it goes to the top 5 \npercent of the population.\n  So there is this absolutely zealous drive for big tax cuts for very \nwealthy people regardless of the Nation's fiscal situation and \nregardless of the fact that this proposal is going to drive us deeper \ninto deficit and deeper into debt. Isn't that the situation?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is the situation. And what is most stunning about it \nis that it is all done at the worst possible time: at a time we are at \nwar, the cost of which none of us can know; and also on the eve of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, a cost we do know because the \nnumber of people eligible for Social Security and Medicare are going to \ndouble.\n  And I believe this proposal is very clear. If this is adopted, this \nwill head us in the direction of massive cuts in Medicare, in Social \nSecurity, and most of the rest of Government as we know it.\n  I think it is absolutely foreordained, if this is adopted, you will \nsee proposals that will be cloaked in the soft language of reform which \nwill hide deep cuts in Social Security, in Medicare, and all other \nparts of Government. You can really have no other outcome because you \nhave record budget deficits now; and what this proposal is, is to cut \ntaxes by $1.3 trillion, not counting the interest cost, to increase \nspending by $1.1 trillion over the so-called baseline, including the \ninterest cost. What you are left with, then, is even deeper deficits, \nright on the brink of the retirement of the baby boom generation which \nstarts in 2008, which we all know what it will lead to. And I will \nshow, as we go through this presentation, where that leads.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further point?\n  The Senator made reference to the context in which we find ourselves. \nI am frank to tell you, I think this is a reckless budget resolution. I \nthink the President's budget proposal was reckless. I think this \nresolution is reckless. As the very able Senator from North Dakota has \npointed out, we are in a war, and we have not only the war costs but \nthe reconstruction costs. We are about to do a supplemental of about \n$80 billion, most of it devoted to that purpose. And there is no one \nwho contends that is anything other than the initial downpayment on the \ncost.\n  But, furthermore, we still have the worldwide battle against al-Qaida \nand\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\ninternational terrorism. We have to confront the challenge of providing \nfor homeland security. We have other threats around the world, to \nmention but one, North Korea.\n  No prudent person would give away their fiscal ability to deal with \nthose situations the way this budget resolution does. It is \nextraordinary what this budget resolution is doing.\n  I ask my friend from North Dakota, isn't this an abject failure to \nreserve fiscal strength to deal with these pressing problems which we \nknow are right there in front of us?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just a parliamentary inquiry: I would \nlike to remind my colleagues the rules of the Senate are to address the \nChair, ask questions through the Chair, not to have colloquies between \ntwo Senators.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to answer my colleague by saying this: \nThis process and this budget, to me, is totally disconnected from \nreality. In fact, I have never seen a greater disconnect with reality \nthan is represented by this budget. Here we are, with record budget \ndeficits, approaching $500 to $600 billion this year, and what we do is \nincrease spending under this resolution, cut the revenue, plunging the \ncountry deeper into deficits, when we are at war, the cost of which we \ndo not know, and when we are on the eve of the retirement of the baby \nboom generation.\n  Let me just say, this fiscal turnaround that we have seen--when \npeople ask us, well, where did the money go? Here is where it went. \nOver the period in question, 36 percent went to the tax cuts--both \nthose already passed and those proposed.\n  The second biggest reason for the disappearance of the surplus is the \nadditional spending caused by the attack on the country and the war; \nthat is, the increased defense spending and the increased homeland \nsecurity spending.\n  The third biggest reason is that revenue is coming in below \nexpectation, apart from the tax cut; that is, the tax cut is the \nbiggest single reason. The third biggest reason--close to the second--\nis that revenue is coming in below what was anticipated.\n  And the smallest reason, over the 10-year period, is the economic \ndownturn at 9 percent.\n  The result of all this is that the budget before us--after many of \nthe Members of this body pledged not to take Social Security for other \npurposes--this is the total amount of Social Security surplus over this \nperiod: $2.7 trillion.\n  This budget takes $2,698,000,000,000 from the Social Security trust \nfund surpluses and uses it for other purposes, uses it to fund the tax \ncut, uses it to pay for other things. This budget has deficits. Some \nhave said they are small and short term. Here is what they are. They \nare not small, and they are not short term. This year we now anticipate \na deficit on an operating basis of $558 billion, by far the biggest we \nhave ever had. You see throughout the rest of the decade, we never get \nbelow $300 billion in deficits. Again, that is not counting Social \nSecurity, not taking Social Security and using it to pay for other \nthings.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for a question \nabout one of his charts?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to go back to the previous chart. As I \nunderstand it, because of the tax cut and also because we are \nconstrained to do these programs for the war and for homeland security, \nover this 10-year period we are going to be using $2.7 trillion from \nthe Social Security trust fund to cover those costs; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, if we didn't do that, that $2.7 \ntrillion would be in the Social Security trust fund to help us take \ncare of the extra stress on the system that will come from the \nretirement of the baby boomers, this upsurge in people taking \nretirement, so that one needs to understand if you didn't do the tax \ncut or if you constrained some of these other programs, you wouldn't \nthen be drawing down the Social Security trust fund and, therefore, it \nwould be in a better position to address the extra stress that will \ncome when the baby boom generation retires. Is that the connection one \nshould be making here?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me just say, the Senator has put his finger on what \nto me is so stunningly irresponsible about this budget. If this money \nwas not being taken and used for other purposes, the surplus money, it \ncould then be used in one of two ways. It could be used to pay down \ndebt that would better prepare us for what is to come, or it could be \nused, some portion of it, to prepay the liability of what we know is to \ncome. That is what other countries are doing. Other countries, \nrecognizing the same demographic time bomb, are taking the surpluses \nbeing generated now in their trust funds and are investing them or they \nare prepaying the liability.\n  Instead of paying down debt or prepaying liability, we are using the \nmoney for tax cuts and for other expenditures of government that leave \nus less capable to deal with what is to come.\n  That is a profound mistake, and we will live to regret it. And we \nwill then face a circumstance in which we will be asked to make even \nmore draconian reductions in the benefits of those programs, or drastic \ntax increases.\n  Let me say, the President told us 2 years ago his budget would pay \ndown a record amount of national debt. He said:\n\n       We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever.\n\n  He said then:\n\n       Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money \n     that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to \n     our children and grandchildren.\n\n  I believe the President was absolutely right in saying that. But look \nat what is happening. There is no record paydown of debt. There is no \npaydown of debt. Instead the gross debt of the United States is \nexploding. From $6.7 trillion in 2003, instead of being virtually paid \noff, which he said would occur by 2008, we are nearly doubling the \nnational debt just in this 10-year period. So the national debt would \nbe $12 trillion at the end of 2013 if this budget is adopted, the plan \nthat it contains.\n\n  The President this year told us:\n\n       This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will \n     not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other \n     Congresses, to other presidents and other generations.\n\n  In this very budget, what we see contained is a call for the biggest \nincrease in the debt limit in the history of the country. They are \nasking for a $984 billion increase in the debt limit as part of this \nproposal. That is the biggest increase in the national debt in the \nhistory of America.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This budget conference report is seeking an increase in \nthe debt limit of just under $1 trillion; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, $984 billion. The previous record increase was under \nthe previous President Bush, November of 1990, when they got a $915 \nbillion increase in the debt limit. As you know, the House has \ndifferent rules than the Senate. We will not conclude action on the \ndebt limit here probably until sometime later. But that is what this \nbudget resolution contemplates, an increase in the debt limit now of \n$984 billion, nearly a $1 trillion increase in the debt.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, until when is this \nadditional $1 trillion increase in the debt limit supposed to last? \nWill they not come back at any point, or are they going to come back \nagain and again seeking increases?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Under this budget proposal, they will probably have to \ncome back as early as next year----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Oh, my.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Late next year and ask for even more expansion of debt \nbecause this budget resolution is one constructed on deficits and debt. \nIt is a testimony to deficits and debt. It can only get worse.\n  It is interesting, the effect on the rest of the budget. For example, \nthe interest costs, we were told 2 years ago the interest costs to the \nFederal Government over this next decade would be $622 billion. \nInstead, because of the failed fiscal plan, the interest costs alone \nwill be $2.3 trillion. That is an increase in interest costs of $1.7 \ntrillion. Obviously, we have to pay it because we have borrowed it, and \nwe owe it. But those are dollars that can't buy a\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n\nsingle tank. They can't buy a single weapons system. They can't buy a \nsingle airplane. They can't educate a child. They can't house the \nhomeless. They can't do any of the other things the Federal Government \nhas responsibility for. They can't pay down debt. Those are dollars \nthat are just used to service the debt we are running up.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I remind my colleagues, they need to ask questions \nthrough the Chair, and they need to ask questions and answer questions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to put a question to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, when this administration came into \noffice, it was my recollection that the Federal budget was running a \nsurplus. Therefore, there was not only no increase in Federal interest \ncosts, but we were, in fact, year to year, reducing Federal interest \ncosts and had done so for 2 or 3 years prior to President Bush coming \ninto office; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct. We had actually been in the happy \ncircumstance of not only running a balanced budget, but running a \nsurplus. In fact, we had stopped the practice of taking Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses to fund other functions of Government. It was \ncritically important that we do that because we are getting close to \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  Some of our colleagues say to us that, you know, deficits don't \nreally matter anymore. What a profoundly wrong notion that is. \nObviously, deficits matter. When the Federal Government is compelled to \nborrow money, that puts us into competition with others who want to \nborrow money, that drives up the cost of interest rates, and that slows \nthe economy. That is why when I reviewed this budget, it is not an \neconomic growth budget, it is a budget that will hurt long-term \neconomic growth because of the deadweight of these deficits and debt. \nThat is not just my opinion.\n  I will get to the point in the presentation where we talk about \nothers who are economists who have been hired by the White House, by \nthe CBO, to tell us the implications of what is being done; and what \nthey have concluded is that this will hurt economic growth because it \nis all being financed by borrowed money.\n  What does that mean? When the Federal Government borrows money, we \nare in competition with the private sector, and that reduces the pool \nof societal savings. That is a dissavings. When you reduce the pool of \nsocietal savings, that reduces the amount of money available for \ninvestment and that hurts long-term economic growth.\n  It is not just this Senator who says that. Interestingly enough, the \nCBO is headed by a man chosen by our colleagues on the other side, who \ncame directly from the White House. He has done seven long-term models \nlooking at the effect of this budget. In four of the seven, he said \ndeficits would be even worse as a result of this budget proposal. In \nthree he found it would be better, but only on the assumption that \nAmericans, over the next decade, would work harder in preparation for \nthe massive tax increases that will inevitably flow from the adoption \nof this kind of a budget.\n  I hope people understand where this is all headed because it is as \nclear as it can be. Nobody can vote today and say they didn't know. \nNobody can vote today and not have their record reviewed and have \npeople look back and say these people led us down a path of deficits \nand debt that fundamentally weakened the country.\n  This is a chart from the President's own budget document. This comes \nfrom his analytical perspectives, page 43. This is his long-term \noutlook. We never escape from deficit under the President's plan--\nnever--according to his own estimates. In fact, we are in the sweet \nspot now. You can see that the deficits here are the smallest they are \ngoing to be. Yet these are record deficits. It may look like a small \namount of red, but it is the most red we have ever experienced, and it \nis going to get worse. Under the President's own analysis of his plan, \nit gets worse because the cost of the tax cuts explode at the very time \nthe cost of the Government explodes because of the retirement of the \nbaby boom generation.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that chart?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, this chart shows the deficit as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product and it is almost 14 percent at \nthis point out here; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct. If this were in dollar terms, I could \nnot put it on a chart. The sea of red ink that would follow would not \nfit on any chart that I am allowed to use on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The European Union, when they made the economic \nagreement with respect to all the European Union countries, set as a \nrequirement that the deficit that a country was running could not be \ngreater than 3 percent of GDP; and countries had to go through a \nrigorous effort to get below the 3 percent of GDP figure as a deficit.\n  Yet what the President has given us, and what is reflected in this \nbudget resolution as a first significant step in that direction, is a \npolicy that is going to put the deficit as a percentage of GDP in the \ndouble figures. It will well exceed 10 percent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What is interesting is that, right now, we would not be \neligible to join the European Union because our deficit is in excess of \nwhat is required for a member state to join the European Union. We \nwould be disqualified. We are headed for a circumstance in which we \nwould not be qualified for decades to come.\n  The fundamental reason is contained on this chart, I say to my \ncolleague. This, to me, is the single most important thing to \nunderstand. This chart shows the Social Security surplus, Social \nSecurity trust fund, the green bar. The blue bar is the Medicare trust \nfund. The red bar is the cost of the proposed and already-enacted tax \ncuts. What one can see is that right now we are running big surpluses \nin the Medicare and Social Security trust funds. In fact, the tax cuts \nright now, in this part of the time period, are less than the trust \nfund surpluses.\n  Look what happens when the baby boomers start to retire and those \ntrust funds go cash negative. It is at the very time that the cost of \nthe President's tax cuts explode. What does that do? That leads us into \ndeep deficits and debt.\n  I don't want anybody to conclude from this that this Senator doesn't \nfavor some tax cuts because I do. I think they are necessary right now \nto stimulate the economy, give lift to the economy. But we have to \nbalance the need for short-term additional stimulus both by way of \nspending and tax cuts, with the long-term need to return to fiscal \nbalance and to prepare for retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  What is being done here does neither because only 5 percent of the \ncost of the President's proposed tax cuts in the stimulus package are \neffective this year, when we need the stimulus, when the economy is \nweak. Ninety-five percent of the cost is in future years, when it is \nonly going to explode deficits and debt. It will lead to a weakened \neconomic position and will fundamentally alter this country's ability \nto meet its obligations.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am struck in looking at that chart by the extent to \nwhich the cost of these tax cuts explodes, as the Senator says, in \nfuture years.\n  For instance, take the year 2023, this is all deficit. But all of \nthis part of that deficit is from the explosion of the tax cut. The \nbalance is from what happens in the trust funds for Medicare and Social \nSecurity. But this chart so clearly demonstrates that these tax cuts \nthat are being talked about have built into them a tremendous expanded \ncost in future years.\n  It is extraordinarily dramatic because all of that is exploding tax \ncuts. We are being set on a path that is dooming us to large deficits \nand large debt.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, what this means is \nnot just numbers on a page, not just deficits, whether people care \nabout deficits or not, they matter a lot to the functioning of the \neconomy. They matter a lot to the ability of the United States to keep \nits obligations.\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\n  The implication of all this is much more direct. This is going to \ncompel at a future time, according to the former Congressional Budget \nOffice Director, massive cuts in benefits of Social Security and \nMedicare, massive tax increases, and massive debt. That can be the only \noutcome because none of this adds up in any serious way.\n  For those who say deficits do not matter, Chairman Greenspan of the \nFederal Reserve believes deficits matter. This is what he said in \ntestimony before the Banking Committee, where my colleague is the \nranking member:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy, unless \n     attended.\n\n  It is not just the view of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, but \nthe Committee for Economic Development, which is made up of some of the \nmost prominent business leaders in the country, has looked at these \nbudget proposals, and this is what their conclusion is:\n  No. 1, current budget projections seriously understate the problem;\n  No. 2, while slower economic growth has caused much of the immediate \ndeterioration in the deficit, the deficits in later years reflect our \ntax-and-spending choices;\n  No. 3, deficits do matter;\n  And No. 4, the aging of our population compounds the problem.\n  The other day in the New York Times, some of our most able former \ncolleagues and former members of administrations, both Republican and \nDemocrat, put out this op-ed. This is former Senator Kerrey, former \nSenator Nunn, both Democrats, former Senator Rudman, a prominent \nRepublican, Pete Peterson who was in the Cabinet of a Republican \nadministration, Robert Rubin, former Secretary of the Treasury, and \nPaul Volcker, the distinguished former head of the Federal Reserve.\n  They asked the question:\n\n       Will Congress stand up for fiscal responsibility?\n\n  They said in this article:\n\n       Tax cuts are the primary focus of this year's budget \n     debate. To speed enactment, Congress is planning to use a \n     special fast-track procedure called reconciliation. While \n     determining the size of the tax cut to be given fast-track \n     protection in the budget is sometimes dismissed as a \n     procedural matter, it is not. Whatever its size, a tax cut \n     that receives this protection is almost certain to be enacted \n     in later tax legislation. Given the rapidly deteriorating \n     long-term fiscal outlook, neither proposal--\n\n  Neither the House nor the Senate proposal--\n\n     is fiscally responsible. It is illogical to begin turning \n     back toward balanced budgets by enacting a tax cut that will \n     only make the long-term outlook worse.\n       Furthermore, the proposed tax cuts are not useful for \n     short-term fiscal stimulus, since only a small portion would \n     take effect this year. Nor would they spur long-term economic \n     growth. In fact, tax cuts financed by perpetual deficits \n     will eventually slow the economy.\n  When our friends say this is a growth package, it is not a growth \npackage. This is a package that undermines long-term growth. We have \nsix of our most distinguished colleagues, former Senators and former \nmembers of the Cabinet, on a bipartisan basis telling us that is the \ncase.\n  We do not have to just look to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve or \nformer Cabinet members or former Senators; we can look at the people \nwho have been hired by the White House to tell them the effect of their \npolicies. This is what they said.\n  They showed that the policy being proposed will give a short-term \nbump, but after 2004, we will get less economic growth than if we did \nnothing. We would be better off to do nothing than to adopt this policy \nbecause it explodes deficits and debt. The deadweight of those deficits \nand debt will hurt long-term economic growth.\n  We have another distinguished economist, the head of Economy.com, who \ndid this analysis of two competing proposals, what the Democrats \nproposed and what the President proposed. This is their conclusion.\n  The Democratic plan will give almost twice as much economic growth in \n2003 and 2004 and not do the long-term harm of the President's proposal \nbecause we do not explode the deficits and debt in the way the \nPresident's plan and the budget plan before us does.\n  If we just want to look at reality, since we pursued this course, \nsince we have gone to this notion of borrow and spend, here is what has \nhappened. We have lost 2.6 million jobs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. My understanding is that the unemployment rate in the \ncourse of this administration has gone from 4 percent to almost 6 \npercent, and that the number of long-term unemployed, people out of \nwork for more than 26 weeks, is now at almost 2 million people. \nConsumer confidence in the latest survey is at a 10-year low. So we are \nfacing serious economic challenges.\n  Of course, the Senator suggested, as did the quote from our former \ncolleagues, that you could do some effort to boost the economy this \nyear and next year to try to bring us out of this situation, but the \nPresident's proposal does very little of that.\n  What the President's proposal does is put into place these exploding \ntax cuts out into future years that will significantly boost the \ndeficit and the debt problem, rather than addressing the immediate \nchallenge we have of trying to give a boost to the economy now. So not \nonly does this budget proposal commit the Nation to a serious long-term \nfiscal problem, but it fails to do what needs to be done in the short \nterm, in terms of trying to restore jobs and economic growth. I ask my \ncolleague, is that not correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I believe that is correct. I say to the Presiding Officer \nin response to my colleague, I really do not know what could be more \nclear. We do not need to just look at economists' projections. We can \nlook at our own history.\n  We had this attempt in the 1980s to pursue the economic policy that \nis now being attempted. It did not end happily. It exploded the \ndeficits and debt of the country. It quadrupled the national debt.\n  Then in the nineties, we took a different approach, the approach of \nbalancing budgets, of investment in technology, of bringing down \nFederal spending, of raising revenue to balance budgets. What it kicked \noff was the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. We \nturned deficits into surpluses, and we had the lowest unemployment rate \nin 30 years, the lowest inflation rate in 30 years, and the strongest \nperiod of business investment in our Nation's history.\n  That is a real-world example of two competing views of how to \nstrengthen the economy. Now we are going back to the failed policy of \nthe eighties and doing it at the worst possible time.\n  Then there was time, before the baby boomers started to retire. Now \nthere is no time. The mistakes that are made now will be paid for by \nincreased debt, by reduced benefits, by increased taxes. That is where \nwe are headed.\n  And I would quote again our most distinguished colleagues warning us:\n\n       Congress cannot simply conclude that deficits do not \n     matter. Over the long-term, deficits matter a great deal. \n     They lower future economic growth by reducing the level of \n     national savings that can be devoted to productive \n     investments.\n\n  That is the argument I have been making this morning.\n\n       They raise interest rates higher than they would be \n     otherwise. They raise interest payments on the national debt. \n     They reduce the fiscal flexibility to deal with unexpected \n     developments. If we forget these economic consequences, we \n     risk creating an unsupportable tax burden for the next \n     generation.\n\n  I guess we are in this mode now where we live for the moment. I guess \nwe do not worry or care about what we do now, how it affects the \nfuture. But we ought to. The lessons are clear. The warning signs are \nthere.\n  Every Senator is going to be responsible for their vote. Every \nSenator can be held accountable in the future for what they did to \neither strengthen this country or to weaken it. Every Senator is going \nto have a very clear choice in a few hours: Do they support a budget \nthat plunges us deeper into deficits and debt, or do they say it is \ntime to pull back?\n  This is the economic record on job creation of administrations going \nback to President Eisenhower. Every one of them created jobs. This is \nthe first one to lose private sector jobs in 50 years. If we look to \npublic opinion, the American people are saying:\n\n       On the home front, Americans strongly agreed with the past \n     week's Senate action to\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\n     slash the President's proposed tax cut. Two in three \n     respondents--Republicans, Democrats and independents alike--\n     favored the Senate plan to reduce Bush's $726 billion tax cut \n     by more than half to help pay for the war, shore up Social \n     Security and reduce the deficit.\n\n  That is two-thirds of the American people sending us a message. I do \nnot think we should do budgets based on polling, but I do think we \nought to do it based on common sense, and common sense ought to tell us \nthat exploding deficits and debt when we are at war, exploding deficits \nand debt when the baby boom generation is about to retire, exploding \ndeficits and debt when we know it will harm long-term economic growth, \nis truly a fool's errand, and we will live to rue the day we made \nshortsighted decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield whatever time he may consume to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from North \nDakota, the former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and now \nranking member, for an extraordinarily perceptive opening statement \nwith respect to this budget resolution.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has taken a long-term view of where the \nAmerican economy is going and the challenges we face. He has assumed \nthat role repeatedly, and I think it is extremely important that we not \nsimply live for the moment and that someone point out the direction in \nwhich we are going and what the consequences will be.\n  The vote we are about to cast has consequences. It has consequences \nfor today, tomorrow, and many years into the future. Members of the \nSenate need to fully appreciate the import of this decision.\n  I will speak a few minutes about equities in this budget resolution. \nWhat needs to be understood is that the whole driving thrust of this \nbudget resolution is to put in place a large tax cut which, under the \nPresident's proposal, will go overwhelmingly to people at the very top \nof our income and wealth scale in this country.\n  The drive to do that is carried so far that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are prepared to twist the procedures of this \ninstitution like a pretzel in order to push through their large tax \ncuts because they are encountering considerable resistance to them by \npeople who are stopping and looking at them and saying this is not the \nresponsible thing to do. Indeed, it is a reckless thing to do.\n  One of my colleagues looking at what they are trying to do said: It \nnever occurred to me, I never thought I would see the day when they \nwould be using these kinds of gimmicks in order to push their agenda.\n  This is no proper process. This is simply a twisting of process in \norder to try to get to this tax cut result.\n  Let's look at what the tax cut does and its implications. The budget, \nof course, sets all our national priorities. We make fundamental \ndecisions within the budget: How much support we will provide for \nparticular programs, what we will do on the tax side. Of course, the \naggregate amount of the budget can have a profound effect upon our \noverall economy, not only this year but extending well into the future. \nThe Senator from North Dakota very carefully and lucidly spelled out \nthose large budget consequences, as is, of course, the responsibility \nof the leader on the Budget Committee to do.\n  We know the fiscal situation has deteriorated drastically since this \nadministration took office. In January of 2001, when President Bush \ntook office, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting a budget \nsurplus over 10 years of $5.6 trillion. The President pointed to that \nsurplus as a rationale for doing the 2001 tax cuts. Now, over that same \nperiod, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting a $2.1 trillion \ndeficit, assuming that the President's tax proposals are adopted. This \nis a swing of $7.7 trillion in our fiscal position, a swing from a \nprojected surplus of $5.6 trillion to a projected deficit of $2.1 \ntrillion.\n  Yet facing this, the whole focus of this budget resolution has been \nwhether to create room within it for another very large tax cut which \nthe President is seeking. This is not going to be a growth package. In \nfact, there is hardly any stimulus in the President's proposal for this \nyear or next year. Instead, this budget is going to drive us deeper \ninto the deficit and debt hole. It is going to leave us with deficits \nprojected out into the indefinite future. We are really mortgaging away \nour economic future. This is very bad macroeconomic policy.\n  In addition, within this budget our urgent national priorities are \nnot being adequately addressed. There is not enough for homeland \ndefense. We have a pressing health care problem in this country with \nregard to both the uninsured and prescription drug benefits for our \nsenior citizens. We have an affordable housing crisis in which millions \nof working families cannot afford even a modest apartment in many high-\ncost cities. The mayors across the country are saying they are getting \ninadequate support to meet their responsibilities. Our first responders \nalso have very large demands placed upon them. And instead of providing \nfully for education to give meaning to the Leave No Child Behind \neducational policy, we are focused on a tax cut proposal seeking to \nmake sure no millionaire is left behind.\n\n  It must be understood that if you do these large tax cuts that \nbenefit primarily wealthy people, you will not be able to support a \nnumber of programs which people all across the country are crying out \nfor, and you will be boosting the deficit in a completely unreasonable \nfashion. There is no magic formula; it is all a question of balance. My \nown view is that a more sensible balance would be not to do these large \ntax cuts, and instead to strengthen some of these programs, and then to \nuse the balance--most of the money--to hold down the deficit and not \nboost the debt and not commit the Nation down that path.\n  Let me talk about one other issue of fairness and equity. I want to \nnote that in almost every previous instance when the Nation went to \nwar, not only did we not cut taxes, we raised taxes in order to help \npay for the war and meet its costs. There is a conference committee \nmeeting at this very moment on the supplemental appropriations bill. We \nexpect it to be somewhere in the vicinity of $80 billion, most of that \ndirected to the Department of Defense for the costs of the war and some \nfor reconstruction. It is obvious to everyone this is but a \ndownpayment. No one is asserting this is anywhere near meeting what the \nfull costs will be. So we know there is more to come.\n  That raises the question of whether this is the appropriate time to \ncommit away significant resources for a tax cut to benefit wealthy \nAmericans. As I said, analysis indicates that almost half of the \nbenefits of the President's proposal would go to the top 1 percent, \nalmost three-quarters to the top 5 percent. Is this the fair and \nequitable thing to do at the very time when the Nation is being \nrallied, as it should be, to support our men and women in the Armed \nForces?\n  This is the time when we are talking about sacrifice, and it is \nappropriate we should be talking about sacrifice at a time like this \nbecause one cannot follow the events taking place now in Iraq without a \ndeep appreciation of the sacrifice our fighting men and women are \nmaking and the risks they are taking every minute.\n  Let me ask this question: What sacrifice are those who are most \nfavored in our society in terms of their economic position making at \nthis critical juncture in our Nation's history? Not only are they not \nmaking a sacrifice, but indeed they are getting a very large tax cut \nwhich will place our economy in a more difficult position as we move \ninto the future. What a sad commentary that these excessive tax cuts, \nwhich will contribute to deficits, which will build up the debt and the \nburden of paying the interest on that debt and, indeed, paying down \nthat debt, will fall upon the fighting men and women when they return \nhome and undertake their economic activities moving out into the \nfuture.\n  They are now being called upon to make a double sacrifice, the \nsacrifice of serving in the Middle East and the sacrifice when they \nreturn home of helping to pay off this debt that has arisen in large \npart because of these enormous tax cuts that are being given to those \nat the very top of our income\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\nscale. Where is the fairness and the equity in this approach?\n  The Nation faces serious challenges. We have our men and women at \nthis very moment in danger abroad. It is a time for all to sacrifice. \nWhat sacrifice here at home will the beneficiaries of the tax cut be \nmaking? This is such a sharp contrast with previous occasions when the \nNation has gone into war. In most instances, not only did we not give a \ntax cut, recognizing we had to pay for the war, we, in fact, increased \ntaxes in order to meet that burden.\n  At the beginning of World War II when Winston Churchill became Prime \nMinister, he told his nation, ``I have nothing to offer but blood, \ntoil, tears and sweat.'' Our young men and women positioned in the \nMiddle East are called upon to sacrifice even as we debate this budget \nresolution. There will be sweat, there will be tears, there will be \ntoil, and there will be blood on their part. What sacrifice will be \nmade by those who are the most well off in our society under this \nbudget resolution? None whatsoever. In fact, not only are they making \nno sacrifice, but they are programmed to reap benefits, extensive \nbenefits, at a time when the Nation is facing critical challenges. \nShould not those most advantaged be making their own sacrifice instead \nof seeking to reap a large economic benefit?\n\n  I urge the defeat of this budget resolution. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to go back to the editorial, \nthe opinion piece that was in the New York Times written by three of \nour former colleagues: Senator Kerrey, Senator Nunn, Senator Rudman--\nSenator Rudman, a Republican who was on the Budget Committee. Senator \nNunn and Senator Kerrey took great interest in budget affairs here in \nthe Senate. Also, Pete Peterson, the former Secretary of Commerce, \nRepublican; former Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin; and the \nformer head of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Volcker; warning us that what \nwe are about to do here is not fiscally responsible.\n  They said in this article--and I want to read an extended version of \nthis for my colleagues because I think it is critically important it be \nin the Record before we vote. They said:\n\n       The fiscal outlook is much worse than official projections \n     indicate. These projections assume that the tax cuts enacted \n     in 2001 will expire at the end of 2010. They also assume that \n     discretionary spending, the part of the budget that pays for \n     national defense, domestic security, education and \n     transportation, will shrink continuously as a share of the \n     economy. Neither of these assumptions is realistic.\n       Moreover, the official projections do not include the costs \n     of war and reconstruction in Iraq. And they ignore the \n     inevitable need to reform the alternative minimum tax, which \n     is not indexed for inflation and will apply to some 40 \n     million households within 10 years--up from two million \n     today.\n\n  Let me just say with respect to the alternative minimum tax, boy, \nhave a lot of people got a surprise coming. They think they are going \nto get a tax cut under this plan. But there is this little thing nobody \ntalks about called the alternative minimum tax that only applies to 2 \nmillion taxpayers today. By the end of this period of the budget, it is \ngoing to apply to 40 million taxpayers. It costs $600 billion to fix. \nNot a dime of it is in this budget.\n\n       Under more realistic assumptions--\n\n  They go on to say in their opinion piece--\n\n     the deficit projections are cause for alarm. A recent study \n     by Goldman Sachs includes this forecast: if the president's \n     proposed new tax cuts are enacted, a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit is approved, [which he has also proposed], the \n     A.M.T. is adjusted and appropriations grow modestly, the \n     deficits over the next 10 years will total $4.2 trillion--\n\n  That is double the amount I have been talking about in my assessment \nof this budget this morning--twice as much as what I have been warning \nmy colleagues about--\n\n     even if the Social Security surplus is included.\n\n  It will be $4.2 trillion of deficits. In other words, if the Social \nSecurity trust funds are used to pay for other things, the deficit will \nbe $4.2 trillion.\n\n       If [the Social Security trust fund] is not included, the \n     deficit would be $6.7 trillion.\n\n  That is just over the next decade.\n\n       Under these circumstances the ratio of publicly held debt \n     to gross domestic product climbs within 10 years to near 50 \n     percent, from 33 percent just two years ago.\n       And all of this happens before the fiscal going gets tough. \n     Looming at the end of the decade is a demographic \n     transformation that threatens to swamp the budget and the \n     economy with unfunded benefit promises, like Social Security \n     and Medicare, of roughly $25 trillion in present value. Our \n     children and grandchildren already face unthinkable payroll \n     tax burdens that could go as high as 33 percent to pay for \n     these promised benefits.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       It is neither fiscally nor morally responsible to give \n     ourselves tax cuts and leave future generations with an even \n     higher tax burden.\n       And yet tax cuts are the primary focus of this year's \n     budget debate.\n\n  Mr. President, in just a few hours we will vote on this budget. This \nwill be a time of choice. This won't be a decision just for this year. \nThis will put in place revenue hemorrhages and increased spending that \nwill put us on a never ending escalator, going in just one direction--\nstraight down into deeper deficits, in deeper debt, right on the brink \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation. It will only escalate \nthose trends, leaving us in a totally unsustainable position.\n  The tax cut that we are voting on is not what has been advertised, \n$350 billion in the Senate--oh, no. The tax cut in this plan, in this \nbudget resolution that is before us, is $1.3 trillion; $550 billion \nreconciled to the Finance Committee, $725 billion provided elsewhere in \nthe resolution--a tax cut of $1.3 trillion, with an additional interest \ncost of some $300 billion, for a total reduction in revenue of $1.6 \ntrillion just over the next decade, when we are already in record \nbudget deficits.\n  This is a proposal that borders on the preposterous. It borders on \nthe absurd. I sometimes come to work thinking the Senate of the United \nStates has become like Disneyland: It is all illusion here. It is \ntotally detached from reality. It has all become the politics of sound \nbite. Substance has absolutely fallen by the wayside, and there is no \nserious concern where all this leads. But it is inevitable. This leads \nto massive deficits and debt that can only undermine the strength and \nsecurity of this economy, that can only endanger the economic lives of \nthe American people.\n  This is profoundly wrong, and I urge my colleagues to think--to \nthink, to pause. I know there is a rush to judgment here. We are on a \nFriday afternoon right before a 2-week break. Members want to leave.\n  But what is going to be decided here has profound consequences for \nthe future of our Nation; a $1.3 trillion tax cut--not paid for, not \noffset by spending reductions, but paid for by borrowed money and by \nlooting the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare. That is what \nis about to happen here.\n\n  Virtually every economist has told us, when you take tax cuts like \nthis and, instead of paying for them with spending reductions, you \nborrow the money, you weaken the economic vitality of this Nation. You \ntake money out of the societal savings, the pool of societal savings, \nthereby reducing the money that is available for investment, thereby \nweakening the economic strength of our Nation.\n  That is exactly what our former distinguished colleagues are telling \nus. I repeat their concluding paragraph:\n\n       Congress cannot simply conclude that deficits don't matter. \n     Over the long term, deficits matter a great deal. They lower \n     future economic growth by reducing the level of national \n     savings that can be devoted to productive investments. They \n     raise interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. \n     They raise interest payments on the national debt. They \n     reduce the fiscal flexibility to deal with unexpected \n     developments [such as the terrorist threat on this country].\n\n  ``Terrorist threat on this country''--that is not part of their op-\ned. I add that because we all now know the devastation that something \nunanticipated can cause to this country.\n\n       If we forget these economic consequences, we risk creating \n     an insupportable tax burden for the next generation.\n\n  Now, I know, in politics, we often live for the next election and \nthere is not too great a concern for the future. But, colleagues, I \nurge you to think carefully about the decision that is about to be made \nbecause it will have profound consequences for this Nation. I believe \nit will weaken our country, not strengthen it. I believe it will damage \nlong-term economic growth, not improve it.\n  Does that mean that on this side we are against any tax reduction? \nNo. I\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\nwould actually support more tax reduction in this year than the \nPresident proposes in order to give lift to the economy at a time of \nserious weakness. But, over the 10-year period, we simply cannot afford \n$1.3 trillion out of the revenue stream, when we are already in record \ndeficit, and when we face the retirement of the baby boom generation, \nand we are at war, the cost of which is unknown.\n  I know the other side must believe it has the votes to pass this \nbudget. We have had no role in it. We were locked out of the conference \ncommittee. Oh, we were invited to the first meeting, and never invited \nback. So this is a budget that was constructed in a conference \ncommittee that excluded the minority.\n  That is not the way the business of Congress is supposed to be done. \nThere was not one member of the minority present when this scheme was \nhatched to come out here with a budget reconciliation number that \nsuggests there is a different number in the Senate than in the House. \nIn fact, both committees have been given an instruction of $550 billion \nfor the reconciliation provision. But then, in a sleight of hand, the \nFinance Committee is told, there will be a supermajority point of order \nif you carry out the instruction you have been given.\n  Never been done before. Never been done before.\n  And when the package comes back from the conference committee, even \nthough there never was a reconciliation, never was a working out or a \nmeeting of the minds between the House and the Senate, the higher House \nnumber will still enjoy privileged protection on this floor.\n  That is a total perversion of the reconciliation process. And, my \ncolleagues, it may benefit you today, it may hurt you tomorrow, because \nwhat goes around comes around. And the real victim is fiscal \nresponsibility. The real victims are going to be those who are asked to \npick up the tab for what we are going to be spending; the real victims \nare going to be those who have to shoulder the burdens that we all know \nare coming. And we are telling them: We are taking our money while the \ngetting is good, and we are sticking you with the tab.\n\n  I guess that is the message that is going to come from this Senate \ntoday. I find it profoundly disappointing that is the way, apparently, \nthe votes will fall, that it is OK to run up the tab, forget about the \nfuture, stick it to the kids. That is what this vote will be about.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just note, the kids they are sticking it to are the \nones who are fighting now in the Middle East. They are out there making \na sacrifice now, and they are going to come home and be called upon to \nmake a further sacrifice in order to carry this deficit and this \nincreased debt.\n  And why are we having the deficit and the increased debt? In order to \ngive a large, excessive tax break to very wealthy people. Where is the \nequity in that or the fairness in that? None whatever. None whatever.\n  But when you connect it all together, that is exactly what is \nhappening. In order to give these large, excessive tax cuts, we are \ngoing to run these deficits and debt. And the burden on these young men \nand women who are there fighting, will be greatly increased, and they \nwill have to pay it off over the rest of their lifetimes when they come \nhome, having made that sacrifice.\n  Where is the sacrifice, in this budget resolution, on the part of \nthose most advantaged in our society? Where is their sacrifice at this \ncritical juncture in our Nation's history?\n  Not only is there no sacrifice, but they are reaping excessive \nbenefits. This budget resolution ought to be defeated.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say, Mr. President, in response to my colleague, I \nbelieve this budget really is a triumph of ideology. And it is a sad--a \nsad--commentary on this body that we pass something that is this \ndisconnected from reality.\n  At some point we are going to have to join together to try to dig out \nof this mess because this is going to damage the country in a profound \nway. I just hope that at some point reason returns.\n  This is not a conservative document. There is nothing conservative \nabout this. This is radical and reckless and dangerous, and it should \nbe defeated. We should go back, and we should restrain spending, and we \nought to restrain our appetite for tax cuts. We ought to have the \ncourage to stand up and tell the American people what we all know is \ntrue: That when this Nation is already facing record budget deficits, \nand we are at war--the cost of which we cannot know--and on the brink \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation, we simply cannot do \neverything they would like us to do.\n  We cannot have every spending program that they would like. We cannot \nhave every tax cut that they would like and be responsible to the \nfuture. The result will be a weakened America, not a growth package. \nThere may be a little bit more growth in the short term--not as much as \nif we had a more robust stimulus package--but, over time, the \ndeadweight of those deficits and debt, because all of this is being \nborrowed--is all borrowed money--the deadweight of those deficits and \ndebt suppresses economic growth, weakens our economy, reduces \ninvestment.\n  If you do not have investment, you cannot grow. You cannot have \ninvestment unless there are savings that are available to invest. When \nthe Federal Government runs deficits, that reduces the pool of societal \nsavings that are available to invest.\n  This is an economic package that simply cannot stand scrutiny.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as this presentation draws to a close, I \nask unanimous consent to print in the Record a column by David Broder \nfrom March 23 entitled ``Cutbacks To Our Children.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 23, 2003]\n\n                        Cutbacks to Our Children\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Under the shadow of war with Iraq, the House and the Senate \n     last week fought a series of skirmishes over the federal \n     budget for next year. One big, overriding question was at \n     stake: Would President Bush and the Republican majorities in \n     Congress step up to the costs of battle, of homeland defense \n     and of national obligations at home, or would they pass the \n     costs on to future generations?\n       The answer, sadly, is that youngsters yet to be born will \n     see their choices limited and their prospects blighted by the \n     decision of today's politicians to press ahead with an \n     unaffordable tax cut even while the costs of war and \n     reconstruction make earlier spending estimates wildly \n     unrealistic.\n       The possible doubling of the national debt in the next \n     decade will drive up interest costs that must be paid every \n     year--billions of dollars that will not be available for \n     Social Security, Medicare or any of the myriad \n     responsibilities of the government here and abroad.\n       But the squeeze is not all prospective. Some dangerous \n     economies are being forced this year--cutbacks that will have \n     long-term damaging consequences for American society.\n       This was brought home to me from an unexpected source in a \n     group interview last week with six state attorneys general--\n     four Democrats and two Republicans--who were in Washington \n     for a professional conference. Their theme was one I had \n     heard before, not just from social workers, academics and \n     supposed bleeding-heart liberals but from police chiefs, \n     prosecutors and other hard-nosed denizens of the criminal \n     justice system.\n       It is the irrefutable evidence that the most effective \n     anti-crime strategies--and the least expensive--are early \n     childhood education, after-school programs and serious \n     mentoring of youngsters who otherwise are almost certainly \n     fated to be dropouts, delinquents and, yes, prison inmates.\n       Larry Long, the South Dakota attorney general and a 30-year \n     career prosecutor, put it this way: ``I can tell you that by \n     the time kids of 12 or 14 are brought into the juvenile \n     justice system, they are lost. All I can do is warehouse \n     them--at huge expense. The sooner and faster we reach kids, \n     the better the chance of their being saved.''\n       Long and his counterparts from Colorado, Delaware, Maine, \n     Montana and New Mexico described what they are doing to reach \n     vulnerable youngsters--especially those being raised by \n     single mothers still in their teens--and to help those \n     parents stabilize lives often blighted by drugs or other \n     addictions. But they also confirmed that many of their \n     initiatives are on the chopping block, as states struggle \n     with declining revenue and runaway health care costs for the \n     elderly.\n       ``These are proven programs that work,'' said Montana \n     Attorney General Mike McGrath, ``but our budget crisis is so \n     severe we may not be able to meet the federal matching \n     requirement''--the dollars a state must put up to qualify for \n     a grant from Washington.\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\n       That is why they express such dismay at what they are \n     hearing out of thee Washington budget proceedings. The \n     briefing paper that all the state law enforcement officials \n     were given by the advocacy group Fight Crime: Invest in Kids \n     spelled out some of the cuts included in the Bush budget.\n       Funds for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers \n     after-school program would be cut form $1 billion to $600 \n     million. The memo to the attorneys general says that cutback \n     would take a half-million children each year out of those-\n     centers, even though unsupervised youngsters make the hours \n     form 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. the peak time for serious and violent \n     juvenile crime.\n       The Bush budget increases Head Start funding by $148 \n     million, just about enough to keep pace with inflation, but \n     the program now serves only six out of 10 preschoolers who \n     are eligible. Several other early childhood block grants and \n     programs are ticketed for reduction or elimination.\n       The picture is similar for other Justice Department an \n     Education Department programs aimed at preventing juvenile \n     delinquency.\n       ``This is so shortsighted,'' said Maine Attorney General \n     Steven Rowe. ``For $300 billion, one-fifth the [10-year] cost \n     of the new tax cut, we could fully fund all of these \n     programs'' for the next decade.\n       That kind of investment would not only save lives, the \n     attorneys general said. It would save money. ``We are \n     spending $75,000 a year every time we incarcerate someone \n     under 18,'' said Delaware Attorney General Jane Brady. ``We \n     have to jail them, educate them, counsel them and try to \n     rehabilitate them. It would be so much better to help them \n     while they are young.''\n       It's another example of the long-term costs will incur \n     today's budget decisions.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to quote a couple of paragraphs from the column:\n\n       Under the shadow of war with Iraq, the House and the Senate \n     last week fought a series of skirmishes over the federal \n     budget for next year. One big, overriding question was at \n     stake: Would President Bush and the Republican majorities in \n     Congress step up to the costs of battle, of homeland defense \n     and of national obligations at home, or would they pass the \n     costs on to future generations?\n       The answer, sadly, is that youngsters yet to be born will \n     see their choices limited and their prospects blighted by the \n     decision of today's politicians to press ahead with an \n     unaffordable tax cut even while the costs of war and \n     reconstruction make earlier spending estimates wildly \n     unrealistic.\n       The possible doubling of the national debt in the next \n     decade will drive up interest costs that must be paid every \n     year--billions of dollars that will not be available for \n     Social Security, Medicare or any of the myriad \n     responsibilities of the government here and abroad.\n       But the squeeze is not all prospective. Some dangerous \n     economies are being forced this year--cutbacks that will have \n     long-term damaging consequences for American society.\n\n  He then cites conversations he had with a number of attorneys general \nof the States, pointing out that cutting back on programs for young \npeople will have disastrous consequences.\n  Once again, that is the connection that has to be made to giving \nthese large tax cuts. I listened to my colleague from North Dakota as \nhe talked about the procedure. I put a question to him. It strikes me \nas all a charade, is it not? As I understand it, we are going to pass a \nbudget resolution that is going to have a tax cut figure in it. The \nFinance Committee in the Senate will be told they cannot reach that tax \nfigure. They have to have the lower tax figure, as I understand it. But \nthen when they go to conference to reconcile their tax figure with the \nhigher House tax figure, let's say they settle at the higher tax \nfigure, the House tax figure, the full amount, then they can bring it \nback to the Senate and that is protected under the special \nreconciliation procedures. Is that how it will work?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would say to the Presiding Officer, in response to my \ncolleague, it is truly a perverted result we have here. Aside from the \nsubstance of this budget, which I find appalling, the procedure is even \nworse. The procedure that was designed to provide a fast-track \nprocedure to reduce deficits has now been seized upon to expand \ndeficits. If that isn't standing history on its head, I don't know what \nis.\n  What they have done here is, they couldn't get a vote out of this \nChamber to have a tax cut bigger than $350 billion. So what they did \nis, they went into a secret meeting in a room with the minority locked \nout, and they conjured up a scheme that says both committees are given \nan instruction, the tax committees, to cut taxes under these special \nfast-track procedures by $550 billion and another $725 billion on top \nof that outside of the fast-track procedures.\n  And with respect to those that are given the special protection, the \n$550 billion, the Senate Finance Committee is told, oh, wait a minute, \nthere will be a supermajority point of order if you report anything \nmore than $350 billion. But don't worry about that because when it goes \nto a conference committee between the House and the Senate, you can \ncome back with the bigger number and still enjoy the protections, the \nspecial provisions of reconciliation that take away a Senator's \nfundamental right to debate and amend. That is what is happening here.\n  I say to my colleagues, we will rue the day this procedure is \nadopted. It has never been done before--never. What is going to happen \nhere is going to fundamentally alter the Senate. The Senate was \ndesigned by the Founding Fathers to be different than the House of \nRepresentatives. It was designed to let a determined minority slow \nthings down, to reconsider. But when it comes to reconciliation, forget \nit, because we have become just an extension of the House of \nRepresentatives. It will render the Finance Committee of the Senate \nirrelevant. All the Members of the Finance Committee should be aware of \nthat. They are going to be irrelevant to this discussion because what \nis going to matter is what comes out of a conference with three or four \npeople from both Chambers. They will come back here with whatever they \ndecide. It will be an up-or-down vote, and a simple majority will pass \nit. And the fundamental role of the Senate is altered and diminished, \nand the strength of our Founding Fathers, the constitutional structure \nthey created to protect this Nation, weakened. This is big stuff that \nis about to happen here. This is history-making stuff that is about to \nhappen here. It is a dark day for this Chamber and for this country, in \nthis Senator's view.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. While the Senator is waiting, I would like to show my \ncolleagues what we have faced, what we were told would be the surpluses \nover the next decade. The Congressional Budget Office made their \nestimates 2 years ago, when they gave us a range of outcomes they said \nwe could expect over the next decade. This is what they told us 2 years \nago. They said this gray area were the possible outcomes, from least \nfavorable to most favorable. They adopted as a prediction the midline. \nThat is what told us we were going to have $5.6 trillion of surpluses \nover the next decade.\n  I showed this chart repeatedly back in 2001, when we were considering \nthe tax cuts, and warned my colleagues that we should not count on any \n10-year projection. Some of my colleagues said: You are being way too \nconservative. We won't have the midpoint of this range of possible \noutcomes; we will have much more than that because the tax cuts will \nproduce more revenue.\n  That is the same song we are hearing now. They said: No, we won't \nhave $5.6 trillion in surpluses; it will be much more than that because \nthe tax cuts will kick off additional economic activity and that will \nbring us even more revenue.\n  Well, let's go back to a reality check and see what happened. This \nred line is what has happened. It is below the bottom of the \nprojections that were made just 2 years ago. That is where we really \nare. We are not at the midpoint. We are not at the low point of the \nrange of projections. We are below the bottom. All those who said if \nyou just cut taxes, you get more money, that is dream world stuff. It \ndidn't work. It didn't come close to working. They were wrong. They \nweren't just a little bit wrong, they were totally wrong. The result is \ndeep deficits and debt that will burden this society for decades to \ncome. That is the fact.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to give a little different vantage \npoint\n\n[[Page S5277]]\n\non some of these issues, and then maybe other colleagues will wish to \nspeak.\n  I have heard kind of a continual part of the debate offered by our \ncolleagues in opposition to this resolution that this is a terrible \nbudget resolution. They say it is bad, worse, evil, preposterous, and \nabsurd.\n  Wait a minute. At least we have a budget. Frankly, budgets are not \neasy. How much money are we going to spend, and how much are we going \nto tax? You always have a lot of people who want to spend more, maybe \ntax less, maybe tax more. I have heard a lot of comments that maybe we \nshould be taxing a lot more. In the budget resolution, we assume the \ntax cuts we passed in 2001 would be continued in years 2011, 2012, and \n2013. They would sunset at the end of 2010. I guess my colleague on the \nother side would like to have those tax cuts made tax increases in the \nyears 2011, 2012, and 2013. That is about half of the tax cut that is \nin this bill. We need to do that. We need to address those tax cuts \nsometime between now and 2010. I doubt it is going to happen this year. \nIf it does--I guess a bill could be offered and, if it is, it is \ndebatable. I doubt that will be part of the tax bill that will be \nproposed under the reconciliation procedure.\n  In the President's proposed reconciliation growth package, he would \nlike to have that happen quickly so we can get the economy moving. The \neconomy is not moving very quickly. Some people presupposed that they \nknew exactly what was going to be in the tax bill. We tell the Finance \nCommittee to cut up to $350 billion in the Senate. The House is $550 \nbillion. We go to conference.\n\n  Most people count votes. I count votes around here. I think I know \nwhere the votes are going to be. I know Chairman Grassley pretty well. \nI doubt we will come back from conference with something we cannot pass \nin the Senate. We will make that decision probably 5 weeks from now, \nnot today. I hope we do things to grow the economy. The economy is \ngoing down. It needs help. I will mention to our colleagues that our \ncolleagues had a stimulus or growth package. Theirs was almost all \nspending; 75 percent was spending, with very little tax relief. I guess \ntheir idea of a growth package is to grow government.\n  Our idea is, wait a minute, let's contain the growth of Government \nand have some incentive to grow the economy. Historically, in the tax \narena--I happened to be elected in 1980, so I go back to that point. In \n1980, the Federal Government took in $517 billion, and the maximum \npersonal tax rate per individual was 70 percent. Ronald Reagan was \nelected President, and 8 years later the maximum tax rate was 28 \npercent. If you listen to the dialog we just had, you would think \nrevenues would have fallen. We reduced tax rates from 70 percent to 28 \npercent. That happened over the first several years of the Reagan \nadministration.\n  In 1990, total revenues to the Federal Government almost doubled, \nfrom $517 billion to over a trillion dollars. So we cut tax rates \ndramatically. But guess what. Revenues went up. Then I looked back a \nlittle closer. Well, President Bush increased the rate from 28 percent \nto 31 percent in 1990. When President Clinton was elected in 1992, he \nraised the rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent. I have heard \ndiscussion about all these ``massive'' tax cuts for the wealthy and \nbenefits to the wealthy. So far, the wealthy, the higher income tax \nbrackets, are reduced a great big 1 percentage point, from 39.6 to \n38.6. That is all that happened. Evidently, they say that is the reason \nwe have this enormous deficit, which is absurd.\n  What do we do on the lower income? We took lower income rates that \nwere 15 percent and made those 10 percent and made that retroactive. \nThen we passed a $500 per child tax credit. That is law. Now it is \n$600. So we have done a lot of things for lower income, to make them \nbasically not pay Federal income tax, some of which was retroactive, or \npay a lot lower rate.\n  I keep hearing all this class warfare and that these deficits are \ncaused by the tax cut, and some people don't like tax cuts and they \nwant to have tax increases, I guess, in the outyears. But I don't think \nthat will help the economy. Some of us want to help the economy.\n  I looked back and, historically, we have done some things in this \nbody, with bipartisan support, that helped the economy. We reduced \ncapital gains rates in 1997 over the objection of the Clinton \nadministration. They eventually signed the bill. We reduced the rate \nfrom 28 to 27 percent and it helped create and foment a lot of growth.\n  If you look at total growth in revenues in the last several years, in \n1998, 1999, and 2000, revenues exploded to the Federal Government--I \nthink in part because we cut capital gains rates. So we can cut rates \non occasion and it will help the economy. I am absolutely convinced \nthat it had a great deal of economic stimulus when we cut the rates in \n1997 and revenues exploded to the Federal Government. Unfortunately, in \nthe last couple of years, revenues have declined a lot, mostly because \nthe stock market has declined a lot.\n  So people talk about, wait a minute, we expected $5.6 trillion \nsurpluses over the next 10 years. That was estimated by CBO. They were \nway wrong because the stock market had already started crashing. \nNASDAQ, which was exploding in the late nineties, declined by 50 \npercent between March of 2000 and December of 2000. CBO missed it. They \ndidn't know what that would mean as far as projections. CBO did not \nforecast the terrorist attack on 9/11 and the disastrous impact that \nhad on the economy and what that has caused in outlays.\n  I wanted to make a couple of those points. We need to grow the \neconomy and we have a stimulus package that I believe will pass the \nSenate--and probably a comparable figure will pass the conference. It \nis a little bit more than our colleagues on the Democrat side wanted, \nexcept it is mostly on the tax side, not the spending side.\n  The other criticism is, wait a minute, this budget is so terrible. \nWell, at least it is a budget. It is critically important that we pass \nit. Last year, we didn't even have a budget on the floor of the Senate. \nOne passed through the Budget Committee; my compliments to the chairman \nfor that, but we didn't have a chance to even vote on the floor of the \nSenate. I think people can be pretty critical, but I think we need to \nbe a little more reserved. It is important that we pass a budget.\n  I urge our colleagues to be mindful, if we do not pass a budget, one \nexample would be: One could come up on a bill next week, and the bill \nmight be a small authorization bill. Someone can offer an amendment to \nit and say: Let's spend $1 trillion on a new program, maybe it is \nprescription drugs or some other type of program that sounds really \ngood. Let's spend hundreds of millions of dollars on education. Sounds \ngood. Let's spend hundreds of millions of dollars--we could do all \nthose things, and if we do not pass this budget today, there would be \nno 60-vote point of order. Spending would be running rampant. We would \nbe totally out of control. We would have no caps on appropriated caps \nand no limit on the $2.2 trillion we are spending today, and there is \nno limit on the demand for Federal spending. It could get out of hand \nvery easily. The only limitation we would have would be the potential \nthreat of a Presidential veto.\n  We need to govern better than that, and we need to show some \ndiscipline. If we remember those 51 votes when we passed the budget \nresolution, there were countless amendments, almost all of which on the \nDemocrat side were: Let's grow spending; let's increase spending. \nDeficits are not caused just on the revenue side, they are caused by \nspending more than we take in.\n  I wanted to make those points in response to our friends and \ncolleagues on the other side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we can debate economic theory for a long \ntime. What is not open to debate is what has factually occurred. Let's \ngo back. Two years ago, we were told this was the range of outcomes \nlooking forward in terms of the budget surplus. The Congressional \nBudget Office and the President's Office of Management and Budget said \nthey adopted the midpoint of this range. We are going to have $5.6 \ntrillion of surpluses. Our friends on the other side said: Oh, no, it \nis going to be better than that because we are going to cut taxes; it \nis going to lead to bigger surpluses; it is not going to be the \nmidpoint of the range of possible outcomes, it is going to be even \nbetter than that.\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\n  That was fantasy world stuff. We tried their approach. It failed. It \ndid not even come close, not even hailing distance of what happened. \nHere is what happened. We wound up below the bottom of the range of \nprojected outcomes with deficits and debt as far as the eye can see.\n  What is the answer of the other side? Let's do it again. Let's try it \nagain. Let's dig the hole deeper. Let's run up more deficits, add more \ndebt, and that will strengthen the country. Does anybody honestly \nbelieve that more deficits and more debt are going to strengthen the \ncountry when we are on the eve of the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration that is going to explode the cost to the Federal Government, \nand these folks come forward with tax cuts that explode at the very \nsame time when we are already in record deficit? I tell you, is there \nno common sense left?\n  Here is what our Congressional Budget Office, headed by their \nappointee, straight from the Council of Economic Advisers of the \nPresident of the United States, tells us if we adopt this proposal. He \nhas done seven different models. He used their dynamic scoring, the \nidea that we are going to get more money if we cut the taxes. What did \nhe find? In four of the cases, the deficits are even bigger. In three \nof the seven, the deficits are somewhat smaller, although all of them \nmassive.\n\n  What does he say:\n\n       CBO estimates show lower deficits relative to so-called \n     static scoring only by assuming large tax increases beginning \n     in 2014.\n\n  Hello, is anybody listening? He is saying, all those who said the \nproblem is they are not using dynamic scoring, they are not showing the \npositive effects of the tax cuts, if we just do that, we will see the \ndeficits are not going to be so bad. So we turned it over to their guy, \nstraight from the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and he \ncomes back and says to us: Oh, no, the deficits are not going to be \nsmaller, they are going to be bigger because of the deadweight of \ndeficits and debt. You cannot take on all this borrowing and strengthen \nthe country. You weaken the country.\n  Then he looked at three other possibilities. He ran three other \nmodels. Do you know what he said: Yes, the deficits could be somewhat \nsmaller than would otherwise be the case, but that is on the theory \nthat people are going to work harder over the next decade in \npreparation for the massive tax increases to come.\n  Let me repeat that: The only way the deficits are smaller than so-\ncalled static scoring is if you assume the American people are going to \nwork harder in anticipation of the massive tax increases to come to \ndeal with these deficits that are exploding out of control.\n  If anybody can seriously come out here and justify this proposal and \nthese budgets, come on out, let's debate it. I do not see them. Where \nare they? Come on out here; let's debate. Let's debate what the effect \nof this budget is, $1.3 trillion of tax cuts on top of an initial $1.1 \ntrillion of spending when we are already in record deficit on the eve \nof the retirement of the baby boomers, we are at war, a cost of which \nwe do not know.\n  There is only one possible outcome: More deficits, more debt in a way \nthat is totally unsustainable, and that will lead to massive cuts in \nSocial Security and Medicare and all the rest of Government. That is \nwhat is coming next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the pending budget resolution. I was very much impressed with the \ncomment by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota who really \nquestioned if anybody is listening. I think the answer to that question \nis generally no. The positions in this Chamber are really frozen. We \nare looking at a 50-50 vote to be broken by the Vice President, and, \nrealistically, we are going through the motions of a debate.\n  Then the Senator from North Dakota says: Let's have a debate. We have \nbeen having a debate today. We have debates lots of days, but most of \nthe time we talk right by each other. The proliferation of charts adds \nmore confusion than clarity. I do not know that there are very many \nviewers on C-SPAN2 who even flick on their sets with the monotony of \nthe kind of debates which we have in the Senate, which I would say is a \nblame attached universally on all sides and to all Members.\n  The one factor I think is most important is that we get a budget just \nto get a budget. We have a lot of argument about tax increase, no tax \nincrease, what is the amount of the tax increase. An arrangement has \nbeen worked out really to sort of save face with all parties involved \nhere so we could come to some terms and move on.\n  Last year, we did not have a budget. When the Democrats were in \ncontrol of this Chamber, there was no budget resolution offered on the \nfloor of the Senate, and I do not say that in a partisan way. I think \ntoo often there is debate and there are arguments which are partisan \nDemocrats versus Republicans bickering, much to the dissatisfaction of \nthe American people. But not having a budget resolution was very \ndetrimental to the whole appropriations process where we could not \ncurtail spending and have a discipline. For those who may be listening \non C-SPAN2 or for a few people in the galleries, there are no Senators \non the floor to listen, 60 votes are required to increase spending \nbeyond the budget allocation if there is a budget.\n  Sixty votes are hard to come by, but if only 51 votes, or a majority \nof those present, are required, then spending goes up.\n  I visited Israel earlier this year, and the Palestinian Authority has \na new finance minister. I was delighted to learn that the Palestinian \nAuthority has a budget. I exchanged views with him that the Palestinian \nAuthority had something the Senate did not have. The Senate did not \nhave a budget. It was not reported out last year by the Budget \nCommittee. It is vital we have a budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to correct the record with respect to one \nthing the Senator from Pennsylvania said, I think inadvertently. The \nBudget Committee did report a budget last year. It did not come to the \nfloor, but the Budget Committee did report a budget. The determination \nwas made not to bring it to the floor. That determination was made \nbecause the Senate had a 10-year budget, the House had a 5-year budget. \nThe Senate had used the more conservative OMB estimates. The House had \nused the more liberal OMB estimates.\n  It was very clear there would not be a reconciliation between the \ntwo.\n  I will be happy to yield in a moment.\n  The Senator, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and I \ndetermined that we would bring a 2-year budget to the Senate. We did \nthat. That required 60 votes to pass because it was not a product of \nthe committee. We got 59 votes for that 2-year budget in the Senate; it \nrequired 60 votes.\n  The further facts are that we had all Democrats voting for it, we had \n8 Republicans voting for it, including the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and \nothers, but because we did not have 60 votes, it did not prevail.\n  It should also be known that the Appropriations Committee, on a \nunanimous vote, adopted the spending recommendation contained in the \nbudget resolution passed in the committee. They adopted it on a \nunanimous vote.\n  Because of differences in the House, there was no final conclusion on \nmost of the appropriations bills. They were held over to this year. And \ninterestingly enough, the conclusion was a total that was within $2 \nbillion of what we had proposed from the Budget Committee. So there was \nalmost no difference--on over $700 billion of spending--almost no \ndifference between what we proposed and what was ultimately passed in \nthe early part of this year.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from North Dakota says \nthere was ``almost no difference,'' $2 billion, I respectfully disagree \nwith him that that means ``almost no difference.'' Regrettably, around \nthe Senate Chamber, and the House Chamber, we think $2 billion does not \namount to very much.\n  The question I have for the Senator from North Dakota is in a context \nwhere the 2-year budget was turned down and there had been a 1-year \nbudget prepared by the committee, as articulated by the Senator from \nNorth\n\n[[Page S5279]]\n\nDakota who was the chairman last year and who specifies differences \nbetween the House and the Senate where there were different assumptions \nmade and many differences; that is what a conference is about. If the \nSenate had passed a budget, having failed on a 2-year budget, and had \ngone back and brought to the floor a 1-year budget with differences, \nthat is what a conference is about.\n  Why didn't the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, then-chairman \nof the Budget Committee, proceed to get a budget, take it to the House, \nand have a conference so we could have a budget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I didn't make that determination. That was made in a \nhigher pay grade than mine.\n  The budget we had done in the committee was a 10-year budget, and the \nbudget in the House was a 5-year budget. We had used the more \nconservative CBO assumptions, and they used the Office of Management \nand Budget assumptions. We went to a 2-year budget because we thought \nthat had the best prospects of securing the votes necessary to actually \nhave a budget blueprint in the Chamber. We did get 59 votes. We did get \na unanimous consent agreement from the appropriators to stick to that \nnumber.\n  For other reasons there was disagreement with House appropriators \noutside of the budget with respect to priorities.\n  I say to my colleague, no question, we would be better off to have a \nbudget. That is a fundamental responsibility. It did not happen last \nyear for lots of reasons. I have tried to enumerate some of those.\n  I personally am committed to the budget process. I think it is \ncritically important. I agree with the Senator with respect to that \nobservation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my followup question is, Would the \nSenator from North Dakota identify who made the decision? The \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota is on the floor now. Was the \ndecision made by Senator Daschle, the majority leader?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The decision, it is fair to say, was a collective \ndecision and probably was the wisest course given the circumstances we \nfaced at the time.\n  We could ask the 41 who voted against the 2-year budget: Why did they \nfail to vote for what was a bipartisan budget proposal right here on \nthe floor of the Senate that would have provided the budget blueprint? \nThey had the chance; 59 Members voted for it, for a budget outline; 41 \ndid not. The question ought to be directed to the 41 who voted no.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may proceed to question one step further. I think \nthe Senator from North Dakota talked about apples and oranges. This \nbody does not have to go to a 2-year budget, if it does not choose to, \nto produce the 60 votes when the customary practice is a 1-year budget.\n  I don't recollect with precision, but my instinct is that I supported \nthe 2-year budget. I have supported votes to try to get this to \nconference to be resolved.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota says probably it was a wise \ndecision, there is a lot of disagreement about that. I believe it is \nthe duty of the majority party to bring a budget to the floor. I admire \nan effort to bring the 2-year budget. I think we ought to have a 2-year \nbudget so we can spend more time on oversight, a subject sorely \nneglected. If that does not succeed, it does not take 59 votes to bring \na 1-year budget to the floor. That is the duty of the party that \ncontrols the Senate.\n  When you talk about a majority of the appropriators agreeing to stick \nto the budget, or unanimous among the appropriators, that does not mean \na whole lot because that does not bind the Senate to the figure.\n  I note the presence of the distinguished Senator from South Dakota on \nthe floor. Might I inquire if the Senator from South Dakota would care \nto respond as to why we did not have a budget?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Dakota has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from North Dakota reclaims my time, and I say \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Pennsylvania voted \nno. We had a 2-year budget. The Senator said he supported a 2-year \nbudget; he voted no. The Senator had a chance last year to vote for a \n2-year budget. He voted no; 59 Senators voted for it. We had an \nopportunity.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will not yield until I finish. The Senator had an \nopportunity. Every Senator had an opportunity. And it is not the \ntypical order to have a 1-year budget in the Senate. We deal with 5-\nyear or 10-year budgets, not 1-year budgets.\n  Last year, in an attempt to achieve a budget on a bipartisan basis, \nwe brought a 2-year budget to the floor. It was rejected; 59 Senators \nvoted aye. It was a bipartisan vote; 41 voted no. They had their chance \nto have a budget, and they decided not to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has sought recognition \nand is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate this colloquy.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota did everything within his \npower to reach the bipartisan consensus required to achieve a budget \nlast year. I give him great credit for the efforts he made, in so many \nways, to reach across the aisle, to find that bipartisan consensus \nthroughout the year.\n\n  Unfortunately, we had very little response or help.\n  When we came to the conclusion, finally, that perhaps the best thing \nto do would be to move a 2-year budget resolution, as he correctly \nnoted, we did get a bipartisan consensus on that but not enough to \nreach the 60 votes. Unfortunately, had the Senator from Pennsylvania \nchosen to support that resolution, we would have had the necessary 60 \nvotes and hopefully worked out the remaining differences with our House \ncolleagues in spite of the chasm that existed between their proposal \nand ours.\n  I appreciate very much the clarification made by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I again thank him for his efforts and the contribution he \nhas made to this debate.\n  I also thank him for his earlier presentation to the Senate. My only \nregret is that more people could not have had the opportunity to see \nit. I think it is very instructive. I am inclined, almost, to go \nthrough the charts once again just because they are so good and they \nhave such a compelling message, but I will leave that to our \ndistinguished manager on budget matters. I appreciate very much the \npresentation he has made.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor with sadness and with great regret \nat the position the Senate finds itself in today. I don't know that we \nhave a clear indication whether the votes are there for this \nresolution. I hope we do not. But I assume our Republican friends would \nnot come to the floor if they didn't have the votes.\n  I am troubled by this resolution for a number of reasons. First, I am \ntroubled by the obsession with tax cuts that appears to be so much a \npart of the motivation behind the construction of this resolution, an \nobsession with tax cuts that led the majority leader of the House a \ncouple of days ago--I guess it was last week--to say:\n\n       In the face of war, nothing is more important than cutting \n     taxes.\n\n  I have thought about that quote on so many occasions:\n\n       In the face of war, nothing is more important than cutting \n     taxes.\n\n  I assume by that he meant nothing in terms of the commitment we make \nto our military, nothing in terms of the commitment we make to homeland \nsecurity, nothing in terms of the commitment we make to education, to \nthe needs of people at every level.\n  So it is troubling to me, first, that this obsession with tax cuts \narticulated so succinctly by the House majority leader could be so much \na part of this resolution. This obsession with tax cuts, as noted by \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota, will cause us to \nexperience deficits and accumulated debt unprecedented in this country. \nWe are told, as a result of this resolution, we will see unified \ndeficits exceeding $300 billion. We anticipate under this resolution \nthere will be a $1.95 trillion increase in the accumulated debt for the \nperiod 2002 through 2011.\n\n  We began, 2 years ago in the 107th Congress, with a projected surplus \nof $5.6 trillion. We will now experience accumulated deficits of $1.95 \ntrillion, leading us to a $7.6 trillion swing in our\n\n[[Page S5280]]\n\nfiscal circumstances in just 24 months. That, too, is unprecedented.\n  As the distinguished Senator from North Dakota noted, the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, close to 40 percent of that swing is \nattributed to the tax cuts previously enacted or incorporated within \nthis resolution. I don't know the degree to which we can calculate a \ndirect connection between higher interest rates and the demise in our \neconomy as a result of the fiscal problems we are likely to face if we \nadopt this resolution. But the deficits and the debt anticipated and \nactually outlined in this resolution present unprecedented and \nextraordinarily complex--in some ways, unimaginable--fiscal challenges \nas we look to the future over the next decade or so.\n  I suppose some would argue that the tax cuts of this magnitude could \ngenerate an economic recovery that could bring about an improvement in \nboth the deficit and debt projections and the economy. We will hear \nthat argument, I am sure, throughout the day.\n  But in a letter that addressed the President's economic stimulus \npackage, 450 economists have said this package will not generate \neconomic activity and will probably cause a loss of jobs. The CBO has \nactually reported that it is possible we could see a net decline in \neconomic growth of just under 1 percent if the President's economic \nproposal, as it has been presented, goes into law.\n  There is no economic stimulus involved here. The CBO says it. Most of \nthe major mainstream economists say it. Therefore, we can't be \nmotivated by any expectation that economic stimulus somehow drives the \nneed for these tax cuts.\n  On Wednesday, in the New York Times, there was an article coauthored \nby five public servants who, between them, helped pull our country out \nof four severe recessions in the last 30 years: former Secretary Robert \nRubin, former Commerce Secretary Peter Peterson, former Senators Warren \nRudman and Bob Kerrey, and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul \nVolcker. This is what they had to say about the economic stimulus and \nthe tax cuts incorporated in this particular resolution:\n\n       Given the rapidly deteriorating long-term fiscal outlook, \n     neither proposal is fiscally responsible. It is illogical to \n     begin the journey back towards balanced budgets by enacting a \n     tax cut that will only make the long-term outlook worse. \n     Furthermore, the proposed tax cuts are not useful for short \n     term fiscal stimulus, since only a small portion would take \n     effect this year. Nor would they spur long-term economic \n     growth. In fact, tax cuts financed by perpetual deficits will \n     eventually slow the economy. . . .\n       They lower future economic growth by reducing the level of \n     national savings that can be devoted to productive \n     investments. They raise interest rates higher than they would \n     be otherwise. They raise interest payments on the national \n     debt. They reduce the fiscal flexibility to deal with \n     unexpected developments. If we forget these economic \n     consequences, we risk creating an insupportable tax burden \n     for the next generation.\n\n  You can't be any more unequivocal, any more clear than that. Our \nbest, most experienced minds in the country urge us, advise us, plead \nwith us: Do not make this choice. Five percent of the tax cuts \nincorporated in the reconciliation package that we anticipate will be \nbefore us in a few weeks--5 percent of the total tax cuts assumed in \nthis resolution will be realized this year: $61 billion, less than 1 \nhalf of 1 percent of our GDP.\n  Yet what do the economists tell us? The economists tell us: First, if \nyou are going to have an economic stimulus package, do it now. Make it \nimmediate. Make it broad based. Make sure it is fiscally responsible.\n\n  On those three counts, the tax cut legislation anticipated within \nthis resolution all fail. So that leaves me with a third concern. The \nthird concern is what it does to our national investment.\n  This resolution assumes a $168 billion cut in domestic investments \nover the course of the next 10 years. That means there will be cuts in \nhomeland security, cuts in education, cuts in law enforcement, cuts in \nhealth care for veterans, cuts in infrastructure--cuts in all of those \nspecific needs that make this country stronger.\n  I am troubled by that. I am troubled by the realization that, in \npart, I believe supporters of this resolution wish to reduce the flow \nof Federal funds to these investments for ideological rather than \neconomic or fiscal purposes.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a very difficult day for our country, a \nday when we will commit to deficits unlike we have ever seen before, a \nday when, as a result of those deficits, we are likely to see economic \ncircumstances get worse, not better, a day when, by the admission of \nthose who support this resolution, we can anticipate dramatic cuts in \nthe investments in those areas for which there is great need.\n  We have talked at length on the floor over the course of the last \nseveral months about homeland security and how badly our first \nresponders need help and the importance of addressing the needs of the \nStates as they confront their own immense fiscal challenges.\n  We have talked about the need for providing additional funding for \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, how critical it is that we find a way to \nbridge the shortfall between the expectations and the unfunded mandates \nincorporated within that bill, and the reality that funding for these \nprograms does not just materialize unless we appropriate it.\n  Serious problems with regard to law enforcement: As crime goes up, \nour investments in law enforcement, under this resolution, go down.\n  Problems in Medicaid for the States: The shortfall has never been \ngreater. And the health concerns that nursing homes and hospitals are \nexperiencing, all through rural America in particular, are commensurate \nwith the shortfall that we find in this resolution.\n  So we can do better. While there are those who continue to talk about \nthe budgets of last year, I think our focus now must be on the budget \nbefore us. And I think the first test legislation must pass before we \nsupport it ought to be: Do no harm. There is a lot of harm done in this \nresolution, and that is regrettable.\n  I hope our colleagues will think very carefully prior to the time \nthey cast their vote. I will be casting a vote in opposition to the \nresolution. I urge my colleagues to join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there has now been an opportunity to \nobtain the vote referenced by the Senator from North Dakota, and it was \nnot a resolution for a 2-year budget at all. It was an amendment made \nby Senator Feingold which would set caps for 2 years. But that is not a \n2-year budget resolution.\n  The idea of a 2-year budget resolution has been discussed widely in \nthis body for many years and has been advocated by the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, who chaired the Budget Committee \nfor many years. It is a proposal that I have long supported.\n  I, frankly, did not remember any resolution for a 2-year budget \ncoming to the floor when it was mentioned by the Senator from North \nDakota. But if it had come to the floor, if there had been a resolution \nfor 2 years, I would have supported it because of my longstanding sense \nthat the Congress does an inadequate job of oversight, finding out what \nis happening in the executive branch, because we spend so much time on \nthe budget and then on the appropriations process.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education, it occupies months of time. So if it can be done in 2 \nyears, then it would be a big savings.\n  But I recall very well when the Feingold amendment was offered. And \nthere was a major effort by appropriators, significantly, to adopt it, \nwhich would set a cap. I refused to back that because I thought it was \ninappropriate to have a way out for the Budget Committee, which had not \nestablished a budget.\n  The budget law was passed in 1974, and for 27 years, this body has \nhad a budget--until last year. And if the Budget Committee could avoid \nor evade its responsibility in coming up with a budget, and then have a \nsimple cure by having an amendment offered which would set a cap, what \nmotivation would there be for a budget?\n  To set a cap is not to have a budget resolution. A cap simply means \nwhat the total expenditure will be. It does not mean what the budget \nwill allocate for various categories of expenditures.\n  We spend a protracted period of time in establishing a budget, and we \nhave\n\n[[Page S5281]]\n\nmany votes. In the last, during what we called a vote-a-rama, we voted \ndozens of times on specific amendments. So you do not have a budget \nresolution when you establish a cap.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Record Vote Analysis be printed in \nthe Record--this is compiled by the staff of the Republican Policy \nCommittee--and that a similar document be printed in the Record, \nprovided to me by the Senator from North Dakota, which repeats that the \nFeingold amendment establishes discretionary spending caps for fiscal \nyear 2003 and fiscal year 2004, which is the same 2-year period.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the 107th Congress, 2d Session, June 20, 2002]\n\n               Senate Record Vote Analysis--Vote No. 159\n\n\n       Defense Authorization/Budget Enforcement, Higher Spending\n\n       Subject: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2003 . . . S. 2514. Feingold motion to waive the Budget Act \n     for the consideration of the Feingold amendment No. 3915, as \n     amendment.\n       Action: Motion Rejected, 59-40.\n       Synopsis: As reported, S. 2514, the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for fiscal year (FY) 2003, will authorize a \n     total of $393.278 billion in new budget authority for \n     national defense programs (last year's bill provided $343.284 \n     billion). The Administration requested $396,396 billion, \n     including $3.5 billion pay for a shift to accrual accounting \n     for civilian employee health and retirement benefits; this \n     bill will not make that shift. The bill was reported on \n     largely party lines due to a cut in the Administration's \n     request for funding for missile defense programs. Democrats \n     favored the cuts and Republicans opposed them.\n       The Feingold amendment, as amended, would modify and extend \n     various budget enforcement mechanisms. It would extend the \n     statutory discretionary spending cap points of order through \n     2007, but would set caps for only the next 2 years. It would \n     cap discretionary spending budget authority for FY 2003 at \n     $768.1 billion and for FY 2005 at $784.4 billion (the cap for \n     FY 2002 was $710 billion); for FY 2003, separate spending \n     caps (a firewall) would apply to defense and non-defense \n     spending. The ``pay-go'' point of order on revenues and \n     mandatory spending would be extended through 2007 (the pay-go \n     point of order requires any decrease in revenue or increase \n     in mandatory spending to be offset with either a \n     corresponding increase in revenue or decrease in mandatory \n     spending; it takes a three-fifths majority (60) vote to waive \n     this point of order). The pay-go point of order would expire \n     at the end of the year following a year in which an on-budget \n     surplus was reported. $25.4 billion in advance appropriations \n     would be permitted in FY 2003. The current bar on delayed \n     obligations would not be extended.\n       Senator Gramm raised a point of order that the Feingold \n     amendment violated section 306 of the Budget Act. Senator \n     Feingold then moved to waive the Budget Act for the \n     consideration of the amendment. Generally, those favoring the \n     motion to waive favored the amendment; those opposing the \n     motion to waive opposed the amendment.\n       Note. A three-fifths majority (60) vote is required to \n     waive the Budget Act. After the failure of the motion to \n     waive, the point of order was upheld and the amendment thus \n     fell.\n       Those favoring the motion to waive contended:\n\n                               Argument 1\n\n       This amendment would extend expiring budgetary restraints. \n     Those restraints, which apply to both mandatory and \n     discretionary spending, are urgently needed. Most of the \n     provisions of this amendment are non-controversial. However, \n     some Senators have objected to a few of its provisions. The \n     main objection they have raised is that the amendment would \n     supposedly allow too much discretionary spending. They have \n     suggested that if we had adopted a budget resolution as a \n     free-standing measure we could have avoided this supposed \n     problem. In response, we concede that a budget resolution has \n     not been adopted by the full Senate this year, but the Budget \n     Committee did pass such a resolution. It set spending at a \n     level that was just $9 billion higher than the President \n     requested. Both the Budget Committee's resolution and the \n     President's proposed budget increased discretionary spending \n     significantly over last year's level of $710 billion in order \n     to increase defense spending by $45 billion and homeland \n     defense by $4.5 billion. When one takes those numbers out, \n     one finds that the spending cap proposed in the Budget \n     Committee will increase non-defense spending by less than 1 \n     percent this year. Further, we think that in many respects it \n     is just a more honest version of the President's budget, \n     because the largest differences are that it will not assume \n     spending cuts in particular areas requested by the President \n     because everyone knows Congress is going to fund those areas. \n     Overall, non-defense discretionary spending will rise less \n     than 1 percent under the Committee's budget. This amendment \n     would take the discretionary limits in the Committee's budget \n     for 2 years. We believe that those limits are very frugal. \n     Our colleagues' only other substantive objections to this \n     amendment are that it would allow an increase in advance \n     funding and would not retain current restrictions on delayed \n     obligations. Neither of those objections give sufficient \n     reason to vote against this amendment. The proposed increase \n     for advance appropriations is marginal, and the delayed \n     obligation restrictions would not be renewed by this \n     amendment solely because they are so complex they are never \n     applied. The final argument against this amendment is that it \n     should not be offered to the defense authorization bill. We \n     disagree. This bill sets a limit on the amount that can be \n     appropriated for defense; the defense appropriations bill is \n     the largest spending bill considered each year. Considering \n     an amendment regarding total Federal spending on this \n     authorization bill therefore makes sense. The point of order \n     that has been raised is that this amendment is not germane. \n     This point of order should be waived.\n\n                               Argument 2\n\n       Congress has been spending discretionary funds like drunken \n     sailors the last few years, but the fact remains that the \n     biggest threat to our Nation's long-term solvency is \n     entitlement, not discretionary, spending. Yes, this amendment \n     would allow $9 billion more in discretionary funds to be \n     spent than the President requested, but we are more than \n     willing to accept that increase in our $2 trillion budget if \n     it means we are able to retain the pay-go point of order. If \n     we do not retain that point of order, we will soon be faced \n     with massive increases in entitlement spending, primarily on \n     health care, that will need only simple majority votes to \n     pass. Further, we note that once we put back in place that \n     binding point of order, the President would still have his \n     veto power to strike down any bill that he thought spent too \n     much. We urge colleagues to be realistic. If we do not \n     reinstate the pay-go rule, we will net end up $9 billion \n     deeper in debt, but hundreds of billions of dollars deeper in \n     debt. The trade-off is very acceptable.\n       Those opposing the motion to waive contended:\n       The Democrats, who are in the majority, have utterly failed \n     in their responsibility to bring up and pass a budget \n     resolution this year. Because of that failure, budget \n     enforcement mechanisms that are expiring will not be renewed. \n     When we consider spending bills in the coming weeks, we will \n     be doing so without any budget blueprint to restrain spending \n     and without rules to keep spending in check. Given this \n     dismal situation, many Members may be tempted to vote for the \n     Feingold amendment under the principle that some restraints \n     will be better than nothing. However, it would be a mistake \n     if they were to do so. This amendment would reinstate \n     spending restraints only after substantially increasing the \n     amount of money that could be spent. First, for next year, it \n     would increase spending by $9 billion more than the President \n     requested. Second, it would increase to $25 billion--a new \n     record level--the amount of ``advance appropriations'' that \n     could be passed. A third problem is that it would not renew a \n     ban on a particular type of budget gimmick--deferred \n     obligations--that was passed in the 106th Congress.\n       All of these matters could have been resolved if they had \n     been dealt with appropriately on a budget resolution. We \n     could have offered amendments and had debate on a wide \n     variety of ideas instead of debating little bits and pieces \n     on unrelated bills. Our Democratic colleagues have created a \n     terrible mess, but they are still trying to push through \n     budget enforcement procedures that would allow them to spend \n     more money. We are not going to go along with these efforts. \n     We encourage them to bring a budget to the floor; it is not \n     too late. All Senators would have their rights to debate and \n     offer amendments protected, and the resolution would be \n     considered under the normal procedures that would ensure it \n     would pass (or be rejected) by a time certain. If they were \n     to follow that course, a bipartisan result would be likely. \n     If they continue with this path, though, they are not going \n     to get anywhere. The President has made clear that, unlike \n     last year, he is not going to accept any increases in \n     spending over his request. Spending has been going through \n     the roof; it is time to draw a line against further \n     increases. Therefore, we oppose the motion to waive the \n     Budget Act for the consideration of this amendment.\n\n                                YEAS (59)\n \n             Democrats (51 or 100%)\n                                                  Republicans (8 or 17%)\n \n \nAkaka                    Inouye                   Chafee, L.\nBaucus                   Jeffords \\1\\             Collins\nBayh                     Johnson                  Domenici\nBiden                    Kennedy                  Gregg\nBingaman                 Kerry                    McCain\nBoxer                    Kohl                     Shelby\nBreaux                   Landrieu                 Snowe\nByrd                     Leahy                    Stevens\nCantwell                 Levin\nCarnahan                 Lieberman\nCarper                   Lincoln\nCleland                  Mikulski\nClinton                  Miller\nConrad                   Murray\nCorzine                  Nelson (FL)\nDaschle                  Nelson (NE)\nDayton                   Reed\nDodd                     Reid\nDorgan                   Rockefeller\nDurbin                   Sarbanes\n\n[[Page S5282]]\n\n \nEdwards                  Schumer\nFeingold                 Stabenow\nFeinstein                Torricelli\nGraham                   Wellstone\nHarkin                   Wyden\nHollings\n \n\n\n                                NAYS (40)\n \n                                     Republicans (40 or 83%)\n  Democrats (0 or 0%)\n \n \n                         Allard                   Hutchinson\n                         Allen                    Hutchison\n                         Bennett                  Inhofe\n                         Bond                     Kyl\n                         Brownback                Lott\n                         Bunning                  Lugar\n                         Burns                    McConnell\n                         Campbell                 Murkowski\n                         Cochran                  Nickles\n                         Craig                    Roberts\n                         Crapo                    Santorum\n                         DeWine                   Sessions\n                         Ensign                   Smith (NH)\n                         Enzi                     Smith (OR)\n                         Fitzgerald               Specter\n                         Frist                    Thomas\n                         Gramm                    Thompson\n                         Grassley                 Thurmond\n                         Hagel                    Voinovich\n                         Hatch                    Warner\n \n\n\n                             NOT VOTING (1)\n \n          Democrats (0)              Republicans (1)\n \n                                   Helms \\2\\\n \n\\1\\ Official Business.\n\\2\\ Necessarily Absent.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. And I conclude, Mr. President, by asking the Senator \nfrom North Dakota if establishing caps for 2 years amounts to a budget \nresolution for 2 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suppose reasonable people could differ \non what constitutes a budget for 2 years. The amendment that was \noffered last year was an attempt to adopt the budget that had been \nformed in the Budget Committee.\n  And what that amendment provided--and I have it before me now and the \nSenator is correct--was caps on spending.\n  It provided, for fiscal 2003, an overall amount for discretionary \nspending of $764,722,000,000. For the highway category, it provided \n$28.9 billion in outlays. For the mass transit category, it provided \n$1.445 billion. For the conservation spending category, it provided \n$1.922 billion.\n  It provided the framework--perhaps that is the best way to say it--of \nthe budget that we had constructed in the committee. It was an attempt \nto give the appropriators the budget framework to go forward so they \ncould do their work.\n  That is what the attempt was. I think it is fair to say it was not a \nfull budget resolution. I would say that to my colleague. A full budget \nresolution is not a 2-year document. What the Budget Committee does \nwith the full budget resolution is either a 5-year or a 10-year \nallocation of resources, both for taxing and spending. But it became \nevident we did not have the votes for that.\n  So what we tried to do was put in place this framework of a budget \nfor 2 years, with caps set for 2 years, with the categories specified \nfor the 2 years; but, more than that, to also provide an extension of \npay-as-you-go provisions to include the budget enforcement mechanisms \nthat were otherwise going to lapse and to provide the other elements \nthat were important for the consideration of the individual decisions \nthat the appropriators have to make.\n  I note my colleague from Massachusetts is here. He has asked for \ntime. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Very briefly, Mr. President, I frankly expected more \nfrom the Senator from North Dakota. When he says, and I read his words, \nadopt a budget formulated in the Budget Committee, there was nothing in \nthe Feingold amendment about a budget formulated in the Budget \nCommittee. When the Senator from North Dakota recites a long list of \ncategories and then says they provide a framework, there were no \ncategories in the Feingold amendment. There was no framework there. \nWhen the Senator from North Dakota says it was not a full budget \nresolution, he really ought to say there was no budget resolution at \nall because that is the fact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I tried to be as frank and forthcoming as \nI could be. When the Senator says there were no categorizations, there \nwere. I would be happy to enter it into the Record. It is not true to \nsay there were not. There were.\n  You had the discretionary spending amount and the other elements that \nI described for the highway category, for the discretionary category. I \ndon't know what the Senator is looking at.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me finish the thought and then I will be happy to \nyield.\n  Maybe we are looking at different things, but I offered an amendment \nto the Feingold amendment providing for these categories, providing for \nthe discretionary amount, providing for these other categories. That \nappears in the Record as an amendment numbered 3916 to amendment No. \n3915.\n  That is what I am discussing here.\n  I do yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts. I am sorry. \nWould the Senator from Massachusetts withhold. The Senator from \nPennsylvania wanted to ask a question. I am happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I discussed this informally with the Senator from North \nDakota, and he handed me a vote, which I read from, which was the \nFeingold amendment which established caps for 2 years. The Conrad \namendment had nothing to do with what the Senator from North Dakota \nhanded me. But these will be in the Record, and people who read the \nRecord can come to a conclusion themselves. I think there is absolutely \nno doubt not only that this is not a full budget resolution but that it \nis no budget resolution at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, perhaps it does no good to prolong this. \nBut this was the chance we had to put in place the spending limits for \nlast year and this. It was our chance to establish what a budget \nresolution does. A budget resolution outlines what are the resources \navailable, and it was our best chance to put in place that structure, \nto have the Appropriations Committee know what was available to them. \nThat vote was held.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting minority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have yielded to the Senator from Massachusetts for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from Pennsylvania sought \nrecognition?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from North Dakota said \nthe amendment put in limits, he is correct. The Feingold amendment did \nseem to put in limits. When he says that is what a budget resolution \ndoes, he is correct also. A budget resolution does put in limits. But a \nbudget resolution does much, much more. A budget resolution specifies \ncategories. It is an elaborate document that specifies categories of \nexpenditures, and that was not in the Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator is correct on that. I have no \ninterest in saying it is something it was not. The Senator is correct \non that. But I would say to the Senator, this was our best chance to \nput in place a budget framework to give the Appropriations Committee an \nindication of what was available to them to spend and not to spend more \nthan that and to put in place the pay-as-you-go restrictions and to put \nin place the other budget enforcement mechanisms so that the \nfunctioning of the Congress could go forward.\n  I understand the Senator, for whatever reason, decided to oppose \nthat. I just say to him, that was our best chance of putting in place \nthe framework for a budget. It didn't happen. All of us can take \nresponsibility. I will take my share of responsibility. I regret very \nmuch that the budget that I took out of the committee didn't come\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\nto the floor and we didn't have a chance to conclude action on it. I \nwas pleased that we were able to get bipartisan agreement, at least \nwith respect to that budget framework. I wish it would have passed. I \nthink that would have been a good thing. But it did not.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the budget that passed the Senate 2 weeks \nago was not a good one. The budget which returned from conference today \nis much, much worse. It provides for far larger tax cuts--totaling more \nthan a trillion dollars. It provides less resources to meet our urgent \ndomestic needs in education, in health care, and in homeland security. \nIt relies on an unprecedented parliamentary gimmick in a desperate \nattempt to force a bigger tax cut through a reluctant Senate. The \nRepublican leaders who controlled this conference had a single goal--\nmore and deeper tax cuts primarily benefitting the wealthiest \ntaxpayers. This budget clearly shows that they are willing to sacrifice \nthe well being of the American people and make a mockery of the budget \nprocess to achieve their goal. We should have the courage to reject it, \nand enact a responsible budget in its stead.\n  The conference report nullifies nearly all of the improvements which \nwere made to the budget on the Senate floor. A majority of Senators \nreduced the size of the overall tax cut. The Republicans in conference \nraised it back up by $400 billion, from $857 billion to $1.23 trillion. \nA majority of Senators reduced the amount of tax cuts which could be \nfast-tracked under the reconciliation process to $350 billion. The \nRepublicans in Congress are attempting to substantially increase that \nnumber through a parliamentary gimmick. On the floor, a majority of \nSenators voted repeatedly to provide additional resources for our top \ndomestic priorities. The Republicans in conference eliminated most of \nthose gains, reducing domestic spending this year by $7 billion. Less \nfor education. Less for health care. Less for homeland security. A \nmajority of Senators should now defeat this irresponsible conference \nreport.\n  The manner in which the conference report deals with the size of the \ntax cut is particularly disturbing. It has been designed to maximize \nthe amount of new tax breaks which can be fast-tracked through the \nSenate. The $350 billion limit on the amount the Finance Committee can \nreport out under reconciliation is a sham. Under this budget \nresolution, when the tax bill returns from conference, it can provide \nfor up to $550 billion in new tax breaks and still be protected by \nreconciliation. That is outrageous. Only 2 weeks ago, a bipartisan \nmajority of Senators said $350 billion would be the limit. It was all \nthe Nation could afford. In just 2 weeks, the number has grown by $200 \nbillion. Why? Because the Republican leadership is desperately trying \nto save the President's ill-advised elimination of the tax on dividend \nincome. That is not a tax cut to help working families and stimulate \nthe economy. That is a tax boondoggle for the wealthy few. Half of all \nthe tax benefits from the elimination or reduction of the dividend tax \nwould go to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers, and 80 percent of the \nbenefits would go to the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers. It is \nunaffordable. It is grossly unfair. No one can claim with a straight \nface that this is a moderate budget.\n  The impact on education is devastating. The Republican conferees cut \n$20 billion in education and training resources over the decade from \nthe Senate passed budget. They stripped the Murray amendment which \nwould have increased funding to make real the promise of No Child Left \nBehind. They stripped the Kennedy-Dodd-Collins amendment which would \nhave increased the Pell grants of 4.8 million students struggling to \npay higher tuition costs. To my constituents in Massachusetts this will \nmean a loss of $24 million in Pell aid. The Republican leaders who \ndictated this conference report ignored the education concerns of a \nbipartisan majority of Senators. And that same bipartisan majority \nshould now reject this shameful budget.\n  The budget resolution before us actually reduces funding for the No \nChild Left Behind Act school reform and cuts over half a million \nchildren from after school programs. How can President Bush abandon his \nunequivocal promise of full funding for the school reforms required by \nthe No Child Left Behind Act? That legislation was signed into law with \ngreat fanfare by the President just a year ago. But when the klieg \nlights go out and the bunting comes down and the cameras leave, the \nmoney isn't there. The Republican budget provides $8.9 billion less \nthan we promised America's children. Six million children are being \nleft behind.\n  On the floor of the Senate, we added an additional $40 billion to \nhelp the uninsured obtain health coverage. This was an expenditure \nwhich even the White House supported. But not the Republican conferees. \nThey deleted it so there would be $40 billion more to finance their \nreckless tax cut scheme. Helping families get health care is obviously \nnot a priority for them.\n  This budget has far less funding than is necessary to provide a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit for all seniors. It follows the \nadministration's grossly unfair plan requiring the elderly to give up \ntheir family doctors and go into HMOs in order to obtain any real \nassistance with the cost of their drugs. Yet Republicans defeated \namendments to increase the amount of money available for the \nprescription benefit and to make the benefit available to all seniors, \nnot just those in HMOs. As a result, many seniors will continue to go \nwithout the medication they need every day to stay well.\n\n  The budget also contains the administration's plan to convert much of \nMedicaid into a block grant, reducing the long-term funding which is \navailable to provide health care for the needy. The Republican block \ngrant program would leave many innocent victims in its wake--sick and \nneedy children and their parents, the disabled, and low-income workers \nand elderly. States are, in fact, being given a financial incentive to \ncut back coverage for those in need.\n  The administration plan would even abolish the highly successful CHIP \nprogram, which is providing five million children with a healthy start \nin life. CHIP would be rolled into the block grant, with no guarantee \nthat all of these children would continue to receive health care \ncoverage.\n  Budgets are the way a nation sets its priorities, and the priorities \nin this Republican budget are profoundly wrong for America. It fails to \naddress the real problems of real families. It appears to have been \ndrafted in a sound-proofed room so that the voices of working men and \nwomen, students and senior citizens could not be heard.\n  In the 2 years since President Bush took office, the well-being of \nAmerican families has declined at an alarming rate. Ask most Americans \nhow their lives have changed since President Bush took office, and they \nwill tell you: declining job security; disappearing retirement savings; \nplummeting school budgets; rising college tuition; skyrocketing health \ncare and prescription drug costs; Federal budget deficits threatening \nthe future of Social Security and Medicare.\n  With the economy stagnating and continuing threats from terrorists, \nthese are not normal times. Our responsibility in Congress is to pass a \nbudget that meets the challenges of our time. Instead of more tax \nbreaks for the wealthy, we should be concentrating on our national \nsecurity and our economic security.\n  Surely, when our troops come home from Iraq, we want them to come \nhome to a strong economy, with jobs that let them care for their \nfamilies and save for a secure retirement. We want them to come home to \nbetter schools for their children, not schools facing drastic budget \ncuts, fewer teachers, and crowded classrooms. We want them to be able \nto afford health insurance, and know that their families will receive \nthe quality health care they need.\n  This budget fails all these tests. It rejects the steps needed to \nrestore the economy, and instead embraces ideologically rigid policies \nthat have not worked and will not work. In 2001, President Bush pushed \na $1.3 trillion tax cut through Congress that disproportionately \nbenefits the wealthiest taxpayers. Now, at his urging, this Republican \nbudget calls for an additional $1.3 trillion in tax cuts, even more \nheavily slanted toward the rich. That\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\nis not the solution to the problems facing America's families. That is \na strategy that will only add to their problems.\n  Huge numbers of working men and women have lost their job security. \nAs layoffs mount, they live in fear of being the next to be let go. \nThere are 2\\1/2\\ million fewer private sector jobs in America today \nthan there were just 2 years ago. Those looking for a job are finding \nit increasingly difficult to obtain one. The number of long-term \nunemployed workers has increased by nearly 200 percent since President \nBush took office.\n  Health insurance is becoming less and less affordable for millions of \nworkers and their families. Over two million more Americans are without \nhealth insurance today than there were 2 years ago. One in ten small \nbusinesses which offered their employees health insurance in 2000 no \nlonger do. The average cost of health insurance is rising at double \ndigit rates--up by 11 percent in 2001 and another 12.7 percent in \n2002--nearly four times the rate of inflation. The health care squeeze \non working families is getting tighter and tighter.\n  The cost of higher education is rising beyond the reach of more and \nmore families. The gap between the cost of college tuition and the \ntuition assistance provided by the Federal Government has grown by \n$1,900 in the first 2 years of the Bush administration. As a result, \nthe number of worthy students being denied the chance to go to college \nis growing each year.\n  For millions of families, their retirement savings have seriously \neroded in the last 2 years. The value of savings in 401(k) plans and \nother defined contribution plans has declined by $473 billion in the \nlast 2 years. Many middle-aged workers who thought their retirements \nwere secure are suddenly being forced to consider staying in the \nworkforce longer and reducing their standard of living in retirement.\n  These are the realities American families face today. It is no \nsurprise that consumer confidence has dropped more than fifty percent \nsince President Bush took office.\n  To all these problems, the Bush administration has one answer--more \nand more tax cuts predominately benefitting the wealthiest taxpayers.\n  In this current situation, the most irresponsible action Congress \ncould take would be to accept the proposal of the Bush administration \nto enact major new permanent tax cuts. Yet, that is what this budget \nresolution does. The combined cost of the President's plan to exempt \ndividend income from taxation, accelerate the tax cuts for the upper \nincome brackets, and make the 2001 tax cuts permanent would be over \n$1.3 trillion in the next 10 years. The conference report provides full \nfunding for this plan. It will lead to an immense increase in the \ndeficit which would trigger an additional $300 billion in interest \ncosts on the larger national debt. We cannot afford the loss of an \nadditional $1.6 trillion from the Treasury. Temporary tax cuts to \nstimulate the economy are affordable, but the President's large, \npermanent tax breaks are not. If the Republican plan is adopted, the \nFederal Government will not have the resources to meet urgent domestic \nneeds in education, in health care, and in homeland security. The \nRepublican plan will raid the Social Security Trust Fund for $2.6 \ntrillion over the decade, threatening the benefits of future retirees.\n  If Congress accepts the Republican budget resolution, the on-budget \ndeficit will be nearly $4 trillion by 2013. More than three-quarters of \nthat amount is directly attributable to the Bush tax cuts enacted in \n2001 and the additional cuts proposed in 2003.\n  The impact these new tax cut proposals will have is clear from this \nbudget. When the President says ``no'' to obviously-needed spending on \nurgent domestic priorities such as education and health care, he says \nthe war on terrorism requires us all to tighten our belts. The burden \nof these sacrifices falls mainly on low and middle income individuals \nand families. Yet the President refuses to ask the wealthiest taxpayers \nto share the burden. In the midst of his repeated calls on others to \nsacrifice, he is advocating over $1.3 trillion in new tax breaks \nprimarily for those with the highest incomes. Such a policy is wrong \nand unfair.\n  Under the President's ``economic growth'' package, households with \nannual income over $1 million would receive an average tax cut of \nnearly $90,000 each year. In contrast, households in the middle of the \nincome spectrum would receive an average of less than $300 a year in \ntax benefits. Exempting dividend income from taxation will take $400 \nbillion out of the Treasury over the next 10 years. Half of that \nenormous amount--$200 billion--will go directly into the pockets of the \nrichest 1 percent of taxpayers. The White House apparently sees no need \nfor the wealthiest taxpayers to share in the national sacrifice. It \ncannot be wartime for middle America but still peacetime for the rich.\n  Despite the enormous amount spent on tax cuts, this budget resolution \nstill does not provide the kind of stimulus that is needed to get the \neconomy moving, nor does it provide help to those who are hurting the \nmost. Under the Republican plan, less than $40 billion of the $1.3 \ntrillion in new tax cuts will go into the economy this year when a \nstimulus is needed--less than $40 billion. There is no extension of \nunemployment compensation benefits to help the long-term unemployed.\n  There is no aid to States and local communities which are struggling \nwith an increased demand for the health care and human services they \nprovide, at the same time their revenues have sharply declined. This \nbudget will not help to bring an early end to economic stagnation.\n  A recent analysis of the President's proposal to eliminate the income \ntax on corporate dividends determined that it is one of the least \neffective forms of stimulus, generating less than a dime of stimulus \nfor every dollar of Federal revenue lost. This is further proof that \nthe Republican tax cut plan is not about stimulating a stagnant \neconomy, it is about further enriching the already wealthy.\n  The Nation cannot afford the tax breaks in this Republican budget. \nThe President's tax cut proposals must be scaled back substantially to \na far more affordable level.\n  Which of these choices will make the American community stronger and \nbetter able to face the challenges of the future? The decision to pass \nmore and more tax cuts for the richest among us is a decision to ignore \nAmerica's greatest needs. Now is the time for Congress to bring our \npolicies back into line with our national values. Rejecting this \nconference report would be a good start.\n  Unfortunately, most Congressional Republicans have made their choice. \nFor them, bigger tax cuts have a higher priority than educating kids, \nproviding a secure retirement for seniors, and making health care \navailable and affordable to more Americans.\n  The priorities clearly revealed in this Republican budget are not the \npriorities of the American people. Their voices have been shut out of \nthe room where the real decisions are being made. If Congress does not \nchange this budget, the American people will change Congress next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe adoption of the pending budget conference report occur at 4 p.m. \ntoday, with the time until then divided equally for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am constrained to object. We hope to \nhave agreement in the very near future, but apparently somebody needs \nto be contacted who has not yet been contacted. I say to my colleagues, \nI apologize. I thought we had agreement, but I am just informed we need \nto wait another few minutes before we can reach agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the conference report. I \nthink it is important we put into perspective the debate we are having \ntoday. You heard a lot of talk, if you listened to this debate, about \nthe potential danger of tax relief at a time like this in our economy. \nYou heard a lot of talk about skyrocketing deficits and what is the \nresponsibility or the cause of those deficits, and the circumstances \naround which this budget has been brought to the floor.\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\n  I wish to step back a bit and look at my personal experience in \nCongress as an example of what it is we are really looking at, what the \nperspective is with regard to this debate.\n  I ran for Congress in 1993. At that time, we had massive deficits, in \nthe neighborhood of $200 billion, $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 \nbillion, and had been having those deficits for years. I ran on a \nbalanced budget platform. I argued for a lot of other issues, but one \nof the main issues I talked about was the need to balance our Federal \nbudget. I got elected, got here to Washington, and have been involved \nin a debate over a budget each year since I served in Congress. Now I \nam in my 11th year.\n  In each year, what happens is, whoever is the leadership in Congress \nproposes a budget. The budget can be a 5-year budget, which is what we \nused to have, or a 10-year budget, such as the one before us. The \nimportant point to note about all these budgets is the year that \ncounts, particularly with regard to spending, is the first year of the \nbudget.\n  Yes, we are here talking about a 10-year budget, but next year we \nwill be back in front of the Congress with a new budget, and the first \nyear of that new budget will not necessarily be the same year, the same \nas the second year of this year's budget. In other words, we do not \njust adopt this 10-year budget and then go on from there and live with \nthe budget constraints contained in each of those 10 years. We do a new \nbudget every year. So what really counts is the first year of the \nbudget. It is important for people listening to this debate to \nunderstand that dynamic in order to understand what is really being \nsaid by those who are arguing about what should be the policy of this \nbudget.\n  It is true that with regard to tax relief, once tax relief is \nadopted, it is permanent until a Congress changes it, and it plays out \nfor a period of years. But it is the spending side of the budget that \ngets changed, especially the discretionary spending side of the budget \nthat gets changed and redone by Congress every year. You have to look \nvery carefully at the spending proposal. What happens, frankly, is that \nthose who want to see more Federal spending, those who want to see our \neconomy basically nationalized, with the Federal Government controlling \never-increasing aspects of the economy and spending ever-increasing \ndollars, frontload the spending into that first year of the budget. \nThen they have very prudent spending patterns in the second through the \ntenth year of the budget or the second through the fifth year of the \nbudget, knowing they can come back next year with a new first year and \nchange the whole spending dynamic.\n\n  The debate we are in right now is just another aspect of the \ntraditional debate we have been having in Washington for the last \ncouple of decades between those who do not want to see tax relief and \nthose who want to see tax relief, and between those who want to see the \nFederal spending increase versus those who want to hold spending down.\n  We have heard a lot of talk, as I have said, about budgets and \ndeficits. There has been a lot of accusation made about who caused the \ndeficit that we face. President Bush, as you know, when he first became \nPresident proposed major tax relief which this Congress adopted. It was \nadopted for a 10-year timespan and will expire at the end of 10 years \nfrom the day it was adopted in 2001, if it is not continued.\n  That tax relief has provided needed relief to the American people. \nThat tax relief is today being attacked on this floor as a cause of the \nbudget deficits when, in reality, I think most Americans are very well \naware we have had dramatic increases in spending required by the attack \non 9/11 by terrorists against our Nation and the significant increases \nin spending on homeland security, by the war in Iraq, and the increased \nspending for our national security that has been driven by the need to \nmake sure we have the strongest military we can to protect and preserve \nour Nation against terrorists and rogue nations overseas.\n  We have seen spending increases in other categories that have been \nfar beyond the growth of the economy. In the categories discussed by \nSenators on this floor today--education, health care, the environment--\nspending has gone through the roof for very good reasons: the defense \nof the war on terrorism, the defense of our homelands, the defense of \nour Nation. Nevertheless, spending has skyrocketed at the same time the \neconomy has collapsed. So we see revenue going down at a time when \nspending is going up. That is what is causing these deficits. It was \nnot President Bush's tax relief.\n  We can argue about whether giving tax relief is going to actually in \na dynamic economy strengthen revenues or reduce revenues, and I would \nlike to talk about that a little bit in a minute. The fact is, wherever \none comes down on that debate, the true core of the causes of the \ndeficits we are dealing with right now was not the tax relief; it was \nthe increases in spending and the collapse of the economy we have seen \nnot only in the United States but across this globe.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the fact we really have an \nobsession with tax cuts. There is definitely a strong commitment on the \npart of many of us to obtain tax relief because we believe strongly \nthat it is through proper management of the tax collection side of our \nbudget that we will provide the economic stimulus to our Nation that is \nneeded. But if there is an obsession on the one side for tax relief, \nthen it must also be said there is an obsession on the other side with \nspending.\n\n  Those very Senators who stand on the floor and talk about the fact we \ncannot support increased tax relief, we cannot have more tax relief, \nare the very same ones who when we debated this budget in the Senate \nthey proposed over 80 amendments. There were over 80 amendments that we \ndealt with. If we tally up the increased spending that was proposed in \nthe bevy of amendments when we considered this budget, it was almost an \nadditional trillion dollars of spending that was proposed.\n  This budget is a lean budget, but it is one that meets the needs of \nthis Nation in the critical areas that we must address. Again, we are \nhaving that age-old battle between whether we should keep taxes low \nand, in fact, even reduce them further or whether we should keep taxes \nhigh and stop tax cuts from being made and allow previous tax relief to \nexpire and thereby let taxes go up so we can sustain higher levels of \nFederal spending in the budget. That is what this debate is about.\n  If we do nothing, if we let the current law stay as it is and have no \ntax relief and have no additional spending, we will still see deficits \nin the neighborhood of $200 billion in the budget year 2004 we are \nworking on. So, again, I think it is important to set the parameters.\n  If we look at the proposals of the one side who are now objecting to \nthe President's tax relief, they also have a stimulus package. Their \nstimulus package, however, does not contain so much tax relief. It \ncontains mostly spending, on the theory, apparently, that we can spend \nourselves into prosperity by having the Federal Government put a \nmassive focus on spending to strengthen our economy.\n  We simply disagree with that. Notably, the spending in this stimulus \npackage is frontloaded. Recall what I talked about with regard to how \nthese budgets work. It is the first year of the budget that we really \nhave to focus on on the spending side, and the frontloaded spending in \nthe alternative stimulus package that is proposed results in a deficit, \nif it were to be adopted, that is even higher than the deficit that is \ncontained with the President's tax relief proposal in this budget. \nAccording to the analysis, the deficit would be $382 billion, but it \nwould not be because of tax relief. It would be because of spending. \nThat is the key difference, again, in the debate we are having today.\n  There has been some discussion about the fact that we did not get a \nbudget last year, and why we did not get a budget. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota asked some of us who voted against what he calls a 2-year \nbudget that was proposed last year, why we voted against it. Well, I \nwill tell my colleagues, it was the same old debate. That proposal, \nthough it was not actually a full-blown budget, was one which extended \nthe caps and it extended the point of order for the budget points of \norder that we need as protection in this budget and had some increased \nspending in some categories. The spending\n\n[[Page S5286]]\n\nproposals were, once again, too high. They were far beyond what the \nPresident had proposed in his budget that was focused on building a \npath back toward balance.\n  The reason we voted against it was because we did not believe in the \nspending levels they had proposed. With regard to those important \nbudget protections, the extended caps on the budget and the budget \npoints of order and the like, we did later on adopt those and extend \nthem into April of this year. It is those spending caps and budget \npoints of order that this budget now proposes to put back into place.\n\n  There has also been some talk about whether the manner in which this \nbudget is being brought forth with the reconciliation instructions, \nbeing different between the House and the Senate, is proper. Frankly, I \nhave looked at it. As I see it, it is very straightforward. The \nreconciliation instructions provide for $550 billion of tax relief over \nthe next 10 years. With regard to that proposed tax relief, it is very \nclear that with the current support in opposition to that proposal, the \nSenate cannot pass that kind of tax relief. So it is proposed in this \nbudget reconciliation that the Senate committee cannot exceed $350 \nbillion, as the Senate committee puts together the tax package \ncontemplated by this budget, and the House committee cannot exceed the \n$550 billion. The reconciliation between those two numbers will occur \nwhen the tax committee in the House and the tax committee in the Senate \nwrite the actual detailed tax language and they seek, if those bills \nare passed, to conference those bills.\n  It is a very normal and standard approach, in my opinion, of bringing \ntogether the differences between the House and the Senate, letting that \ndebate be resolved at a time when the House and the Senate have put the \ndetails to the tax packages.\n  As has been said many times, what we are adopting today is a budget. \nIt creates a number for tax relief. It does not say what kind of tax \nrelief will occur. There are proposals and I am going to talk about \nthose proposals, but the budget that we are talking about allows the \nHouse and the Senate tax committees to write their own proposals. We do \nnot know what they are likely to adopt--well, let me say we think we \nknow what they are likely to focus on, but we do not know the details \nof how they will adopt it.\n  I will talk about the tax relief argument for a minute. It has been \nsaid again today, multiple times, that we are talking about tax relief \nfor the wealthy. As I said, I have served in Congress now for over 10 \nyears, and during each of those 10 years--the 6 years I served in the \nHouse and going on 5 years I have now served in the Senate--we have had \ndebates over tax relief. We have had tax relief proposals of all \ndifferent kinds, everything from proposals to reduce the income tax \nrates to proposals to eliminate the marriage tax penalty, to proposals \nfor child tax credits, and so forth. Every single time that a proposal \nfor tax relief has been made, since I have served in this Congress, it \nhas been attacked as tax relief for the wealthy. Even the proposal to \neliminate the marriage tax penalty was attacked as tax cuts for the \nwealthy.\n  Why? Because that is something that seems to work when people do not \nlook at the details behind what kinds of tax relief are being proposed.\n  Well, what kind of tax relief is being proposed by the President? \nFirst, he is proposing that we accelerate the tax cuts that were put \ninto place in 2001. That includes expansion of the 10-percent bracket, \nhardly a tax cut on the wealthy; acceleration of the 2006 rate \nschedule; acceleration of the 15-percent bracket; and an increase in \nthe standard deduction for married filing jointly, hardly tax cuts for \nthe wealthy; acceleration of the child credit increase, hardly tax \nrelief for the wealthy; an increase in the AMT exemption amount. There \nis one where people from all different categories could get caught up \nin it but particularly I hear about this one from small business \nowners. I certainly hope all small business owners in America and \nothers are not considered to be wealthy simply because they own their \nown business.\n\n  It also includes an increase in the expensing options for small \nbusinesses and other businesses, all businesses.\n  Mr. President, I have just been notified I can now make a unanimous \nconsent request, and I will do so.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct a question through the \nChair to my friend, who is acting majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUNUNU). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Could I have some indication how much longer the Senator \nfrom Idaho is going to talk? We may not be able to make the 4 time.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Maybe 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have four speakers, and if the time is equally divided \nbetween now and 4, I am not sure we have enough time for all of our \nspeakers.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I do not expect to go more than another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if the majority is going to use all of their \ntime, if we decide to vote at 4, which will be beyond 15 minutes. Does \nthe Senator think he would have authority to allow us to have another \nhour of that time and the majority have what remains?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I am not authorized to make that agreement at this point. \nShould I forego making the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The point I was making is that the first thing the \nPresident was talking about doing was accelerating the tax relief that \nwas implemented in 2001, tax relief which was attacked then for being a \ntax cut on the wealthy but certainly was not so.\n  The other thing the President has proposed is to make all of that tax \nrelief permanent. That would be making the elimination of the marriage \ntax penalty permanent, making the elimination of the estate tax \npermanent, making the increase in the expansion of the 10-percent \nbracket and the other tax relief provided for all taxpayers in America \npermanent. These proposals benefit every taxpayer in America. On a \npercentage basis, they favor those in the lower income brackets far \nmore than those in the upper income brackets.\n\n  The bottom line is, whether you use percentages or numbers, people \ncan play with the numbers and say this is a tax cut for wealthy or \nmiddle income or whatever, but on a percentage basis these tax relief \nproposals benefit those in the lower income tax brackets more than any \nother bracket.\n  In order to facilitate our effort to conclude this debate at the 4 \np.m. time, I will forego the remainder of my comments.\n  I conclude by pointing out this is another angle on the traditional \ndebate we have virtually every year between those who want to see \nspending maintained and increased and those who want to see the Federal \nbudget controlled and implement tax relief. The American people can see \nthrough these arguments. The American people understand the value and \nstimulus tax relief can provide to the economy of this Nation at a time \nwhen our economy dramatically needs the right kind of fiscal policy to \nbe adopted by this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the budget before the Senate, like the \nPresident's budget which it reflects, represents the wrong priorities: \nToo many ill-advised cuts in too many critical area to help pay for a \ntax cut which is too large, too inequitable, and which will worsen our \nfiscal situation without providing our economy the jump-start it needs.\n  The budget resolution that passed the Senate, while irresponsible, \nwas a small improvement over the one reported from the committee. The \nSenate managed to make an irresponsible budget resolution slightly less \nirresponsible. The huge tax cuts the President proposed, a majority of \nwhich would go to upper income folks and which most economists agree \nwould provide our economy with almost no jump-start that it so \ndesperately needs, were scaled back some. But the conference report \nbefore the Senate today pushes us right back to where we started.\n  Notwithstanding our current record deficits, a war in Iraq and its \nexpected aftermath, the full cost of which is not\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\nyet known, and a baby boom generation that will soon retire in record \nnumbers, the conference report contains tax cuts that total about $1.3 \ntrillion over the next 10 years and, with the expected interest costs \nadded in, $1.6 trillion.\n  As recently as January of 2001, the Office of Management and Budget \nprojected a 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. Now we are back into a \nhuge deficit hole and will be there for the foreseeable future. In \nfact, this conference report projects total deficits of $1.4 trillion \nover the next 10 years, including record deficits of over $300 billion \nthis year and next.\n\n  The right type of small tax cuts could stimulate the economy by being \neffective in the short term and going to working families and small \nbusinesses who will spend the money now, instead of mainly going to the \nwealthiest among us who do not need tax cuts. Tax cuts that drastically \nworsen our long-term fiscal situation, that will not help out in the \nshort term, and that would require cuts to many other priorities are \nnot what our economy needs and not what our people are asking us to \nadopt.\n  How much money is going to whom in 2003? The President's tax cut \nproposal gives about half of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 5 percent \nof American taxpayers. People can try to put a different gloss on \nnumbers, but there are two bottom lines: One bottom line is this \nproposal puts us deeper into a deficit ditch and pays for tax cuts \nmainly going to upper income folks by borrowing; the other bottom line \nis that the 2003 tax cut proposal of the President gives the wealthiest \n5 percent about 50 percent of the money involved in these tax cuts.\n  Simple equity, as well as an economic stimulus, suggests if we are \ngoing to have tax cuts, they should be broad based, providing, for \ninstance, every working family of four with an immediate tax cut of \n$1,200. That would be an economic stimulus. That would be equitable. \nThat is not what is before the Senate.\n  There are a number of other things we ought to do in talking about \nequity and economic stimulus. We ought to extend unemployment benefits \nfor those whose benefits have expired and were not previously extended. \nWe ought to provide short-term incentives for businesses to invest \nimmediately. We ought to provide some assistance to our struggling \nstates for education, homeland security, Medicaid, and highway and \nother infrastructure improvements. Those measures would be better for \nour economy today, our fiscal situation in future years, and the many \nother challenges that lie ahead. They would also address today's \nproblems today without passing the costs on to future generations. One \nsymbol of those future generations are the men and women who now are \nputting their lives on the line for us in the war in Iraq. It seems to \nme unthinkable that when we welcome them home--hopefully with the \nparades and the welcome and the hugs they deserve--we would also tell \nthem: By the way, the war you are fighting is going to be paid for by \nyou and your kids, not by us; we are going to borrow money, not to pay \nfor this war; we are going to borrow this money to pay for a tax cut \nthat mainly goes to the wealthiest among us.\n  This approach in this budget is wrong on three counts. Number one, we \nshould not be cutting taxes. We ought to be paying for the war now. \nNumber two, if we are going to borrow money, if we have to borrow money \nfor the war, we obviously should borrow it for the war, not for a tax \ncut. Finally, if there are going to be tax cuts, the tax cuts ought to \ngo not only to those who need the tax cuts the most but those who will \nspend the money now, giving our economy the jump-start it needs.\n  We need a lift in this economy, not one that will kick in years down \nthe road or will further explode the deficit, but a fiscally \nresponsible lift that will kick in now. The job loss numbers released a \nweek ago by the Labor Department reinforce the need for a stimulus plan \nthat will create jobs now, in 2003, when we need it.\n  The proposed tax cuts are not only sharply slanted toward the \nwealthiest among us, they would do virtually nothing to assist our \nfinancially strapped States. As a matter of fact, the tax cuts as \nproposed may harm them. Just the proposed dividend tax provision alone \nwould actually strip my home State of Michigan of over $100 million in \nrevenue in 2004. And economists, including multiple Nobel Prize \nwinners, agree the tax cut will not provide the boost that this economy \nneeds.\n  I was also very disappointed to see the conference report excluded an \namendment that I offered and that was adopted by the Senate in the \nbudget resolution which we adopted.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend to yield. I am rising for a \nunanimous consent request so Members have an idea when this will be \nconcluded.\n  Mr. President, I have been in discussion with the majority, and I ask \nunanimous consent the vote on adoption of the pending budget conference \nreport occur 2 hours from this time, and that Senator Levin be allowed \nto complete his statement on our side, and Senator Durbin would have 15 \nminutes, Senator Graham of Florida 15 minutes, Senator Feinstein 10 \nminutes, Senator Biden 10 minutes, and Senator Byrd 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also need some time to wrap up, I say to my colleague, \nin maybe 10 minutes. Maybe we can work these all down in a way that \nfits within the time constraints.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I think it is totally appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to an additional 10 minutes \nbeing allocated to the Senator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. REID. We need to make sure we have enough time for the majority. \nIf we do 2 hours, they would be limited, instead of 30 minutes, to 20 \nminutes. The only reason I say that is Senator Nickles, when he started \ntoday, said they would not need a lot of time. I know 110 minutes \ncompared to 20 minutes is not very much.\n  Mr. CAPO. I am authorized to agree to 90 minutes for the Democrats \nand 30 minutes for the Republicans. But I am not authorized to reduce \nthat 30 minutes at this point, so I would have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. If I could modify my request, I will try to pare down the \ntime here. Let's make it 95 minutes here and 35 minutes on the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I just had a chance to \nvisit for a moment with the Senator from Nevada. I would like to be \nable to speak for 20 minutes between now and the time the vote occurs.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Michigan has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment to which I referred, which was adopted by \nthe Senate, was aimed at closing down certain abusive tax haven \nloopholes. We would have taken the money which we would receive by \nclosing down these abuses and applied half of it to the deficit, the \nother half going to education in areas where we are cutting education.\n  It is unconscionable to me that corporations, too many of them, have \nrenounced their United States citizenship and opened phony offices in \nBermuda from which they can then pretend that their businesses operate, \nkeep doing their business here in the United States, using our police \ndepartments, our fire departments, our schools, and all of our other \nservices--inverting, as it is called--getting the benefits of \ncitizenship here but avoiding paying taxes.\n  People ask, how come revenues are going down? There are a lot of \nreasons why revenues are going down. One of them is the tax cuts which \nwere adopted here which were proposed by President Bush. Obviously, a \nslowing economy has had an effect, too. But one of the other reasons we \nlost revenues is that we have too many corporations that are avoiding \npaying their fair share of taxes through a very large number of tax \navoidance schemes.\n  We have seen some of these tax shelters. We have seen some of these \nspecial-purpose entities used by Enron and\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\nothers. We have seen a whole host of ways folks can avoid paying their \nfair share of taxes. It seems to me, in the middle of a war, the most \nunconscionable one of all is those corporations that renounce their \ncitizenship and open up a fake office somewhere else in order to avoid \npaying taxes which they should be paying, and at the same time using \nour roads, our schools, our banks, our patent laws, our law \nenforcement, our fair trade laws, our workforce, and not contributing \ntheir fair share to pay for those benefits. It was really unfortunate \nthat the conferees decided to strip this budget resolution of language \nthat was aimed at closing down that particular loophole.\n  This budget emphasizes the wrong priorities. It burrows us deeper \ninto the deficit ditch. It continues our reliance on the Social \nSecurity surplus. And it fails to provide the stimulus which is needed \nto improve our sputtering economy. It rises to a new level of \nirresponsibility and it should be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to respond to something my \ncolleague from Idaho indicated during his remarks when he stated that \nmarriage penalty relief has been attacked as a tax cut for the wealthy. \nI know of no example of that. I do know that on our side, Democrats \nmoved to accelerate that relief in 2001, but virtually every Republican \nvoted against it.\n  I would be happy to have that vote printed in the Record at this \ntime, so people can check the record and determine whether or not that \nallegation has merit or not. I ask unanimous consent that be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [Record Vote 112, May 17, 2001]\n\n              Reconciliation (Tax Cut), (Marriage Penalty)\n\n       H.R. 1836--Amendment No. 654: ``Economic Growth and Tax \n     Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001''.\n       Conrad-Kennedy-Johnson amendment which accelerates the \n     elimination of the marriage penalty in the standard deduction \n     and the 15 percent tax bracket to fully eliminate the penalty \n     in 2002; offsets by delaying the reduction of the top two tax \n     brackets from 2009 to 2010; and provides a trigger mechanism \n     to protect the Medicare HI trust fund, requiring the Treasury \n     Secretary to adjust the marginal tax rate reductions in any \n     fiscal year in which the rate cuts would result in an on-\n     budget surplus smaller than the Medicare HI trust fund \n     surplus.\n       Amendment Rejected.\n\n\n                               YEAS (44)\n\n       Democrats (42 or 84%): Akaka, Bayh, Biden, Bingaman, Boxer, \n     Byrd, Cantwell, Carnahan, Clinton, Conrad, Corzine, Daschle, \n     Dayton, Dodd, Dorgan, Durbin, Edwards, Feingold, Feinstein, \n     Graham, Harkin, Hollings, Inouye, Johnson, Kennedy, Kerry, \n     Kohl, Landrieu, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Mikulski, Murray, \n     Nelson (FL), Reed, Reid, Rockefeller, Sarbanes, Schumer, \n     Stabenow, Wellstone, Wyden.\n       Republicans (2 or 4%): Chafee, L., McCain.\n\n\n                               nays (56)\n\n       Democrats, (8 or 16%): Baucus, Breaux, Carper, Cleland, \n     Lincoln, Miller, Nelson (NE), Torricelli.\n       Republicans (48 or 95%): Allard, Allen, Bennett, Bond, \n     Brownback, Bunning, Burns, Campbell, Cochran, Collins, Craig, \n     Crapo, DeWine, Domenici, Ensign, Enzi, Fitzgerald, Frist, \n     Gramm, Grassley, Gregg, Hagel, Hatch, Helms, Hutchinson, \n     Hutchison, Inhofe, Jeffords, Kyl, Lott, Lugar, McConnell, \n     Murkowski, Nickles, Roberts, Santorum, Sessions, Shelby, \n     Smith (NH), Smith (OR), Snowe, Specter, Stevens, Thomas, \n     Thompson, Thurmond, Voinovich, Warner.\n\n\n                             NOT VOTING (0)\n\n       Democrats (0).\n       Republicans (0).\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I believe what I said was that, as I had been here over 10 \nyears, we debated that proposal several times and every time it has \nbeen debated it has been attacked as a tax cut for the wealthy. I can \ntell you from my own personal experience, that is the case. In fact, \ntoday it is part of the proposal being talked about and it is being \nattacked as a tax cut for the wealthy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleague, as I indicated, we on this side \nmoved to accelerate that relief in 2001. In fact, I offered the \namendment.\n  Mr. CRAPO. We will take a look at that and see why the vote was \ndifferent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All but two on your side voted against it.\n  Is the Senator seeking time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I reduced the time I requested because I \nknow I have colleagues on the floor seeking recognition and we want to \nwrap this up in a timely way.\n  Let me say to those following this debate, one, the greatest \nIllinoisan of all times once said:\n\n       A speech the world will little note nor long remember.\n\n  I think the same can be said of this debate. The United States will \nlittle note nor long remember this debate on the Senate floor. But it \nwill remember what happened today when we see the outcome. The outcome \nis going to be devastating for the economy of the United States for \nyears to come.\n  The reason is, of course, America is preoccupied, as it should be, \nwith the war in Iraq. We are so proud of the achievements of the men \nand women in uniform. We have watched every single day the wonderful \nunfolding of the change in Iraq, offering a new opportunity. I think \nthe reason we are focused and so positive about the military \naccomplishment is we know the men and women involved in that decision \nshowed both courage and vision.\n  Sadly, when it comes to the economy of the United States, the other \nparty and the administration in the White House show political \ncalculation and myopia. Instead of dealing with the real economic \nchallenges of America in a sensible, fair, and evenhanded way, we have \na Republican budget resolution which will be devastating. It will be \ndevastating in creating the largest deficits in the history of the \nUnited States of America.\n  What happened to this Grand Old Party, this party of fiscal \nconservatism? Today, we find it is the party of record deficits and \nrecord debt. A party which once said, we don't want to leave a legacy \nto our children of debt, is in fact creating that debt with this budget \nresolution.\n\n  There are some things you can argue are beyond the control of the \nWhite House or anyone in Congress. One of those things is the cost of \nthis war and the war on terrorism. I will gladly concede that those are \nthings which could not be calculated 2 or 3 years ago and cannot be \ncalculated today in terms of their cost. But the real problem with this \nbudget resolution is this President's fixation with creating massive \ntax cuts for the wealthiest people in America. It is the age-old \nRepublican answer to every single problem: When in doubt, cut taxes for \nwealthy people.\n  This is done in the belief that if the wealthiest people in America \njust had a little more money to spend, things would get so much better. \nWe tried this. A little over 2 years ago, the President came in with \nthe first round of his tax cuts for the wealthy, and he said: Just \nwatch what happens.\n  We watched. The economy continues to plummet. We continue to lose \njobs. In fact, if you look at the Bush record since the President took \noffice: 2.5 million fewer private sector jobs under this President; \nlong-term unemployment up 184 percent; over 2 million more Americans \nwithout health insurance; 1 in 10 small businesses has dropped health \ninsurance for their workers; the average cost of health insurance rises \nby double digits; the gap between tuition and Federal student aid has \ngrown $1,900 more under President Bush, retirement savings have been \ndecimated, consumer confidence dropped by 51 percent, and the Bush \nbudgets have turned a projected $5.6 trillion Federal surplus into a $2 \ntrillion deficit.\n  How can one President in 2 years and 3 months have dealt such body \nblows to the American economy? He did it with the wrong policies, a \npolicy of tax cuts for the wealthy that failed in the first round and \nwill fail again. This budget resolution enshrines those tax cuts and \nsays to our children and future generations: Get prepared to pay off \nthis debt because we have to give tax breaks to wealthy people today.\n  My friend from Idaho says: Oh, that's just class warfare. I am \nreminded we were recently visited by Warren Buffett, one of the most \nwealthy men\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\nin America. He said: If this is class warfare, I have something to \nreport: My class is winning.\n\n  It certainly is, because if you look at the President's overall tax \ncuts, and the amount of money that average taxpayers can expect, look \nat these numbers: $265 for the typical taxpayer in tax relief; and yet \nfor people with over $1 million, $88,873 on an annual basis.\n  Think about that for a moment. We are saying to the average taxpayer: \nWe are going to give you a modest bicycle and some roller skates. We \nare saying, for the millionaires: You need a luxury car.\n  That is the idea of fairness and justice when it comes to the \nRepublican side of the aisle.\n  Well, it has been absolutely devastating. When you take a look at it \nin terms of the Bush tax plan, nearly 50 percent of American taxpayers \nwill receive less than $100. They just get the roller skates. The \npeople who are millionaires end up with the luxury limos.\n  Is that what America is all about, particularly in time of war, when \nwe have children from average, middle-income working families risking \ntheir lives for this Nation? Is this the best we can do? To offer a tax \ncut to the wealthiest people in this country? To say at this time of \nuncertainty about the cost of the war, and what we will need as a \nnation, that the best we can come up with is a plan from the White \nHouse to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people?\n  Take a look at this budget conference report and I will tell you what \nyou will find. The Republican approach shortcuts education \ndramatically. The President passed No Child Left Behind. He said: We \nare going to help our schools move forward.\n  We need $9 billion, Mr. President, next year. Your budget provides \n$400 million--not nearly enough. While school districts face \nbankruptcy, States are deep in deficit, this administration cannot find \nthe money for education. But it can find the money for tax cuts for \nwealthy people.\n  I will tell you, the No. 1 issue I find among families and businesses \nin Illinois--the No. 1 issue--is not this whole question of tax cuts; \nit is the cost of health insurance. This administration, in this \nbudget, has done absolutely nothing to deal with the most serious \nproblem that businesses and families face today--nothing. It is better, \nthey believe, to give a tax cut to wealthy people than to deal with \nreal issues that families and businesses face every single day.\n  You want to deal with tax cuts? Let me tell you one that I find \noverwhelmingly popular in my town meetings. The Senator from New York \nhas suggested it, Mr. Schumer: a $12,000 deduction each year for \ncollege education expenses. Think about working families whose kids get \ninto good schools and face tuition that they never would have dreamed \nof and debt that they couldn't imagine. Imagine if we could give them \ntax assistance, give them tax help: $12,000 deductibility.\n  But, no, the Republicans say that isn't the way to invigorate \nAmerica. That isn't the vision of the future. Their vision is to make \nsure the wealthiest among us have more money to spend.\n  I don't get it. It is classic Republicanism, but it is a classic \nfailure--a failure which over 2 years and 3 months has driven the \nAmerican economy into the rut.\n  In my State, we have lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, \nfaced record unemployment rates, and this administration believes the \nway out of it is to provide tax cuts for the wealthiest people.\n  I salute the Senator from North Dakota. His leadership on this has \nbeen extraordinary. He and the Congressman from South Carolina, John \nSpratt, have spoken out in honest terms about what we face as a nation. \nSome of the things the Senator said during the course of the debate are \nnot necessarily politically popular, but they are courageous and they \nshow vision. That is what our military forces are doing in Iraq. That \nis what we should do here, nothing less. Instead, we are dealing with \npolitical calculation and kind of shortsightedness that we will pay for \nfor many generations.\n  I will vote a resounding no on this budget resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Does the Senator from Florida seek time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n\n  Mr. President, the real priorities of the President and those who \nwrote this budget can be seen by comparing two numbers: The tax cuts \nauthorized in this resolution total $1.3 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. Over the same 10 years, the Federal budget will run deficits \ntotaling $1.4 trillion.\n  The priority of those supporting this resolution is crystal clear: \ntax cuts today, in exchange for an even higher mountain of debt that \nwill be paid by our children and grandchildren.\n  So strong is the lust for tax cuts, the conference committee on the \nbudget has gone so far as to develop an unprecedented gimmick by which \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives will consider a portion of \nthese tax cuts later in the year.\n  Under normal procedures, a conference report is to be a consolidated \nsingle resolution of all of its issues. We are presented with what is \ncalled a conference report, which has a dramatic difference between tax \ncut allowances in the House--$550 billion, over 10 years--and tax cuts \nallowed in the Senate--$350 billion.\n  The goal of the majority is to give the appearance of limiting tax \ncuts to the Senate-passed limit of $350 billion, while paving the way \nfor fast-track tax cuts of $550 billion.\n  During the debate on the Senate's budget resolution a couple of weeks \nago, I voted against any tax cut in the budget. Why? Because, in my \njudgment, they do not reflect our Nation's priorities.\n  This budget should seek to reduce the national debt. It should seek \nto strengthen and reform Social Security. It should seek sufficient \nfunds to modernize the Medicare Program and add a meaningful \nprescription drug benefit. It should provide funds for programs the \nFederal Government has committed itself to which are so critical in the \nlives of our children.\n  This budget includes no adequate money for these priorities. It is \nlaser like in its focus on tax cuts. The tax cuts allowed by this \nbudget are not only irresponsible, they are misdirected. Although their \nadvocates claim their purpose is to create jobs and stimulate economic \ngrowth, these tax cuts will not do the job. That is especially true of \nthe proposed tax cut on stock dividends.\n  To truly stimulate the economy, any tax cuts should be targeted so \nthey boost demand for consumer goods and services. Most economists \nagree that this is best achieved by directing the tax cuts to low- and \nmiddle-income families and small businesses.\n  I personally would prefer a short-term reduction in the payroll tax, \npaid for by general revenue, holding the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds whole.\n  The tax cuts contemplated by this resolution are directed at upper \nincome families who are the least likely to boost their purchases of \ngoods and services.\n  We had a debate a few moments ago as to whether this was class \nwarfare. That is in the eyes of the beholder. But one thing that it \nclearly is: It is intergenerational warfare.\n  It is warfare against children, with cuts in education, the failure \nto fund the No Child Left Behind Act, which we passed 2 years ago, cuts \nin childcare, cuts in women's, infant's, and children's health care.\n  The irony of this intergenerational warfare against children is that \nthey will end up paying, during their adulthood, the cost of the \ndeficits which we are adding today.\n  It is also intergenerational warfare against older Americans. Some \nwould argue that this budget includes $400 billion for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. They know full well that $400 billion is \ninadequate to provide an affordable, comprehensive, universal \nprescription drug benefit for America's seniors.\n  Why do we know this? Last year, 52 Senators voted for a plan, which I \nhad\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\noffered, to provide to Medicare beneficiaries real drug benefits, with \nno gimmicks, no gaps, no hidden ``gotchas.''\n  With inflation and the change in demographics of the older \npopulation, such a benefit would now cost $619 billion over 10 years.\n  Limiting a prescription drug benefit to $400 billion means that 89 \npercent--89 percent--of Medicare beneficiaries, those who have elected \nto stay in the fee-for-service Medicare Program, will go without \nprescription drug coverage, unless they either have very low incomes or \nvery high drug costs.\n  The only way to provide a drug benefit within this budget's framework \nis to limit the benefit to a relatively small number of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  If they should happen to live in an area that offers health \nmaintenance organization coverage--and millions of our seniors do not--\nMedicare beneficiaries will have no choice but to move into managed \ncare plans because there is no other way that they will be able to \naccess the lifesaving prescription drugs they need. It is wrong to \nforce seniors to make this choice. It is irresponsible to approve a \nbudget that ignores vital priorities such as modernizing the Medicare \nProgram, securing Social Security's future, reducing the national debt, \nwhile promoting massive tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to take responsibility for our actions, to pay \nfor our obligations now--not to pass a budget that promotes \nunaffordable tax cuts, tax cuts with consequences that will be felt \nnow, particularly by children and older Americans, tax cuts with costs \nthat will be passed on to future generations to pay.\n  Therefore, I shall vote no on this budget resolution and hope that we \nmight have an opportunity later in the year to reconsider this \nmisguided proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an item which appeared in the New York \nTimes of April 9, titled, ``No New Tax Cuts,'' which was authored by \nformer Senators Bob Kerrey, Sam Nunn, and Warren Rudman, as well as \nPeter Peterson and Robert E. Rubin, and Paul A. Volcker be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 9, 2003]\n\n                            No New Tax Cuts\n\n(By Bob Kerrey, Sam Nunn, Peter G. Peterson, Robert E. Rubin, Warren B. \n                      Rudman and Paul A. Volcker)\n\n       With a war in Iraq and looming post-war costs, growing \n     pressures for a prescription drug benefit, increased expenses \n     for domestic security and a ballooning budget deficit, \n     Congress must exercise restraint on both revenues and \n     spending to prevent fiscal policy from spiraling out of \n     control. The consensus in favor of long-term budget balance \n     must be re-established. This issue is now directly before \n     Congress as it debates the federal budget.\n       The fiscal outlook is much worse than official projections \n     indicate. These projections assume that the tax cuts enacted \n     in 2001 will expire at the end of 2010. They also assume that \n     discretionary spending, the part of the budget that pays for \n     national defense, domestic security, education and \n     transportation, will shrink continuously as a share of the \n     economy. Neither of these assumptions is realistic.\n       Moreover, the official projections do not include the costs \n     of war and reconstruction in Iraq. And they ignore the \n     inevitable need to reform the alternative minimum tax, which \n     is not indexed for inflation and will apply to some 40 \n     million households within 10 years--up from two million \n     today.\n       Under more realistic assumptions, the deficit projections \n     are cause for alarm. A recent study by Goldman Sachs includes \n     this forecast: if the president's proposed new tax cuts are \n     enacted, a Medicare prescription drug benefit is approved, \n     the A.M.T. is adjusted and appropriations grow modestly, the \n     deficits over the next 10 years will total $4.2 trillion--\n     even if the Social Security surplus is included. If it is not \n     included, the deficit would be $6.7 trillion. Under these \n     circumstances, the ratio of publicly held debt to gross \n     domestic product climbs within 10 years to nearly 50 percent, \n     from 33 percent just two years ago.\n       And all of this happens before the fiscal going gets tough. \n     Looming at the end of the decade is a demographic \n     transformation that threatens to swamp the budget and the \n     economy with unfunded benefit promises, like Social Security \n     and Medicare, of roughly $25 trillion in present value. Our \n     children and grandchildren already face unthinkable payroll \n     tax burdens that could go as high as 33 percent to pay for \n     these promised benefits. It is neither fiscally nor morally \n     responsible to give ourselves tax cuts and leave future \n     generations with an even higher tax burden.\n       And yet tax cuts are the primary focus of this year's \n     budget debate. To speed enactment of tax cuts, Congress is \n     planning to use a special fast-tract procedure called \n     ``reconciliation'' in the budget resolution. While \n     determining the size of the tax cut to be given fast-track \n     protection in the budget is sometimes dismissed as a \n     procedural matter, it is not: whatever its size, a tax cut \n     that receives this protection is almost certain to be enacted \n     in the later tax legislation. Members of Congress should not \n     therefore approach the budget decision with the idea that a \n     tax cut given such status now can be easily scaled back \n     later.\n       The president has proposed a cut of $726 billion, which the \n     House has already approved. The Senate has reduced the cut to \n     $350 billion.\n       Given the rapidly deteriorating long-term fiscal outlook, \n     neither proposal is fiscally responsible. It is illogical to \n     begin the journey back toward balanced budgets by enacting a \n     tax cut that will only make the long-term outlook worse. \n     Furthermore, the proposed tax cuts are not useful for short-\n     term fiscal stimulus, since only a small portion would take \n     effect this year. Nor would they spur long-term economic \n     growth. In fact, tax cuts financed by perpetual deficits will \n     eventually slow the economy.\n       The tax cuts now before Congress do not pay for themselves. \n     No plausible array of matching spending cuts or offsetting \n     revenue increases has been, or will be, proposed to close the \n     gap resulting from a large new tax cut.\n       We believe that there should be no new tax cuts beyond \n     those that are likely to provide immediate fiscal stimulus, \n     and that avoid growing revenue loss over time. If, however, \n     Congress decides it must approve a tax cut, it should pass \n     the Senate's. While a $350 billion tax cut does not fit our \n     definition of fiscal responsibility, it comes closer than a \n     tax cut of $726 billion. Moreover, Congress should \n     reestablish the pay-as-you-go rule in which tax cuts and \n     entitlement expansions must be offset. The discipline of this \n     rule greatly contributed to the elimination of budget \n     deficits in the 1990's and is clearly needed again.\n       Congress cannot simply conclude that deficits don't matter. \n     Over the long term, deficits matter a great deal. They lower \n     future economic growth by reducing the level of national \n     savings that can be devoted to productive investments. They \n     raise interest rates higher than they would be other \n     otherwise. They raise interest payments on the national debt. \n     They reduce the fiscal flexibility to deal with unexpected \n     developments. If we forget these economic consequences, we \n     risk creating an insupportable tax burden for the next \n     generation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, how much time would the Senator \nfrom Florida like?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The good ranking member of our committee was \ngoing to allocate 10 minutes to me.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Taking the position of the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, I shall allocate 10 minutes to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. For that to come from the senior colleague of \nmy State, who not only can I call friend but also my senior Senator, my \nmentor, I am very grateful. I find that as in most of the cases, his \nand my ideas are very similar, as he has just expressed so about this \nbudget.\n  I want to start my remarks by telling a story. In 1978, I came to the \nHouse of Representatives and became a freshman member of the Budget \nCommittee. Twenty-two years later, I come to the Senate, and I am a \nfreshman Senator put on the Budget Committee.\n  In the second term I had in the House, we had a newly elected \nPresident, President Reagan. I felt that the President, having won a \nsignificant victory, was owed a certain deference with regard to his \ntax policy. On a very close vote, I was one of the handful of votes \nthat allowed President Reagan to pass his budget in 1981, and his tax \ncut.\n  In a couple of months, I realized that I had made a mistake. I took \nto the floor of the House of Representatives and stated that I had made \na mistake because what we had done was to cut the tax revenues so much \nso that the revenues were plummeting at the same time we were \nincreasing expenditures of Government. Prior to the Reagan \nadministration we were still running deficits, but it was about a $20 \nbillion deficit, annual deficit--that is, $20 billion more that the \nGovernment was spending than it had coming in tax revenue--but if you \nlook on a chart, what happened after that was the expenditures were \ngoing up and the revenues were coming down. And the annual amount of \nborrowing that the Government had to do was all the greater,\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\nswelling the national debt, causing a huge expenditure for the \nFederal Government of annual interest on the additional amounts that we \nwere borrowing each year. It was taking us into the economic ditch. We \nwere in fiscal chaos. I will never forget one of my dear friends in the \nHouse, who shall remain nameless but who was one of the preeminent \neconomic spokespeople of the time for the trickle-down, supply-side \neconomics theory, stated--and I found it revealing--We do not worship \nat the altar of the balanced budget anymore.\n\n  Well, that was certainly true because in the decade of the 1980s, the \nannual deficit swelled to around $250 billion a year. The national debt \ndoubled and tripled, and that big tax cut I said was a mistake in 1981 \nhad to be undone--not once, not twice, but three times over the course \nof the decade of the 1980s--ultimately, into the 1990s. Then sounder \nfiscal minds prevailed. The budget was ultimately balanced to the point \nat which almost nirvana was achieved in the late 1990s and the year \n2000. And lo and behold, here we were in a surplus.\n  Had we been fiscally conservative--let me repeat that statement--had \nwe been fiscally conservative, we could have been good stewards of \nthose surpluses, and we could have provided for the additional spending \nthat clearly we were going to have to do, particularly in the defense \nof the country, even though we didn't know at the time that September \n11 would happen. And we had the very real probability that we could pay \noff the national debt over the course of 10 or 12 years.\n  I tell that story because that is a personal story I have lived. It \nis a story of personal experience that I come to this Senate Chamber \ntoday to tell as to why I voted against this budget resolution when it \ncame through the House and why I am going to vote against it today. \nBecause it is not sound fiscal policy; it is not conservative fiscal \nphilosophy. It is exactly the opposite. It is reckless fiscal policy \nwhen you drive revenues down, increasing expenditures, particularly in \ntime of war and the kinds of occupational expenses that we are going to \nhave to be expending, that we are already expending in Afghanistan, \nthat we have been expending in Bosnia for 7 years, and how many years \nare we going to have to expend it in Iraq, which I support.\n  It brings us back to this mindless fiscal policy driving us into the \neconomic ditch.\n  I say to the ranking member of the committee, I am just getting wound \nup. I know you have lots of others to talk.\n  I am just getting into my message, but you get the drift of my \nmessage. I know you want to allocate time to other folks. I will sum \nup.\n  I have always tried to conduct myself in public office looking to \nwhat is the workable solution, what is the commonsense solution. Most \nfolks want Government to work, and they want their elected \nrepresentatives to perform so that Government will perform and function \nwell.\n  When you adopt fiscal policy such as this, driving the annual deficit \nhigher and higher, when there is no prospect in the future anytime soon \nof bringing it into fiscal balance and getting close to a balanced \nbudget. That just doesn't comport to common sense. You can do all of \nthe legislative sleight of hand and fiscal ``now-you-see-it-now-you-\ndon't,'' as has been done by this budget resolution, but that doesn't \nget away from the hard economic fiscal reality that we are going in the \nopposite direction.\n  Do I support tax cuts? Of course I do. In the first year, I voted for \na version that went as high as $1.2 trillion over a 10-year period. \nWhat we passed was supposedly $1.35 trillion. But the reason I didn't \nvote for that was that we knew that wasn't accurate; that it was going \nto be closer to $2 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years.\n  Would I like to have those tax cuts? Of course, but every decision we \nmake here has to be balanced as to how is it going to perform in the \nfunctioning of the economy. What you want is an economy that hums. You \nwant an economy that functions, that is a robust economy.\n  We are going in the opposite direction, where we fall off revenues so \nmuch at the time of expenses going so high that it causes the markets \nto get shaky because people do not have confidence in the markets.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield an additional few minutes to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I will not take the time \nbecause so many others have such beautiful ways of expressing \nthemselves and they want to speak and I want to hear. I will conclude \nby saying I love this Senate, and I love these Senators. I love the \nSenators on this side of the aisle, and I love the Senators on that \nside of the aisle.\n  The only disappointment I have had is when this place gets too \npartisan so it cannot work out a solution, and when this place gets too \nideologically rigid so that you cannot find a consensus in the \ncommonsense middle ground, and that is what is happening to us in this \nbudget debate.\n  Someday we will learn because we will have to make Government \nfunction in the way that the people all across America want it to \nfunction.\n  I would venture that every single Member of Congress, on both sides \nof the aisle and both sides of the Capitol, can agree on one thing: We \nneed to get the economy moving again.\n  Every priority that we speak about up here--whether it's health care, \nretirement security, national defense, battling terrorism or even \ncutting taxes--every one of our priorities is easier to achieve when \nthe economy is booming.\n  The fundamental disagreement is on how we get the economy going \nagain.\n  When talking about the economy, I tend to trust economists. But these \ntax cuts that are the centerprice of the administration's economic \ngrowth package, don't have a lot of fans among the Nation's economists. \nIn fact, 450 economists, including 10 Nobel laureates, oppose his tax \ncuts because they won't create jobs or stimulate the economy. Meantime, \nthe President was able to find just 13 who support his ``stimulus'' \nplan.\n  And still, here we are, ignoring not only the better judgment of \nexperts, but ignoring a majority of Senators who were able to agree on \na smaller tax cut package. Only 2 weeks ago, this body agreed to reduce \nthe reconciled tax cut package from $726 billion to $350 billion. Yet, \nin 2 short weeks, the administration and the majority party have found \na way to game the system of reconciliation to ram through a higher tax \ncut number against the collective will of the Senate and the budget \nprocess.\n  Over the years the budget process has endured many changes, but \nalways with the intention of creating procedures that allowed Congress \nto be fiscally responsible as we plan for 10 years of spending \npriorities. The games that were played with the system this year have \ncompletely undermined the purpose of our budget process. As a result, \nwe are in grave danger of plunging the country off a cliff into massive \ndeficits and debt--threatening the education of our children, the \nfinancial security of our seniors, and the strength of the Nation.\n  Given all the uncertainty we face, this tax cut we're forcing through \nis irresponsible. If the economy doesn't improve, or it peacekeeping in \nIraq takes longer than expected, or if we face another conflict or \nterrorist act, we're going to have to find a way to pay for it. Fiscal \nresponsibility cannot be predicated on a hope that all goes right, it \nrequires planning to ensure financial stability should anything go \nwrong.\n  This is no way to budget. We are not planning for the rainy days \nahead. We're hoping that the economy gets going again. We're hoping \nthat America doesn't have to defend itself again. We're hoping that \nhomeland security costs don't mount or that more terrorists don't \nstrike.\n  Meantime, unemployment is growing, there are more uninsured \nAmericans, we're about to have more veterans, our schools are not \nreceiving the funds they need, the baby boomers are retiring, and we're \ncutting taxes?\n  Sooner or later, we are going to have to pay for all of this or, more \nlikely, our children will.\n  If any of these worst-case scenarios occur, we will have to raise \ntaxes or we will have to cut programs such as Medicare and Social \nSecurity or we will have to keep up deficit spending.\n\n[[Page S5292]]\n\n  No matter what, future generations are going to be forced to pay for \nthe sacrifices we have refused to make.\n  Our budget process and sound fiscal policy have become the latest \ncasualties of political expedience. This is not the time for a tax cut, \nand certainly not one this large.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nNelson. He is a very valuable member of the Budget Committee. He has \nbeen steadfast and resolute on fiscal responsibility. As he has made \nclear, he does not believe this budget represents that. The truth is, \nit does not. This is a budget that is going to explode the deficits and \ndebt of the United States at a time of already record deficits. It \ntakes $1.3 trillion away in revenue and increases expenditures by $1.1 \ntrillion. There can only be one result, and that is more red ink, more \ndeficits, more debt, and a threatening of the economic security of the \nNation.\n  How much time does my colleague from North Dakota need?\n  Mr. DORGAN. About 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I recall an article by David Broder some \nwhile ago. He is one of the thoughtful columnists in the Washington \nPost. I think perhaps he is considered the dean of thinkers in \nWashington, DC, who write regular columns. He said in the first \nsentence:\n\n       I am going to commit class warfare--not because I want to, \n     but because that is the only way I can describe what is \n     happening.\n\n  Let me not act as a volunteer to commit class warfare, but I will say \nsome things that others who are in a habit of doing so will describe as \nclass warfare. We have proposals to cut taxes before us. We have plans \noffered by those who support this budget that will say to those who \nmake $1 million in income in this country that we want to give you an \n$80,000-a-year tax cut. That is what they are proposing if you are \nlucky enough to receive $1 million in annual income. And if you are, \nGod bless you. I am sure you work hard for it. But if you are lucky \nenough to be in that category, the majority party plan says we think \nyou should have an $80,000-a-year tax cut. If we say that, is that \nclass warfare? Is that what it is called?\n  It seems to me it is logical for us to ask a question. When you are \ndeep in debt, should you be talking about giving the most affluent in \nthis country another tax cut? They got a very large tax cut 2 years \nago. Should you talk about another one that will go largely to the most \naffluent in the country? I don't think so.\n  Let me go to the specifics. Everybody speaks in generalities. We use \na lot of charts and we talk about the numbers on the charts. But we \nseldom go right to the resolution itself. We have a budget resolution \nbefore the Senate. It comes from a conference between the House and the \nSenate, which our side was not part of because the conference was not \nbipartisan. It was a conference of the Republicans in the House and in \nthe Senate, deciding together what kind of a budget they wanted to \nbring to the House and Senate from that conference.\n\n  Let me describe what they brought to the floor of the Senate. Here is \nwhat they propose. Ask yourself: Is this Republican economics, is this \nconservative values, or a conservative doctrine? It is not a part of a \nconservative doctrine with which I am familiar.\n  On page 5, they say: (4) Deficits (on budget).--For purposes of the \nenforcement of this resolution, the amounts of the deficits (on-budget) \nare as follows:\n\n       Fiscal year 2003: $512 billion.\n       Fiscal year 2004: $558 billion.\n       Fiscal year 2005, $487 billion.\n\n  If I keep going to fiscal year 2013, there are very large budget \ndeficits year after year after year.\n  Does anybody care about that around here? Is there anyone who calls \nthemselves a conservative who is willing to stand up and say this \nmatters? No. The only thing you hear is the chanting from the other \nside that says you know what this is, this is a growth plan.\n  Let me be the first to admit this is the financial fertilizer that \npromotes growth. The problem is it promotes growth in deficits and debt \nand nothing else. Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nreviewed this nonsense and said this is not a growth plan. This isn't \ngoing to promote growth in the economy. Don't take it from me because I \nbelong to a political party. Take it from the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office. They say it is not a growth plan. Take it from 10 Nobel \nlaureate economists. They say this is not a growth plan.\n  My colleague from Florida just described a bipartisan op-ed piece in \nthe New York Times. Former Senators Kerrey and Nunn; former Senator \nRudman; former Treasury Secretary Rubin; former Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Paul Volcker; former Commerce Secretary, Peter Peterson--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--say this is not a growth plan. This is \na serious problem for this country. We have people on the conservative \nside telling America let's spend money we do not have, often on things \nwe don't need, and let's have the kids fighting the war come back and \nbe saddled with the debt. This is fundamentally irresponsible.\n  It is not a surprise then I am not going to vote for the conference \nreport. This does not make sense.\n  On page 5, for fiscal year 2003, they propose with this budget a $512 \nbillion debt. Do you know what they will say? ``How on earth can you \nsay that? We are not proposing $512 billion in debt.'' What they do is \ntake the Social Security trust funds for that year and reduce this and \nsay: Our debt is only in the $300 billion range. You can do that if you \nwant to loot the Social Security trust fund and use those revenues for \na purpose for which it is not intended. I guess you can do that, but \nhow many people are you fooling in this country? What does the word \n``trust'' mean? Is ``trust'' a forgotten word in this town, in this \nChamber?\n  They are the ones who say in the budget on which we will be voting \nthat they want $512 billion in debt for fiscal year 2003 and $558 \nbillion in 2004, and on and on. In fact, what they are also saying on \npage 6 is very interesting. I would just love for one of them to stand \nup and say: Sign me up for this, count me in, I am a big cheerleader; \nin fact, bring some pom-poms to the floor. We believe we ought to \ndouble the national debt from $6 trillion to $12 trillion. Sign us up. \nIn fact, put on some sweaters. Put the letters on the sweaters: We are \nfor higher debt; we are for doubling the debt; we are for giving tax \ncuts mostly going to upper-income people to increase Federal \nindebtedness.\n  I would just like somebody to stand up and be honest about that. Just \ntell us that is what you are for. Instead, we get this nonsense: We are \nfor a growth plan. Growth of what? The only thing you are growing is \ndebt. Deny that. Then take a look at your resolution. Stand up with \npages 5 and 6 and deny it. Do I hear anybody denying it? I guess not. I \nguess they understand page 5 and 6 is what they wrote because this was \nnot a bipartisan conference. Democrats were not involved in writing \nthis. It is what they wrote, page 5 and 6, let's double the Federal \ndebt and decide it does not matter. I just do not understand this \nthinking.\n  This is a remarkable country. In the McCullough book about John \nAdams, he writes about how John Adams used to write back to Abigail \nwhen he was posted in Europe as they were forming this new country of \nours. He would plaintively ask Abigail in his letters: Where is the \nleadership going to come from? Where will the leadership be to help \ncreate this new country of ours? Who will be the leaders?\n  Then he would say: There is really only us. There is just me, George \nWashington, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, Madison, Mason--just us, he \nwould say. It turns out, with two centuries of hindsight, it was some \nof the greatest human talent ever assembled, and they created a \nremarkably strong democracy.\n  It is important from time to time to ask the same question John Adams \nasked: Where is the leadership? Where is the leadership going to come \nfrom? Who will stand up and say: Let me lead; let me make tough \nchoices? Regrettably, we do not see many leaders say that. My \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, is one of those leaders. There are precious \nfew others.\n  Some of my colleagues who have stood up and fought valiantly to say \nthis budget resolution will hurt this country, it will move this \ncountry deep\n\n[[Page S5293]]\n\nin to debt, are willing to assume some leadership in saying that, but \nthere are not enough in the Senate who want to say: Let me assume some \nleadership. There is not enough here. I regret that.\n  This country is not going to move ahead by leaving some behind. In \nthis plan, they say, we must increase defense spending, we must \nincrease homeland defense spending, we must cut taxes deeply, and we \nwill shrink all other domestic discretionary spending to pay for it. \nThat is not a plan.\n\n  What we are seeing in Iraq today is something quite remarkable, \nsomething that makes all of us enormously proud, first of all, of what \nour soldiers have done to liberate the Iraqi people. But then it \nbothers us a lot to see this looting all over the country of Iraq. That \nis what happens when you do not have civil order in a country, when \nthere is no civil authority and no government.\n  Government means essential functions. It means law enforcement. It \nmeans building schools and educating children. It means roads, \nproviding for the common defense--that is what government is. So when \npeople talk about let's just give very large tax cuts and we will just \ndecide to shut everything else down, I say, yes, let's cut some \nspending, let's tighten our belts in the right way. But let's not \ndecide in this country to provide a budget resolution to America that \non page 5 and page 6 says at this moment in America when we are at \nwar--the war in Iraq and the war against terrorism--when we have an \neconomy that is sluggish, when we have so many difficulties, let's \nembark on an irresponsible fiscal policy that doubles the Federal debt \nand has budget deficits every year as far as the eye can see.\n  As John Adams would ask: Where is the leadership? Where is the \nleadership to move this country responsibly toward the future of \neconomic opportunity and growth and hope?\n  When this war is over and the young men and women, sons and daughters \nof America, come home to their loved ones--and we hope and pray that is \nsoon--we have to get about the business of taking care of business at \nhome. We have an economy that is a mess. Those who make investments in \nour country, those who work for a living, those who build businesses--\nall of them want to be American people who are confident about the \nfuture because our economy is all about confidence. If they are \nconfident, then they do the activities that manifest that confidence. \nThey take a trip, buy a car, buy a home, make a purchase, and the \neconomy expands and new jobs are created. If they are not confident, \nthey do exactly the opposite.\n  This budget document takes us toward deep Federal debt, and deeper \nFederal deficits year by year. This is not a document that is \nresponsible. This is not a document that is a growth document. This is \na document that takes America backward, not forward. None of us here \nwould come to the Chamber of the Senate and say, Let's have higher \nincome taxes. But at the very least we ought to decide we should not \nhave very large tax cuts at a time when we are doubling the Federal \ndebt, at a time when we are at war in Iraq and at war against \nterrorism.\n  The easiest lifting in American politics is by those who shuffle \naround saying: I am for tax cuts; it does not matter what the \nconsequences are, I am for tax cuts. The consequences are, of course, \nto say let's do now what we want to do and have our kids pay for it. \nLet's have America's children bear the burden of the responsibility of \nthis mistake. I think that is a horrible mistake. I wish very much I \ncould come to the floor to support this budget. My colleague, Senator \nConrad, made a persuasive argument earlier today. He used a great deal \nof charts.\n  Let me use two of them. I mentioned what is on page 5 and 6. Here is \nthe chart on debt. That is where it is headed, from $6 trillion to $12 \ntrillion. That is not my number, that is on page 6 of the budget \nresolution. That is not my number, that is what the Republicans are \nproposing. I do not mean that just because they are proposing this, I \nam saying this is irresponsible. It would not matter to me who proposed \nit. If my side was proposing it, I would say it is irresponsible. It is \na fiscal policy that does not add up, and everybody in this room knows \nit.\n  There is debt every single year, unless you loot the Social Security \ntrust fund. We can make a chart that is a little better than this if \none takes the Social Security money and misuses it. But we keep the \nSocial Security trust fund in a trust fund, where the word ``trust'' \nmeans something to everybody.\n  This is what we have for 10 years. One can paint a barn with this red \nink. Red ink is all we see. It is not a growth plan. The only thing \nthat grows in this plan is debt and deficits, and that is why I am \ngoing to vote no.\n  I appreciate the time my colleague has offered me to describe my \nstrong feelings about what this budget will do to this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to address an aspect of the \nbudget resolution that we are debating today. I am going to focus on \none of the Finance Committee's tasks that is included in the \nresolution. I am referring to growth package and reconciliation \ninstruction to the Finance Committee. I would first like to put all of \nthis into context. After that, I will describe an agreement with \nSenators Snowe and Voinovich.\n  When I was thinking about the budget, Former Senator Barry \nGoldwater's words came to mind. Among legislators, you will find \npurveyors of perfection and those who practice the art of compromise. \nReflecting on Senator Goldwater's words, I came up with a new version \nof Senator Goldwater's famous statement. With a little bit of poetic \nlicense, here is the version that I think sums up where we are:\n\n       Let me remind you that extremism in tax policy at the \n     expense of no budget resolution is a vice. Moderation in tax \n     policy in pursuant of a budget resolution is a virtue. Fiscal \n     conservatism is a virtue. No budget equals no spending \n     ceilings and that equals a vice against taxpayers.\n\n  Our economy has not recovered as we had hoped. Too many factories are \nshut or running below capacity. Too many workers are looking for work \nand need jobs to provide for their families. Stock prices have remained \nwell below the ``bubble'' prices of the late 1990's. Americans wonder \nwhen their 401(k) accounts will bounce back.\n  To me, there is a clearly demonstrated need for bold fiscal policy to \ngive our economy a ``kick start.'' President Bush took the initiative \nand the responsibility. The President put forward a bold plan that \nfocused on consumer demand and lagging investment. Let me be clear. I \nam with the President and supported his proposals in committee and on \nthe floor.\n\n  Keep in mind, press reports indicated administration officials \npursued ever larger resources for the growth package. Last fall, the \nfigure seemed to be $150 billion. In early winter, the Wall Street \nJournal reported one day the figure had gone up to $300 billion. \nFinally, when the President announced his plan the figure had grown to \nalmost $700 billion. In fact, Joint Tax scored the plan at $726 \nbillion.\n  I supported the President's number at each step and support it today. \nUnfortunately, there is not now a majority of Senators in support of \nthe President's figure. Based on countless conversions I have had that \nmajority is not going to materialize over the next few weeks. As much \nas I wish it were no so, that is the political reality.\n  The reality is that the Republican caucus is split. Most of the \nSenate Republican caucus supports the President's number. My moderate \nfriends, such as Senators Snowe and Voinovich, think the President's \nnumber is too large. Our Democratic colleagues who want to be \nconstructive legislators, such as Senators Baucus, Breaux, Ben Nelson \nand others, share our Republican moderates' view. Unfortunately, there \nare many on the other side who appear to view this exercise solely from \nthe political objective of destroying part of the President's agenda. \nThey seem less concerned about addressing the needs of the people.\n  My moderate friends base their views on concerns about future \ndeficits. Those are sincere concerns. Likewise, I do not like the \nprospect of deficits. My difference is that fiscal discipline needs to \ncome from the spending side as well. I do want to differentiate these \nmoderates who are deficit hawks from those that claim the title of \ndeficit hawk and seem to be advancing political objectives.\n  I would ask a question of those hard line opponents of the \nPresident's growth package who claim to be deficit hawks. How often \nhave they offered to restrain spending? Did they offer any fiscally \nresponsible spending restraints during the budget debate? I think we \nknow the answer on that one.\n  We all need to focus on getting spending under control. \nUnfortunately, the reality is that a majority of the Senate wants to \nfocus only on the tax relief side. That is where we find ourselves. We \nonly see restraint on the revenue side of the ledger.\n  There is a more fundamental issue at stake. Republicans have a \nresponsibility to govern. Aside from 135 days in the 2001, Republicans \nhave not had control over both the Congress and the administration for \nalmost half a century. The American people gave us the authority to \ngovern in the last election and we owe it to them to produce. Senators \nSnowe and Voinovich understand this.\n  Senators Frist and Nickles also understand this responsibility. I \nwant Iowans to know I understand it as well. The people are tired of \nthe partisan games and want us to govern. That is one of the reasons \nwhy I have said, as the growth package emerged, I want a bipartisan \nproduct. Senators Baucus and Breaux have told me they want to help me \nget a bipartisan growth package. They, along with other Democrats, made \na down payment on this pledge with their support of the Senate budget \nresolution. I will work with them and like-minded Democrats in the \nbipartisan tradition of the finance Committee.\n  In this context, the governing comes down to a couple of pieces of \nthe peoples' business. One, producing a budget and, two, advancing an \neconomic growth package. We cannot go through the chaos of last year \nwhen, under Democratic control, we did not have a budget. Chairman \nNickles has made it his priority to restore the order that comes with \nthe fiscal blueprint of a budget resolution.\n  A few moments ago, I discussed the importance of the second item, the\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\ngrowth package. That is my job, hopefully with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Baucus, to get a bipartisan economic growth package out of the \nFinance Committee, out of the Senate, out of conference, and on its way \nto the President.\n  So, the reality is these two items, the budget and the growth \npackage, will not happen unless a majority of the Senate support the \neffort. Last night, a majority of the Senate did not support the budget \nresolution that passed the House early this morning. In order to get \nthe necessary support, we made an agreement with Senators Snowe and \nVoinovich. Let me be clear, without this agreement, the budget \nresolution conference report would not pass the Senate today. There \nwould be no budget and no growth package without our agreement. That is \nwhy the leadership supports my efforts.\n  The agreement is simple. It relates to the revenue number for the \ngrowth package. I agreed that I would not return from the conference on \nthe growth package with a number greater than $350 billion in revenue \nreductions. This means that, at the end of the day, the tax cut side of \nthe growth package will not exceed $350 billion over the period of the \nreconciliation instruction.\n  Now, some on the other side will characterize this agreement as a \n``defeat for the President.'' Those who say it is a defeat for the \nPresident may reveal their objective. It appears that they view this \nimportant responsibility solely from a political angle. I would say the \nsame thing about my Republican friends who use that same \ncharacterization.\n  This is not about the President. It is not about the House. It is not \nabout the Senate. It is about doing our job. It is about doing the \npeople's business. As a matter of fact, if you review where the growth \npackage started, at about $150 billion, you could say the ball has been \nmoved substantially. Why is that? Common sense will tell folks on both \nsides of the aisle are a lot more concerned about the economy now than \nthey were when we started. The reality is that we have the resources to \ndo a very good growth package.\n  We have the tools to cut taxes that burden workers. We have the tools \nto cut taxes that burden small business. We have the tools to make \ninvestment decisions more attractive. That is where my focus will be--\non workers, small business, and investors. I hope that my colleagues \nwill join me and focus on doing the people's business. They can start \nby supporting the budget resolution conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I compliment my friend and \ncolleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for his leadership, \nfor his courage, for his service on both the Finance Committee and on \nthe Budget Committee. He full well realizes we need both a budget and a \ngrowth package, and he has helped us and enabled us to do that. I also \nthank my colleagues from Ohio and Maine as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, while I welcome what I have just heard the \nSenator from Iowa say, no one should be under any illusion that there \nwill only be $350 billion in tax cuts provided for in the budget \nresolution. This budget resolution provides for $1.3 trillion of tax \ncuts. Focusing on the reconciled tax cuts is only half of the story. It \nis a very important part of the story because those are the provisions \nthat have special protection. There is a whole other part of the tax \ncut package part of this budget resolution that gets little reported. \nWe are still left with well over $1 trillion of tax cuts.\n  People keep asserting it is a growth package. This is the work of the \npeople who determine the effect of various packages, the very people \nwho are under contract to the White House, the people who are under \ncontract at the Congressional Budget Office who have looked at the \nPresident's plan. This is what they say:\n\n       Initially the plan would stimulate aggregate demand \n     significantly by raising disposable income, boosting equity \n     values and reducing the cost of capital. However, the tax cut \n     also reduces national saving directly while offering little \n     new, permanent incentive for either private saving or labor \n     supply. Therefore, unless it is paid for with a reduction in \n     Federal outlays, the plan will raise equilibrium real \n     interest rates, ``crowd out'' private-sector investment, and \n     eventually undermine potential GDP.\n\n  Not a growth package, it is a package that hurts economic growth. \nThat is the hard reality.\n  The fundamental reason for it is revealed in the President's own \nbudget that shows his long-term outlook with respect to budget deficits \nif his budget plans are adopted. This is from his budget document. It \nshows we never get out of deficit. It shows the deficits explode \nbecause the baby boom generation retires and the cost of his tax cut \npackage explodes.\n  The result is a heavy load of deficit and debt that burdens this \neconomy and prevents the kind of economic growth for which we had all \nhoped.\n  The Senator from Montana is seeking time. I yield 15 minutes to the \nSenator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, so often Members of Congress, the \nPresident of the United States, and members of the press refer to an \nevent as ``historic.'' The vote we are about to take on the budget \nresolution is one of those events. If this resolution passes, then \nApril 11, 2003 will be included in the history books as the day the \nSenate relinquished part of its Constitutional purpose and power.\n  On March 31, a little over a week ago, I attended the funeral service \nof the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. I had the privilege of \nserving in the Senate with Senator Moynihan. He was a visionary, a \nleader, a teacher, and a statesman. Senator Moynihan reminded us to pay \nattention to our history. And he protected the historical purpose of \nthe institutions of our nation's government the executive branch, the \njudicial branch, and especially the legislative branch.\n  Article 1, Section 3 of the Constitution designates the Senate as our \nNation's deliberative body. As such, Senators are the only elected \nofficials in our Federal Government with the power to impeach, approve \ntreaties, and have 6 year terms.\n  In Federalist paper No. 63, the Founders explained that 6 year terms \nwere important because the Senate would serve ``as the cool and \ndeliberate sense of the community.'' The Framers believed this was \nimportant to prevent the Federal Government from making hasty decisions \nabout matters that are central to the future of our country.\n  Let me quote directly from Federalist 63:\n\n       . . . so there are particular moments in public affairs \n     when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or \n     some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful \n     misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures \n     which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to \n     lament and condemn.\n\n  In short, our Founding Fathers saw the Senate's obligation to \ndeliberate the important issues of our time:\n\n       Until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority \n     over the public mind.\n\n  I believe we are at such a critical juncture.\n  Several Senate rules facilitate the Founders intent. First, Senators \ngenerally are allowed to offer amendments to any bill brought before \nthe Senate. This is not generally the case in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In order to limit debate and reduce amendments, either all 100 \nSenators must agree to the limitations or the promoters of the \nlegislation must file a motion to close debate and get 60 votes for \nthat motion. That means that a simple majority is simply not good \nenough. The magnitude of our decisions requires a larger number of the \nMembers of this body--60--to agree that it is the right thing to do for \nour country.\n  These Constitutional protections are fundamental to ensuring that the \nSenate maintains the role envisioned by our Founding Fathers. We must \nbe very cautious when diminishing these protections in any way.\n  The enactment of the Budget Act of 1974 is one of the very few \ninstances when the Senate has cut back on these protections. This was \ndone with another important goal in mind--reducing deficits.\n  Let me take a minute to touch on the budget and budget reconciliation \nprotection process.\n\n[[Page S5297]]\n\n  When Congress passed the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \nAct of 1974, the purpose of the legislation was to help Congress \ncontrol its budget.\n  Among other things, the Budget Act allows Congress to enact a budget \nblueprint each year. That blueprint, contained in what we call a budget \nresolution, is considered under special rules and must be passed by \nApril 15th of each year.\n  One of these rules is that, instead of requiring 60 votes for \napproval, the resolution requires only 51. After a limited amount of \ntime for debate, the Senate moves to a final vote.\n  The Budget Act set up a streamlined process--reconciliation--to make \nit easier for the Senate to pass legislation pursuant to the directives \nof the budget resolution.\n  Those provisions such as cutting spending or increasing taxes, are \ncritical to reducing deficits.\n  Thus we agreed to significantly diminish the right of Senators to \ndebate and amend measures brought to the Senate floor when done as part \nof the budget resolution and reconciliation. We agreed to give up these \nrights for a very important goal--that of deficit reduction.\n  Things changed, though, in 1996. In 1996, the Senate parliamentarian \nruled that the budget resolution's streamlined reconciliation \nprotection could also be used to pass tax cuts, that is, provisions \nthat increase deficits.\n  The budget resolution can now include instructions to the Finance \nCommittee to report tax cuts that can be passed in subsequent \nlegislation with only 51 votes in the Senate. That ruling turned the \nBudget Act on its head. Unfortunately, today's parliamentary maneuver \ngoes even further; it turns Senate procedure on its head.\n  The instructions in this budget resolution regarding the tax cut \nestablish new precedents that will expand the power of the House and \nthe leadership of the Senate at the expense of Senators. The precedents \nwill diminish the power of any individual Senator, the Senate's \ncommittees, and whichever party happens to be in the minority at any \ngiven time. This new budget resolution scheme runs counter to intention \nand rules governing Congress since Congress first convened in 1789.\n  The tax cut instructions direct the Finance Committee to pass a bill \nwith a maximum of $550 billion in tax cuts.\n  However, if the Finance Committee passes a bill greater than $350 \nbillion, then the bill will not be permitted to pass the Senate unless \nit garners 60 votes of support instead of 51. This is accomplished \nthrough a new point of order that will apply during Senate \nconsideration of the Finance Committee bill.\n  So, for example, if the Finance Committee passes a tax cut bill \ncosting $450 billion, any Senator could raise a point of order on the \nSenate floor. The point would be sustained by the chair, unless 60 \nSenators voted to waive the point of order.\n  The point of order, however, is not applicable in conference under \nthis resolution. Accordingly, a conference report that comes back above \n$350 but no more than $550 would need only 51 votes. No known points of \norder would lie against it--a dramatic change from current Senate \npractice.\n  At this point, I might say the architect of all these provisions \nwhich were designed to maintain Senate procedure and to maintain \ncontrol of the deficit in a meaningful way is now seated on the floor, \nSenator Robert Byrd from West Virginia. I pay great respect to the \nSenator from West Virginia, who I am sure right now is lamenting a lot \nof new procedures that this body is about to adopt.\n  Under the Byrd Rule, the Senate could not exceed the instructions to \nthe Finance Committee unless there were 60 votes to waive the \nobjection.\n  But there is a significant difference. The Byrd Rule applies to both \nSenate consideration of the tax bill and Senate consideration of the \nconference report. But there is a big twist. The new point of order \nwill apply only to Senate floor consideration of the Finance Committee \ntax cut legislation. It won't touch the conference report.\n  Now, you may ask, why doesn't the Byrd Rule still apply to the \nconference report? I believe that the Chair would rule that it does \napply. This was confirmed in a letter sent from the Parliamentarian to \nSenator Daschle on April 9, 2003, which stated in part:\n\n       During Senate consideration, the conference report on this \n     measure [the tax cut bill] would be subject to the level of \n     the reconciliation instruction given to the Finance \n     Committee. If that conference report exceeded the instruction \n     to the Finance Committee, the Byrd Rule would be available to \n     remove provisions from that report sufficient to bring the \n     measure into compliance with the reconciliation instruction \n     to the Finance Committee.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing to you in response to \n     your question about the consideration in the Senate of a \n     revenue reconciliation bill pursuant to H. Con. Res. 95, the \n     budget resolution currently in conference, if the conferees \n     on that budget resolution give different revenue \n     reconciliation instructions to the Senate and the House.\n       The Senate during its consideration of a Senate measure \n     would be bound by the reconciliation instruction given to the \n     Finance Committee. As you know, the Senate must pass a House \n     originated revenue measure, and therefore the Senate must \n     consider a suitable House revenue measure as a vehicle to be \n     passed and sent to conference. The Senate could consider as a \n     reconciliation bill a House passed measure which complied \n     with the higher reconciliation instruction given to the House \n     Ways and Means Committee. During Senate consideration the \n     conference report on this measure would be subject to the \n     level of the reconciliation instruction given to the Senate \n     Finance Committee. If that conference report exceeded the \n     instruction to the Finance Committee, the Byrd Rule would be \n     available to remove provisions from that report sufficient to \n     bring the measure into compliance with the reconciliation \n     instruction to the Finance Committee, subject to subsequent \n     House action.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Alan Frumin,\n                                                  Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is what the Senate Parliamentarian wrote in a letter \nto Senator Daschle 2 days ago.\n  The operative question is, What is the instruction given to the \nFinance Committee? I suggest there are two possibilities: $550 billion \nand $350 billion. The case for the $550 billion is technical. Section \n201(b) of the bill before us states:\n\n       The Senate Finance Committee shall report a reconciliation \n     bill not later than May 8, 2003, that consists of changes in \n     laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to reduce revenues by \n     not more than [$550 billion].\n\n  The case for $350 billion--that is what is the instruction given to \nthe Finance Committee--is substantive. The instruction to the Senate \nFinance Committee is conditional. The very next section of the budget \nresolution, Section 202(a), provides:\n\n       It shall not be in order for the Senate to consider a bill \n     reported pursuant to section 201, or an amendment thereto, \n     which would cause the total revenue reduction to exceed [$350 \n     billion] . . .\n\n  Taken together, the instruction to the Senate Finance Committee \nregarding reconciliation is $350 billion. I believe if you were to ask \n100 Senators what the size of the tax cut is going to be in the Finance \nCommittee-reported bill, they will tell you, it will be $350 billion--\nnot more. Everyone in this Senate, this body, knows that is what is \ngoing to be reported.\n  The budget resolution says it is not in order to consider a tax bill \ngreater than $350 billion. If the Chair rules that the instruction to \nthe Finance Committee is for $550 billion, then I believe that approval \nof this resolution would eviscerate a significant part of the Byrd \nrule.\n  The Senate will have created a mechanism to, at a minimum, eliminate \nthe effect of the Byrd rule provision in consideration of conference \nreports.\n  Under this ruling, there would be no basis for stopping further \nerosion of the Byrd rule. The drafters could eliminate the use of the \nByrd rule provision by setting a very high instruction number to the \ncommittee, and setting points of order at lower amounts at whatever \nsteps along the way were necessary to command the votes sufficient to \npass a bill.\n  For example, the budget resolution could instruct the Finance \nCommittee to report a bill costing $1 trillion. The resolution could \nthen set a point of order applicable to the Finance Committee bill at \n$200 billion, set a point of\n\n[[Page S5298]]\n\norder applicable to Senate floor consideration at $300 billion, and set \na point of order applicable to the conference report at $400 billion. \nThe Byrd rule would then be inapplicable provided the cost of the tax \ncut bill was not more than $1 trillion, an artifice. That is exactly \nwhat is going on here in this budget resolution.\n  That result is absurd, and I believe this interpretation renders \nportions of the Budget Act moot or ineffective. If these actions go \nforward, this ruling will come back to haunt the Senate. It may enhance \nthe Senate's ability to pass bigger tax cuts. It may enhance the \nSenate's ability to pass larger spending increases. It may do both. But \nit will not help the Senate reduce the deficit, which was the purpose \nof the reconciliation provisions.\n  I urge every Member of this body to fully examine the effects this \nruling will have on the Senate and on our Nation. It is irresponsible \nto go forward with this plan, and I cannot support the procedural \nscheme cooked up in this budget. I urge my colleagues to look at the \nlong run, not the immediate short run, and vote against this \nresolution.\n  In addition to my earlier comments expressing my disappointment and \nserious concern regarding the procedures adopted with respect to this \nbudget, I would like to also speak against certain funding provisions \nincluded in this budget conference report. I'm especially concerned by \nthe insufficient level of highway funding and by Title III.\n  Highway funding is one of the most effective ways to create jobs and \nsend needed assistance to the States--in my State of Montana and across \nthe nation. It is unacceptable to cut transportation funding at this \ntime when states are facing record deficits and unbalanced budgets. In \naddition to highway funding levels being set too low in the budget \nresolution, the reserve fund provisions won't allow us to increase the \nhighway program unless we raise taxes.\n  In order to build on the success of TEA 21 and pass a TEA 21 \nreauthorization bill, we must ensure that our budget resolution can \naccommodate higher levels of spending for highways and transit. These \nhigher levels of spending will enable the successor to TEA 21 to become \nlaw.\n  Increasing funds into the Highway Trust Fund is the sole \nresponsibility of the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Grassley and I \nhave been working very hard to find ways to grow the highway and \ntransits programs, without raising taxes.\n  I can't emphasize enough how the single principal feature of any new \nhighway reauthorization bill has to be its increased funding for the \nprogram, something that will help Montana and help our country. The \nblueprint that the budget resolution sets for our fiscal year 2004 \nbudget fails when it comes to transportation funding.\n  I am also troubled by provisions that were included in Title III of \nthe budget resolution. Similar to the deceptive procedures that are \nbeing used to rush this budget to a final vote, Title III includes \nmisleading findings in order to justify possible future cuts to \nprograms that are essential for working Americans. Title III includes \nfindings on waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal programs and \ninstructions for the tax-writing committees to examine these programs \nfor savings.\n  Many of the programs included in Title III involve aid to low income \nAmericans. Included in this group are millions of veterans and members \nof our current armed forces. Title III includes findings addressing the \nearned income tax credit (EITC). EITC works to reduce the tax burden on \nlow income Americans, while giving a powerful incentive to work. I am \nconcerned by a section of Title III that would crack down on erroneous \npayments of the earned income tax credit, stating that the OMB has \nfound that $8 billion a year is paid erroneously for EITC claimants.\n  I have no tolerance for people who commit fraud and steal benefits \npaid for with the tax dollars of hard working Americans. However, I \nbelieve the OMB findings are largely due to errors, not fraud. And I \nbelieve that the complexity of the tax credit and complex living \nsituations are responsible for the high error rate. Publication 596, \nthe instructions and forms for the EITC, are 54 pages long. The number \nof pages explaining the EITC is longer than those describing the \nalternative minimum tax. Many of the claims paid ``erroneously''--\naccording to the study on 1999 tax returns--are not paid fraudulently. \nOften a payment made in ``error'' is simply made to a mother living in \nthe same house as her grandmother--who should have claimed the credit--\nand is consequently marked as paid in ``error.''\n  Senator Nickles argued earlier today that we have never addressed \nthese issues before. With all due respect for my good friend from \nOklahoma, we have worked in a very bipartisan way over the last several \nyears to address the issue of EITC noncompliance. In 1997, we passed a \nprovision allowing the IRS to access the Federal Case Registry to \ndetermine if a child is qualifying. This registry is still a work in \nprogress. We also established kid-link, which as of today, only affects \nchildren aged four and up.\n  In 2001, Senator Grassley and I worked together to include \nsignificant provisions in the bipartisan tax cut that were aimed at \nreducing error. These changes include the AGI tiebreaker provision and \ngiving the IRS math error authority to prevent deadbeat dads from \nclaiming the EITC.\n  It should be noted that almost none of these changes were in place \nwhen the study Senator Nickles refers to was done on 1999 returns.\n  President Reagan hailed the expansion of the EITC in 1986 as ``the \nbest anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure \nto come out of Congress.'' It has been estimated that nearly 4.8 \nmillion people, including 2.6 million children, are lifted out of \npoverty every year because of the earned income tax credit.\n  In 1999, then Presidential candidate, Governor Bush, told reporters \n``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs of the \npoor.'' Mr. President, I hope we take these words to heart when we \nconsider this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Montana, the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, the former chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for, with great specificity, pointing out the \nextraordinary danger of what is being proposed here.\n  In order to accomplish a short-term goal, we are endangering the \nability of this body to responsibly manage the budget of this Nation. I \nbelieve this is a dark day for the Senate. I believe we will live to \nregret the day this was adopted.\n  It is a sham. It will create enormous problems in the future. Whoever \nis in the minority--whoever is in the minority--is going to face a \ndramatic diminution of the power and the ability to influence outcomes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I take issue with our colleagues. I \nregret the decision they made. But that is not the way this resolution \nreads. It may have been the way we were looking at having it a couple \ndays ago, but because of some changes that were made, this resolution \nreconciles both committees to $550 billion, both Houses to $550 \nbillion.\n  It also has additional language that says the Senate will be limited \nto $350 billion, both out of committee and on the floor. The chairman \nof the Finance Committee said he would not report, he would not sign a \nconference report that was greater than $350 billion. You can take the \nword of the chairman of the Finance Committee. If he says it is not \ngoing to be more than $350 billion, it is not going to be more than \n$350 billion.\n  But to say we are starting something different, if the resolution was \ndrafted correctly and it said $550 billion for both Houses, it did have \nlimitations on the Senate. We have the right to put limitations. We put \ninstructions to various bodies, either the House and/or the Senate, and \nvarious committees. That is what a Senate resolution does.\n  I just want to make sure people understand both the commitment our \ncolleague from Iowa made and also that the resolution--and it was not \ndone haphazardly. It was not done with malice or trying to distort the \nbudget process. We were trying to pass a budget in both the House and \nthe Senate. That is what we are going to do. We are going to have a \nbudget.\n  We did not have a budget last year. We are going to have a budget \nthis\n\n[[Page S5299]]\n\nyear. We are going to have a budget that will have caps on \ndiscretionary spending and points of order against entitlements. It \nwill be able to keep people from offering entitlements on any little \nbill that comes down that costs billions of dollars and acting as if it \ndid not cost anything. We are going to have budget enforcement. We are \ngoing to have fiscal discipline. We are going to have a reconciliation \npackage that will be reported out of the Senate Finance Committee on \nthe floor of the Senate, and I believe out of the conference report, at \n$350 billion.\n\n  I will also say, I heard my colleagues say: Well, there is really \n$1.2 trillion. Mr. President, $600 billion and some of that is for the \nlast 3 years of the reconciliation period--the years 2011, 2012, and \n2013. That will be to extend present law. If we do not extend present \nlaw, you are going to have people who are paying 10 percent, who will \nbe paying 15 percent. You are going to have people who are paying 25 \npercent who will have to go back up to 28 percent. You will have an \nincrease or reinstatement of the marriage penalty. You will have people \nwho were receiving a $1,000 tax credit per child who will only get a \n$500 tax credit per child.\n  I just mention these. Everybody keeps talking about these fabulous \ntax cuts for the wealthy. The highest income tax bracket has been \nreduced a great big 1 percent. It has gone from 39.6 percent to 38.6 \npercent. Hopefully, eventually it will be at 35 percent. How high is 35 \npercent? I might remind my colleagues, in 1990, the maximum rate was 31 \npercent. So even after all of these enormous personal income tax cuts \nproposed by President Bush, the rate is going to be 35 percent, which \nis still about 13 percent--or maybe higher than that--well, the old \nrate was 31 percent. So you are still about 15 percent higher than it \nwas under President Clinton.\n  I just mention, with all these rate reductions--I have been in the \nSenate not nearly as long as Senator Byrd, but when I came to the \nSenate, the maximum personal income tax rate was 70 percent. In my \nfirst 8 years in the Senate, it was reduced to 28 percent--a pretty \nsignificant reduction.\n  Incidentally, Federal revenues in that 10-year period of time, \nbetween 1980 and 1990, doubled. So even though we reduced personal \nincome tax rates dramatically, total revenues to the Federal Government \nrose dramatically--doubled--in that timeframe. So it can happen.\n  We reduced capital gains rates in 1997 from 28 percent to 20 percent, \nand revenues rose, and rose dramatically, because we cut tax rates.\n  President Bush is now proposing additional tax cuts to stimulate the \neconomy. The chairman of the Finance Committee said the reconciliation \npackage would be $350 billion. Colleagues on the other side offered tax \nbills and spending bills--mostly spending--that was $140 billion. I \nguess that was OK but this is not OK.\n  We are looking at an economy that is $11 trillion per year. We are \nlooking at total revenues to the Federal Government over this same \nperiod of time of $28 trillion. We are trying to move the economy by \nhaving a slight reduction of $350 billion. The House would say $550 \nbillion. That is hard to do. Some of us think it should be more, but we \nalso know we have to count votes. We also know we have to pass a \nbudget. That is our objective, to pass a budget and to get the biggest \ngrowth package we can. That has been my objective for a long time. I \nthink it would be very foolhardy to say: Well, we can only get half a \ngrowth package; therefore, we will not have a budget. I think that \nwould be a mistake.\n  We need to have a budget. We need to have a growth package.\n  I just tell my colleagues as well that there are still opportunities \nto do additional tax cuts outside of reconciliation. I encourage that. \nI was very close to recommending we not have reconciliation and just do \na tax cut, period, the old-fashioned way, without the expedited \nprocedure, Senator Byrd, because I believe we can pass one. I think we \nshould pass one. It would be amendable and debatable. We could do it, \nand we would help the economy. I hope we will, in addition to what we \ndo on reconciliation. I don't think you can stimulate the economy as \nbig as this economy is. I don't think you can do enough with $350 \nbillion. I agree with our President. It may well be we will have to do \nsome inside of reconciliation, and we will have to do some outside of \nreconciliation. Fine. I would imagine the House can pass a tax bill, \nand I hope and look forward to taking it up in the Senate. Yes, there \nwill be unlimited debate and unlimited amendments. Fine. Let's take it \nup. Let's vote. Let's find out, do we really want to grow the economy.\n\n  I hope our colleague, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nwill work with the chairman to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, he may get a budget \nresolution, but there is no fiscal discipline here. Let's not mislead \nanybody. This is a prescription for record budget deficits, for red ink \nas far as the eye can see, for the explosion of deficits and debt. This \nmay be a budget resolution, but it is not a prescription for fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  People can make all the deals they want. We are going to vote on a \nbudget resolution. This budget resolution authorizes $1.3 trillion in \ntax cuts. That is what is provided for here. And they can do this \nfandango dance that they instruct on one hand the Finance Committee to \ndo $550 billion of tax cuts, then turn around and make a supermajority \npoint of order against any actual product of that committee over $350 \nbillion, and the chairman of the committee can come out and commit not \nto bring back from conference committee anything more than 350. I have \nrespect for the chairman of the committee. When he gives his word, I \nbelieve it. I commend him for it. But let's not be under any illusion \nthat that restricts what is happening to $350 billion of tax cuts. It \ndoes not.\n  What is in this budget we are going to vote on is $1.3 trillion of \ntax cuts when we already have record budget deficits, and it also \nincreases spending by $1.1 trillion. Guess what? You are going to have \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. And they are not small deficits; \nthey are huge deficits. And they are going to mushroom when the baby \nboom generation retires.\n  Is the Senator from West Virginia seeking time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. BYRD. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 20 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia, ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and also an \nextraordinarily valuable member of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, the former chairman of the Budget Committee in the Senate on \nwhich I serve. I thank him for the time. I may not use the 20 minutes. \nI will yield back to him whatever I do not use.\n  I also thank the distinguished Democratic whip for his courtesies and \nhis characteristic accommodating mood.\n  With the final passage of the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution, I \nexpect that many in Congress will congratulate themselves for a job \nwell done. I expect a whole flurry of press releases to emanate from \nWashington about who is or is not a friend of the taxpayer, and who is \nor is not a friend of the President.\n  Those characterizations underscore just how ridiculous this budget \ndebate has become.\n  The economy is floundering. Economists are warning that it could \nbegin to contract in the months ahead, raising the risk of a disastrous \ndouble-dip recession. The airline, manufacturing, and tourism sectors \nare already in outright recession.\n  More than 2 million jobs have been lost nationwide since January \n2001, and 3.5 million workers are drawing unemployment benefits.\n  During that same time frame, the Dow Jones Industrial Average--a \nsymbol of the retirement holdings of millions of Americans--has \ndeclined by a disastrous 23 percent.\n  Budget deficit projections are soaring, with some private-sector \nprojections for the current fiscal year topping $400 billion. Yes, $400 \nbillion. That is $400 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born.\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\n  The trade deficit remains disturbingly high, with the economy losing \ntens of billions of dollars every month in growth to other nations. We \noften hear the other distinguished Senator from North Dakota speaking \non this subject, Mr. Dorgan, about the trade deficit. His pleas fall on \ndeaf ears.\n  The dreaded twin deficits plaguing the U.S. economy have raised \nalarms around the globe, with the world's economic leaders pleading \nwith this Administration to reverse its policies and trim its deficits.\n  Now the Senate is on the verge of passing a budget to authorize over \n$1 trillion in new tax cuts while we are in a war. It would be funny if \nit were not so serious; over $1 trillion in new tax cuts. How long \nwould it take you to count to a trillion dollars at the rate of $1 per \nsecond--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, at the rate of $1 per second--how long would it \ntake you to count to $1 trillion? Anybody want to guess? Thirty-two \nthousand years. So here we are on the verge of passing this budget to \nauthorize over $1 trillion in new tax cuts before the American people \ncan even begin to come to grips with just how badly our fiscal position \nhas deteriorated. This budget deliberately obscures from the American \npublic the mounting levels of deficits and debt we are accumulating. \nHave we no shame? This budget resolution is a sham. The spending and \ndeficit numbers it contains are phony. I doubt there is a Member of \nthis body who believes the assumptions that are included in this \nbudget.\n  We haven't even figured out yet how we are going to pay for the war. \nAsk Secretary Rumsfeld what the cost of the war is going to be? He will \nsay that is not knowable; these things are not knowable. Well, we \nhaven't even figured out yet how we are going to pay for the war, a war \nthat began 3 weeks ago that this administration has been eyeing since \nit took office 2 years ago.\n  The budget is in deficit. Under this so-called balanced plan, the \nnational debt will almost double in just 10 years, reaching $12 \ntrillion by 2013. That is trillion dollars, trillion with a capital \n``T.'' We are borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars and exhausting \nthe Social Security surpluses just to finance the current operations of \nGovernment.\n  I pity those three little great-granddaughters I have, and other \nSenators should weep alike. If you don't have granddaughters or great-\ngranddaughters now, if the Lord blesses you, you will have them.\n  The Congress will soon pass a roughly $80 billion supplemental, but \nthose funds are just a downpayment on the war--just a downpayment, a \nsmall one at that--on the war, and post-war reconstruction there is \nlikely to cost hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  This budget resolution includes only $75 billion for the war in Iraq \nand pretends that not budgeting for this effort will not have long-term \nconsequences for our troops and humanitarian relief efforts.\n  The economy is faltering, the budget is deteriorating, and all this \nadministration says is tax cuts will save us. Well, I have been in \nCongress for over 50 years. I have been in politics almost 60 years. \nThe easiest votes that I ever had to cast were votes to cut taxes. The \nadministration says tax cuts will save us. They append their hopes to \nideological rhetoric. Meanwhile, the poor, beleaguered, hard-pressed, \ndowntrodden American taxpayer gets stuck with bigger and bigger debt \nand more and more interest costs.\n  The Congress has struggled for weeks about whether to endorse the \nPresident's tax cut proposal. For a while, there appeared to be a \nglimmer of hope on the horizon. A number of Senators, despite immense \npressures from the White House, despite immense pressures from their \nparty leadership, voted their conscience. Tax cuts were trimmed so \nfunds could be set aside to pay for the war, pay for the deficit \nreduction, and pay for the other priority needs of the Nation.\n  What's more, the Senate sought to create parity between emergency \ndesignations for homeland security and defense spending. That was my \namendment.\n  This budget resolution effectively erases those decisions--wipes them \nout--and replaces them with a lot of nonsense that has already been \nrejected by this Senate.\n  We haven't the funds to pay for a war, and the administration knows \nthat. They didn't even budget one thin dime in the budget for the war. \nWe haven't the funds to pay for a war, let alone a massive new tax cut. \nOur only option is to go deeper and deeper into debt. How deep we are \ngoing to go is anybody's guess, but one thing is sure: Mr. President, \nyour children, my children, my grandchildren, my great grandchildren, \nyour grandchildren, your great grandchildren, and theirs--those people \nlooking at the Senate Chamber today through those electronic eyes--your \ngrandchildren, their children, and their children's children will still \nbe paying the tab many years hence.\n  We hear the cry for stimulus through tax cuts. I say bunk. Economic \nstimulus is a code word for covering your political backside--if you \nknow what the code word ``backside'' is for. Economic stimulus is the \ncode word for covering your political backside. The economy of this \nNation has been mismanaged by those who put protecting their political \nbase ahead of enacting sound economic policy. If all we had to do was \nto pass massive tax cuts every time the economy began to stumble, if it \nwere just that simple, we would have done away with recessions in the \nlast century.\n  President Ronald Reagan had the common sense to recognize the \nconsequences of long-term deficits and the courage to repeal portions \nof his own 1981 tax cut. President George Herbert Walker Bush likewise \nrecognized the dangers of long-term deficits and signed legislation to \nincrease taxes in 1990. But this administration refuses to recognize \nhow badly its economic policies are failing. This administration can \nonly stubbornly argue for more of the same--more tax cuts.\n  It was unwise, unfair tax cuts that helped to push the budget into \ndeficit in the first place. The much touted stimulus to the economy did \nnot happen. The only thing these tax cuts will stimulate is campaign \ncontributions from fat cats.\n  The budget process is supposed to provide this Congress with a \nroadmap that will guide us toward reasonable spending and tax policy. \nBut under this budget resolution, the war and postwar reconstruction \nwill not be paid for, deficits and debts will continue to pile up, and \nthe American taxpayer won't even know that the Nation has veered off \nthe cliff, off the road, until the economy is on its back--spinning its \nwheels deep inside the deficit ditch.\n\n  In the New York Times on Wednesday, Sam Nunn, Warren Rudman, Bob \nKerrey, Peter Peterson, Robert Rubin, Paul Volcker--Republicans and \nDemocrats, moderates and conservatives, former Federal Reserve and \nTreasury officials, and former Members of the Senate--all joined \ntogether to warn us not to do exactly what we are about to do. They \nurged us not to rely on unrealistic budget assumptions, not to ignore \nthe deteriorating long-term fiscal outlook, and not to enact these \nfiscally irresponsible proposals.\n  This budget makes promises to the American people that we know we \ncannot keep. This budget piles years of interest and debt payments on \nthe public and then tries to obscure them with the promise of economic \nstimulus. I oppose that kind of manipulation. I oppose not being \nforthright with the American people. I oppose this budget resolution.\n  I yield back to the distinguished manager of the bill on this side of \nthe aisle whatever time I did not use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia. As I indicated, he is a very valuable \nmember of the Budget Committee and the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee. He has said very clearly what this budget \nbefore us represents: a plunge off the cliff into unending deficits and \ndebt--at the worst possible time.\n  Here we are at war, the cost of which we cannot know, right on the \nbrink of the retirement of the baby boom generation. We are already in \nrecord budget deficits. The Senator said the budget deficit, as some \nprivate forecasters indicate, will be over $400 billion this year. That \ndoesn't count the $160 billion they are going to take out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  On a true operating basis, we are going to have a deficit this year \nof more than $600 billion. Is anybody listening? And it doesn't end \nthis year.\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\nWe don't see the deficit on an operating basis, if this budget is \nadopted, ever getting below $300 billion to $400 billion a year. This \nis the sweet spot--the time the trust funds are throwing off big cash \nsurpluses. When the baby boomers retire, we will go into cash deficits. \nThen the cost of the President's tax cuts truly explode, driving us off \nthe cliff into deficits, and deficits that are totally unsustainable.\n  I note the Senator from New Jersey is seeking time. He is also an \nextraordinarily valuable member of the Senate Budget Committee. He is \nsomebody whose expertise in financial matters has been demonstrated in \nthe private sector and public sector. Very few have been as successful \nas he has been in the private sector, and he was successful in \nunderstanding how the economy works. How much time does the Senator \nseek?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I would like 10 minutes. I might go a few minutes beyond \nthat.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-two minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey and any additional time he requires.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator yields to \nthe very distinguished Senator from New Jersey, will he allow me to \nthank him, the Senator from North Dakota, for the leadership he \ncontinues to provide to the Senate in these budget matters. I thank him \nfor his kind words. Future generations will not rise up to call us \nblessed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. I yield now to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I appreciate the time from the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. I say to both my colleagues, they are laying out for \nthe American people the nature of a budget resolution that really does \nundermine our future. Before the Senator from West Virginia leaves, I \nheard one of the most direct analogies about what we are doing dollar \nfor dollar and that it would take 32,000 years to count the deficit if \nwe went to a $1 trillion deficit. We are actually creating a $1.6 \ntrillion deficit, which I think is 50,000 years. It is very hard for \nany of us to understand the dimensions of the fiscal irresponsibility \nwe are taking on here.\n  I compliment the Senator in trying to put this debate in terms which \npeople can picture in reality.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I add my strong opposition to this \nconference report on the budget resolution before us today from a whole \nhost of perspectives. I am certainly no expert on procedural rules, but \nI have heard a description of an approach to the debates we have had \nabout the budget. It is hard to accept if this is the process by which \nwe want to bring discipline to our budgetary process.\n  The area I do understand clearly is fiscal matters, and this budget \nresolution, in my view, is fiscally irresponsible to the extreme. Maybe \nmore important than the accounting issue is it risks enormous harm to \nour economy in the short term and in the long term. It poses a clear \ndanger to the future of Social Security and Medicare, and it threatens \nour ability to provide for critical priorities, such as homeland \ndefense and education for our children.\n  This budget calls for a tax cut of $1.3 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. When we add in the extra interest costs--that is using the \nassumptions we use now of low interest rates--which are required to pay \nfor that cut, the real cut is $1.6 trillion. It raises the obvious \nquestion: Where is the money coming from? It is a question one has to \nask when doing budgets: Do we have $1.6 trillion to fund these cuts \nwithout raiding the Social Security trust fund or undercutting \nconsensus-driven priorities for the American people?\n\n  A few years ago, we had the resources and the ability to evaluate \nwhether we wanted to have tax cuts. We had a $5.6 trillion projected \nsurplus. That surplus was built on sound fiscal policies, ones that \naccompanied an extremely strong economy for many years. It is hard to \nunderstand why we needed to change policies since the economy was doing \nvery well and it had probably the greatest run in the 20th century. But \nwe felt there was a need to tinker with this $5.6 trillion surplus.\n  Guess what. It has disappeared, and we have added $1.6 trillion--that \n50,000 years the Senator from West Virginia talked about if you count \n$1 a minute. We do not have the extra dimes, nickles, and dollars--a \nblank checkbook--to fund these tax cuts or increase any of the spending \nwe might want for homeland security, national defense, making sure we \ninvest in our future so that when our men and women come home from the \nwar, they will have an economy that works for their children and their \nfuture.\n  By the way, we are looking at those deficits before these tax cuts, \nand this proposal in the budget resolution undermines that baseline. So \nthe huge tax cuts proposed in this resolution are going to be relying \non payroll taxes that are supposed to be dedicated to Social Security \nand Medicare. Then they will be financed by putting the remainder on \nour national credit card.\n  Who is going to get those credit card charges? It is hundreds of \nbillions of dollars that come with the additional interest we will be \npaying in the years ahead. As we have heard, it is not this generation, \nit is the next generation--our children and our children's children. We \nare laying the burden right out on their shoulders.\n  I find it completely irresponsible. You certainly would not do that \nin your own life. That would border on immorality at a family level. \nThis generation, or at least the most fortunate members of this \ngeneration, in my view, have no right to transfer the benefits of \nAmerica for which we all worked so hard and so many have fought for and \ngiven their lives for at the expense of future generations.\n  I do not get it. Just this morning I was at a funeral for a heroic \nyoung man in the State of New Jersey who lost his life in Iraq. He made \nthe ultimate sacrifice so we would have a positive future and to \nprotect America. We are doing just the opposite in economic security \nwith respect to this budget.\n  Beyond the raw, in my view, inappropriateness of this \nintergenerational transfer of wealth, it is also terrible economic \npolicy. That is why we have had--one of the few times in history--10 \nNobel Prize economists--hardly 10 economists can agree on anything--and \n500 others signing up to say this does not provide short-term stimulus \nand really does undermine our long-term credibility, our long-term \nfiscal health.\n  It is very simple what it is going to do. It actually creates \nantigrowth policies in the sense we are going to create deficits, and \nas the economy takes off, interest rates will rise and there will be \nthis crowding out--which has gone on off and on when we have run these \nbig budget deficits over time--and undermining of private sector \ninitiatives, and that will depress future economic growth. There are \nmany models that verify this and many people making those arguments. We \nheard that in the group the Senator from West Virginia talked about in \nthe article on Wednesday--a Republican, a Democrat, conservative, \nliberal. This is not a policy that is in the mainstream of economic \nthought, of business thought about how we are going to grow the economy \nover time.\n  Unfortunately, these negative effects of heavy fiscal deficits are \ngoing to last for decades. We have this baby boomer situation where we \nare going from 40 million 65 and older to 80 million, give or take a \ncouple million on both sides of those numbers, and they are going to \nraise the cost of Social Security and Medicare in future years.\n  If we are going to maintain those programs, we have an incredible car \ncrash coming with regard to our fiscal conditions, even before these \ntax cuts.\n  It is not as if we do not have a need to do something about the \neconomy now. I could go through the employment situation. We have lost \n460-some-odd thousand jobs in the last 2 months. I check these weekly \nunemployment numbers, and they are startling. We have people out of \nwork, working part time, dropping out of the labor force. It is not a \npretty picture. We need stimulus now. We are having serious shortfalls \nin the ability for the economy to\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\nproduce those jobs, and I do not see anyone saying that in the near \nterm this package of proposed tax cuts is going to have much, if any, \nimpact on creating jobs.\n  It might be talked about in some kind of long-term context. At least \nthere is a legitimate debate about whether that works. I actually think \nthe mainstream comes out and says that does not even work in the long \nrun, but there can be an argument about it. In the short run, it is \nalmost universal it has little, if any, impact.\n  We have lost 460,000 jobs in this economy in the last 2 months. \nPresident Bush could very well end up being the first President in 50 \nyears to preside over a decline in the total number of private sector \njobs in the economy. I do not see this in the self-interest of the \nPresident and the administration with regard to good economic stimulus \nprograms.\n  There are plenty of problems we can talk about. Business investment \nhas declined in all but one quarter in the period of time we have been \nhere. The stock market has obviously plummeted. We are now using only \nabout 75 percent of our Nation's productive capacity. We can go on and \non. There are just a series of problems.\n  So we have a continuing sense of lack of direction about dealing with \nthe economic circumstance we have, and just at a time when what we are \ndoing is pushing more of the same policies that we have been following \nfor the last 2 \\1/2\\ years. At least in the world I come from, when \nsomething is not working, you admit it, you change it, you move on; you \ndo something else.\n  All we are doing is changing the level of the red ink we have already \nput on the paper, and we are going to have greater red ink. It is going \nto hurt this country's economic well-being in the years ahead.\n  Like my colleagues, I hope we will stand back, evaluate this budget \nresolution, think about that $1.3 trillion that is going to put us \ndeeper in debt--$1.6 billion if we count the interest--and say no to \nthis budget resolution because it undermines the health of the American \neconomy, it does not improve it.\n  I think we are going to be looked at in the history books as a \nCongress that has really put us into the tipping point of fiscal red \nink for as far as the eye can see, for generations to come, and I think \nit is just wrong that we are funding it out of Social Security, funding \nit out of payroll taxes. It is an intergenerational transfer, to future \ngenerations, of the obligations. I think historians will say we are not \ndoing what it is our responsibility to do, which is to bring fiscal \nsanity and responsibility to the American budget.\n  This is a system that depends on the rising tide lifting all boats. \nThis budget, and particularly the tax cuts that are implied in it, do \nanything but lift all boats. They are targeted at a very narrow group. \nI hope my colleagues will stand up and say no to this budget and do the \nright thing. I really do hope we can reconsider this and move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for yielding me some time. I also want to thank him and let \nhim know how much I appreciate the yeoman work he is doing in regard to \nthis budget.\n  I am a member of the Budget Committee. I had an opportunity to serve \nwith him during the deliberations in the committee, and at the very \nstart the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, said: We \nare going to work in a bipartisan way. We are going to work with the \nPresident, we are going to work with the House of Representatives, we \nare going to work with the Members of the Senate. But his most \nimportant priority is to get a budget passed.\n  I think he had it right because the most important thing we can do in \nthis Senate is to pass a budget. Now, it may not be a perfect budget \nthat I would envision or the chairman would envision or somebody in the \nHouse or the President would envision, but we need to have a blueprint \nthat will lay out the plan for this Senate and how we are going to \nhandle those valuable tax dollars that get sent to Washington, DC.\n  People refer to the sham in this budget. The sham is when we do not \npass the budget. The big failure in the last Congress was that we did \nnot pass a budget. There was an attempt to try to pass appropriations \nbills and spending bills through the process, but they did not have a \nblueprint to follow. We did not have a budget. Well, we are working \nhard to get a budget passed now so we will have a blueprint.\n  I was struck by the comments that Senator Grassley, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, made when he said, I do not recall an amendment \nthat was ever put forward by those who oppose the President's tax cut \nplan that suggested we ought to cut spending.\n  There were some Republican amendments, particularly the traditional \none offered by Senator McCain, where he goes after porkbarrel spending \nthat was actually working to cut spending, but I do not recall any \nothers.\n  Then I got to thinking about when we started this process this year, \nwe came back in, we got sworn in, and the first two weeks we are \nworking on an appropriations bill in an omnibus bill. There were 11 \nappropriations bills we did not get passed in the last session because \nwe did not have a budget, we did not have a blueprint.\n  While that omnibus bill was going through, there were some $50 \nbillion in amendments that were offered by that group of individuals \nwho are opposing the President's plan. So we move on further and then \nwe bring up the budget resolution itself, and if we look at the number \nof amendments from those who oppose the budget and oppose the \nPresident's plan, there was $1.6 trillion at the desk to be acted on. \nIt ended up being about $950 billion, all spending increases, all \nincreasing the deficit, all increasing the total debt. I am speaking of \nthe 40 amendments we ended up acting on, on the last day when we had \nour voting marathon.\n  Then we had the supplemental bill that came up and now is in the \nconference committee this week that we have been working on, and here \nwe have $12.3 billion in new spending that was put in the supplemental \nthat was supposed to take care of just emergency spending. Many who are \nopposing this budget today, who oppose the President's plan, the \namendments they offered increased spending. They did not cut spending, \nbut they added to the deficit, and they did not have to comply with the \nbudget rules because it was an emergency supplemental.\n  When we have an emergency supplemental, that means that the budget \nrules do not apply. So we have Members of this body who cannot wait to \nhave an opportunity to have an emergency supplemental bill come through \nbecause amendments or legislation that fall under the budget guidelines \nthat we should pass with every Congress every year, that gives them a \nchance to get out from under those rules because they increase \nspending.\n  The only time we hear from many of the individuals who are opposing \nthis budget, opposing the President's plan, and who speak about how \nimportant it is to eliminate deficit spending is when we are talking \nabout tax cuts.\n  I think we need to have tax cuts. I think we need to have something \nto stimulate the economy. How are we going to stimulate the economy? I \ndo not think we do it by increased spending. We started our spending \nbinge as early as 2002.\n  If we look back at what has been happening to the gross domestic \nproduct, it has been growing, probably peaked out somewhere around \n2001, 2002--our spending binge started about 2000 actually, and all the \nagencies that want to increase spending always wanted to talk about how \nmuch they were spending as a percentage of gross domestic product \nbecause gross domestic product measured all the goods and services that \nhappen in our economy. There has been phenomenal growth. So it made \ntheir budgets look relatively small in relation to the total economy of \nthis country.\n  The taxpayers in this country are paying a burden that is among the \nhighest it has ever been in the history of the country as a percentage \nof gross domestic product, especially since World War II. That tells me \nwe have to do something to stimulate the economy. The only solution is \nto cut taxes.\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\nIncreased spending will not do it. Doing nothing is not acceptable. We \nneed to cut taxes.\n  I strongly support any effort we have to cut taxes. I don't think our \ntax cut package is big enough, considering how big our gross domestic \nproduct is. It really needs to be more to stimulate the economy.\n  Finally, we need to get this bill passed. The longer we delay getting \nit passed, the more it tends to delay our efforts. We need to get our \nmoney to take care of the needs of our men and women on the military.\n  I was as disappointed as anyone about the increased spending driven \nbecause of September 11, and increased spending as a result of trying \nto maintain peace in the world in the Iraq crisis. It is a need we had \nto face. As a businessman, I realize sometimes you have to incur debt \nto take care of immediate problems in the business. You always had a \nplan to pay off the debt. There is a plan in this budget to pay off \nthis debt. That is not easy to come up with.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee worked hard to have a plan laid \nout to meet what the President was wanting to see as far as tax cuts to \nmeet the increased needs, and then to have a plan out there to \neliminate deficit spending within 10 years. I compliment the chairman. \nHe is doing a great job. I support the budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I take issue with my colleague on this \nquestion of spending. This chart demonstrates the long-term \nrelationship between spending and outlays going back to 1981. This is \nthe outlay line, the spending of the Federal Government. It was over 23 \npercent of gross domestic product in 1982 and has been brought down \nsteadily. When Democrats were in control in 1993, we put in place a 5-\nyear plan. Look what it did to spending.\n  I hear the allegation that Democrats are the spenders. Let's look at \nthe historial record. When Democrats had control in 1993, this is the \ntrajectory we put spending on--down as a percentage of our gross \ndomestic product, which economists say is the right way to measure \nspending over time because you are taking out the effects of inflation. \nWe did increase revenues because we faced massive deficits. These \ndeficits during this period were huge as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  So we cut spending; we raised revenue; we balanced budgets; we turned \ndeficits into surpluses; we stopped raiding Social Security trust \nfunds. We kicked off the longest period of economic growth in our \nNation's history. We had the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the \nlowest inflation in 30 years, the strongest business investment in \nhistory. That is our record. We are proud of it.\n  When the talk is about spending, let's look at the comparison. This \nchart looks at, from 1981 going forward, the difference in the \nDemocratic alternative and the Republican budget before the Senate. \nHere is the difference. They are at 19 percent of gross domestic \nproduct, and we are at 19.3. We are both dramatically down from the \npeak of 23.5 percent in 1982. We have demonstrated spending restraint. \nThis increase in spending that occurred was totally bipartisan. The \nincrease in spending that occurred was for defense and homeland \nsecurity almost exclusively. We participated in that spending increase \ntogether. We all agreed we ought to increase defense and we ought to \nincrease homeland security.\n\n  I hope my colleagues, when we talk about the record around here, will \nreflect on the whole record, and Democrats, despite what we hear all \nthe time, were disciplined in spending, reduced spending when we were \nin a position to control it, reduced it for 5 years in a row as a \npercentage of gross domestic product, and balanced the budget.\n  I give them high marks for getting a budget resolution. But what is \nin this budget resolution deserves low marks. It is red ink as far as \nthe eye can see, with absolutely no concern for balancing budgets, \never.\n  Our friend on the other side said this has a plan to pay off the \ndebt. There is no plan to pay off the debt. If this budget is adopted, \nit doubles the debt. He is talking about a plan to pay off the debt; \nthere is no plan to pay off the debt. This exploded the debt. If they \nwant to get partisan about fiscal accomplishments here they are: The \ndeficits of the Reagan administration, the Bush administration, the \nClinton administration, and now this Bush administration. The only time \nwe have been out of deficit, the only time was when the Democrats were \nin charge and we actually not only got out of deficit, we stopped the \nraid on the Social Security trust fund. That is a fact.\n  And the deficits this President proposes are deep and long lasting \nand could not be timed in a worst way. Here we are on the eve of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation that will absolutely explode the \ndeficits, and the President's tax cuts will explode in costs at the \nsame time, putting us into a sea of red ink.\n  How much time does the Senator from Delaware seek?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the country is truly well served by having \nthe Senator from North Dakota as ranking member. I don't know anyone \nwho knows more about facts relating to our budget this year, last year, \nor in the last decade than the Senator from North Dakota. I am not \nbeing solicitous.\n  A good friend of ours from the State that was much closer to North \nDakota than Delaware--from Wyoming, Senator Simpson--used to say in the \nSenate repeatedly, in his colloquial way: You know, everyone is \nentitled to their own opinion but not entitled to their own facts.\n  It seems as though some in the Senate think they are entitled to \ntheir own facts.\n  I will repeat some things that have been said here. They are so \nconsequential I don't know how they cannot be repeated because they \nhave not seemed to have broken through the ether, not here necessarily, \nbut even in the country. To state the obvious, these are very serious \ntimes, just as they were at the dawn of the atomic age when Einstein \nobserved ``that everything had changed except our way of thinking.'' We \nface mortal threats to our Nation from terrorists from rogue nations, \nexpanding international commitments, a looming and gigantic democratic \ntransition--a fancy word for saying there is going to be a bulge in the \nretirement-age people, myself included, and part of this baby boom \ngeneration--and our thinking must now change, not just about how we \nsecure our safety in this dangerous new world but how we maintain our \neconomic security, as well.\n  And we are here today with yet another budget resolution that calls \nfor more than $1 trillion in new taxes.\n  One definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over \nagain and expecting a different result. This budget meets that \ndefinition.\n  Thanks to the people of Delaware, I have been here now for three \ndecades and I have shared this floor with many of my colleagues--well, \nnot that many, actually--who are still here today. How many of my \ncolleagues came to this Chamber back in the 1980s and talked about the \nneed to balance the Federal budget? It was a fervor at the time.\n  The President of the United States of America, and many on this \nfloor, the most ardent supporters of this outrageous budget deficit, \nwere insisting on--and I remind everybody--a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. Does everybody remember that? A constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  When some of us voted for an exception to that amendment for war, our \nRepublican friends, by and large, overwhelmingly our conservative \nRepublican friends, voted it down and said that is a loophole we cannot \nsustain.\n  The President, this President of the United States, indicated that. \nWhen we said that when there are exceptional economic circumstances \nrequiring us to deficit-spend as an exception to the constitutional \namendment, our Republican friends said no, no, we want to enshrine it \nin the Constitution of the United States of America. I think the leader \nof the Budget Committee was probably for a constitutional amendment--\nwithout exceptions, we tried to put in.\n  Now what are we doing? Here we are. Back in the 1980s we were told \nthat\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\nGovernment needs to run more like a business and like a family; that \nbusiness and families are under the danger of extending beyond their \nmeans and they should stop.\n  I know it is kind of trite to say it, but I guess we are modeling \nthis after Enron businesses, instead of what we used to know as \nbusinesses back in the 1980s.\n  It took some time, but we eventually took that sound advice and we \ndid balance the budget. As the old political saw goes, ``I have the \nscars on my back to prove it.'' It took discipline. It took some hard \nchoices that made my constituents angry and my most ardent supporters \nangry--because we cut their programs.\n  Here we are again. But this time the Nation is at war--in case \nsomeone on this floor hasn't noticed. We are at war. We face ballooning \ndeficits, far larger than anyone could have imaged, especially, I might \nadd, in the wake of our jubilation just 2 years ago about a projected \n$5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years.\n  This year alone, counting the costs of the war, our deficit, if we \npass this budget, will reach, in the unified budget, which means \ncounting the surplus in Social Security, a $350 billion deficit. If you \ntake out Social Security like we all promised you we would do, and \ndon't count the surplus in Social Security, it is a $587 billion \ndeficit this year.\n  In the face of this $587 billion deficit, or what everybody likes to \ntalk about now, the unified budget, which takes the Social Security \nsurplus and spends it, the $350 billion deficit that this budget \nresolution calls for in the face of this more than a third of a \ntrillion dollar deficit, for 1 year we are adding another $1.3 trillion \ntax cut.\n  In my 30 years in the Senate I can honestly say, from my perspective, \nI cannot recall a more reckless or irresponsible proposal to come \nbefore this Senate.\n  Where are the deficit hawks now? Where are those who were demanding \nfor decades that we balance the budget; those who said we couldn't \nsustain our economy in the face of massive deficits? Where are those \nwho were telling me we cannot let our children and grandchildren foot \nthe bill for our excesses? Where are they now? Where have all--not the \nflowers--where have all the balanced budgeters gone? What happened to \nthem? They all died and were reincarnated as kings. All my conservative \nRepublican friends--where are they? Where have they gone?\n\n  Instead of a careful, conservative approach to our finances, instead \nof caution and a sense of responsibility in these dangerous times, this \nbudget throws caution to the wind and simply dumps the bill for our \nchoices today on our children and our grandchildren.\n  A lot of people around this place, since I got here--it is a \ndangerous habit we tend to--and I hope I don't do it--question one \nanother's motives, not just their judgment. I am not questioning the \nmotive of my Republican colleagues here. I believe that, \nnotwithstanding that the rich benefit the most from this--I don't think \nthat is their purpose. It is a result of what they do. I think their \npurpose is they truly believe somehow, if they go along with this \nbudget, somehow it will cause the economy to grow so significantly that \neverybody is going to be all right. We are going to be able to pay for \neverything and balance the budget.\n  They even went so far--I will do this in a separate speech since I \ndon't have time--they even went so far as to get someone from the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers and place him, hire him with \nthe Congressional Budget Office to make a case that this could be done.\n  As I understand it from my Ph.D. economist on my staff, he ran, I \ndon't know how many--two, three, five, a half dozen econometric models, \na fancy term for seeing how this would work out under dynamic scoring, \nand still could not come up with a balanced budget. Even the \nRepublicans can't, through this new voodoo, come up with a balanced \nbudget--not this year but long term.\n  We are now in a position where we ask, when we are fully engaged on \nthe ground in Iraq in a war that is not truly over and will not be over \nuntil the reconstruction and nationbuilding the President rightly calls \nfor is accomplished, where are they now? Where are my deficit hawk \nfriends now when the $75 billion the President has requested is just \nthe first downpayment on the war?\n  Let me be clear about the numbers at the outset, before we find \nourselves under the weight of deficits that will begin to crush us, \nbefore we have to have our old ``cut the deficit'' conversation again, \nbecause I promise you it is coming up. We are going to have our ``we \nhave to cut the deficit'' conversation when reality finally sinks in, \nunfortunately probably too late.\n  In the face of all the new, massive domestic and international \ncommitments that are staring us in the face, this resolution calls for \na $1.3 trillion tax cut. The additional interest charges we will pay on \nthe increased national debt as a consequence of the tax cut and the \nbudget deficit will total over $1.5 trillion. It will bring the amount \nup to $1.5 trillion, the cost of the tax cut; over $1.5 trillion in \ndollars that will not be available to meet the new commitments we face.\n  These funds will not be available, to take one example close to home, \nto give the Adjutant General of the Delaware National Guard, General \nVavala, the medivac helicopters he needs or the civil support he needs \nin case of biological or chemical attacks.\n  Sadly, there are countless more examples of tax cuts shortchanging \nvital programs such as the hundreds of thousands of eligible veterans \nstill waiting 6 months to enroll in a health care system, not to \nmention 400,000 claims by disabled vets that are still backlogged, not \nto mention no money for the COPS Program, or underfunding nearly $10 \nbillion in the President's own No Child Left Behind education law, \nsigned just last year and heralding the President as the President of \nEducation.\n  Forget about Social Security. Virtually all of these tax cuts are \nborrowed straight from the Social Security system on the very threshold \nof the time when that system will need not just the borrowed surpluses, \nbut even hundreds of billions of dollars more to meet the commitments \nto a retiring generation of baby boomers.\n  Let's be clear now at the outset what we are about to do and the \nchoices we are about to make. I remember clearly those conversations \nwith many of my colleagues. You can be sure as I am standing here today \nwe will be having them again soon.\n  Mark Twain said a lot of things, but one of the things he said is \nvery appropriate today, in my view. He once said:\n\n       History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\n\n  Boy, am I hearing a rhyme here today. It does rhyme. It rhymes with \nall the nonsense of the supply-siders of the 1980s. It rhymes. It \nrhymes: massive tax cuts and deficits as far as the eye can see. They \nrhyme.\n\n  Mr. President, at its core, a nation's budget reflects its basic \nvalues. More than any speech, more than any campaign promise, our \nbudget reveals who we are, what we believe in, what we think is \nimportant, what we think is not. It reveals our real values, our real \npriorities.\n  I do not say this as a criticism, but my value system and that of the \nSenator from Oklahoma are fundamentally different. My value system and \nthe value system of my friends who are supporting this massive deficit \nare very different. And that is legitimate. I am in no way casting an \naspersion but stating the obvious.\n  Budgets reflect our values. In these historic times, in my view, our \nbudget policy should reflect two of our most fundamental American \nvalues. The first is facing up to our responsibility.\n  I love all my friends, Democrats and Republicans, who talk about that \nwe have to have more individual responsibility in this Nation. I just \nask the average person listening to this debate: Tell me how \nresponsible you think we are being individually. It means putting \ntogether a responsible budget that makes hard but necessary choices, \njust like they are making in their families right now, as I speak. It \nmeans doing what is right. And by that I am not saying my Republican \nfriends are doing what is wrong. They mean well, but I think it is \nwrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for 5 more minutes.\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I do not have that \nadditional amount of time. I will give him an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will take the additional few minutes.\n  It means doing what is right . . . and not handing the bill for our \nactions to our children and grandchildren.\n  By returning us to the failed policies of massive deficits this \nbudget does exactly that. It hands it to the generation of young men \nand women who are fighting in Iraq.\n  The second value is fairness--a sense that we're all in this \ntogether.\n  In a democratic society like ours, under threats like those we face \ntoday, that means having a shared sense that paying our fair share of \nthe bill is not just a partisan buzz-phrase . . . it is not just window \ndressing . . . It is who we are . . . It is what we are about. It is \nwhat this budget should be about, fairness and responsibility.\n  No one's definition of fairness is a tax cut that gives a taxpayer in \nthe middle income bracket about $250, while those with incomes over a \nmillion dollars get a cut of over $90,000.\n  No one's definition of fairness is a tax cut that gives almost half \nof all taxpayers a cut of less than $100, while the top one percent of \ntaxpayers get a cut of over $24,000.\n  Take a look at the income bracket of the men and women who are \nfighting now in Iraq--the young people who will be handed the bill for \nthe future deficits in this budget. They will be getting less than $100 \nin tax cuts.\n  Is there anyone here who will argue that is fair, Mr. President?\n  In my view, as far as reflecting our values, this budget fails.\n  It is written as if we faced no new threats to our physical and \neconomic security and it ignores the--small ``d''--democratic standard \nof fairness that we are fighting for.\n  I remember when the President was running for office . . . when he \nwas still facing a primary challenge from Steve Forbes and his flat \ntax, then Governor Bush proposed cutting taxes. The problem back then, \nas he saw it, was that we were piling up budget surpluses and we were \npaying off--yes, paying off--the national debt.\n  So what did he say? He said it would be better to cut taxes, above \nevery other possible use of those resources.\n  He did not say we should use those resources to fix Social Security, \nfor example, or to restore the integrity of Medicare, or beef up and \nreorganize the military, or build up homeland defense to meet the new \nthreats we face, or paying for his own priorities such as a missile \ndefense system.\n  At that time, at the end of the second Clinton Administration, the \nFederal budget was in surplus. We had actually paid down over 150 \nbillion dollars of the national debt, and we were on schedule to \neliminate the national debt altogether by 2010.\n  Think about that. In seven years, we were going to completely \neliminate the national debt . . .\n  If there was any question about what the government could do if it \nbalanced the budget and ran a surplus--if there was any question why \nsurpluses are better than deficits--it was answered on the morning of \nSeptember 11.\n  That morning we learned the nature of the new threats we might face . \n. . We realized what it would cost to defend the Nation against them . \n. . It wasn't long before we saw the pricetag for rebuilding \nAfghanistan . . .\n  And now we are winding down a war in Iraq that the budget doesn't \nfully account for . . .\n  Not to mention the pricetag for nation building which--from the looks \nof news reports of massive looting this morning--will be substantial.\n  In his first year in office the President promised that he could cut \ntaxes . . . pay off the national debt . . . add new funds for education \n. . . launch a missile defense system . . . and--he insisted--take care \nof any emergency that might come along.\n  A lot of us were skeptical. We thought the tax cuts were too big . . \n. that the surpluses were overestimated . . . that the future was too \nuncertain. But unfortunately it was a vote we lost. He got what he \nasked for: a tax cut totaling $1.7 trillion, counting interest, over \nthe next decade.\n  We have seen the results of that mistake--the results are right there \nin the hundreds of billions of dollars of red ink we are spilling every \nyear.\n  Simple common sense tells us we must not make the same mistake again.\n  In ordinary times, these proposals would be bad tax policy, and bad \nbudget policy . . . In these times, they are irresponsible, a failure \nto confront the challenges we face.\n  In the face of threats to our security, we are offered weaker Federal \nfinances, with deficits as far as the eye can see . . .\n  In the face of a weak economy, we are offered a tax cut program that \nis a windfall for a few instead of jobs for the many who need them . . \n. In the face of a demographic wave that will overwhelm our Social \nSecurity system, we are told to borrow the system's reserves . . .\n  Let me conclude by suggesting that at a time when our Nation is \nchallenged as never before, we are offered a budget policy that was \ndevised to win a party primary 3 years ago.\n  Finally, we must be concerned--in these times above all others--about \nthe question of fairness. When we are putting the lives of our men and \nwomen in uniform on the line, when we face security threats here at \nhome, in the Middle East, and in Korea, when deficits are once again \nimbedded in our budget, we have to pull our Nation together.\n  It does make a difference how we pay for these goals. It is important \nthat America believes we are in this war all together. We cannot send \nthe bill for this to our children and our grandchildren--returning from \nthis war--by returning to another era of deficits. And they are young \nmen and women in their teens and early twenties.\n  We cannot--in these times above all other times--cut taxes for a \nsmall fraction of Americans while we face the unknown costs of \nreconstructing Iraq and maintaining our security.\n  Right now, I think the best thing we can do is forego any tax cuts \nthat are not paid for and that are not part of a short-term stimulus \npackage, and forego spending increases, as well, unless they are for \nhomeland security and national defense because anything else--anything \nelse we do, in my view--is just wrongheaded.\n  In terms of the fairness of this, I will conclude by saying, if one's \ndefinition of fairness in a tax cut is to give taxpayers in middle \nincome about $250 this year--with this tax cut--while those with \nincomes over $1 million get $90,000, and those in the top 1 percent--\nmeaning people making over $317,000 a year--get $24,000 a year, and the \nkid coming home--with the average pay being paid for a kid who is \nfighting over there in Iraq now--their tax cut will be $100 on average, \ngive me a break about how this is fair--beyond being wrongheaded and \ncounterproductive economic policy.\n  I thank my colleague for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just for the information of our \ncolleagues--I appreciate the comments that have been made by many of \nour colleagues--I think we are close to wrapping this up. I inform \npeople it is our expectation we will be voting probably no later than \n5:30. So if colleagues are off Capitol Hill, at least they can have \nthat in mind. The rollcall vote will probably be starting maybe at \n5:20, 5:25, 5:30. So I just want to make that notification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and want to echo that \nfor Members on our side. We are very close now to being able to go to \nthe final vote.\n  How much time remains on our side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen and a half minutes remains.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fifteen and a half minutes.\n  Could I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would appreciate that. And I will make sure that I \ndo not run longer than that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate very much the Senator from New Jersey, who \nis the former ranking member of the Budget Committee, and, of course, \nhas a history of extraordinary success in the private sector as well as \ntremendous contributions in the public sector.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\nfrom North Dakota. I think perhaps my tenure as ranking member was the \nlast time we had a balanced budget. But that is intended to be a joke, \nand I hope the Parliamentarian so notes it.\n  Mr. President, the conference report to the fiscal year 2004 budget \nresolution is a curiosity at best. This piece of legislation, if it is \nadopted, will likely become as notorious, perhaps, as the Smoot-Hawley \nTariff Act of 1930.\n  When President Bush assumed office in January of 2001, he inherited a \n10-year surplus forecast, according to the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, of $5.6 trillion.\n  Now, if this budget resolution is adopted, instead of a surplus, we \nare going to wind up with close to a $2.0 trillion deficit, according \nto CBO.\n  A Republican President and a Republican Congress are presiding over a \n10-year $7.6 trillion reversal of economic fortune. And they are going \nto blame it on the recession that began in March of 2001, and they are \ngoing to blame it on 9/11, and they are going to blame it on the war \nagainst terrorism, the war in Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq.\n  No, no, no. The single biggest contributor--and everybody should \nlisten carefully and look at the numbers to confirm this--the single \nbiggest contributor to that deficit is the 2001 tax cut, which the \nPresident wants to make even bigger, even longer.\n  The administration and its allies in Congress will say that tax cuts \nare necessary to ``grow'' the economy. The only things growing in our \neconomy are the number of people without jobs, the budget deficits, \npublicly held debt, and interest payments on that debt.\n  There is an old saying: When you're in a hole, quit digging. And that \nis what we ought to do.\n  One would think that much would be obvious to the administration and \nits Republican friends in Congress. Hundreds of prominent economists--\nliterally hundreds--including 11 Nobel prize winners, have come out \nagainst these tax cuts.\n\n  It sounds like plain, old common sense to me. But the administration \nand those who control Congress seem immune to that kind of common \nsense--the kind of common sense that ordinary working families and \nbusiness leaders from the smallest to the biggest companies use every \nday: spend less than what you take in.\n  I will tell you why the administration and the Republicans in \nCongress seem to be immune to common sense: It is the triumph of a \npolitical ideology over good fiscal management. Our Government, \nparadoxically, is now in the control of people who hate Government.\n  The tax cuts are not really meant to stimulate the economy; they are \ndeliberately intended to reward well-heeled friends and create a budget \ncrisis that forces us to cut important programs and permits them to \nturn the jobs of hard-working, loyal Government employees over to \nprivate sector contractors who claim they can do things at a cheaper \nprice.\n  There's a problem with this scheme. People who depend on the programs \nwill get hurt and on the job front, we just converted a huge baggage \nscreening operation at airports across the country, with 28,000 \nemployees, to the Federal Government because the private sector was \nhandling it so poorly.\n  Republicans have a name for this ``deliberate deficit'' strategy. \nThey call it ``Starving the beast.'' Don't take my word for it. Listen \nto the words of two influential Republicans, economist Milton Friedman \nand activist Grover Norquist.\n  On January 15, the Wall Street Journal ran an op-ed piece written by \nMilton Friedman, entitled, ``What Every American Wants.'' Part of what \nhe wrote reads as follows:\n\n       . . . how can we ever cut government down to size? I \n     believe there is one and only one way: the way parents \n     control spendthrift children, cutting their allowance. For \n     government that means cutting taxes.\n\n  That's Milton Friedman's interpretation of Congress: spendthrift \nchildren.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       . . . Resulting deficits will be an effective--I would go \n     so far as to say, the only effective--restraint on the \n     spending propensities of the executive branch and the \n     legislature.\n\n  He concluded by saying:\n\n       . . . a major tax cut will be a step toward the smaller \n     government that I believe most citizens of the U.S. want.\n\n  The last part is a pretty breathtaking statement for someone who has \nnever been elected to any public office. But more important, the op-ed \npiece reveals the utterly cynical strategy of deliberately creating \ndeficits ``as far as the eye can see'' until the public becomes \nsufficiently alarmed to demand some responsibility out of its elected \nofficials.\n  I also mentioned Grover Norquist who heads Americans for Tax Reform. \nOn May 21, 2001, Mr. Norquist appeared on National Public Radio's \n``Morning Edition'' and said:\n\n       I simply want to reduce it [government] to the size where I \n     can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\n\n  Interestingly, Mr. Norquist, who is another person who has never been \nelected to any public office, denied making such a statement in a more \nrecent interview with Bill Moyers. But, as the saying goes: You can \nlook it up. I have the transcript.\n\n       I simply want to reduce it [government] to the size where I \n     can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\n\n  So, according to Messrs. Friedman and Norquist, elected officials are \nnothing more than spendthrift children and government--Social Security \nand Medicare, environmental protection and Pell Grants, national parks \nand the Coast Guard, veterans' benefits and disaster relief, the SEC \nand the FBI and all other hard-working, loyal Federal employees--are \nall things that should be drowned in the bathtub.\n  If this budget resolution is adopted, unified deficits will reach \nrecord levels in 2003 and 2004 of $347 billion and $350 billion, \nrespectively, and will total more than $1.7 trillion through 2013.\n  Excluding Social Security, deficits will reach $558 billion in 2004--\nthat is the coming year--and will exceed $400 billion in every year \nthrough 2008, and will total more than $4.5 trillion by 2013.\n  When the government runs deficits long enough, then Congress has to \nraise the debt ceiling. That is what happens. If we spend too much or, \nin this instance, cut revenues too deeply, the government has to go \nahead and borrow money to meet its needs.\n  The majority doesn't have the courage and probably doesn't have the \nvotes to bring up free-standing legislation to increase the debt limit. \nSo they resorted to a ploy: Under House Rule XXVII, adoption of the \nconference report before us will result in the House being ``deemed'' \nto have passed a joint resolution increasing the statutory limit on the \npublic debt.\n  This conference report states that the conferees anticipate that the \ndebt ceiling will be raised from $6.4 trillion to nearly $7 trillion, \nan increase of $984 billion. That is the single biggest increase in the \ndebt limit in history, surpassing the $915 billion increase the first \nBush administration needed in 1990.\n\n  The debt ceiling was under $6 trillion when this administration took \nover, and we were actually moving away from it because we were running \nbudget surpluses. If we adopt the administration's budget blueprint \ntoday, the debt ceiling will have to be doubled to $12 trillion by \n2013. That is an extra $6 trillion in debt.\n  The amounts are staggering. It is hard to put them into a format that \neverybody can understand, but I'll try: this extra $6 trillion amounts \nto $21,429 worth of debt for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  This is what is happening while we are at war and with the baby boom \ngeneration on the verge of retirement. It would be impossible to mangle \nthings so badly by accident. It can only be done by design.\n  The triumph of ideology may bring joy to those currently in power; \nthe ideologues in control may think that their ``starve the beast'' \nstrategy will make our country stronger. But the problem with \nideologues is that they shape reality to fit their ideology. It should \nbe the other way around.\n  To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, ``the trouble with our conservative \nfriends isn't that they are ignorant, it's just that they know so much \nthat isn't so.''\n  Destroying the Government will not stimulate the economy. It will \ncripple it. Starving the beast will not strengthen our Nation. It will \nweaken it, immeasurably and perhaps permanently.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget resolution \nconference report that is as cynical as it is reckless.\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Mental Health Parity Assumption\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Oklahoma and \nthe Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee on a job well done. He has \nskillfully navigated a difficult course to produce the budget \nconference report before us today. Congratulations.\n  I would like to raise the issue of mental health parity as the Senate \ndebates the FY 2004 Budget Resolution Conference Report.\n  It is my understanding the conference report before us assumes the \nrevenue impact of enacting a mental health parity law by using the \nCongressional Budget Office score for S. 543 from the 107th Congress of \n$5.4 billion over 10 years. However, I want to make sure that this is \nindeed the case because the assumption I just mentioned is not \nspecifically referenced in the conference report. Rather, the overall \nrevenue number is such that it assumes Congress will pass mental health \nparity legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand the concern of the distinguished senior \nSenator from New Mexico about mental health parity, and I would concur \nwith my colleague's assessment. The conference report does assume the \nrevenue impact of enacting mental health parity legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his \nconsideration and explanation of this important matter.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express serious concerns \nabout the budget resolution conference report. This is a 10 year \nblueprint for disaster that ignores the real priorities of working \nfamilies. It eliminates all of the gains we made in the Senate that \naddresses the real fiscal challenges we face, while setting the Nation \non a course of fiscal irresponsibility. This budget's contents and \nconsequences will hurt the health of our nation.\n  The budget agreement before us, which I want to point out was filed \nlate last night, takes us back to the failed economic policies of the \n1980's that resulted in a tripling of the national debt. It also builds \non the failed economic record of this administration.\n  Since the President took office in 2001, we have lost 2.6 million \nprivate sector jobs. Many of these jobs were in the high tech and \nmanufacturing industries so important to Washington State, which is one \nof the reasons our State has one of the highest unemployment rates in \nthe Nation. The number of people unemployed for 6 months or longer has \ntripled. Real business investment has fallen. And finally, the $5.6 \ntrillion 10 year surplus that this administration inherited has been \nconverted to a $2 trillion deficit in a little over 2 years.\n  America's finances are deep in a hole, but rather than reaching for a \nladder, this budget proposes a bigger shovel. Rather than trying to \nreverse the downward spiral, this budget drags us deeper and deeper \ninto debt.\n  The agreement is also deceptive and uses parliamentary tricks to \nachieve a $550 million tax cut for the few. It also calls for hundreds \nof billions more in tax cuts to make permanent the failed 2001 tax cut. \nAfter 2 years, we are still waiting for the ``economic stimulus'' that \nwas promised from that tax cut.\n  Despite the claims of my Republican colleagues, these new tax cuts \nwill provide little relief to working families and will have little, if \nany, economic stimulus. We need a real economic stimulus plan now. We \nneed to invest in the American workers and businesses now, not 5 years \nfrom now. The only way to get this economy going is to invest in \neconomic development and growth, not in ineffective tax cuts targeted \nto the most affluent.\n  This budget agreement not only fails our families, it will leave \nmillions of children behind. When the President signed the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, he made two promises: First, schools would be held \naccountable for their progress. And, second, schools would be given the \nresources to meet these new requirements.\n  These two always went together--otherwise schools can't make real \nprogress. But the Republican leadership in Congress and the President \nhave broken their promise to our children by not providing the \nnecessary resources.\n  I was proud that the Senate accepted my budget amendment to increase \nfunding for No Child Left Behind by $2 billion. But the House conferees \nhave stripped out even that modest increase in education.\n  Congress still has an obligation to fund the new requirements that we \nimposed on local schools. This commitment means we must provide $9 \nbillion to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act. Unfortunately, this \nbudget agreement will reduce funding for education over the 10 years. \nIt holds domestic spending on education to roughly half the rate of \ninflation over 10 years. That means that each year our commitment to \neducation will be less than the rate of inflation. This is the wrong \ndirection. In order to strengthen our economy, we need to invest in \ntomorrow's workforce by investing in education.\n  This budget agreement also falls short in supporting our \ntransportation infrastructure. We know that transportation problems \nplague our biggest cities and isolate our rural communities. In my home \nState of Washington, our inadequate transportation network is hindering \nour economy, our productivity and our quality of life.\n  When we make sound investments in our transportation infrastructure, \nwe create good jobs today, and we build the foundation for our future \neconomic growth. Making our transportation systems more efficient, more \nproductive and safer, we will pay real dividends for our economy and \nour communities.\n  This agreement provides little hope to seniors for a comprehensive, \naffordable Medicare prescription drug benefit. This agreement will \nallow for the block granting of Medicaid and the elimination of the \nentitlement. It offers no long term increase in the Federal match for \nMedicaid. In my home State of Washington, Medicaid could be faced with \na $2 billion shortfall. This will mean cuts in programs for the \nuninsured and massive reductions in nursing home reimbursement. I fear \nthis could lead to hospitals and nursing homes being closed, and that \nmore doctors could refuse to see new Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n  There are many of us in the Senate who have worked hard to strengthen \npublic health and increase our investment in biomedical research. This \nis a commitment in prevention and long term savings in health care. We \nhave seen the results of doubling NIH and the impact this is having on \nconquering diseases such as cancer, MS, Parkinson's and diabetes. Yet \nthis agreement leaves little hope that we can maintain this investment.\n  I would have to echo the comments of the Senator Conrad. This budget \nis reckless, extreme and backwards. Perhaps the saddest conclusion is \nthat this budget fails to invest in our families and our communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous course and work today \nto strengthen our economy and invest in real economic development.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nbudget resolution which my colleagues and I will be voting on this \nafternoon.\n  First of all, I take serious exception to what has gone on here with \nrespect to this year's budget resolution process. In all my years in \nCongress I have never seen anything quite like it.\n  The budget resolution we are voting on today is different than the \nresolution passed by the House early this morning. This resolution \ncreates an unprecedented ``point of order'' which ties the hands of the \nSenate by creating competing procedural paths between the House and the \nSenate for approving the size and nature of these proposed tax cuts.\n  This is like a business keeping two sets of books. That is shady \npractice for a business and it is awful policy for this Nation's \neconomy.\n  But, more importantly, I believe that no matter how you look at this \nbudget resolution it is extraordinarily fiscally irresponsible and will \nlock our Nation into years of record deficits and a skyrocketing \nnational debt.\n  I believe this resolution is profoundly unfair--providing hundreds of \nbillions in tax cuts for the most affluent Americans who need them \nleast, while slashing critical services from the American families who \nneed them most.\n  I believe that this resolution will be fundamentally ineffective in \naddressing the major challenges our Nation currently faces.\n  I was in this Chamber in the early 1980s, when we debated the utility \nof\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\nenormous tax breaks benefitting mostly the wealthiest Americans and \nrichest corporations. I was in this Chamber the last time we heard \narguments about how passing large tax breaks and accepting huge \ndeficits now will lead us to economic prosperity down the line.\n  And I was here to witness what those breaks and deficits wrought on \nthe American people: greater unemployment, lower growth, more \nhomelessness, more poverty.\n  For many of us, this budget resolution is--to quote Yogi Berra--\n``deja vu all over again.''\n  President Reagan was a remarkable man, who filled America with a \nsense of pride and optimism, at a time in our history when such \nfeelings were sorely lacking. But that doesn't mean his fiscal policies \nwere good for America. They were reckless policies that led us down the \nwrong path.\n  I was one of a handful of Senators who voted against the Reagan tax \ncuts in 1981 and 1982. And history shows that the budget policies of \nthe early 1980s were enormously destructive to the fiscal health of our \nNation--the shameful legacy of which lasts to this very day.\n  Our Nation's Federal budget deficit rose from $74 billion in 1980, to \n$221 billion in 1986, and peaked at nearly $300 billion in 1992.\n  In 1980, our national debt stood at $712 billion. By 1990 it had \nreached $2.4 trillion.\n  Well, ``here we go again.''\n  Here we are, once again, voting on an extraordinarily reckless \nbudget, based on disproven and discredited economic theories.\n  The philosopher George Santayana once said, ``Those who fail to \nremember the past are condemned to repeat it.''\n  Our collective failure to remember the past, will be, in my view, far \nworse this time around than the first time we made these mistakes in \nthe 1980s.\n  This budget resolution locks in the largest deficits in our Nation's \nhistory. This year alone, the budget deficit could reach as high as \n$600 billion. That's more than twice as high as the highest annual \ndeficit ever recorded in American history.\n  According to the Republicans' own analyses, if these tax cuts are \nenacted, the deficits over the next 10 years will total as much as $6.7 \ntrillion.\n  If these tax cuts are enacted, our national debt, which currently \nstands at a whopping $6.4 trillion--thanks, again, to the budget \npolicies of the 1980s--will rise as high as $12 trillion.\n  Frankly, I am shocked that we are about to pass a bill that is almost \nuniversally recognized as an enormous fiscal mistake.\n  Even many of the Republican's own hand-picked economic officials \nconcede that the Bush economic package will likely do little to spur \ngrowth, and could well stifle it.\n  This is profoundly unfair--tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans \nwhile all others are making enormous sacrifices--including some in Iraq \nwho are right now prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n  During past Congresses and past administrations, the American people \nhave always been called upon to share the burden that is brought about \nfrom conflict.\n  They have done so by buying government bonds and by even paying \nhigher taxes if necessary to support our troops in times of war. \nAmericans made these sacrifices with a sense of pride because they \nrecognized it as their responsibility.\n  What past administrations and Congresses did not do was consider tax \ncuts for the wealthiest Americans while their troops were in battle, \nwhich is what this administration and the majority in Congress are \ndoing.\n  I believe we missed an enormous opportunity here. I believe that we \nhad an historic obligation and an historic opportunity to set our \nfiscal house in order this year.\n  We had an opportunity to take enormous steps toward fiscal \nresponsibility, a balanced budget, and economic prosperity. Instead, \nthe agreement that we are voting on today will bring about record-high \ndeficits and will significantly shortchange families across America.\n  As I said, this resolution is irresponsible, unfair, and ineffective.\n  It is highly irresponsible in the middle of a war, and in the midst \nof a severe economic downturn, to have a budget reconciliation bill \nwith more than $1.2 trillion in tax cuts as its centerpiece.\n  The other centerpiece of this budget resolution is, of course, \ncutting crucial funding for our national priorities--including homeland \nsecurity, education, and health care.\n  And for what? To pay for a tax cut for the wealthy.\n  While offering tax breaks of up to $90,000 for the most affluent \namong us, this resolution cuts more than $7 billion over 10 years in \nservices for America's veterans.\n  As tens of thousands of our young men and women return from the \nPersian Gulf, we will reward them with cuts to their health care \nbenefits, their education grants, and their opportunities to get ahead.\n  While assuring the richest of the rich will receive an unprecedented \nfinancial windfall this year and over the next 10 years, we are \nseverely shortchanging our children's education--underfunding Title 1 \nby $5.8 billion, falling short of funding for the ``No Child Left \nBehind Act'' by roughly $8 billion, and slashing $400 million from \nafter-school programs, which will force nearly 600,000 children out on \nthe street after school.\n  While making certain the bank accounts of the wealthiest Americans \nare secure, this budget fails to provide the funding necessary to make \ncertain our homeland is secure.\n  Money has been slashed for the FIRE grants program--which helps fire \ndepartments nationwide obtain the equipment and training they will need \nto effectively respond to new threats.\n  And cuts have also been made to the COPS program and other programs \ncritical to our defense against terrorism.\n  We must attack head-on the argument that says that this tax cut is \nessential to our economic recovery. Just saying it is, does not make it \nso. Contrary to the belief of some on the other side of the aisle, \ndeficits do matter. They lower future economic growth by reducing the \nlevel of national savings that can be devoted to productive \ninvestments--because more and more of the budget will be used to pay \npast debts, not to put into productive investments.\n  They exert upward pressure on interest rates, which will mean higher \nrates for mortgages, new cars, business loans, and education loans--\nwhich serve as a de-facto tax on our hardest-working families. They \nraise interest payments on the national debt. And they reduce our \nfiscal flexibility to deal with the unexpected.\n  If we do not take action now to bring these growing deficits under \ncontrol, those who endorse this document, in so doing, help to create \nthe first generation of Americans less well off than their \npredecessors.\n  The prosperity we had in the 1990s did not just come about from one \nday to the next. It came about through wise and tough decisions from \nthe private and public sector. It took decisions to put an end to smoke \nand mirror accounting and budget gimmicks. It took tough decisions \ngeared toward fiscal discipline and long term prosperity.\n  Just 2 years ago, when President Bush first came into office, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected a surplus of $5.6 trillion over \n10 years. And now we are projecting record deficits of up to $6.7 \ntrillion over 10 years. That's a $12.3 billion decline in our Nation's \nbudgetary health and economic prospects.\n  This administration and the majority of this Congress are digging an \nenormous hole for our national economy. Their solution is more shovels \nand more digging. This does not strike me to be the wisest or most \nresponsible course of action to take.\n  I strongly oppose this budget resolution and urge my colleagues to \nvote against it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our nation is at an economic crossroads. \nThis budget resolution conference report is an important document, \nsetting out a course of policy for the coming decade. I oppose this \nresolution. I believe it takes us dangerously in the wrong direction as \na country.\n  We face a demographic shift as the baby boomers retire. We need to \nprovide for the costs of Social Security and Medicare in the coming \ndecades. I believe the elderly deserve a decent prescription drug \nbenefit. We must provide a quality education for our children in an \never more competitive world\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\nwhere a large part of our advantage is the skills of our workforce.\n  Prior to the 2001 tax bill, we were on a path to eliminate publicly \nheld debt and to meet those needs. Now, the President is again \nproposing tax cuts of a similar size despite the fact that the \nsurpluses predicted in 2001 have totally disappeared. Those projected \nsurpluses have been replaced by record deficits. We may have historic \ndeficits near $400 billion this year and next.\n  The ranking member of the Budget Committee explained earlier today on \nthe floor that the largest single factor in turning surpluses to \ndeficits has been that 2001 tax cut. That tax cut, which I opposed, is \nmore responsible for deficits in the long term than the downturn of the \neconomy, and more responsible than the new spending on defense and \nhomeland security that was made necessary by the attacks of 9-11.\n  The President's new proposed tax cuts are largely provided for in \nthis budget resolution--over $1 trillion worth. If made permanent, \ntheir cost to the Treasury will be larger than the entire projected \nshortfall in both Social Security and Medicare over the coming 75 \nyears.\n  The proposal before the Senate is radical. So-called supply-side \neconomics, manifested in the 1981 tax cut, brought us huge deficits in \nthe 1980s. Unemployment skyrocketed from 7.4 percent to 10.8 percent in \njust 15 months. Supply-siders tried again in 2001, and we have lost 2 \nmillion jobs. Now we are being asked to bet the farm for the third try. \nThe economists who are so sure that this third bet will work are the \nsame ones who predicted economic destruction when we passed measures to \nbalance the budget in 1993, which led to strong economic growth.\n  The budget resolution will produce $1.7 trillion in new Federal \nGovernment debt. That debt will compete with the private sector for \nfunds, driving up interest rates. And it puts a break on economic \ngrowth, especially harming the housing, auto and agriculture sectors.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the President's \nplan--which is very similar to this resolution--would actually reduce \neconomic growth by almost 1 percent. The CBO, now under a just-departed \nmember of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, did an analysis \nof the budget proposal under so called dynamic scoring. The \nsupplysiders say that economic analysis will show how much good the \nbudget will do. What did it show? More debt.\n  I believe that a short term economic growth package could be very \nhelpful. We could make temporary tax relief available to working \nfamilies immediately and provide financial assistance to states facing \nfiscal crisis. That would be stimulative. But the budget resolution \nproposes that only 5 percent of the tax cuts will be available this \nyear. The proposal assumes that a huge share of the tax cuts will go to \nthe very wealthy, those making $300,000, $500,000, and far more than a \nmillion dollars a year. There is nothing stimulative about such a \nproposal.\n  We need a budget that is balanced, that takes the approach that we \nneed to reduce the debt to take care of the baby boomers and provide \nfor a decent drug benefit for the elderly. Clearly, the $400 billion \nproposed for prescription drugs and other medical reforms is far too \nlow for that purpose. The total drug cost of the elderly in the coming \n10 years is estimated to be $1.8 trillion. While we should not cover \nall of that cost, far less than a quarter is not enough.\n  We need a budget that provides for more for the education of our \nchildren. This budget calls for education spending that is $4 billion \nless than the Senate measure for the coming year and $20 billion below \nthat level over the coming 10 years. No Child Left Behind is not \nadequately funded. IDEA, a program Congress promised to provide 40 \npercent of the funds for decades ago is still grossly underfunded, \nmeaning higher property taxes in almost every school district in the \ncountry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to state my opposition to the \nfiscal year 2004 budget conference report.\n  At a time when the United States is engaged in a war and will shortly \nbegin a massive reconstruction effort whose costs are still unknown, at \na time of growing deficits and rising debt, and at a time of increasing \nentitlement spending and increasing interest payments to service that \ndebt, it is highly irresponsible for Congress to engage in such \nunprecedented maneuvering and gamesmanship to try to force through an \noverlarge, unstimulative, and unnecessary tax cut.\n  The parliamentary maneuvering is unprecedented. A conference report \nis supposed to reconcile differences between the two bodies, but this \nconference report sets up a mechanism by which two different figures \nfor a tax cut can be considered. It is a clear effort to make an end \nrun around the Senate rules and procedures by advocates of large and \nirresponsible tax cuts to avoid a vote they know that they simply can't \nwin. It makes no sense, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nconference report.\n  When President Bush assumed office in January 2001, the Congressional \nBudget Office projected a budget surplus of $5.6 trillion for fiscal \nyears 2002 through 2011. But under this budget resolution, there will \nbe a deficit of $1.95 trillion. That is a $7.6 trillion turnaround in 2 \nyears.\n  For fiscal years 2003 and 2004 alone, deficits will reach $347 \nbillion and $385 billion respectively if this budget resolution is \nadopted, and this does not include the cost of the war or the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  This conference report provides for tax cuts of $1.3 trillion over \nthe period 2003-2013. With interest the full cost of this tax cut is \n$1.6 trillion. And in an unprecedented move, the amounts of the tax cut \nthat are reconciled are different in the House and Senate. The \nreconciliation instructions to both the Senate Finance and House Ways \nand Means Committee say that tax cuts up to $550 billion over 11 years \ncan be reported.\n  A special rule prohibits consideration in the Senate of the \nreconciliation bill that costs more than $350 billion, but it allows \nthe Senate to consider a reconciliation conference report that costs up \nto $550 billion. This would establish a precedent that could be used in \nthe future to play all kinds of games with the budget resolution. It is \na bad solution to an impasse and should be rejected.\n  There is also an urgent need to fund many priorities which are not \ndealt with in this budget, and those needs are not likely to disappear \nover the next decade. Those priorities include, among others: The war \nin Iraq and the subsequent reconstruction of Iraq, including a 90 \nbillion supplemental appropriations conference report coming to this \nbody shortly; the President's No Child Left Behind education \ninitiative; homeland security; a full prescription drug benefit in \nMedicare.\n  Many priorities that are important to Californians are either cut or \neliminated altogether, most notably funding for the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program. If that program is eliminated, the burden of \nprocessing and incarcerating criminal aliens will fall entirely on \nthinly-stretched State law enforcement budgets.\n  When faced with the choice between supporting a bad budget and no \nbudget at all, I must choose the latter.\n  I support a budget which faces our fiscal needs head-on, even when an \neconomic downturn forces us to make tough choices, and which resists \nthe temptation to further increase the debt burden on future \ngenerations of taxpayers. This is not that budget. I urge my colleagues \nto vote against the budget conference report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the budget that passed the Senate was bad. \nThis budget is worse. Though the budget is supposed to set priorities, \nthis budget does not reflect America's priorities.\n  Overall, for domestic needs, this budget cuts $6.9 billion from what \nwas passed by the Senate. That means less for education, less for \nhealth care, less for homeland security. It means $4 billion less next \nyear for education than what passed the Senate--and $20 billion less \nover the next 10 years.\n  This budget begins by failing our kids. It provides $8.9 billion less \nthan what was promised in the No Child Left Behind Act, which was \nsigned into law with great fanfare just 1 year ago. That would leave \nmillions of kids behind, and in the program to help States educate \ndisadvantaged children, it would leave more than 600,000 California \nkids behind. This budget also cuts afterschool programs by 40 percent--\nkicking\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\n570,000 kids nationally and over 81,000 kids in California out of their \nafterschool programs.\n  This budget fails our young people struggling with rising college \ntuition. Conferrees stripped out the Senate provision to increase Pell \ngrants for 4.8 million students nationwide and for almost 600,000 \nstudents in California. That means a loss of $165 million in Pell grant \naid for California students.\n  On health care, this budget fails to address national needs. This \nbudget stripped out the Senate provision adding $38 billion to help the \nuninsured get health care. On prescription drugs, this budget accepts \nthe President's plan to force seniors into HMOs in order for them to \nget help to pay for needed medicines. It cuts $100 million over 10 \nyears in Medicaid--putting at risk health care for sick and needy \nchildren, their parents, the disabled, low-income workers, and the \nelderly.\n  On homeland security, this budget leaves us less secure. This budget \nstripped out the Senate provision providing an additional $2 billion \nover the next 2 years for port security. This budget cuts support to \nState and local law enforcement by over $1 billion, including \neliminating all funding to hire more police officers and put more \npolice in the schools and eliminating funding for the local law \nenforcement block grant program. It provides no increase in funding for \nfirst responders--those on the front lines of a possible terrorist \nattack.\n  Incredibly, this budget eliminated the Senate provision that set \naside almost $400 billion to strengthen Social Security.\n  For highways, this budget is nearly $25 billion less over the next 6 \nyears than the Senate bill. For transit, it is over $7 billion less \nover the next 6 years. These cuts will make it difficult to pass a \ntransportation bill--a key to economic growth and alleviating the \ntraffic problems in California.\n  On the tax cut, the budget does too much for the wealthy when more \ntargeted tax cuts with broad benefits would bring dramatically more \npositive results. This budget increases the overall tax cut to $1.3 \ntrillion over 10 years. The reconciliation tax cut was increased from \n$350 billion to $550 billion. This was done in order to pass a tax cut \nthat provides 80 percent of the benefits to the richest 10 percent of \nAmericans--and a dividend tax cut that gives 49 percent of the benefits \nto the richest 1 percent of Americans.\n  I support tax cuts. I support tax cuts that help working people and \ntarget growth. I support Senator Schumer's effort to make up to $12,000 \nper year in college tuition costs tax deductible and create a $1,500 \ntax credit to help college graduates pay off their student loans. I \nsupport increasing the child tax credit and providing a $2,000 tax \ndeduction to help people pay for health insurance. I also support \nlowering the tax for 1 year on the transfer of capital from abroad for \ncompanies willing to invest the savings in jobs at home. And I support \nincreasing the expensing deduction for small businesses. But we can do \nall of that in a fiscally responsible manner. That is not this budget.\n  This budget favors the wealthy, turns our priorities upside down, and \nreturns us to the days of exploding deficits and debt. I will vote \nagainst it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against this budget \nresolution. The Senator from North Dakota has stated that this may be \nthe worst budget this body has ever considered. It is hard to dispute \nthat statement.\n  The tax and spending policies outlined in this resolution are \nreckless. There is no other word for it. Over the 11 years covered by \nthis document, from FY 2003 through FY 2013, the budget resolution \nproduces annual deficits that by themselves would cause concern in any \none year. In total, their effect is far worse. The additional debt run \nup over the 11 years covered by this budget resolution is an absolutely \nastounding $4.5 trillion.\n  That is simply an astounding number, $4.5 trillion in debt created \njust by this document.\n  According to Budget Committee staff, the budget resolution policies \nwill produce a $2.4 trillion deterioration in the budget outlook for \n2003 through 2013 relative to the Congressional Budget Office March \n2003 baseline projections. Most of that comes from the $1.3 trillion in \ntax cuts provided for by this resolution.\n  Let me quickly add that the true cost of the tax cuts is even higher \nbecause we are just charging their cost on the government credit card. \nIf you include the interest costs that arise because we don't pay for \nthese tax cuts but borrow it by running up more debt, then the true \ncost is $1.6 trillion.\n  Who will pay for all of this? As the Nobel Prize winning economist \nMilton Friedman famously said, ``there is no free lunch.'' Someone will \nbe stuck with the credit card tab this budget runs up.\n  The answer is that our children and grandchildren will have to pay \nfor all of this. The tax cuts and spending increases we pass today will \nbe paid for by our children and grandchildren. That is precisely the \ntradeoff this budget makes. Tax cuts and increased spending for us, and \nour kids will have to pay the bill.\n  The budget policy advanced by this resolution is not sustainable. The \n$4.5 trillion in new debt produced by the policies outlined in this \nbudget does not include the long term costs of the Iraq war or the cost \nof postwar occupation and reconstruction. It does not include the cost \nof addressing one of the most significant problems in the tax code, the \nexpanding impact of the alternative minimum tax. And it makes \nfundamentally unrealistic assumptions about the spending accounted for \nin the discretionary accounts, the part of the budget where we find \nspending for defense, education, transportation, and other critical \nprograms.\n  In a column that ran in the New York Times earlier this week, several \ndistinguished members of the nonpartisan Concord Coalition offered some \ntelling comments about the future we face under the deficits produced \nby this budget. This is what they said:\n\n       Congress cannot simply conclude that deficits don't matter. \n     Over the long term, deficits matter a great deal. They lower \n     future economic growth by reducing the level of national \n     savings that can be devoted to productive investments. They \n     raise interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. \n     They raise interest payments on the national debt. They \n     reduce the fiscal flexibility to deal with unexpected \n     developments. If we forget these economic consequences, we \n     risk creating an insupportable tax burden for the next \n     generation.\n\n  The Concord Coalition is right. This budget resolution is a \nprescription for fiscal disaster. The tax cut and spending policies it \nprovides are grossly irresponsible. The budget enforcement rules \nincluded in the resolution are no better. Instead of extending the \nbudget rules that have helped impose some fiscal restraint on Congress \nand the White House since 1990, this resolution rips a $1.5 trillion \nloophole in them for this year, and opens the door for unlimited fiscal \nmischief in future years.\n  It will be extremely difficult to recover from this budget \nresolution. As we have seen, our economy is resilient, but the damage \ndone by this resolution will be with us for many years. The deficits \nresulting from the budget policies in this resolution extend as far as \nwe can project. We can only hope that Congress will show more restraint \nthan it has in the recent past, and forego the opportunity provided by \nthis resolution to engage in a binge of fiscal self-indulgence.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, in 2001, at the President's urging, Congress \npassed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, which \nprovided $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. While I have \nconsistently voted to reduce the tax burden of working families, I \nvoted against the President's tax cut because it left too few resources \nfor debt reduction and came at the expense of reforming Medicare and \nSocial Security, providing a prescription drug benefit, and supporting \ncritical investments like education, the environment, and national \ndefense. A year later, the economic evidence indicates that the \nPresident's 2001 tax breaks have had little positive effect on the \neconomy.\n  The economy continues to be in a slump and, now, we are in the midst \nof considering another large round of tax cuts that would help wealthy \nAmericans. These tax cuts would also come at a time of record budget \ndeficits and would break from the longstanding congressional practice \nof not passing tax cuts in times of war.\n  The Republican budget resolution calls for $1.3 trillion in \nadditional tax cuts over the next 11 years. In an unprecedented move, \nthe House and Senate Republicans are including two reconciliation tax \nnumbers--rather than\n\n[[Page S5311]]\n\none so they can use the reconciliation procedure to pass a bigger $550 \nbillion tax cut. These tax cuts will add to long-term deficits and \nfurther impede economic growth.\n  Last week, the newly released labor market data confirmed again that \nthere is a crisis facing America's working families. Mr. President, \n108,000 more jobs were lost in March, including 68,000 in the private \nsector. There are 2.6 million fewer private payroll jobs than there \nwere when the recession began.\n  Nationally, the number of long-term unemployed rose to 1.8 million in \nMarch, far higher than the 660,000 long-term unemployed in January \n2001. There were 445,000 new unemployment insurance claims filed last \nweek, up from 407,000 the prior week.\n  The economy is in as much trouble as it was in the early 1990s, if \nnot worse. The latest study by the Joint Economic Committee shows that \nduring the last 4 months that private sector job loss in the current \nrecession is now larger and more serious than the private sector job \nloss in the 1990 recession.\n  With so many Americans out of work for far too long, the persistence \nof job losses and the clear signs of no economic recovery anytime soon, \nthe need to pass another extension of unemployment insurance benefits \nis overwhelming. These benefits are set to expire on May 31, and the \nlast time the extension was passed, it did not even include assistance \nto approximately one million workers who had exhausted all of their \nunemployment benefits and still found no work. Yet the budget \nconference report fails to provide for further extensions to help \nvictims of this recession who are struggling to take care of their \nfamilies and struggling to find work.\n  Furthermore, just yesterday the IMF, in its annual report, projected \nthat the world economy would grow 3.2 percent this year, down from its \nprevious projections. It expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.2 percent \nthis year and 3.6 percent next year. Commenting on the current \nadministration's economic plans, IMF research director Kenneth Rogoff \nsaid, ``Suppose for a moment we were talking about a developing country \nthat had a gaping trade deficit year after year as far as the eye can \nsee, a budget ink spinning from black into red, open-ended security \ncosts and an exchange rate that has been inflated by capital inflows. \nWith all that I think it's fair to say we'd be pretty concerned. The \nU.S. isn't a developing country, but nonetheless, for the global \neconomy, the tax cut . . . on top of ongoing security expenditures \nseems awkwardly timed.'' This comes from the IMF that was supportive of \nPresident Bush's first round of tax cuts.\n  With all this negative data and with no upturn in the economy in \nsight, this budget resolution also makes too many cuts to vital \nprograms and services to pay for the administration's oversized tax \ncuts. The conference agreement endorses a majority of the tax cuts that \nwere in the President's proposal at the expense of domestic investments \nthat are integral to the recovery of the economy and the welfare of our \ncitizens.\n  As columnist Bob Herbert observed in the New York Times last week, \n``With the eyes of most Americans focused on the war, the Bush \nadministration and its allies in Congress are getting close to agreeing \non a set of budget policies that will take an awful toll on the poor, \nthe young, the elderly, the disabled and others in need of assistance \nand support from their government . . . It mugs the poor and the \nhelpless while giving unstintingly to the rich.'' The Senate budget \nincludes a reduction of approximately $168 billion in funding for \ndomestic discretionary programs in fiscal year 2004. Approximately two-\nfifths of this funding consists of grants in aid to State and local \ngovernments. These cuts will worsen the already severe budget crises \nthat States are facing.\n  This is a restrictive funding level for domestic discretionary \nspending, given the continued needs in the homeland security area, the \nunderfunding of the education reforms in the No Child Left Behind Act, \nneed for aid to the States, and the severe structural burdens facing \nMedicare and Social Security.\n  The administration and the majority need to stop pushing economic \nplans that reward the wealthiest Americans and abandon fiscal \nresponsibility. Instead, they need to support real economic stimulus \nthat would provide immediate one-time tax relief for working families, \nextend unemployment benefits and provide desperately needed fiscal \nrelief to the States.\n  Lastly, this conference report includes a gross misuse of the \nreconciliation process which was intended to facilitate deficit \nreduction not deficit increases. Due to the majority's obsession with \nsupersized tax cuts, they have devised a heretofore, unheralded \nmechanism, to subvert the Senate's right to amend legislation. Indeed, \nwhile many of my colleagues can say that while the Senate can enact \nonly $350 tax cut, the sad truth is that this contrivance paves the way \nfor a tax cut that is much larger than many of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle are willing to support.\n  The budget before us is lamentable, and I only hope that those who \nsupport it today will reassess their positions in the weeks ahead.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is not a conference report, because \nwe never conferred. This is not a concurrent resolution, because we \nnever concurred. To stimulate the economy, the Republicans doubled the \ndebt from $6 trillion to $12 trillion, which will wreck the economy.\n  This budget is a fraud.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise in support of this conference \nagreement on the fiscal year 2004 budget.\n  Before I begin, I first want to commend the President for his \nleadership in initiating the debate on the necessity of stimulating our \neconomy. From the beginning, I have shared his belief that we need to \ntake steps in the short-term to strengthen our economic outlook, and \nthe conference report before us provides us the opportunity to do just \nthat.\n  I thank our majority leader for his unflagging perseverance in seeing \nthis budget through to a final passage of this conference report. He \nhas shown incredible patience, understanding of the various issues and \nviewpoints, and he has been willing to work tirelessly to ensure a \nbudget resolution around which we can coalesce.\n  And in that same light, I want to commend my friend and colleague, \nChairman Nickles, for his Herculean efforts in forging and producing \nthis budget. As I have said in the past, as a former member of the \ncommittee I know what goes into this process and Chairman Nickles has \ntried to move Heaven and Earth to avoid the colossal failure we had \nlast year under Democrat control when we failed to pass a budget for \nthe first time. And I did not want to see a repeat performance; that \nwould have been exactly the wrong message and completely counter to the \ninterests of our Nation at a time when we are experiencing a troubled \neconomy and when we are at war in Iraq.\n  The bottom line is, the budget is critical, because it imposes \nstructure and discipline and defines the priorities in Federal \nexpenditures. That should be a fundamental responsibility of Congress, \nand it was a regrettable lapse of leadership last year that we failed \nto pass such a resolution. So I want to thank Chairman Nickles for his \ncommitment to getting this done.\n  I also want to thank Senator Grassley for his willingness to listen \nand to work toward a resolution of the concerns I have raised along \nwith Senator Voinovich about the size of the tax cut package. It is \nbecause of their dedicated efforts--and let me say that Senator \nVoinovich has been steadfast in holding to his deeply held principles--\nthat we have reached the compromise I will now discuss. In fact, it \nwould be entirely accurate to say that without Senator Grassley, we \nwouldn't have a budget.\n  I will be voting today for the budget resolution conference report we \nhave before us because the resolution--in concert with commitments I \nhave secured from Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and from Majority \nLeader Frist--and I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nmajority leader detailing that commitment be placed in the Record--will \nboth ensure that we impose on Federal spending the discipline of a \nbudget blueprint, and that tax cuts will be limited to $350 billion \nthrough the Senate Finance Committee and floor consideration of any \ngrowth package, including any final conference report.\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\n  These are the two critical goals I have been working to achieve for \nthe past 6 weeks of this budget debate--and I will ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the letter I signed with Senators Voinovich, \nBreaux, and Baucus calling for a limited tax cut of $350 billion as \npart of reconciliation be printed in the record. I am pleased that, \nwith the assurances I have been given from Senator Grassley and Senator \nFrist both men of their word--my goals have been fulfilled.\n  One of the functions of our letter was to prompt a bipartisan budget \nresolution, and today that is what we have before us. Senator Grassley \nhas said very eloquently that the people want us to govern--that is our \nobligation, and I think by coming to this compromise agreement we have \nfulfilled that responsibility when it comes to the budget.\n  With the commitment we received, the budget provides funds for a \nstrong, reasonably sized economic stimulus package that can create jobs \nand opportunities in the short term. At the same time, this agreement \nwill assure that this tax package will be limited to $350 billion--an \namount we believe is the right size to achieve this growth without \nballooning budget deficits. Let it be remembered that Senator Daschle \nwas proposing $112 billion and many in this Chamber wanted nothing at \nall, so $350 billion is a significant victory.\n  I want to be clear about what this budget does. The budget agreement \nprovides instructions for both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives to write growth packages not to exceed $550 billion, \nand the Senate is further instructed that no tax package under budget \nreconciliation rules may be more than $350 billion.\n  To guarantee our position, I have secured language and commitments \nthat neither the tax reconciliation bill reported by the Senate Finance \nCommittee nor the tax bill voted out of the Senate may be more than \n$350 billion unless additional tax cuts are specifically offset or paid \nfor. And, importantly, Senator Grassley, the Finance Committee \nchairman, who will also chair the conference committee on the tax \nreconciliation bill, has provided his personal commitment that Senate \nconferees will not support reporting of a bill with tax cuts greater \nthan $350 billion, unless additional tax cuts are specifically offset \nor paid for.\n  Once again, just as I trusted the word of the majority leader as we \nagreed to address extraneous special interest provisions in homeland \nsecurity legislation last fall, so I trust the good word of Chairman \nGrassley and Majority Leader Frist. Moreover, this agreement provides \nwritten confirmation that the Senate will at no point consider the \nHouse-passed legislation, except when it is necessary to be sent to \nconference, and provides the protections we have sought to ensure a \nresponsibly sized tax package.\n  I feel strongly about my commitment to a lower tax cut, and this \nagreement reflects the principles on which I have held firm throughout \nconsideration of the budget.\n  As I said, from the start I have shared the President's belief that \neconomic stimulus is demanded by the wavering conditions of our \neconomy, which was already on shaky ground before the horrific attacks \nof September 11. We've lost 2.3 million jobs since the recession began \nin March 2001--nearly half a million in the past 2 months alone. And \ncomparing today's employment situation with the one prevailing after \nthe 1990-1991 recession--which was followed by a ``jobless recovery''--\nCharles McMillion, chief economist of MGB Information Services in \nWashington, recently told the Financial Times, ``The current jobless \nrecovery has now lasted longer and is far worse'' than the aftermath of \nthe 90-91 downturn.\n  Just this week, the Business Roundtable released results of a survey \nof CEOs on the economy that revealed a more pessimistic outlook for the \neconomy than just 6 months ago. For example, CEOs were very concerned \nabout employment growth and weak consumer demand. According to the \nsurvey, CEOs, on average, expect GDP growth to be only around 2.2 \npercent over the next 6 months.\n  We can't afford another ``jobless recovery'' like we had just over a \ndecade ago--or, worse, a ``double-dip'' recession. At the same time, \nwith the demands of our action in Iraq, with the need to fund pressing \ndomestic issues such as the necessity for prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors and for strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and \nwith the deficits we have already seen in a dramatic turnabout from 4 \nyears of surpluses--we also cannot allow ourselves to be drawn into \nanother downward spiral of perpetual deficits.\n  This is a matter of principle, and one upon which I have stood since \nI first came to Congress--that a cycle of deficits must not be allowed \nto continue. If we act wisely, I believe we can provide significant tax \nrelief to help taxpayers and business to get the economy moving, while \nalso achieving fiscal discipline.\n  This budget is a responsible, well-balanced approach to stimulate our \neconomy in the short term, and to protect our economy from the effects \nof unnecessary deficits in the long term. As we continue to confront \nglobal uncertainties that have cast a shadow over a domestic economy \nalready on shaky ground even before September 11, I believe an \nimmediate growth package is absolutely essential to help create both \nconsumer demand and new jobs. As we move to the next phase in this \nprocess, I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley and my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee to craft such a plan.\n  We must work to maintain a carefully calibrated plan that will \nproduce short-term benefits for our economy, without jeopardizing long-\nterm fiscal responsibility and economic growth. By capping the size at \n$350 billion, I believe we can do so without risking the types of \ndeficits that could come from deficit-financing of long-term tax cuts.\n  At the same time, we will also pass a budget, which I believe is \ncritical because it imposes structure and discipline on Congress, and \ndefines the priorities in Federal expenditures. This is a fundamental \nresponsibility of the Congress, and I am pleased we will be successful \nin passing a budget this year.\n  So I believe we should have a growth package in this budget. At the \nsame time, given these unprecedented times and the confluence of \ncircumstances by which they are defined--the economic uncertainties, \nthe war in Iraq, new projections of higher budget deficits, the \ndomestic fiscal challenges that lurk on the horizon with Social \nSecurity and Medicare, our responsibility to carefully evaluate the \nimpact of any tax reductions and spending increases in this budget is \nthat much greater.\n  That is the context in which we must shape a budget--indeed our \nprojected deficits are at historic levels. What is required in this \nbudget resolution is a careful calibration if we are to produce short-\nterm benefit for our economy without jeopardizing long-term fiscal \nresponsibility and economic growth. And let there be no mistake, just \nas the need for short-term economic stimulus is compelling, so, too, is \nthe need to return to balanced budgets and indeed surpluses as soon as \npossible.\n  What it all comes back to is setting priorities. That is what we \ntalked about all those years we were fighting for balanced budgets. We \nare here to draw lines and make distinctions so as not to exacerbate \nour economic situation and thereby lead to even greater problems down \nthe road.\n  A look at the administration's budget shows substantial out-year \ndeficits, even if productivity growth turns out to be higher than \nexpected. If growth is just ``average'' we still face unsustainable \nbudget deficits. This year, given the slow economy and the war costs, \nour deficits could be near 4 percent of GNP.\n  Recently, the Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees reported \nthat between 2010 and 2030, the costs of these programs will increase \nrapidly, with annual costs exceeding dedicated tax revenues beginning a \ndozen years before this `baby boom' wave is over. And the trustees \nestimate Medicare will become insolvent 4 years earlier than predicted \njust last year. Importantly, these estimates do not include the \naddition of a necessary prescription drug benefit.\n  The bottom line is, we cannot diminish our ability to strengthen \nSocial Security and Medicare. We were looking to the window of \nopportunity presented by a return to surpluses to prepare for these \nfuture challenges. But as we have\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\nseen over the past 18 months, projections of surpluses or deficits can \nchange dramatically, and that opportunity has evaporated. Given the \nuncertainties we are facing today, given the challenges we face \ntomorrow--we must exercise caution now so that we do not exacerbate \nlong-term deficits in the years to come, and threaten our ability to \naddress America's long-term priorities in the future.\n  Once again, the President was right to offer a growth plan. But, we \ncannot ignore the impact of all of the challenges we face--the cost of \nwar, higher defense spending, the retirement of baby boomers, higher \nhealth care spending, and homeland security.\n  This agreement gives us the chance to unite behind a consensus \nfigure. A figure that is ``right-sized'', a figure that strikes the \nright balance and one that will allow us to stimulate the economy in \nthe short-term. It represents the most effective and responsible way to \nstimulate the economy, while advancing a growth package that can \nachieve the strongest bipartisan support.\n  If we are to restore balance to the Federal budget, we must exercise \nfiscal discipline. This budget provides an important step in that \ndirection and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join \nme in supporting this conference agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters that I referred to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This will be a further clarification to \n     the letter I sent to you earlier today.\n       It once again confirms my conversation with you and Senator \n     Baucus concerning the consideration of a possible revenue \n     reconciliation bill.\n       Should the Congress adopt a conference report for the FY \n     2004 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, and should that \n     conference report include reconciliation instructions to your \n     Committee to report changes in laws to achieve tax reductions \n     of no more than $350 billion, your Committee will not be by-\n     passed, it will be responsible for reporting that \n     reconciliation bill, and that bill will be the vehicle \n     brought to the Senate floor for consideration.\n       After the Senate reconciliation bill has been advanced to \n     third reading, you or I will move to the consideration of the \n     House a bill, solely for the purpose of amending it with the \n     Senate measure. I will prevent any effort including any \n     unanimous consent requests to move to the House bill except \n     for this purpose.\n       This is the historic and correct procedure for \n     consideration of such legislation in the Senate. Further, \n     both as a member of the Committee and as Leader, I look \n     forward to working with you to comply with any reconciliation \n     instructions to your Committee.\n           Sincerly yours,\n                                                 Bill Frist, M.D.,\n     Majority Leader.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Daschle: \n     With the international challenges our nation faces, including \n     a possible military engagement with Iraq, continuing tension \n     on the Korean Peninsula, and the ongoing war on terrorism, \n     coupled with sluggish economic growth, we believe it is \n     critical a budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2004 (FY2004) be \n     enacted this year. We are committed to working in a \n     bipartisan manner to this end.\n       We believe that our nation would benefit from an economic \n     growth package that would effectively and immediately create \n     jobs and encourage investment. We appreciate President Bush's \n     leadership in identifying this need and beginning this \n     important debate with his economic growth proposal.\n       Given these international uncertainties and debt and \n     deficit projections, we believe that any growth package that \n     is enacted through reconciliation this year must be limited \n     to $350 billion deficit financing over 10 years and any tax \n     cuts beyond this level must be offset. All signatories to \n     this letter are committed to defeating floor amendments that \n     would reduce or increase this $350 billion amount.\n       We look forward to working with you on a bipartisan budget.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Breaux.\n     Max Baucus.\n     Olympia Snowe.\n     George V. Voinovich.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I had hoped to be here today to say that \nthe Congress is enacting a blueprint for spending that would improve \neducation, invest in our transportation and water infrastructure, and \ndeal prudently with our ever-increasing projections of budget deficits. \nUnfortunately, this budget will accomplish none of these goals, and may \nin fact put this country in dire fiscal straits just as the baby boom \ngeneration places new and unprecedented demands on our Social Security \nand Medicare systems.\n  Let me begin by saying that I oppose the tax cuts authorized by this \nbudget conference agreement. To call this a conference ``agreement'' is \na misnomer; there has been no agreement. In the House, the tax cut \nallowed under the reconciliation procedure will be $550 billion; in the \nSenate, $350 billion. If the conferees on the tax bill ultimately agree \nto a cut larger than the Senate figure, the vote we take on that \nconference report will be a vote on tax cuts never approved by the \nFinance Committee or the full Senate.\n  Perhaps more importantly, this is not the right time for a tax cut. \nWhen we passed the 2001 tax cut, we were facing a 10-year budget \nsurplus of $5.6 trillion. It made sense to return some of that \nprojected surplus in the form of a tax cut. But things have changed, \nand changed dramatically. Unless there are dramatic cuts in spending--\nwhich no one realistically expects--we are facing deficits as far as \nthe eye can see. On top of that, we face the unknown costs of the war \nin Iraq and its aftermath. It is irresponsible to cut taxes under these \ncircumstances.\n  Perhaps some sort of tax cut could be justified if it stimulated the \neconomy or if it furthered important national interests like education \nor health care. But the tax cuts being contemplated in this budget will \ngo overwhelmingly to those at the top of the economic ladder--those who \nare least in need of help. These tax cuts will mean bigger deficits and \na higher national debt. The costs for this folly will be borne for \nyears by our children and grandchildren. And areas of national need \nwill get short shrift.\n  Our Nation's transportation needs get short shrift in this budget.\n  As ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am \nvery disappointed by the treatment afforded to our Nation's roads, \nbridges, and transit systems in the conference report.\n  Just over a week ago, 79 Senators recognized the importance of our \nNation's infrastructure and the vast need for investment by supporting \na bipartisan amendment to increase surface transportation spending.\n  What has come back from conference is a dramatic cut in funding from \nthe levels put forward by the Senate. We agreed in this body to highway \nprogram contract authority for reauthorization of $255 billion. The \nconferees set the level at $231 billion. While presented as a simple \n``split-the-difference'' compromise with the House, the conference \ninserted provisions that will in fact reduce funding to levels only \nmarginally greater than those authorized for TEA-21 and would barely \ncover inflation during the next six years.\n  Our highway program expires this year. Traffic congestion is a \ngrowing problem and freight needs are expanding rapidly. The States \nwant us to review the program on time. The strength of the Nation's \neconomy and literally hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake.\n  I foresee great difficulty in enacting a transportation \nreauthorization bill with the numbers proposed in this budget \nresolution.\n  Our environmental programs get short shrift in this budget.\n  I am most disappointed that conferees refused to agree to the \nadditional $3 billion in funding for the Nation's water infrastructure \napproved by the Senate. As I said during debate on the Senate floor, \nthe estimates of the current funding gap in the areas of water and \nwastewater infrastructure are enormous. Accounting for inflation, \noverall funding for environmental programs will be $770 million below \nfiscal year 2003 levels. Real cuts in programs that keep our water, \nland, and air clean will have to be made.\n  Finally, education gets short shrift in this budget.\n  Earlier this year, the President emphasized that education and \nhomeland\n\n[[Page S5314]]\n\nsecurity are integral to having a secure nation with a well-educated \nand training workforce that would grow and strengthen our economy.\n  At a time in our history when we are all focused on homeland \nsecurity, it must be noted that education should be considered the \ncenterpiece of our homeland security efforts. The best security for a \nnation is to ensure that every individual has the opportunity to \nreceive a high-quality education, from prekindergarten to elementary \nand secondary education, to special education, to technical and higher \neducation, and beyond.\n  The budget resolution before us severely underfunds key education \nprograms. The Title One program, which is the heart of the Federal \neffort in elementary and secondary education, is $6 billion below the \nlevel authorized under the No Child Left Behind Act. The resolution \nalso fails to provide for any increase in the Pell grant maximum award.\n  By authorizing large tax cuts in the budget conference report, we are \nseverely damaging our education delivery system. This Nation has \noverwhelming needs in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The \ntax cuts in this resolution should have gone to meet these needs.\n  Mr. President, a budget is a statement of priorities. As is clear \nfrom my statements, I will vote against this budget because I believe \nthis budget's priorities are dangerously misguided.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me first congratulate Senator Nickles. \nThis is the chairman's first budget resolution, and I particularly \nthank him and his staff for all their hard work these last nearly 7 \nweeks to bring us to this point today.\n  It has not been easy, but the committee has met its schedule and \ncompleted the budget resolution ahead of the statutory deadline of \nApril 15.\n  I understand this is the second fastest budget resolution conference \nagreement ever considered. Senators might be reminded that the last \ntime we adopted a budget resolution in the Senate was almost 2 years \nago on May 8, 2001, under the chairmanship of Senator Pete Domenici, at \na time when the Senate was 50-50.\n  The Senate, for the first time in the 27 years of the Budget Act, did \nnot adopt a budget resolution last year, did not even consider one here \non the Senate floor. And I truly believe that our failure to complete \n11 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2003 until just 8 weeks ago, \nwas a direct result of not adopting a budget last year.\n  So having a budget resolution that we can vote on today, is not only \nimportant for how it will allow the legislative calendar to move \nforward in a more orderly manner, it is also important to the \ninstitution. The congressional budget process now is back in operation \nand that is important not only for today but for the future of how \nbusiness is conducted particularly in this chamber.\n  Without a budget, chaos would rein in the legislative calendar.\n  Without a budget, there would be no fiscal discipline on our return \nfrom the upcoming recess.\n  Without a budget, we would have no enforcement provisions to control \nmandatory or discretionary spending. It would be open season on \nspending increases.\n  Without a budget, interestingly to my colleagues who are opposed to \neven the modest tax cuts assumed in this resolution, there would be no \nrestrictions on any tax cuts, just as there would be no limit on any \nspending increases without a budget in place.\n  But more importantly, the fiscal blueprint before today, is the \ncorrect blueprint to provide for economic growth and job creation.\n  It is going to be absolutely critical that once we return from the \nupcoming recess that we focus quickly on adopting a tax reconciliation \nbill that will stimulate investment, increase demand, and begin to \ncreate needed jobs.\n  Equally as important this budget will provide for increased spending \nwhere it is needed to provide for homeland security and national \ndefense.\n  And nondomestic spending will not decline but actually increase over \n3.6 percent next year. A rate of growth consistent with the average \nAmerican family's pay check growth. Government spending should grow no \nfaster than families' income growth.\n  Mr. President, this is not, as the minority leader suggested, a \ndifficult day. This is a good day to adopt a budget, the first one in \nover 2 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes five seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we anticipate now that the vote will start \nat 5:20. We want to alert our colleagues to that. Let me just wrap up, \nif I may. And then would the chairman like to conclude this debate?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Thank you.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right. Mr. President, let's all understand what we \nare voting on. This is not a tax cut of $350 billion. There is a tax \ncut contained in this budget resolution for $1.3 trillion. There may be \nsome side deals that have been arranged to reduce the reconciled amount \nof that tax cut, but the budget resolution before us provides $1.3 \ntrillion in tax cuts. This is at a time of record budget deficits. We \nhave the biggest budget deficits we have ever had.\n  The budget deficit for this year will be between $500 and $600 \nbillion, not counting Social Security. If we treat Social Security the \nway it was intended and we don't take it and use it for other things, \nthe operating deficit is between $500 and $600 billion this year.\n  This is advertised as a growth package, something that will grow the \neconomy. In our analysis, nothing could be further from the truth. The \ndeadweight of these deficits and debt will burden the economy for \nyears. It threatens the economic security of our country.\n  This is the analysis of the people who were hired by the White House \nand the Congressional Budget Office to do the economic analysis. This \nis what they say:\n\n       Initially the plan would stimulate demand by raising \n     disposable income, boosting equity values, and reducing the \n     cost of capital. However, the tax cut also reduces national \n     saving while offering little new permanent incentives for \n     either private saving or labor supply. Therefore, unless it \n     is paid for with a reduction in Federal outlays, the plan \n     will raise real interest rates, crowd out private sector \n     investment, and eventually undermine potential gross domestic \n     product.\n\n  In other words, this plan hurts the economy. It doesn't help it. It \nhurts it. That is the analysis of the people who are paid to do it by \nthe White House themselves.\n  The White House's own budget document reveals the long-term \ncircumstance we face: Exploding deficits as a result of exploding costs \nto the Federal Government from the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration, coupled with exploding costs of the tax cut that is \nproposed and contained in this budget. The result: we never get out of \ndeficit, ever, at least until the year 2050, according to the \nPresident's analysis. The deficits just get deeper and deeper and \ndeeper, threatening the economic security of the country.\n  I close with this piece that appeared in the New York Times op-ed \npage on Wednesday. This is a piece done by six of our most \ndistinguished colleagues: three former Senators--two Democrats, one \nRepublican--two members of President's Cabinet in the past--one \nRepublican, one Democrat--and Paul Volcker, former head of the Federal \nReserve. I don't know his political affiliation.\n  They are warning us of the direction we are going. They conclude by \nsaying this:\n\n       Congress cannot simply conclude that deficits don't matter. \n     Over the long term, deficits matter a great deal. They lower \n     future economic growth by reducing the level of national \n     savings that can be devoted to productive investments. They \n     raise interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. \n     They raise interest payments on the national debt. They \n     reduce the fiscal flexibility to deal with unexpected \n     developments. If we forget these economic consequences, we \n     risk creating an insupportable tax burden for the next \n     generation.\n\n  That is what is at stake here.\n  Are we really going to pass a budget that contains authorization for \nanother $1.3 trillion in tax cuts, when we are already in record budget \ndeficits, when we are in a war, the cost of which we do not know, and \nwe are on the brink of retirement of the baby boom generation, which is \ngoing to explode the cost to the Federal Government?\n  Mr. President, anybody who votes for this budget is voting to \nincrease the\n\n[[Page S5315]]\n\ndeficits by $2.4 trillion. It is precisely the wrong thing at this \ntime. It is precisely the wrong thing. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nare going to be voting momentarily. I have a lot of colleagues who say \nthey want to catch planes, and a lot of the debate has cycled around \nonce or twice. It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Conrad. I am \nnot totally surprised that he will not vote for the budget resolution--\nmaybe a little disappointed.\n  I hope we return to the days of having bipartisan budget resolutions. \nThere will be some Democrats who will vote for this. I hope there are \nseveral. When we passed this budget 3 or 4 weeks ago in the Senate, \nthere were several Democrats who voted for it. I hope we will get \nseveral to vote for it today.\n  I have heard a lot of complaint about it, most of which is excessive \ntax cuts. I beg to differ. We have tax revenues over the next 10 years \nof about $28 trillion, and the reconciled portion of this tax cut, at \nmaximum, would be $550 billion, but probably more like $350 billion. \nThat is a small percentage. Some colleagues say: Wait a minute, there \nare more; in the outyears, there is $600 billion, and that is basically \ncontinuing present law. If you don't do that, you are going to have \nmassive tax increases in 2011, 2012, and 2013. A lot of those tax \nincreases will be on low-income people, raising their rate from 10 \npercent to 15 percent, reinstating the marriage penalty, or it would be \neliminating the $1,000 tax credit per child. I don't want to do that. I \ndon't know that we are going to do it this year. We don't have to do it \nthis year. We should do something to stimulate the economy. We have a \nsmall stimulus package--$350 billion for the Senate.\n  So I hope our colleagues will support this package.\n  I will make one comment about deficits. Are deficits too high? You \nbet. Some people say--and I have heard this a lot--they were caused by \nexcessive tax cuts in 2001. But I disagree with that. There are two \nequations: how much revenue you are taking in, and also how much money \nyou are spending. We have been spending a lot of money because of \nnational defense needs, because of homeland security and, frankly, \nCongress got in the habit of spending a lot of money during the later \nyears in the Clinton administration when we had a lot of growth \nrevenue. We had spending compounding at double-digit levels--12, 13, 14 \npercent. We cannot continue doing that.\n  This budget has fiscal discipline. It does say that the discretionary \namounts, compared to last year prior to the supplemental, will grow at \nabout 2.5 percent. We have caps on entitlements, points of order \nagainst growing entitlements, and we say that entitlement changes in \nMedicare should be limited to $400 billion after a bill is reported out \nof the Finance Committee. We didn't put that in reconciliation. We want \nMedicare, and we want a prescription drug bill, and we think we can get \nit as a result of this bill.\n  Last year, we had no budget. When we had no budget, we didn't get \nappropriation bills done. We didn't pass 11 of 13 appropriations bills \nlast year because the House and Senate didn't have numbers with which \nthey concurred. We didn't get a prescription drug bill. We didn't \nfunction or manage.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's not be totally focused just on the size \nof the growth package--and a lot of people have different opinions, \nsuch as it is not large enough, it is too big; some want zero, some \nwant $350 billion, some want more, and some may want more than that. \nLet's also keep in mind that that is a tax figure over 10 years, and it \nis a very small percentage compared to what we are spending per year, \nwhich is $2.2 trillion.\n  This budget is the only game in town if you want to have any control \nover the growth of that total expenditure. We didn't pass the budget \nlast year. If we don't pass one this year, the whole budget process is \ndead. I urge my colleagues, let's be fiscally responsible. This is the \nonly game in town. For people to say, wait a minute, this is too high--\nthe only thing they are talking about being too high is on the tax \nside. That doesn't count the trillions of dollars they were trying to \nadd on spending.\n  I urge my colleagues to be responsible. Let's work together and pass \na budget that can pass. This can pass. Let's reinstate some discipline \nthat we didn't have last year. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbudget.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and I ask for the yeas and nays \non the conference report.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues. This has \nbeen a challenging process. I especially thank Senator Conrad. We have \nhad a good debate, a challenging process, needless to say, but we now \nhave a budget. I thank all of my colleagues for their support in making \nthat happen.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we welcome the Vice President to the \nChamber. We congratulate you on the success of our forces half a world \naway in Iraq. We deeply appreciate that success.\n  We have concluded action now on the budget resolution. This has been \nan item of significant debate in the Chamber, and disagreement, but we \nrespect the outcome. Everyone had a chance to express their view. \nEveryone hopes this works out for the best for our country.\n  I conclude by thanking the chairman of the committee, who worked very \nhard in difficult circumstances to produce a budget resolution. We \ncongratulate him on his success. We also thank his excellent staff, who \nwere terrific to work with. Although we had, obviously, disagreements \non the two sides, the tone of this debate has been excellent.\n  I also thank all of my colleagues who expressed themselves, who \nparticipated in this debate and made their feelings known.\n  I conclude by thanking my own staff, my staff director, Mary Naylor, \nJim Horney, Sue Nelson, my counsel, Lisa Konwinski, and all of the \nother staff members who worked long and hard as we considered this \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. A brief announcement now for the benefit of our \ncolleagues. The supplemental is currently being\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\ndiscussed, debated, amended, worked on very hard as it has been over \nthe last several days, and will likely go into tonight. We expect to \npass that supplemental by unanimous consent later tonight, and thus the \nvote we just took will be the last vote prior to the recess. The next \nvote will be on Tuesday, April 29. I will notify Members of the exact \ntime on Tuesday, the 29th.\n  Again, there will be no further rollcall votes between now and the \nrecess.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee. Frankly, no matter how difficult, we \ndid produce a budget resolution. Obviously, it is less than unanimous \nin terms of the likes and dislikes for this proposal, but I submit it \nis far better for the Senate and for the people of this country that we \nhave a budget resolution than we not have one at all.\n  Obviously, there will be opportunities to differ during the year, and \nthere are provisions that will be difficult to maintain and to enforce. \nThe truth is, we do know when we do not have a budget resolution, \nregardless of how contentious it is, we are inviting chaos. We are \ninviting a delay in almost every one of the processes that are ordinary \nand normal to this case without a resolution. There are plenty of \nSenators who do not agree with that. That is why the vote is 50/50. \nThat is exactly what voting is for. Someone wins; someone loses. In \nthis instance, the Vice President did what is provided for in our \nConstitution, provided the one-vote majority, and now we have a budget \nresolution.\n  I am hopeful that the implementation of that budget resolution, \ncontrary to what has been said this evening by the other side, will be \ngood for this country. I am confident that it will be better for this \ncountry than not to have one. Of that, I am positive.\n  Could there be a better one? Maybe, but there cannot be a better one \nand get votes in the Senate to have that as a budget resolution. If we \ncould, we would have. This is the best we can do.\n  I compliment Senator Nickles, the new chairman, and all who worked \nwith him. Obviously, the decorum, the demeanor, in getting this done \nrequires more than a chairman. It requires a ranking member and the \nranking member deserves our accolades.\n  In addition, I guarantee there are plenty of staff hours and toil and \nwork on both sides of the aisle that went into this resolution. I \ncommend each and every one of the staff who worked so hard to get us to \nthis point.\n  Last but not least, I commend the majority leader for his dedicated \nand diligent work in helping the chairman get us to where we are today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici. Personally, my \nadmiration for him has gone up dramatically, recognizing that he was \neither chairman or ranking member for 22 years of the Budget Committee, \nand every year he was chairman, he was able to get a budget passed. It \nis not an easy process. I also thank him because he has given me some \nexcellent staff and they have been a great asset. Hazen Marshall is the \nchief of staff who put together a great team, many of whom were former \nemployees of my very good friend.\n  Senator Domenici, who is now chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, is doing a fabulous job. This year we will have an \nenergy bill and it will be passed out of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. When marking it up, it had a lot of amendments. We \nhad a lot of amendments on the budget package in committee and on the \nfloor, and I am sure we will in the energy bill, but I am sure we will \nhave an energy bill to contribute to our country's energy security.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5316-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5316-S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 EASTER\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

After the \ncontentious debates and harried schedules of past weeks on Capitol \nHill, some Members may just relax and enjoy the beauty of spring. \nSpring, ah spring.\n  Spring is such a gentle season. The air is soft, the earth is moist, \nthe new leaves and blades of grass are tender, not like the superheated \nair of summer that parches the earth, toughening leaves and drying \nlawns into crispy, crunchy deserts. Even the colors of springtime are \ngentle, all soft purples, buttery yellows and pale pinks of lilac, \ndaffodil, and hyacinth. Only later, in the summer sun, come the vibrant \noranges, deep reds, and gaudy color mixes of sun- and heat-loving \nflowers like marigolds, zinnia, and geranium.\n  In this most gentle of seasons, the contrast between the beauty \noutdoors and the images saturating the airwaves is difficult to \nreconcile. Images of war waged in distant cities in a distant land, of \ngunfire, bombs, of ambushes, of sudden death and the loss and anguish \nof families both here and there, do not seem to match the mood of \nspringtime, with its message of birth and life and growth. But the \nholiday that Christians celebrate this season contains all of these \nparadoxes. Easter is tragedy and loss, capture and death, as well as \nrebirth and new life, life everlasting.\n  The story of Easter is monumental. It is theater for the ages, \nunmatched by Sophocles, Euripides, or Shakespeare, because it is true. \nEaster is the history of one man, his life and death highlighted in the \nannals of history as few individuals are. Though full of miracles \nbeyond wonder and betrayal beyond believing, the story of Jesus of \nNazareth ends on a stirring note of hope. His death, the price of life \neverlasting for mankind, offers solace and hope to the families who \nhave lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. Indeed, the Easter story offers comfort to all of us.\n  When you have lived as long as I have, and when you have been as \nblessed as I to have and have had many good friends over the years, you \nmust also live with the loss of those friends and loved ones. Not a day \npasses but that the untimely loss of my grandson Michael does not make \nmy heart ache. It was 21 years ago this coming Monday. Recently, my \ncolleague and good friend, the former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, \npassed away at the age of 76. I miss him. There is where he sat--there. \nAt that desk at the end of the back row. That is where he sat, I miss \nhim. I miss my faithful and loving little dog Billy, who died last \nyear. All things in this life must pass. But their memories warm my \nheart and their friendship is etched in the laugh lines on my face. My \nbelief in the Creator and in his promise of life everlasting in his \npresence gives me support and comfort.\n\n       Though nothing can bring back the hour\n       Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;\n       We will grieve not, rather find\n       Strength in what remains behind;\n       In the primal sympathy\n       Which having been must ever be;\n       In the soothing thoughts that spring\n       Out of human suffering;\n       In the faith that looks through death,\n       In years that bring the philosophic mind.\n\n  The poet William Wordsworth wrote that, in his ode, ``Intimation of \nImmortality.''\n  This coming Sunday is Palm Sunday, marking the triumphal entry into \nJerusalem by Jesus, our blessed Lord. It is a joyous day, but shadowed \nnow by the foreknowledge of what is to come on Maundy Thursday, Good \nFriday and Holy Saturday--dark, sad days relieved by the miracle of \nEaster Sunday. On Easter Sunday, our spirits are lifted by the wondrous \nnews of the resurrection and the ascension. Those are uplifting words: \nresurrection and ascension, rebirth and, for Jesus, a homecoming to sit \nat the right hand of the Father, His Father. My Father. Your Father.\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\n  On Easter Sunday, surrounded by fresh spring flowers, pretty Easter \ndresses and baskets of brightly colored Easter eggs, we again see \nSpring in its best light. We see it in the light of renewal and hope. \nWe see it in the amazing story of Private Jessica Lynch of Palestine, \nWV. The State of West Virginia, and the entire nation, rejoices in her \nsafe recovery. Her homecoming will be a day to remember forever. My \nthanks, and the Nation's thanks, go out to the brave and honorable \nIraqi nationals who risked so much to bring her aid and the daring \nservice personnel who rescued her.\n\n  Mr. President, a poem that I memorized long, long years ago reminds \nus all of how we are touched by the presence of others:\n\n     A Persian fable says:\n\n     One day a wanderer found a piece of clay,\n     So redolent of perfume\n     Its odor scented all the room.\n     ``What are thou?'' was the quick demand;\n     ``Art thou some gem of Samarcand?\n     Or spikenard rare in rich disguise,\n     Or other costly merchandise?''\n     ``Nay, I am but a piece of clay,''\n     ``Then whence this wondrous sweetness, pray?''\n     ``Friend, if the secret I disclose,\n     I have been dwelling with the rose.''\n     Sweet parable! And will not those\n     Who love to dwell with Sharon's rose,\n     Distill sweet odors all around,\n     Though low and mean themselves be found?\n     Dear Lord, abide with us, that we\n     May draw our perfume fresh from thee.\n\n  Mr. President, the rose that has perfumed this humble piece of clay \nis my wife Erma. In 49 more days, God willing, we will celebrate 66 \nyears of marriage. It has not all been a level voyage. There have been \nups and downs, as there will be in every marriage, but they have been \ngood years, filled with many Easter mornings.\n  And now, as I look forward to watching my great-grandchildren hunt \nfor their Easter eggs in the green grass, I am grateful for the \nopportunity to see so many generations grow up. My sense of hope for \nthe future is redoubled, as it is each Easter time.\n  It must have been at Easter time when William Jennings Bryan penned \nthose words from ``The Prince of Peace:''\n\n     If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold and \n           pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it \n           burst forth from its prison walls, will he leave \n           neglected in the earth the soul of man, made in the \n           image of his Creator?\n     If he stoops to give to the rosebush, whose withered blossoms \n           float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of \n           another springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to \n           the son of men when the frosts of winter come?\n     If matter, mute and inanimate, tho changed by the forces of \n           nature into a multitude of forms, can never die, will \n           the imperial spirit of man suffer annihilation when it \n           has paid a brief visit like a royal guest to his \n           tenement of clay?\n     No, I am sure that He who, notwithstanding his apparent \n           prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and \n           wasted not a single atom in all his creation, has made \n           provision for a future life in which man's universal \n           longing for immortality will find its realization.\n\n  I am as sure that we live again as I am sure that we live today.\n  So my sense of hope for the future is redoubled, as it is each Easter \ntime. That is the beauty of Easter, because that typifies the glorious \npromise which is ours and which the Saviour gave to us. That question, \nwhich was asked in the Book of Job: ``If a man die, shall he live \nagain?'' is answered--answered--by Easter.\n  I recall, in the Book of John, Jesus came to the grave of Lazarus and \nsaid: ``Lazarus, come forth.'' And Lazarus came forth, still wrapped in \nhis grave clothes. And Jesus said: ``Loose him, and let him go.''\n  So in the midst of war there is life. In the midst of uncertainty \nthere is faith. After each winter, there is spring.\n  Mr. President, I wish you and all of our colleagues a glorious \nEaster. May we ponder upon its meaning, and upon its reason, and upon \nits promise for us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it had been my intent earlier in the week to \ncome and share with my colleagues some thoughts on the recent crackdown \non human rights activists in Cuba. I was unable to do it, so before we \nadjourn for the Easter Passover recess, I want to take a few minutes to \nexpress my thoughts on the recent events in Cuba, and to express in the \nstrongest terms possible my sense of outrage over what has happened.\n  Cuban President Fidel Castro recently initiated severe and repressive \nmeasures in an attempt to silence prodemocracy activists on the island \nnation of Cuba. I rise to denounce in the strongest possible terms \nthose actions. The arrests and show trials of these individuals are \nwell beyond acceptable norms of governance today, and they call into \nquestion the very legitimacy of the Cuban state. It speaks volumes \nabout that state's legitimacy when its citizens are denied an \nopportunity to dialog with the Government authorities about the future \nof their nation, its political institutions, and its practices.\n  Over the last 40 years, there have been ebbs and flows with respect \nto the extent of political space granted to human rights activists and \nindependent journalists by Cuban authorities. Last year, in the runup \nto the visit of former President Jimmy Carter to Havana, there was a \nperceptible loosening of restrictions on civil society activities. And \nthe Cuban people exhibited a genuine interest in and motivation toward \nmaking the most of this newly found political space. When President \nCarter was in Havana, he was permitted to address the Cuban people, \nlive and uncensored, on Cuban national television. At that time, he \nrightfully acknowledged the ongoing democratic grassroots activities on \nthe island symbolized by the so-called Varela Project, headed by \nOswaldo Paya. This important grassroots organization has already \ngathered more than 20,000 signatures on petitions in support of \ndemocratic reforms.\n  Thanks to President Jimmy Carter, the activities of Mr. Paya are now \nknown not only to the international community but to the Cuban people \nas well.\n  Representatives of the Varela Project presented a petition with over \n11,000 signatures to the Cuban National Assembly, calling on the \nAssembly to act on some vital democratic issues, including free speech \nand free press, economic liberalization, and the release of political \nprisoners. While I understand that the National Assembly has responded \nto the Varela petitioners, it has done so in a narrowly, legalistic \nmanner that misses the larger political issues that deserve serious \nconsideration by Cuban authorities.\n  It speaks volumes that thousands of ordinary Cubans have been willing \nto publicly petition their government seeking change. I for one had \nhoped that the Cuban people's expressed desire for democratic \ninitiatives would prompt further liberalization of the Nation of Cuba. \nIn fact, if the Castro government abided by its own constitution, this \nmight very well be the case.\n  Instead, over the past several weeks, my colleagues, my fellow \nAmericans, and the global community have witnessed the Castro \ngovernment's abrupt and repressive retaliation against Cuban grassroots \ndemocracy activists, independent journalists, economists, and other \ndissidents. On trumped up charges of allegedly ``working with a foreign \npower to undermine the government,'' the Castro government is \nattempting to undermine the will of its own people, in my view, and \nabout 75 Cuban dissidents have now been arrested and convicted.\n  Opposition political party leader Hector Palacios has already \nreceived 25 years in prison, and his wife, Gisela Delgado was also \nconvicted. Civil rights advocate Oscar Elias Biscet is expected to be \nsentenced this week. Economist Martha Beatriz Roque, who has been \nconsistently critical of President Castro's handling of the Cuban \neconomy--and rightfully so, I might add--which happens to be in dire \nstraits, received 20 years in prison for merely doing that. Three \nothers met the same fate, including dissident independent journalist \nRaul Rivero, independent magazine editor Ricardo Gonzales, and \neconomist Oscar\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\nEspinosa Chepe. Indeed, up to this point, there have been 57 \nconvictions, with sentences ranging from 6 to 28 years.\n  And, I must say that after examining these tragic cases, it comes as \nno surprise that although Mr. Paya has not yet been arrested, 42 of the \n74 people arrested in these crackdowns are participants in the Varela \nProject.\n  Even more troubling is that these trials have been and are continuing \nto be conducted in a Havana courtroom closed to international diplomats \nand foreign journalists. I strongly believe that this atmosphere of \nauthoritarianism is indicative not only of the lack of substantial \nevidence against these individuals, but these trials' lack of domestic \nand international legitimacy.\n  For many years, I have strongly supported United States engagement of \nCuba. I have worked to dismantle the myriad of restrictions on American \ninteraction with that nation, including those on trade and travel. Once \nagain, let me state for the record my belief that our 40-year long \nisolationist policy towards Cuba has played, unfortunately, a major \nrole I believe in keeping the government of Fidel Castro in power. It \nhas allowed the Castro regime to blame U.S. policies for the lack of \nfood and medicine in Cuba and has created a siege mentality which has \nallowed repression to flourish under the guise of national sovereignty. \nFor those reasons I continue to believe that U.S. policy needs to \nchange to some degree.\n  However, my support for United States engagement of Cuba should not \nbe mistaken for support of the Castro Government or for the \nreprehensible tactics it resorts to in order to suppress popular \ndissent with its policies\n  It is a curious thing, indeed, that prior to these recent actions by \nCuban authorities, there was growing support in the Congress and in the \nCuban American community in particular for more engagement with Cuba. \nIt leads me to speculate whether President Castro's recent persecution \nof prodemocracy and human rights activists is not designed to chill \nefforts in the United States to engage more actively with the island.\n  I call upon the Castro Government to take immediate steps for the \nrelease of its political prisoners, to stop the persecution of Cuban \ndissidents, and to show respect for and abide by the Cuban Constitution \nand the will of the Cuban people. Fidel Castro has always said that the \nCuban Revolution liberated the Cuban people from tyranny and \noppression. The events of the last few weeks would indicate just the \nopposite. Many of the actions that the Castro regime has taken in \nrecent months, particularly against democratic activists and \nindependent journalists make it crystal clear that tyranny is still the \norder of the day in Havana under Fidel Castro. It is time for Cuban \nauthorities to drastically reverse course and allow the Cuban people to \nhave a voice in their governance. Then and only then will the Cuban \npeople be truly liberated from tyranny.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we recently heard a wonderful address by \nSenator Byrd when he talked about Easter and expressed his views about \nit. He did so as a believer. This is a great and wonderful free \ncountry, and we are able to express our views.\n  I wish to take a few moments to comment on some of the attacks from \nthe left on a comment recently made by Secretary of Education Rod \nPaige.\n  Secretary Paige is a great educator, a great man. I am so impressed \nwith him. When he took over the Houston County school system in Texas, \nonly 37 percent of the students were passing the basic Texas test. In 5 \nyears, by bringing on discipline, accountability, a rigorous testing \nprogram, not accepting failing schools and being intolerant of them, \nand being intolerant of educators who were not performing, he doubled \nthe number of students passing that test. As he told me, in the fourth \nor fifth year, he got a little extra money, but basically he achieved \nthose results without extra money in the Texas State school system.\n  I believe he is a tremendous man. He loves those children. He loves \nthe children more than he does the bureaucrats and the educators. He \nwants to know if they are learning, and he cares about them. He cares \nabout their values. He cares about whether or not they are becoming \nbetter children, not just smarter children.\n  The complaints arose from a story published in the Washington Post \nwhich misquoted the Secretary. This is what the quote was in the \nWashington Post, quoting Secretary Paige:\n\n       All things equal, I would prefer to have a child in a \n     school that has a strong appreciation for the values of the \n     Christian community, where a child is taught to have a strong \n     faith.\n\n  First of all, a lot of Americans believe that. Lots of Americans \nbelieve that. I submit a majority of Americans believe that. But, this \nis what a tape recording of his question-and-answer interview \ndemonstrates that he actually said:\n  Question:\n\n       One final question, Mr. Secretary. We're hearing a lot in \n     Christian colleges and universities about Christian world \n     view education. Do you have any comment on that? What do you \n     think about that?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       No, I have not heard enough about that to formulate a view. \n     So I'll probably need to pass on that one.\n\n  But they did not let him get away with that. You know how they press.\n  Question:\n\n       Given the choice between private and Christian or private \n     and public universities, who do you think has the best deal?\n  Secretary Paige answered:\n\n       That's a judgment, too, that would vary because each of \n     them have real strong points and some of them have some \n     vulnerabilities, but you know, all things being equal, I'd \n     prefer to have a child in a school where there's a strong \n     appreciation for values, the kinds of values that I think are \n     associated with the Christian communities so that this child \n     can be brought up in an environment that teaches them to have \n     strong faith and to understand that there is a force in their \n     lives.\n\n  So the Secretary of Education basically was saying he would like to \nhave a child in a school where there is a strong appreciation for \nvalues, and those values are sometimes associated with the Christian \ncommunities. So that brought the left up in arms.\n  That is what we are too often reduced to in this country, that one is \nnot able to express those kinds of ideas. So we are at the point now \nwhere we question whether or not the words, ``In God We Trust,'' should \nbe on the wall of this Chamber. There they are, several inches high, \nright over the main door to this Chamber.\n  Are we going to rip that down? Take down the Ten Commandments that \nare in the Supreme Court building? Have no prayer at football games at \ngraduation? That pretty well has been taken care of. I remember when \nformer President Jimmy Carter's Attorney General, the wonderful Griffin \nBell, was asked about litmus tests for judges, and he responded without \nhesitation. He had left office at that point or he probably would have \ncaused a controversy. He said: I tell you we ought to have a litmus \ntest. Nobody should be a Federal judge who does not believe in prayer \nat football games.\n  We cannot say ``under God'' in the pledge now according to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. They struck down the Pledge of Allegiance. \nThey are not happy with the Boy Scouts because they teach values and \nthey believe in disciplining personal behavior. We certainly cannot do \nthose things in school, the left says.\n  So what we are asking for, it seems to me, or at least the hard left \nis, elimination of any reference to moral or spiritual values in public \nlife in this country, and I do not think that is how we were founded.\n  Secretary Paige has dedicated his entire career to promoting children \nand promoting diversity, making sure that all children of all ethnic \ngroups and all faiths have access to the best possible education. Yes, \nhe is a man of faith. He is a man of conviction. He is a man of \ncharacter. Those are good reasons for\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\nhim to be the Secretary of Education. Do we want someone who is not?\n  Secretary Paige talks about preferring a school that has a strong \nsense of values; not that he is requiring or thinks all children should \ngo to Christian schools. He never said that. He uses Christianity as an \nexample of those values because that is his background, because he has \nmade it very clear he believes the same could be said of other \nreligions.\n  I agree with what the Secretary said, and I think that those who \nwould attack him for talking about the state of American education are \ndoing a tremendous disservice to our children.\n  Let's face it, this is part of a regular, organized attack on faith \nmore than it is a complaint about Dr. Paige. It is close to requiring a \nreligious test for public service, prohibited by our traditions in law. \nIt is saying that your religion must be secular; people of faith need \nnot apply. If you have any religious beliefs, keep them to yourself, do \nnot let them guide you, for heaven's sake, in anything that you might \ndo.\n\n  Unfortunately, there is a group in this country, small but very \nvocal, who are offended by any expression of faith in public life. I \nthink we have drifted out of sync, we have drifted away from what we \nare about. I do not think it is healthy.\n  Religion is woven into the fabric of our great Nation. Faith has \nalways guided our leaders. I think most Americans were taught, as I was \ntaught, not to make fun of someone else's religion, to respect their \nfaith. It did not have to be the same as yours. Ronald Reagan called \nAmerica ``a shining city on a hill.''\n  We are a nation that believes so deeply in our values we confidently \npromote those values around the world.\n  Reagan understood the role of religion in fulfilling our mission. \nHere is what he believed about God in schools:\n\n       The Declaration of Independence mentions the Supreme Being \n     no less than four times. ``In God We Trust'' is engraved on \n     our coinage--\n\n  And I will note, on that wall right there.\n\n       The Supreme Court opens its proceedings with a religious \n     invocation--\n\n  Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. God bless this Honorable Court and save \nthese United States.\n\n       And the Members of Congress open their sessions with a \n     prayer.\n\n  We have a prayer every time this door opens.\n\n       I just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the United \n     States are entitled to the same privileges as Supreme Court \n     Justices and Congressmen.\n\n  I think we have gone too far. Thomas Jefferson, whom we know to be \nthe architect of that great Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and \nwho is considered to be a great bulwark of the separation of church and \nstate, said:\n\n       I consider the doctrines of Jesus as delivered to contain \n     the outlines of the sublimest system of morality that has \n     ever been taught.\n\n  He would not make Secretary of State today if he were to say that. \nPeople can have different views. Public officials can express their own \nviews. President Reagan said:\n\n       Without God there is no virtue because there is no \n     prompting of the conscience; without God, there is a \n     coarsening of the society; without God democracy will not and \n     cannot long endure. If we ever forget that we are One Nation \n     Under God, then we will be a Nation gone under.\n\n  If one wants to see a nation that has a virtueless government, all \nthey have to do is look at Iraq for the last 25 years. Certainly, \nSaddam Hussein was not a religious person of any kind, Muslim or any \nother faith. To see such a nation gone under and to see a revival, one \nhad to just turn on the television on Wednesday morning to see the \nexhilaration of the Iraqis dancing on Saddam Hussein's statue.\n  I thought about that poem: My name is Ozymandius, king of kings. Look \non my face and beware, and now it has fallen in the desert and nobody \nhas seen it in a thousand years.\n  For decades, these helpless citizens have lived under a government \nwithout, more or less, virtues or values. The only thing that was \nvalued by the government was the power and privilege of the Saddam \nHussein regime. Their own might was their God.\n  The Iraqi people, on the other hand, have been liberated by a group \nof nations, led by our Nation, a government that was motivated by \nvalues--liberty, justice, democracy, morality, fairness, equality. \nThose are the sorts of values I think Secretary Paige was talking \nabout. Right and wrong. Right and wrong does not come from the self-\ninterest of whatever dictator happens to be in power. Right and wrong \ncomes from the Creator.\n  At our core, we are, and remain a people who believe that each life \nhas sacredness, and that is why our military would not leave one life \nor not rest with one POW still in prison or even without a body \nrecovered because we believe life is sacred. As the Declaration says, \nwe are a people endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. \nThus, right and wrong for believers never changes. And millions of \nAmericans, many of them Christians, Muslims, and Jews, take their \nguidance on questions of right and wrong out of their core faith in a \ncreating God.\n  Before those on the secular left attack people for expressing their \nreligious beliefs or their desires to instill values and moral and \nreligious values in their children, I would urge them to take a step \nback and think about the millions of people of faith in this country. \nWe strike the right balance in America, I believe. Religion is okay, we \nthink. It is good. It is to be encouraged, not diminished, but we \nrespect people of other faiths. We do not demean them.\n  People can come here from Muslim nations and live happily and safely, \nand if any of them are harmed we defend them; we prosecute those who \nharm them. We will not accept that. It is our heritage.\n\n  The complaints on Secretary Paige should be turned down. It is time \nto reacquaint ourselves with the principles of our Founders. They got \nit right. Every person was free to be faithful or to be secular, to \nfollow their own creed. Government should never bring force to bear, \nour Founders said, on the mind of man. Never establish a church by the \ngovernment.\n  But the Constitution does provide free exercise. The Constitution \nsimply says about religious faith: Congress--us--shall make no law \nrespecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.\n  Secretary Paige was not out stirring this issue up. He had to be \nasked repeatedly before he even got into the subject. It was not on his \nmind. He was asked and he gave his personal view. He said: I think. He \ndid not say ``everybody else did'' or ``You must believe.'' He said: I \nthink we should have an appreciation for values, the kinds of values \noften associated with the Christian community.\n  What is wrong with that? Have we gone that far down the road to \ndenying the right of our American citizens to freely exercise and \ncomment on their faith? I hope not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I will talk about \nthat for a few moments.\n  Mr. President, what is going to happen when we come back, there will \nbe at some point soon after we get back from our break, a vote up or \ndown on the Senate floor on whether or not the Senate will advise and \nconsent to approving President Bush's nominee, Mr. Jeffrey Sutton, to \nbe a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I will speak for a while tonight about Jeffrey Sutton, but when we \ncome back I will have a lot more to say. I don't think too many people \nhave focused on this. There has been a lot of talk about Mr. Estrada \nand now there is talk about Judge Owen from Texas but not too much has \nbeen said about Mr. Sutton. I will lay out the case and lay out for my \nfellow Senators and for the public at large what is at stake in this \nnomination.\n  First, for the record, Mr. Sutton is a 42-year-old lawyer, currently \na partner at Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue in the Columbus, OH, office. \nHe is an adjunct\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\nprofessor of law at Ohio State University College of Law. He served as \nState Solicitor of Ohio from 1995 to 1998. He is a former law clerk to \nJustice Powell and Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas Meskill of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals. He has been nominated by President \nBush to be a member of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  At the outset, Jeffrey Sutton has a great resume. He hails from Ohio \nState Law School, is a former solicitor for the State of Ohio, and he \nhas argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Quite frankly, he has \nwon many of them. So he has a great resume. Quite frankly, my arguments \nwill not be about whether he is qualified. That is not the point.\n  I will state at the outset in terms of legal qualifications and \nbackground that Mr. Sutton is qualified to sit on a bench. However, I \ndon't believe that is all we have to look at.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Sutton for about an hour and a \nhalf in my office. He was kind enough to come to my office. We sat \nthere and discussed an issue of great importance to me and to him. We \nhad a great conversation. I found him to be personable. I found him to \nbe highly intelligent, very bright. He is definitely an accomplished \nattorney. Frankly, I enjoyed my conversation with him for an hour and a \nhalf.\n  However, I take very seriously our responsibility to advise and \nconsent on lifetime judicial nominees. These are not positions to \nrubberstamp or just to lightly say that simply because someone is \nqualified they should be on the court. I have done a careful review of \nMr. Sutton's advocacy inside and outside the courtroom.\n  What I come to, I am not convinced Jeffrey Sutton would be able to \nput aside his own personal agenda and be a fair and balanced judge. \nEspecially for me, I cannot support putting someone on a Federal \ncircuit court who has worked, worked assiduously, worked intelligently, \nto undermine the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  As many here know, my brother, Frank, now deceased, was deaf. Through \nhis eyes and through his life, my family and I saw firsthand what \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities looks like. It was not \nsomething abstract. It was real. It was personal. It was up close. I \noften said if I could ever be in a position to do something about the \nkind of discrimination that my brother and so many others had faced, I \nwould do it. Through the generosity of the voters of Iowa, I was in \nthat position. In both the House and later in the Senate, I spent my \ntime working to develop legislation to bring out of the shadows of \ndiscrimination, of institutionalization, people with disabilities, \nbring them out of the shadows and bring into the sunshine of civil \nrights laws in this country.\n  The day before the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed by the \nfirst President Bush, the day before it was signed, if you were a \nperson of color in this country, say, you were an African American, and \nyou went down the street and answered an ad for a job for which you \nwere qualified, and you walked in there and your prospective employer \nlooked at you and said, I'm not hiring Black people, get out of here. \nYou could have walked out that door, walked down the street, and walked \nright into the courthouse because we passed a Civil Rights Act in 1964 \nthat outlaws, bans that kind of discrimination, based upon race.\n  If, however, on that same day a person in a wheelchair, qualified for \nthat job, had rolled that wheelchair down there and the prospective \nemployer looked at you and said, Get out of here; I don't hire \ncripples, and you rolled that wheelchair down to the courthouse door, \nthe doors were locked. They were open if you were a person of color and \nyou had been discriminated against. But, if you were a person with a \ndisability, the courthouse door was locked because there was no law \nthat banned discrimination based upon disability.\n\n  The next day President Bush signed it into law and you, Mr. \nPresident, or anybody else who might have a disability, took their \nplace alongside those who had been brought into our civil rights laws \nin America.\n  We did not pass that bill overnight. We didn't just all of a sudden \ndecide we were going to pass a civil rights bill for people with \ndisabilities, and pass it. We spent years. I am going to have more to \nsay about this when we come back after the break, but we spent years on \nthis, holding hearings and hearings, in forums all over the United \nStates; a Presidential task force appointed by a Republican President, \nhaving hearings all over the United States. There were years of \ndrafting, debating, trying to hone it down to make sure we had it \nright. With bipartisan support it passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. \nIt passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives with \nbipartisan support.\n  I will never forget that grand day when President Bush signed that \ninto law on the White House lawn. At that time it was the biggest \ngathering ever in White House history for the signing of legislation.\n  Justin Dart was there. Justin Dart was right there on the platform. \nJustin Dart, the hero of the disability rights movement in America, now \nalso sadly deceased. Justin Dart sitting up there, and President Bush \ntalking about Justin Dart leading this great movement to bring people \nwith disabilities under our civil rights laws.\n  Here is what President Bush said that morning:\n\n       The Civil Rights Act of '64 took a bold step towards \n     righting that wrong--the wrong of discrimination against \n     people of color--but the stark fact remained that people with \n     disabilities were still victim of segregation and \n     discrimination, and this was intolerable. Today's legislation \n     brings us closer to that day when no Americans will ever \n     again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life, liberty, \n     and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  Justin Dart was there that day. Before he died, Justin Dart wrote \nthis letter:\n\n       I feel certain that the great majority of 54 million \n     Americans with disabilities, and millions more of their \n     family members, join me in urging President Bush to \n     reconsider his nomination of Jeffrey Sutton as a Federal \n     judge.\n\n  I won't read the whole letter. I ask unanimous consent Justin Dart's \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks by Justin Dart, ADA Watch Press Conference, May 19, 2001, \n                             Washington, DC\n\n       I feel certain that the great majority of fifty four \n     million Americans with disabilities, and millions more their \n     family members, join me in urging President Bush to \n     reconsider his nomination of Jeffrey Sutton as federal judge.\n       The Americans with Disabilities Act is the world's first \n     comprehensive civil rights law for people with disabilities. \n     Barbara Bush has described it as the finest accomplishment of \n     her husband's administration.\n       Abraham Lincoln led this nation to war and died to \n     establish the authority of our federal government to protect \n     the rights of our citizens no matter what the state of their \n     residence.\n       It is very difficult to understand how President George W. \n     Bush could send to the Federal Court a man who challenges the \n     ``across the board'' constitutionality of a great civil \n     rights law written in the tradition of Abraham Lincoln and \n     signed by his father, George Bush Sr.\n       I am deeply concerned for the future of American democracy. \n     I am deeply concerned for the civil rights not only of \n     Americans with disabilities, but of all Americans. I am \n     deeply concerned not only for the principle of federal civil \n     rights, but also for the economic prosperity of our nation. \n     As more and more Americans triumph over death to live with \n     disabilities, it becomes absolutely imperative that they be \n     empowered to get off of the welfare rolls and onto the tax \n     rolls.\n       At the last count more than seventy percent of employable \n     Americans with disabilities were unemployed. Millions more \n     were underemployed. In 1990 President Bush Sr. estimated the \n     resulting burden to the nation to be 200 billion dollars \n     annually, and growing.\n       Finally I love the American Dream. I am passionately \n     serious about the pledge: ``one nation, under God, \n     indivisible with liberty and justice for all.''\n       Mr. President, you have pledged to support the ADA. You \n     have pledged to support one nation with liberty and justice \n     for all. You must send people to the court who support those \n     pledges.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. We in Congress met, these many years, overwhelming \nevidence that discrimination in this country against people with \ndisabilities was rampant, unchecked, building up year after year. It \nwas not just in the private sector but in the public sector. State \ngovernments and the Federal Government discriminated against people \nwith disabilities. It was pervasive in our society. We took care, when \nwe passed that bill, to make sure we had the findings and the \nconstitutional\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\nbasis to pass muster in the United States Supreme Court.\n  The signing sealed the work of a monumental bipartisan effort that \nsought to right decades of wrong. It took the tireless work of \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. As I said, it passed the Senate 91 to \n6. The House passed it 402 to 20. Then-Attorney General Thornburgh was \na strong supporter. The Chamber of Commerce was on our side, the \nbusiness community, the States, President Bush, all stood together. Why \ndid we all stand together on the ADA? Because it was the right thing to \ndo. Justice demanded it.\n  July 26, 1990--President Bush said a lot of good things that day as \nhe signed this bill. As I said, I will never forget it.\n  I was proud of this because it represented the hard work of a lot of \npeople and it broke down these old barriers of exclusion and \nintolerance and injustice toward people with disabilities. Now after \nall the work we did, all the findings, all the hearings, all the \ndocumentation we compiled, all that President Bush said, Mr. Sutton--\nguess what he said. He said it wasn't needed. He said the ADA was not \nneeded.\n  Why did he say it was not needed? Why, because the States were doing \nthe job. This was a State responsibility and Congress did not have the \nfindings that States had been discriminating. As I told Jeffrey Sutton \nwhen he sat in my office that day, I said, ``How could you say that?'' \nI said, ``Did you read all the documentation? Did you read all the \nfindings that we had? Twenty-five years of studies going clear back to \n1965 and beyond; 1974. There were 17 formal hearings by congressional \ncommittees, markup by 5 separate committees. There were 63 public \nforums across the country by congressionally established task forces. \nThere was oral and written testimony by the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, Governors, States' attorneys general and State \nlegislators. There were over 300 examples of discrimination by State \ngovernments in that record.\n  Yet before the Supreme Court of the United States, Mr. Sutton said it \nwasn't needed. That is Garrett v. Alabama. I'll have more to say about \nPat Garrett, too. But he said it just wasn't needed.\n  Regarding the Americans With Disabilities Act, I see them chipping \naway at a law that symbolizes the inclusion of all Americans in our \nsociety. For the past few years, Jeffrey Sutton has held the hammer and \nthe chisel.\n  In my mind it is not about whether he is qualified to be a Federal \njudge, or whether he is a nice guy. As I said, I happen to have enjoyed \nmy conversation with him. Frankly, I know who the six Senators were who \nvoted against the ADA in the Senate. I hope to enjoy my conversations \nwith them, too. I just disagreed with them and so did 91 other Senators \ndisagree with them. But that doesn't mean the six who voted against it \nare bad people. I, frankly, enjoy the friendship of those six people.\n  That is not the point. The point is whether or not someone should be \non the circuit court who holds that same kind of opinion. His \nqualifications--to me, a judge's qualifications are half of the \nequation. In other words, I think they have to meet the test of are \nthey qualified. I think the other half of our responsibility is to \ndetermine whether or not that person can be a fair and balanced judge \nwho understands the role of Congress in correcting ancient wrongs and \nhelping to make our society more fair and more just. Frankly, in his \nwritings and in his statements, and even in my conversation with him in \nmy office, Mr. Sutton seems to have a unique view of our role here that \nsomehow when it comes to civil rights laws, especially the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, that we have a very narrow area in which we can \noperate; the rest must be left to the States.\n\n  As I said, you read his writings. I was in the Supreme Court. I sat \nthere in the front row the day he argued the Garrett case, sat right \nnext to Bob Dole. And when I heard him stand up and say the ADA was not \nneeded, I said: Wait a minute. When I heard him talk about how we had \nnot really established the record, that we had not really had the \nfindings of State discrimination, I said: How could he possibly say \nthat? Only someone who did not know what we did could ever say that.\n  And that is what I talked to him about in my office. How could he say \nsuch a thing, when we had all this? Well, he said, yes, OK, he \nappreciated that, but I never got to the bottom of it with him.\n  Anyway, his arguments before the Supreme Court articulated that \nStates can do a better job of it than we can, and Congress did not find \nenough evidence. We found the evidence. It is there. It is in the \nrecord. It is compiled.\n  Mr. Sutton has said a lot of times: Well, I was only representing my \nclient, and I am duty bound as a lawyer to do the best I can for my \nclient. And he was representing the State of Alabama. Well, OK, I can \naccept that. But here is what Mr. Sutton said on National Public Radio \non October 11, 2000. Now, a lawyer's responsibility to fully represent \nhis or her client does not spill over into talking on National Public \nRadio. That is his personal opinion. And here is what he said:\n\n       Disability discrimination, in a constitutional sense, is \n     really difficult to show.\n\n  That is what Mr. Sutton said on National Public Radio.\n  I am going to talk more about this when we come back after the break, \nabout the extensive record that we found of constitutionally based \ndiscrimination against people with disabilities--discrimination that \nwas pervasive in our society, the institutionalization of people, the \nblatant discrimination in jobs, in transportation, in public places \nagainst people with disabilities. And yet he said it is difficult to \nshow.\n  Well, we showed it. But evidently that was not enough for Mr. Sutton \nbecause he has his own narrow view, his own personal view of what the \nlimits of Congress are in addressing these wrongs.\n  People with disabilities, as I said, locked away in institutions for \nyears; people with mental disabilities subjected to involuntary \nsterilization because, in the words of the late Justice Holmes: ``Three \ngenerations of imbeciles are enough.'' Persons with severe hearing \nloss, like my brother Frank, labeled deaf and dumb. They sent my \nbrother away to a school, segregated him away from his friends, from \nhis family, from his community, to go to the Iowa State School, as they \nsaid in those days, for the deaf and dumb. What does that do to people, \nsimply because they are deaf, being called dumb? For too many years, \nthose who were blind were forced to sell pencils on a street corner to \nearn a living.\n  When the day is done, and we all go home, Jeffrey Sutton--no matter \nhow likable he is, no matter how good his qualifications are--has an \nextreme, limited view of our congressional role to legislate in this \nimportant area. From his arguments before the Supreme Court, he seems \nto believe that each State does its job to protect the constitutional \nrights of persons with disabilities as the State sees fit.\n  After what I saw and heard with my own ears, and during the crafting \nof the ADA over all those years and all those hearings, I cannot fathom \nanyone reaching that conclusion.\n\n  Pat Garrett--I will have more to say about the Garrett case--Pat \nGarrett, from Alabama, working in a job for the State, came down with \nbreast cancer. She had to go have an operation. She had chemotherapy. \nShe recovered. She went back to work. She was told by one of her fellow \ncoworkers that her boss didn't like sick people. Her boss fired her.\n  So she brought a case under the Americans with Disabilities Act. She \nwon. She won her case in the lower court. Then the State of Alabama \nhired Jeffrey Sutton to argue its case before the Supreme Court, and \nthe Supreme Court found for Alabama by a 5-to-4 decision.\n  It seems to me that according to Jeffrey Sutton, that if Pat Garrett \ndoes not like the fact that the State of Alabama did not have a law \nthat protected her rights as a disabled person, why, she can move to \nNevada, maybe move to Minnesota, maybe move to Iowa. That is her right, \nthat she can just move out of the State, maybe find some other place to \nlive, where a State does have laws against discrimination against \npeople with disabilities in their State institutions.\n  But is that what we have become in our country, a patchwork quilt? \nThat is what we found in all these hearings\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\non the ADA, a patchwork. Yes, some States were good; some States had \nnone--a patchwork quilt.\n  I do not believe that your civil rights ought to depend on your \naddress. Your civil rights, under the Constitution of the United \nStates, ought to depend on whether you are in this country and you are \na citizen of the United States, not whether you live in Minnesota, \nIowa, Nevada, or Alabama.\n  States rights--I don't know which seat the occupant of the chair from \nMinnesota holds, but it was that great Senator from Minnesota who, back \nin 1948, took on his own party--my party--the Democratic Party, in that \ngreat speech he gave at the convention and said: It is time to come out \nof the shadow of States rights and into the sunshine of civil rights. \nAnd that is when the Dixiecrat, Senator Strom Thurmond, left the party, \nbecause of what Hubert Humphrey said.\n  But Hubert Humphrey was right, it was time to come out of that shadow \nof States rights and recognize that civil rights inures to all of us as \ncitizens of the United States and not just because I happen to live in \none State or another.\n  But Jeffrey Sutton does not believe that; down deep inside he does \nnot. And I say that only because of what he has said and what he has \nwritten, not just because of his representation of a client, but what \nhe has said outside the courtroom.\n  All the lawyer code and duty talk does not tell the whole story. He \nhas written articles, participated in radio talk shows, panel \ndiscussions, expressing his personal views, not his clients', but his \nown personal views. That kind of publicity is not required by his role \nas a lawyer advocating on behalf of his clients.\n  So based on his advocacy, based upon his own words, I am not \nconvinced that a person with a disability, walking into Jeffrey \nSutton's courtroom, can expect a fair shake from Mr. Sutton.\n  Again, as I said, I find him a likable individual, obviously very \nintelligent. But he means to undo with his position all we have done \nhere to make sure that people with disabilities have their civil \nrights.\n\n  There are over 400 disability rights and civil rights groups in the \nUnited States opposing this nomination to the Sixth Circuit. I am hard \npressed to know of any disability group that supports Mr. Sutton.\n  Again, this is nothing personal. People with disabilities understand \nhow tenuous their hold on their civil rights is today. The Supreme \nCourt has chipped away a little bit here, a little bit there on the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. There are still those in our country \nwho believe we should not have had that law. Mr. Sutton, obviously, is \none of those. He says it wasn't needed.\n  People with disabilities live every day wondering whether or not they \nwill be treated fairly based not upon their disability but on their \nabilities: Will I be able to get a good education? Will I be able to be \ntreated fairly and equitably in terms of employment? Will I be able to \nfind some reasonable accommodation so I can do a job? Will I go into a \nplace of business and be ignored because I look different, maybe I act \ndifferently?\n  That is what people with disabilities live with every day. They know \ntheir hold on this is tenuous. I can understand very deeply the concern \nthat people with disabilities all over America have about this \nindividual, the deep concern they have, because they see in Mr. Sutton \nthe personification of all of the people in their lives who made life \nharder for them, people who had a view that was narrow, who said that \nsomehow our National Government cannot do anything to secure their \ncivil rights, they only have to look to the State.\n  I will have more to say about Mr. Sutton. I will close with this. On \nthat National Public Radio broadcast I talked about, he also said:\n\n       I think it is a positive attribute of this system of \n     divided government that when 51 different sovereigns, 51 \n     different legislatures tackle a difficult social problem, \n     they all arrive at different approaches. And the ultimate \n     idea and really transcendent purpose of federalism is to have \n     them compete for the best solution.\n\n  That is his personal view. He was not representing anyone. This is \nJeffrey Sutton talking:\n\n       I think it is a positive attribute of this system of \n     divided government that when 51 different sovereigns, 51 \n     different legislatures tackle a difficult social problem, \n     they all arrive at different approaches. And the ultimate \n     idea and really transcendent purpose of federalism is to have \n     it compete for the best solution.\n\n  What happens when a State wins in these competitions? Do they get a \nprize? What happens to the people who are in the losing States? Are \nthey just unlucky? What about Pat Garrett? Obviously, Alabama was not \ncompeting to have the best antidisability discrimination laws in the \ncountry.\n  I would be the first to say that one of the great things about our \nsystem of government is, it does allow for experimentation in different \nStates. It allows different States to approach problems differently. \nOut of that we do get not a top-down, one-size-fits-all type of \ngovernment. That is one of the beauties of our system. But when it \ncomes to fundamental issues of fairness and justice and equity, when it \ncomes to the basic, fundamental issues of civil rights, I say again, \nyour civil rights as an American citizen should not depend on your \naddress. It should not depend upon the shadow of States rights. It \nshould depend upon the sunshine of being a U.S. citizen and having the \nFederal Government make sure that our civil rights are protected no \nmatter where we are.\n  Again, if we want to have competition among States on education and \ntransportation and all kinds of different things, that is fine. But on \nfundamental, basic civil rights, one law, one Constitution, one Bill of \nRights that covers us all.\n  Mr. Sutton is going to be before us. He is not now, but I understand \nhe will be as soon as we come back. I wanted to start the debate. Quite \nfrankly, I don't think Mr. Sutton has received the kind of attention \nand the kind of discourse and debate in this body that a circuit judge \nof his stature deserves, at least one who has this background and one \nwho by his statements invites this kind of controversy.\n  We have approved circuit court judges around here almost on voice \nvote, 98 to nothing, 96 to nothing. I have joined in that. The people \nwere not only qualified, but they didn't raise these kinds of troubling \nquestions about how they will deal with fundamental civil rights laws. \nBut Jeffrey Sutton does. He raises those issues. He has done it on his \nown.\n  I will have more to say about his statements when we come back. I am \nhopeful--not in a vindictive sense or anything like that--that this \nSenate will disapprove of putting Mr. Sutton on the court, thereby \nsending a very loud and strong message to people with disabilities all \nover this country that we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act \nwith our eyes wide open; that we knew what we were doing; that we \nassembled the data. We had all of the evidence we needed. We compiled \nthe record, and we want to keep it as the law of the land--as the civil \nrights law of the United States.\n\n  It would be a powerful message because I can tell you this. If \nJeffrey Sutton ascends to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, Americans \nwith disabilities all over this country will see the hands of the clock \nturning backward--back, back to the days of discrimination, back to \nthose days when they were afraid to enter that door, or to demand their \nrights as an American citizen, as a human being. I believe it is going \nto cause people with disabilities to wonder whose side we are on.\n  Whose side are we really on? I hope we are on the side of civil \nrights.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the comments \nmade by my good friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  I was also a cosponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and I \nbelieve very much in that legislation and its goals. It is one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation that I have worked on during my \ntenure in the Senate. I can certainly understand my distinguished \ncolleague's concerns about the limitations that the Supreme Court \nplaced on the Act in their decision in Garrett. However, I do not \nbelieve for one minute that Mr. Sutton's representation of the State of \nAlabama is in any way indicative of an agenda, personal or otherwise, \nagainst Americans with disabilities.\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\n  Even the People for the American Way has conceded, ``No one has \nseriously contended that Sutton is personally biased against people \nwith disabilities.'' Furthermore, Mr. Sutton's opposing counsel in the \nGarrett case, former Clinton administration Solicitor Seth P. Waxman, \nhas written to me in support of Mr. Sutton. He stated:\n\n       I know that some have questioned whether the position Mr. \n     Sutton advocated . . . in the Garrett case reflected \n     antipathy on his part toward the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act. I argued that case against Mr. Sutton, and I discerned \n     no such personal antipathy. Mr. Sutton vigorously advanced \n     the constitutional position of his client in the case, the \n     State of Alabama; doing so was entirely within the finest \n     traditions of the adversary system.\n\n  When Mr. Sutton was young, he regularly helped out at his father's \nschool for children with cerebral palsy. As Ohio State Solicitor, he \nrepresented Cheryl Fisher, a blind woman who was refused admission to \nmedical school. Ms. Fisher wrote of Mr. Sutton, ``I recall with much \npride just how committed Jeff was to my cause. He cared and listened \nand wanted badly to win for me. It was then I realized just how \nfortunate I was to have a lawyer of Mr. Sutton's caliber so devoted to \nworking for me and the countless of others with both similar \ndisabilities and dreams.''\n  In National Coalition of Students with Disabilities v. Taft, Mr. \nSutton successfully argued that Ohio universities were violating the \nfederal motor-voter law by failing to provide disabled students with \nvoter registration materials. Benson A. Wolman, former Director of the \nACLU for Ohio and currently a member of its National Advisory Council, \nwho recruited Mr. Sutton to work on the case, wrote:\n\n       [Mr. Sutton's] commitment to individual rights, his \n     civility as an opposing counsel, his sense of fairness, his \n     devotion to civic responsibilities, and his keen and \n     demonstrated intellect all reflect the best that is to be \n     found in the legal profession.\n\n  Mr. Sutton also serves on the Board of the Equal Justice Foundation, \na public interest organization that provides pro bono legal services to \nthe disadvantaged. During his tenure on the board, the Foundation has \nsued three Ohio cities to force them to build curb cuts to make their \nsidewalks wheelchair accessible, sued an amusement park company that \nbanned disabled individuals from their rides, represented a mentally \ndisabled woman in an eviction proceeding against her landlord who tried \nto evict her based on her disability, and represented a girl with \ntubercular sclerosis in a case alleging that the school was not \nproperly handling her individual education plan.\n  I have received other letters from those who work in the disabled \ncommunity who support Mr. Sutton. Francis Beytagh, Legal Director of \nthe National Center for Law and the Handicapped, wrote:\n\n       I believe Jeff Sutton would make an excellent federal \n     appellate judge. He is a very bright, articulate and \n     personable individual who values fairness highly . . . I do \n     not regard him as a predictable ideologue . . . I recommend \n     and support his confirmation without reservation.\n\n  James Leonard, co-director of the University of Alabama's Disability \nLaw Institute, writes:\n\n       In my opinion, Jeffery Sutton is well-qualified to sit on \n     the Sixth Circuit Court and should be confirmed . . . I also \n     see no ``agenda'' on Mr. Sutton's part to target disabled \n     citizens . . . Just as I would not infer an anti-disabled \n     agenda from Mr. Sutton's participation in Garrett, neither \n     would I assume from his role in the Fisher case that he had \n     the opposite inclination. Rather, he seemed to be a good \n     lawyer acting in his client's interests.\n\n  Beverly Long, Immediate Past President of the World Federation of \nMental Health and former Commissioner of President Carter's Commission \non Mental Health writes:\n       I have followed news reports of the intense lobbying \n     against Mr. Sutton by various people who advocate on behalf \n     of the disabled. This effort is unfortunate and, I am \n     convinced, misguided. I have no doubt that Mr. Sutton would \n     be an outstanding circuit court judge and would rule fairly \n     in all cases, including those involving persons with \n     disabilities.\n\n  In addition, my good friend from Iowa mentioned that he sat next to \nSenator Robert Dole at the Garrett arguments. Senator Dole, who has \nalways been a great champion of disability rights, has of course joined \nthe chorus of those who have written in support of Mr. Sutton.\n  There is simply no evidence to suggest that Mr. Sutton took the \nGarrett case due to any personal agenda. It is a well-established \nprinciple in the legal profession that lawyers should not be held \nresponsible for the positions of their clients. The ABA Model Rules of \nProfessional Conduct state, ``A lawyer's representation of a client, \nincluding representation by appointment, does not constitute an \nendorsement of the client's political, economic, social or moral views \nor activities.'' Lawyers from across the country have written \nsuggesting that it is not appropriate to attribute a client's views to \nthe attorney, and it is certainly not appropriate in Mr. Sutton's case \nspecifically.\n  My distinguished colleagues' own constituent and good friend Bonnie \nCampbell is included in those lawyers. She wrote, ``I strongly urge the \nSenate to reject any unfair inference that Mr. Sutton's personal views \nmust coincide with positions he has advocated on behalf of clients. It \nis, of course, the role of the advocate to raise the strongest \navailable arguments on behalf of a client's litigation position \nregardless of the lawyer's personal convictions on the proper legal, \nlet alone policy, outcome of the case. I am confident that Mr. Sutton \nhas the ability, temperament, and objectivity to be an excellent \njudge.''\n  In the Garrett case, Mr. Sutton was advocating for his client, the \nState of Alabama. Just as accused murderers are entitled to \nrepresentation under the laws of this country, so are state \ngovernments. Mr. Sutton has represented them both. We cannot attribute \nthe position of the State of Alabama to Mr. Sutton, and we should not \ndisparage him for fulfilling his ethical duty of zealous advocacy to \nhis client. If the Supreme Court chose to accept the arguments he put \nforth on behalf of his client, we must respect its decision. While some \nof us who worked so hard on that legislation understandably may be \ndisappointed, that disappointment should not be directed at Mr. Sutton. \nThe principle of judicial review is well-established; Mr. Sutton \nethically and honorably was fulfilling his role as an advocate. He has \nno personal agenda against Americans with disabilities. I have no doubt \nthat if confirmed, Mr. Sutton will give any disabled American that \ncomes before him a trial that is fair, impartial, and consistent with \nall our notions of justice.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5323-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues in honoring \nthe memory of our dear friend and colleague, Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan. Millie and I extend our deepest condolences and prayers to \nhis wife Elizabeth and the Moynihan family.\n  History will remember Daniel Patrick Moynihan as one of the most \nprescient American voices on public policy and international relations \nissues for the second half of the 20th Century. As a professor, author, \nadviser to four Presidents, Ambassador to India, and Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations, he had a rich and distinguished career, and a \ntremendous impact on our Nation's public policy and foreign relations, \nprior to his election to the Senate.\n  In the Senate, Pat Moynihan's illustrious service to his country and \nto his constituents in New York for four terms in the world's greatest \ndeliberative body gave greater truth to that appellation. Many of my \ncolleagues have spoken of Senator Moynihan's intellect, the \nencyclopedic width and breadth of his knowledge on an incredible range \nof public policy issues--history, architecture, culture, and \nphilosophy, to name a few. He used the power of his intellect, along \nwith great wit and dogged persistence, to fashion a record of \naccomplishments in the Senate that stands as a testament to his \ncommitment to the preservation of the\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nfamily and the welfare of children and the poor, his staunch and \nprincipled opposition to communism and totalitarianism, his dedication \nto civil rights, the Constitution, and the rules and traditions of the \nSenate, and his passion for historic preservation and architectural \ndistinction.\n  As chairman and ranking member of several Senate committees, and \nfrequently, as a clarion on the Senate floor, Pat Moynihan helped shape \ntransportation policy, international trade, intelligence matters, \nforeign policy, and economic and fiscal affairs that strengthened our \nNation and our communities. For his myriad achievements, I don't think \nSenator Moynihan has received the credit he deserves for his role in \nshaping and shepherding through the Senate President Clinton's deficit \nreduction and economic plan in 1993. I remember that in the midst of \nall the responsibilities and pressures he faced as chairman of the \nFinance Committee, he responded to my request to discuss a few tax \nissues of particular importance to Hawaii by inviting me to his office \nfor a cordial and illuminating discussion on an array of subjects. Pat \nMoynihan was always generous with his time and his wisdom. He served \nhis country and the people of New York with elan, style, and grace. He \nwill always be remembered as the gentleman from New York.\n  We mourn for his passing from this life, but we and future \ngenerations will continue to find inspiration, guidance, and courage in \nthe splendid legacy of public service bequeathed the Nation by this \nbrilliant statesman and patriot.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan--whose words, thoughts, and deeds will forever \nreverberate throughout this Chamber and, indeed, throughout our \ncountry. I also extend my most heartfelt sympathies to his wife Liz and \nSenator Moynihan's entire family. We share in their profound sense of \nloss.\n  I was privileged to serve with Senator Moynihan from 1995, when I \nfirst arrived in the Senate, to his retirement in 2001. He was one of \nthose truly legendary figures on the political landscape, but it was a \nreputation built not on procedural savvy or the brokering of power, but \nrather on the crafting and expression of ideas. It was the process of \ntransforming intellectual thought into action--and not simply the \nprocess of politics--that will always remain the hallmark of Senator \nMoynihan's entire, exceptional life.\n  His was a life not wanting for opportunities to contribute. The \ncurriculum vitae of Daniel Patrick Moynihan reads more as a biography \nof a man driven to synthesize the world of academics with the realm of \npolitics in order to make a difference--and he did to wherever he \nserved, whether at the Labor Department or at Harvard or as U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations or in the Senate. Perhaps most \nimpressive of all, no man or woman is requested to serve four different \nPresidents--of both parties, no less--unless they possess and exhibit \nonly the most extraordinary qualities that engender the kind of trust a \nPresident must have in an advisor and confidant.\n  It could certainly never be said that Senator Moynihan equivocated on \nan opinion for fear of controversy. If he spoke--or wrote, which he did \noften and well--you always knew it was a viewpoint born of a careful \nstudy of history and a keen eye on contemporary society. He believed \nthat society could be influenced to change itself for the better \nthrough its leaders--indeed, that those in a position to leave such a \nmark are obliged to do so.\n\n  Daniel Patrick Moynihan was a Democrat, but he was less about party \nand more about policies that would build a better country for all \nAmericans--regardless of whatever political stamp such initiatives \nmight bear. As Jonathan Alter so pointedly observed in his column in \ntribute to Senator Moynihan, he ``consistently frustrated the foolishly \nconsistent.''\n  In my own experience, I was privileged to work with him across the \nparty aisle on a number of issues important to our region of the \ncountry, and also to men and women across the Nation. We worked \ntogether to try to strengthen and improve welfare reform in 1996, to \nenhance treatment under the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \nDetection Program for uninsured women, to bolster our Nation's \ntransportation system, and to encourage private sector investment in \nbringing more advance Internet access to the people of rural America.\n  We also joined forces on numerous occasions to ensure that the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program was funded at levels sufficient \nto help those families in the cold and in need. And, together, we \nfought to ensure the Northeast States that were devastated by the \nhistoric ice storm of 1998 received the Federal assistance they \nrequired, and deserved.\n  Throughout his tenure, regardless of whether one agreed or disagreed \non an individual issue, it could always be said that Senator Moynihan \nwas a thoughtful, gentlemanly force for good. He had an influence on \ncountless social policy initiatives over his tenure, offered his views \nfor strengthening and protecting Social Security, and fought tirelessly \non behalf of causes a diverse as public transportation and teaching \nhospitals.\n  Above all, he was never superficial, and he had the ability to see--\nand foresee--what others could not. Indeed, how fitting that a man of \nideas would serve a nation founded on ideas. Senator Moynihan stood at \nthe intersection of intellect, insight, and integrity, and in so doing \nleft a lasting and positive impact on the people of the State of New \nYork and the United States of America.\n  George Bernard Shaw said that ``Life is no brief candle to me--it is \nlike a splendid torch which I have hold of for the moment and I want it \nto burn as brightly as possible before handing it over to the next \ngeneration.'' That is the credo by which Daniel Patrick Moynihan lived \nhis life, and we are the beneficiaries of his extraordinary spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5324-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5324-S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN HONOR OF RUTH BURNETT OF FAIRBANKS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's \nattention the dedicated service of one of my employees and great \nfriends, Ruth Burnett. Ruth runs my Fairbanks office and has been a \nfixture with her husband, Wally, in the Fairbanks community for almost \n50 years. All of her children have worked in my Washington office at \none time or another, but currently Ruth is the only Burnett on my \nstaff.\n  April 19 is Ruth's birthday and one which commemorates a year that \nshe will be happy to have behind her--as Queen Elizabeth once remarked, \n``an annum horribulous.'' Last fall, Ruth was diagnosed with ovarian \ncancer, underwent surgery, and immediately began an aggressive \ntreatment of chemotherapy. By her birthday next week she will have \ncompleted her chemotherapy protocol and will begin rebuilding her \nstrength. Her son Shane and daughters Pam and Suzy will join Wally and \nRuth in Fairbanks to celebrate her birthday.\n  I could go on about Ruth's courage, her ever-optimistic outlook on \nlife, her faith, and her boundless energy, but I think an article \nwritten by her 10-year-old granddaughter Emily Combs captures Ruth \nquite well. Catherine and I and my entire staff who work with Ruth on a \ndaily basis send her our warmest wishes for a happy birthday and the \nbeginning of a great new year.\n  I know the Senate joins me in wishing Ruth and her family well on the \noccasion of her birthday and in wishing her a speedy recovery.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a short story by Emily Combs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                          The Incredible Jump\n\n                  (By Emily Combs, September 19, 2002)\n\n       We looked ahead as we were peddling away when we saw a \n     pretty steep mound of dirt. Surprisingly my grandma yelled \n     excitedly, ``Let's jump it!'' I wanted to shout ``no,'' but \n     no one can change grandma's mind once it's set. My grandma \n     Ruth is amazing! She is sixty-eight years old, has brown \n     hair, goes to church every Sunday and works for U.S. Senator \n     Ted Stevens.\n       Apart from being a great athlete, my grandma looks \n     fantastic. Her eyes are a brilliant blue, and have a sparkle \n     to them when something exciting is going to happen. My \n     grandma's hair is a walnut brown. Shed stands about five feet \n     seven inches tall.\n       In addition, going to church is one of the biggest parts in \n     my grandma's life. She goes to church every Sunday and is an \n     elder at the church. Whenever they need help with a sermon, \n     she's always willing to help as much\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\n     as possible. She helps collect the offerings, and when I am \n     in Alaska, I help her.\n       After my grandma was mayor of Fairbanks, she became an \n     assistant for U.S. Senator Ted Stevens. She runs his office \n     in Fairbanks. She helps people in the community contact the \n     government or Senator Stevens. If a person needs help \n     concerning a problem with the government, my grandma will \n     help them.\n       My grandma and I saw the jump coming closer. We were on the \n     jump, then crash! I went off crooked into some bushes, but my \n     grandma was still going straight. That does not surprise me \n     because my grandma is so incredible. My grandma Ruth is very \n     beautiful and never misses a day of church or work. I wish \n     everyone had a great grandma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5325-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WELCOMING OUR NEW DEPUTY SERGEANT AT ARMS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

In 1977, Keith was tapped by Senator Hatfield to \nserve as a professional staff member on the Senate Select Committee on \nIndian Affairs.

Her mother, Jan Jones, was the successful \nand legendary mayor of Las Vegas for 8 years. Maura worked with her \nmother on her campaigns for Mayor, and now she continues her service to \nNevada working for Congresswoman Shelley Berkley.

Madam President, I rise today to join with my fellow \nMarylanders and all Americans in celebrating the 35th anniversary of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1968. On April 11, 1968, President Lyndon \nJohnson signed this historic act, one of several landmark pieces of \nlegislation that helped ensure equal treatment for people of all races, \nand helped bring to life the original founding principles of our \nNation.\n  In 1964, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which \nmade segregation in public facilities and discrimination in employment \nillegal. This remarkable piece of legislation was followed up 4 years \nlater with the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which contained the Fair \nHousing Act that prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, and \nfinancing of housing.\n  This law helps to ensure that people of all races have opportunities \nto live where they choose. The housing pattern in the early 1960s was \none of almost complete segregation. In 1967, 80 percent of all \nnonwhites living in metropolitan areas lived in the central city, while \nup to one-third of all new factories and stores were locating outside \nof the central city areas. Equal access to housing was seen not only as \na basic right by legislators and advocates, but it was also seen as key \nto increased employment opportunities. In order for people of all \nracial groups to advance economically, they needed access to jobs, and \nhousing near those jobs was being denied to African Americans and \nothers in this country.\n  Unfortunately, 35 years after its passage, the Fair Housing Act is \nstill needed because discrimination in housing continues. Too many \nminorities, disabled people, and families are unable to live where they \nchoose because of discrimination. Each year, thousands of people turn \nto the Department for Housing and Urban Development and agencies around \nthe country because they have been denied decent and safe housing based \npurely on their race, ethnicity, disability or familial status. As we \ncelebrate the anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, an act that promised \nthat we as a nation would work to ensure that all people had equal \naccess to areas of opportunity, we must do more to act on that promise \nand make it a reality. The Fair Housing Act must be better enforced, so \nthat people around the country understand that we take the act and its \nprotections seriously.\n  I also want to remind people that, even after achieving the American \ndream of homeownership, we must remain vigilant. Each year, many \nhomeowners, particularly minority homeowners, are stripped of the \nwealth and equity they have accumulated in their homes over many years \nby the unscrupulous practices of predatory lending. The Federal \nGovernment took a small step to guard against this abuse when it passed \nthe Home Owners and Equity Protection Act in 1994. However, we need to \ndo more, and I intend to press legislation to move this part of the \ncivil rights agenda forward.\n  While we continue to make progress to ensure that people of all races \nare treated equally, we should also honor those great civil rights \nleaders who gave us their vision of equality. President Johnson signed \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1968 just a week after Martin Luther King, Jr., \nwas assassinated at a hotel in Memphis, TN, affirming that despite this \nNation's great loss, the legacy of Dr. King would live on. We must \ncontinue to recognize and honor the remarkable achievements and the \nultimate sacrifice of Dr. King.\n  In order to remember and preserve Dr. King's legacy, the Martin \nLuther King, Jr., Memorial Project Foundation is in the process of \nplanning and building a memorial on The Mall to Dr. King. The process \nhas been ongoing for several years, and I have recently offered \nlegislation that would extend the legislative authority for the \nmemorial by an additional 3 years. This legislation would give the \nfoundation the extra time that it needs to complete this important \nproject. Visitors will be able to come to the memorial from every part \nof this country, and indeed the world, to be inspired anew by Dr. \nKing's words and deeds and the extraordinary story of his life.\n  The civil rights movement inspired by Dr. King and others changed the \nlives of all Americans for the better. However, we can do more to live \nup to the expectations that he and others set for our Nation. In \ncelebrating the anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, we are \nreminded of how far we have come, and how far we have yet to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5325-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5325-S5331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF TITLE IX OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today to offer the following \nsection-by-section analysis of Title IX of the ``Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n2002,'' P.L. 107-204, of which I was the primary author along with my \ngood friend from Utah, Senator Hatch. Title IX was derived\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\nfrom S. 2717, the ``White-Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of \n2002,'' which I introduced with Senator Hatch on July 10, 2002. That \nsame day, Senator Hatch and I offered the text of S. 2717 as a floor \namendment to the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investment \nProtection Act of 2002, S. 2673. Our amendment was unanimously adopted \nby the Senate on July 10, 2002, by a 96-0 vote. S. 2673 was \noverwhelmingly approved, as amended with the inclusion of S. 2717, on \nJuly 15, 2002, by a vote of 97-0. S. 2673 then went to a House-Senate \nconference. The Biden-Hatch amendment was retained in the final \nconference report as Title IX, and in substantially identical form to \nthat in S. 2673. The conference report, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, H.R. \n3763, was passed by the Senate on July 25, 2002, by a 99-0 vote. The \nPresident signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into law on July 30, 2002.\n  As I mentioned, Title IX of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, entitled the \n``White-Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002,'' closely mirrors \nthe original S. 2717. In order to provide guidance in the legal \ninterpretation of these provisions, I have compiled the following \nanalysis and discussion, which are intended to augment, and not \nsupplant, the legislative history and explanatory statements that \naccompanied passage of H.R. 3763. This legislative history is intended \nalso to supplement my remarks at the time of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's \nfinal passage. See S7426-S7425 (July 26, 2002). I ask unanimous consent \nthat this section-by-section analysis be included in the Congressional \nRecord as part of the official legislative history of these provisions.\n  The content of Title IX was developed partly in response to a series \nof white-collar crime hearings I held in my capacity as Chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs. Through those \nhearings, the subcommittee heard from a wide range of witnesses with \nexpertise in both corporate law and white-collar crime--including \ncurrent and former high-ranking officials from the United States \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the United States Departments \nof Justice and Treasury, and the Federal Reserve; business and law \nprofessors; corporate practitioners; as well as victims of corporate \nfraud.\n  The first hearing, held on June 19, 2002, focused on the disparity in \nsentences between white-collar offenses, including pension fraud, and \nfederal ``street crimes'' like car theft. Specifically, the hearing \nexplored four broad areas: it focused on the human consequences of \nwhite-collar crimes; defined and quantified the problem, including an \nevaluation of the use of the criminal sanction against white-collar \ncriminals and the severity of penalties typically imposed; explored the \nreasons that might explain the lighter sentences that white-collar \noffenders often receive; and discussed recent amendments to the federal \nsentencing guidelines that purport to address the historic, disparate \ntreatment of economic crimes. The first-panel witnesses included \nCharles Prestwood, a retiree who lost his retirement savings in the \nbankruptcy of the Enron Corporation; Janice Farmer, a retiree who \nsimilarly lost her retirement savings in the Enron bankruptcy; and \nHoward Deputy, a former employee of the Metachem Company in Delaware \nwho was at risk of losing a portion of his pension in Metachem's \nbankruptcy. The second-panel witnesses included James B. Comey, United \nStates Attorney for the Southern District of New York; Glen B. Gainer, \nChairman of the Board of Directors of the National White Collar Crime \nCenter and West Virginia State Auditor; Bradley Skolnik, Chief of the \nEnforcement Section of the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation and Securities Commissioner for the State of Indiana; Frank \nO. Bowman, Associate Law Professor at the University of Indiana School \nof Law; and Paul Rosenzweig, Senior Legal Research Fellow at the \nHeritage Foundation.\n  The second hearing, held on July 10, 2002, also addressed the \nadequacy of criminal penalties for white-collar crimes and evaluated \nthe use of the criminal sanction to deter wrongdoing and encourage \ncorporate responsibility. We were particularly interested in learning \nwhether the current federal criminal law, as opposed to civil \nenforcement mechanisms, was sufficient to address the range of \ncorporate scandals that were then unfolding. Specifically, the hearing \naddressed the issue through the lense of the recent accounting \nscandals--exploring the pattern of corporate irresponsibility and the \ncultural and economic conditions that made the scandals possible; the \nimpact of the scandals on investor confidence and economic health; and \nthe need for investor protection and anti-fraud legislation which \nincludes stiffened criminal penalties. The first-panel witnesses \nincluded Michael Chertoff, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \nDivision at the United States Department of Justice; and William W. \nMercer, United States Attorney for the District of Montana and head of \nthe United States Attorneys' White-Collar Crime Working Group. The \nsecond-panel witnesses included John C. Coffee, Jr., Adolf A. Berle \nProfessor of Law at Columbia University School of Law; Thomas \nDonaldson, Mark O. Winkelman Professor at the Wharton School of \nBusiness at the University of Pennsylvania; Charles M. Elson, Edgar S. \nWoolard, Jr. Chair at the Center for Corporate Governance at the \nUniversity of Delaware; George Terwilliger, former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral at the United States Department of Justice; and Tom Devine, \nLegal Director at the Government Accountability Project.\n  The third hearing, held on July 24, 2002, continued the discussion \ninitiated in the earlier hearings and featured three former, high-\nranking officials in the Executive Branch who commented on a host of \nsuggested reforms--including S. 2717 which, by that time, had been \namended to the Senate precursor to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the Public \nCompany Accounting Reform and Investment Protection Act of 2002, S. \n2673). The witnesses included G. William Miller, former Secretary of \nthe Treasury under President Carter and former Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board; Roderick Hills, former Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission under President Ford; and James Doty, former \nGeneral Counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission and head of \nthe corporate and securities practice at Baker Botts LLP.\n  On a final note, the legislation was introduced and subsequently \nenacted against the backdrop of the Sentencing Commission's ongoing \nefforts in the area of economic crime. We are aware of the ``Economic \nCrime Package,'' which was approved by the Commission in April 2001 and \nwent into effect in November 2001. These amendments to the federal \nsentencing guidelines consolidated the guidelines for theft, property \ndestruction, and fraud offenses; revised the definition of ``loss,'' \nwhich largely informs the range of sentencing available for an offense; \nincreased penalties for offenses involving moderate and high-dollar \nlosses and reduced penalties on some lower-level offenses; and revised \nthe loss table for tax offenses to provide for higher penalty levels \nfor offenses involving moderate and high tax losses. Title IX was \ndeveloped and enacted with full awareness of these new amendments to \nthe guidelines.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSection-By-Section Analysis and Discussion of the ``White-Collar Crime \n       Penalty Enhancements Act of 2002'' (Title IX of H.R. 3763)\n\n     Section 901. Short Title\n       This section designates this title of the Act as the \n     ``White-Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002.''\n     Section 902. Attempts and Conspiracies To Commit Criminal \n         Fraud Offenses\n       This section adds a new provision to the United States Code \n     (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1349), which indicates that any person who \n     attempts or conspires to commit a fraud offense under Chapter \n     63 of Title 18 (in other words, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1341-\n     1348) shall face the same penalties as those provided for in \n     the predicate, or underlying, offense that was the object of \n     the attempt or the conspiracy. (While 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2 \n     currently provides for the same penalties for aiding and \n     abetting offenses as the predicate crimes, prosecution under \n     that section requires the government to prove some \n     affirmative act by the defendant. In contrast, prosecution \n     under Section 902 requires no affirmative act, but only an \n     agreement to commit a future crime, as is the case with 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 371.)\n       During hearings by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and \n     Drugs on the ``penalty gap'' between white-collar offenses \n     and\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\n     other federal crimes, we observed that defendants charged \n     with conspiracy pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 were afforded \n     a potential windfall in terms of their sentence, vis-a-vis \n     their co-defendants who were convicted of the actual \n     offenses. That windfall resulted because the charge of \n     conspiracy under Section 371 only subjects a convicted \n     individual to a maximum imprisonment term of 5 years. In \n     contrast, certain fraud offenses in Chapter 63 carry maximum \n     penalties of up to 30 years imprisonment, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1344 (imposing up to 30 years imprisonment for bank \n     fraud). In the case of a particularly egregious bank fraud \n     case, then, one co-defendant could receive a 30-year sentence \n     while an equally culpable co-conspirator would receive only a \n     5-year sentence.\n       Congress responded by creating a new Section 1349 for \n     defendants who attempt or conspire to commit a financial \n     fraud under Chapter 63 of Title 18. The Justice Department \n     may now elect to charge a fraud conspirator under this new \n     section, rather than pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371, thereby \n     preserving the same maximum penalties. In enacting this new \n     section, we harmonize the penalties for financial fraud \n     conspiracy with those of narcotics offenses. See 21 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 846 (``[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit \n     any [narcotics] offense defined in this subchapter shall be \n     subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the \n     offense, the commission of which was the object of the \n     attempt or conspiracy.'')\n     Section 903. Criminal Penalties for Mail and Wire Fraud\n       This section increases the potential maximum term of \n     imprisonment available upon conviction for mail fraud (18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1341) or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343) from 5 \n     years to 20 years. Fraud affecting financial institutions in \n     both Sections 1341 and 1343 of Title 18 is unaffected by this \n     section, so the potential maximum term of imprisonment for \n     this offense remains 30 years.\n       By raising the criminal penalties for Sections 1341 and \n     1343, we intended to harmonize the penalties for mail and \n     wire fraud with the penalties for other serious financial \n     crimes. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1348 (25-year maximum \n     penalty for securities fraud); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(a)(3)(A) \n     (20-year maximum penalty for money laundering); 18 U.S.C. \n     1962 (20-year maximum penalty for racketeering). In addition, \n     we intended to ensure that the penalty structure for these \n     offenses was sufficiently stiff to provide a real deterrent \n     effect. As support for that aim, the Subcommittee on Crime \n     and Drugs heard testimony from several witnesses who insisted \n     that (1) these federal penalties should be toughened; and (2) \n     in order to deter misconduct, offenders should be subject to \n     some amount of actual incarceration.\n       For example, the Honorable James B. Comey, Jr., the United \n     States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, \n     observed that ``[w]hite collar criminals have broken serious \n     laws, done grave harm to real people . . . [and] should be \n     subject to the same serious treatment that we accord all \n     serious crimes: substantial periods of incarceration. While \n     we have made significant progress on some issues in recent \n     years, especially in improving the applicable sentencing \n     guidelines, we believe that current federal penalties for \n     white collar offenses should be toughened.'' Testimony of \n     Comey before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and \n     Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 2. He continued: ``[E]nforcement can \n     be undermined when criminals perceive the risk of \n     incarceration as minimal and view fines and probation merely \n     as a cost of doing their criminal business. We believe that \n     if it is unmistakable that the automatic consequence for one \n     who commits a significant white collar offense is prison, \n     then many will be deterred. . . . [White collar criminals] \n     commit their crimes not in a fit of passion, but with \n     cold, careful calculation. Accordingly, they are the most \n     rational offenders and are more likely than most to weigh \n     the risks of possible courses of action against the \n     anticipated rewards of criminal behavior.'' Testimony of \n     Comey before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime \n     and Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 4.\n       The Honorable Michael Chertoff, Assistant Attorney General \n     for the Criminal Division at the United States Department of \n     Justice, echoed this sentiment: ``We believe that strong \n     enforcement and tough penalties are especially important in \n     the context of white collar crimes, because business \n     criminals act with calculation rather than in a fit of anger \n     or compulsion. Because white collar criminals act more \n     rationally than most other criminals, they can more easily be \n     deterred. In our experience, one thing is crystal clear: \n     businessmen and women want to avoid jail at any cost. If \n     their calculus includes a reasonable likelihood that they \n     will be caught, and if caught, a reasonable likelihood that \n     they will go to jail rather than get probation, home \n     detention, or some other alternative to incarceration,' they \n     will be much less willing to roll the dice and commit a \n     fraud.'' Testimony of Chertoff before the Senate Judiciary \n     Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 10, 2002, p. 3; see \n     also Testimony of G. William Miller, former Secretary of the \n     Treasury and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \n     before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, \n     July 24, 2002, p. 3-4 (``[T]he greed that drives the recent \n     rash of alleged corporate wrongdoing is fostered by the \n     criminal's belief that the rewards are great and the \n     possibility of more than nominal punishment is low. For the \n     corporate wrongdoer the deterrent is only likely to be \n     effective if there is a high likelihood of detection and a \n     high probability of serious punishment. The most powerful \n     deterrent is the threat of jail time. The prospect of \n     substantial monetary penalties also can affect behavior.''); \n     Testimony of Bradley Skolnik, Securities Commissioner of the \n     State of Indiana and Chairman of the Enforcement Division of \n     the North American Securities Administrators Association, \n     before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, \n     June 19, 2002, p. 2, 3 (``Investor education is an effective \n     crime prevention tool but the strongest deterrent to crime, I \n     believe is criminal prosecution and prison time. . . . [F]rom \n     my perspective as a state securities regulator, white-collar \n     criminals who commit securities fraud deserve prison time \n     just like thieves, muggers and murderers. . . . Someone \n     steals your car, they go to prison; some con artist steals \n     the money your parents needed for retirement, they get fined. \n     That's just not right.'') ``Jail time performs two \n     functions,'' Chertoff explained. ``It holds white collar \n     criminals accountable for their past misdeeds, and it \n     prevents future misbehavior by those executives who might toy \n     with the idea of beating the system.'' Testimony of Chertoff \n     before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, \n     July 10, 2002, p. 5.\n     Section 904. Criminal Penalties for Violations of the \n         Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n       This section increases the maximum criminal penalties for a \n     willful violation of the reporting and disclosure provisions \n     of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Title \n     I, subtitle B, part 1, or any regulation or order issued \n     thereunder. Section 904 increases the maximum fine for an \n     individual defendant convicted under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1131 from \n     $5,000 to $100,000, and the maximum term of imprisonment from \n     1 year to 10 years. The increased maximum term of \n     imprisonment converts the offense from a misdemeanor to a \n     felony. In addition, this section increases the maximum fine \n     for a convicted organizational defendant from $100,000 to \n     $500,000.\n       ERISA imposes on pension managers a number of reporting and \n     disclosure requirements regarding the administration of their \n     pension plans. Among other things, ERISA requires the \n     administrator of a pension plan to notify the United States \n     Department of Labor and the plan's participants and \n     beneficiaries of any material modifications in the terms of \n     the pension plan. It also creates a fiduciary relationship \n     between the pension managers and the pension plan \n     beneficiaries. Criminal penalties apply for violations of \n     Part 1 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1131, which is designed, \n     among other things, to do the following: (1) require the \n     disclosure of significant information about employee benefit \n     plans and all transactions engaged in by those who control \n     the plans; (2) provide specific data to plan participants and \n     beneficiaries about the rights and benefits to which they are \n     entitled and the circumstances that may result in a loss of \n     those rights and benefits; and (3) set forth the \n     responsibilities and proscriptions applicable to persons \n     occupying a fiduciary relationship to employee benefit plans. \n     29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1021-1031.\n       Hearings by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs \n     included a discussion of the penalty scheme under ERISA. \n     Section 1131 of ERISA only made it a criminal misdemeanor \n     ``willfully'' to violate Part 1 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1131, even though the potential harm flowing from an \n     ERISA violation could be enormous. A criminal violation of \n     Part 1 of ERISA could occur, for example, where a \n     corporation's pension administrator learns of information \n     relating to the company's financial health which, if not \n     disclosed, could result in a loss of the employees' rights \n     and benefits under the corporation's pension. (A recent study \n     by the Congressional Research Service of the Enron \n     Corporation collapse concluded that one criminal provision \n     which might be implicated is Section 1131 of ERISA. See CRS \n     Report for Congress, ``Possible Criminal Provisions Which May \n     Be Implicated in the Events Surrounding the Collapse of the \n     Enron Corporation,'' RS21177 (March 25, 2002)). In enacting \n     Section 904, Congress concluded that the disproportionately \n     low ERISA penalty constituted one of the ``penalty gaps'' \n     between white-collar offenses and other federal crimes. For \n     example, a defendant convicted of interstate auto theft is \n     subject to up to 10 years in prison, regardless of the value \n     of the stolen automobile. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2312. In contrast, a \n     defendant who violates ERISA--but no other federal fraud \n     statute--was only subject to a maximum penalty of 1 year in \n     prison, regardless of the value of the loss to an employee's \n     pension.\n       While a defendant who violates the criminal provisions of \n     ERISA may also violate another federal felony statute with \n     higher penalties, that will not always be the case. \n     Accordingly, the intention of this provision is to provide \n     federal prosecutors with an appropriate felony charge to \n     combat willful criminal conduct which devastates \n     employees' pension holdings. The United States Sentencing \n     Commission recognized that there are instances when an \n     ERISA criminal violation occurs in the absence of any \n     other federal criminal offense. The United States \n     Sentencing Guideline provision for the ERISA criminal \n     violation is USSG Sec. 2E5.3, entitled ``False Statements \n     and Concealment of Facts in Relation to Documents Required \n     by the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\n     Act.'' The background notes to Sec. 2E5.3 provide that \n     ``this section covers the falsification of documents or \n     records relating to a benefit plan covered by ERISA.'' The \n     background note to Sec. 2E5.3 recognizes that while ERISA \n     violations ``sometimes occur in connection'' with other \n     federal offenses, they do not always thus occur. The base \n     offense level under Sec. 2E5.3 for a ``stand-alone'' ERISA \n     violation, absent any other violation, is only 6.\n       If the ERISA criminal offense is accompanied by another \n     criminal violation, however, the guidelines direct the \n     application of USSG Sec. 2B1.1, which addresses fraud, theft \n     and other white-collar offenses (which has a base offense \n     level of 6, but may increase to a level of 32 depending on \n     the monetary value of the loss). Thus, under prior law, if a \n     defendant violated both ERISA and the mail fraud statute, \n     Sec. 2B1.1 would apply--not Sec. 2E5.3--and the defendant's \n     sentence would be calculated with the loss calculations of \n     the guidelines, and apply the higher felony maximum penalties \n     of the mail fraud statute.\n       In contrast, if the defendant were only convicted of an \n     ERISA criminal violation, the sentencing court would be \n     limited by the statutory cap in 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1131 and the \n     base offense level cap of Sec. 2E5.3. Accordingly, given the \n     relative potential for devastating economic loss to \n     pensioners who are victims of an ERISA criminal violation, it \n     is entirely appropriate for Congress to close the ``penalty \n     gap'' between ERISA and other federal statutes used to combat \n     securities fraud. Pursuant to Section 905 of the Sarbanes-\n     Oxley Act, Congress expects the Sentencing Commission to \n     examine Sec. 2E5.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines and make any \n     appropriate modifications given the enactment of Section 904.\n     Section 905. Amendment to Sentencing Guidelines Relating to \n         Certain White-Collar Offenses\n  This section directs the United States Sentencing Commission, within \n180 days of enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to review and, as \nappropriate, to amend the applicable sentencing guidelines and related \npolicy statements. Section 905(b) directs the Commission, among other \nthings, to ensure that the guidelines and policy statements reflect the \nseriousness of the offenses and the statutory increases in penalties \nset forth in the Act, the growing incidence of such fraud offenses, and \nthe need to modify the guidelines and policy statements to deter, \nprevent, and punish such offenses.\n       In passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the criminal and \n     sentencing provisions in particular, Congress was aware of \n     ongoing efforts by the Sentencing Commission to consolidate \n     certain economic crimes, as achieved through the ``Economic \n     Crime Package,'' and to study the effects of that \n     consolidation. Recognizing, however, that the length of an \n     offender's sentence is determined both by the operation of \n     the sentencing guidelines and by the strength of the \n     underlying statute, cf. Testimony of Paul Rosenzweig, Senior \n     Legal Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, before the \n     Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June 19, \n     2002, p.6 (noting that disparities in penalties are \n     principally the product of actions of Congress, i.e., the \n     criminal statutes passed by Congress), we amended the federal \n     criminal code to increase penalties significantly for certain \n     offenses (as discussed above). Our expectation is that, \n     similarly, the federal sentencing guidelines will be reviewed \n     and, where appropriate, modified accordingly.\n       Although the Commission has recently considered the \n     severity of sentences for these economic crimes, we believe \n     that further study is warranted--as did several of the \n     witnesses who testified before the Subcommittee on Crime and \n     Drugs. This is particularly so, given the new and increased \n     penalties for white-collar offenses established by Title IX. \n     For instance, the Honorable Glen B. Gainer, III, State \n     Auditor of the State of West Virginia and Chairman of the \n     National White Collar Crime Center, a non-profit organization \n     that provides support services to state and local law \n     enforcement agencies and other organizations involved in the \n     prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic crimes, \n     noted: ``In terms of sentence length, research conducted in \n     the early 90's clearly demonstrates the disparity between \n     [white-collar and so-called `street' crime offenders. Those \n     incarcerated for losses in excess of $100,000 or more as a \n     result of the savings and loan scandals received an average \n     of 36.4 months in prison. During the same time period, those \n     nonviolent federal offenders who committed burglary got 55.6 \n     months, car theft received 38 months, and first-time drug \n     dealing averaged 65 months. While some of this disparity may \n     have been corrected by revisions to the federal sentencing \n     policy for economic crimes, disparate sentencing can still be \n     seen between `white-collar' cases involving substantial \n     monetary loss, and other crimes with similar financial \n     impact.'' Testimony of Gainer before the Senate Judiciary \n     Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 4.\n       Another witness, also using data that preceded adoption of \n     the ``Economic Crime Package,'' cited statistics that \n     similarly demonstrated a disparity in sentencing between \n     traditional white-collar and other crimes: ``[D]efendants \n     convicted of larceny, embezzlement, fraud, and counterfeiting \n     who were sentenced to federal prison received average (mean) \n     sentences of 15.6 months, 9.9 months, 18 months, and 17 \n     months respectively. By contrast, robbery defendants received \n     110.6 months, drug defendants 75.3 months, and firearms \n     offenders 64.1 months. Even the average immigration sentence \n     was 27.8 months, ten months longer than the average fraud \n     penalty. Moreover, federal economic crime defendants receive \n     sentences of probation at dramatically higher rates than \n     virtually any other class of defendant. More than one-half of \n     all larceny defendants and one-third of all fraud defendants \n     receive probation.'' Testimony of Frank O. Bowman, Associate \n     Law Professor at the University of Indiana School of Law, \n     before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, \n     June 19, 2002, p. 2. Similarly, Rosenzweig observed: ``An \n     overwhelming percentage of those who were sentenced for \n     traditional crimes received sentences requiring terms of \n     imprisonment. For example, 94.2 percent of those convicted \n     of drug trafficking were sentenced to prison. 97 percent \n     of those convicted for robbery were imprisoned, as were 93 \n     percent of those convicted of arson, and 97.4 percent of \n     those convicted of murder. By contrast only 53.5 percent \n     of those convicted of fraud and 48.1 percent of those \n     convicted of embezzlement were sentenced to prison.'' \n     Testimony of Rosenzweig before the Senate Judiciary \n     Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 4.\n       While there was not a consensus regarding the reasons for, \n     or desirability of, such a penalty disparity between \n     similarly egregious infractions, many of the witnesses \n     suggested that its existence worked to undermine the \n     integrity of the criminal justice system. For example, \n     Chairman Gainer concluded: ``The conclusion we can safely \n     draw from this body of information is that white-collar \n     criminals, particularly those involved in large, complex \n     frauds that impact hundreds, if not thousands of victims, do \n     not receive punishment that is proportionate to the harm that \n     they cause.'' Testimony of Gainer before the Senate Judiciary \n     Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June 19, 2002, p. 5.\n       Finally, in its efforts to comply with the terms of this \n     title, we hope that the Sentencing Commission will take the \n     opportunity to review and advise Congress on a disturbing \n     development cited by the two witnesses from the Justice \n     Department, Assistant Attorney General Chertoff and United \n     States Attorney Comey--namely, an over-willingness in some \n     jurisdictions to depart downward from the mandated sentencing \n     guideline range for certain white-collar offenses. Justifying \n     the need to increase penalties for certain white collar \n     offenses, Chertoff explained: ``Not only are the maximum \n     statutory penalties for fraud and other white collar-type \n     offenses substantially less than those for violent offenders \n     or drug cases, but it appears that judges in some \n     jurisdictions are overly willing to depart downward from the \n     mandated federal sentencing guideline range to sentence such \n     offenders to minimal (if any) jail time, home detention, or \n     even probation.'' Testimony of Chertoff before the Senate \n     Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 10, 2002, p. \n     5.\n       Comey's comments mirrored this concern: ``[I]n some \n     districts, non-substantial assistance downward departures are \n     anything but infrequent (9,286 non-substantial assistance \n     downward departures were made in 2000). . . . While available \n     analyses do not detail the bases of these departures in white \n     collar cases, a number of district judges appear to believe \n     that white collar defendants should not be incarcerated in \n     order to facilitate payment of restitution and fines. Of \n     course, this is at odds with the view that incarceration can \n     deter such crime in the first instance. . . . [F]or a variety \n     of reasons, federal judges are hesitant to incarcerate white \n     collar defendants. If past is prologue, even though the \n     economic crime amendments of 2001 increased penalties for \n     these crimes, departures will be used to undercut the \n     purposes of the new provisions.'' Testimony of Comey before \n     the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, June \n     19, 2002, p. 17.\n       By citing this and other testimony, we underscore Congress' \n     belief that a ``penalty gap'' has existed between white-\n     collar offenses and other offenses. Congress in particular is \n     concerned about base offense levels which may be too low. The \n     increased sentences, while meant to punish the most egregious \n     offenders more severely, are also intended to raise sentences \n     at the lower end of the sentencing guidelines. While Congress \n     acknowledges that the Sentencing Commission's recent \n     amendments are a step in the right direction, the Commission \n     is again directed to consider closely the testimony adduced \n     at the hearings by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and \n     Drugs respecting the ongoing ``penalty gap'' between white-\n     collar and other offenses. To the extent that the ``penalty \n     gap'' existed, in part, by virtue of higher sentences for \n     narcotics offenses, for example, Congress responded by \n     increasing sentences for certain white-collar offenses. \n     Accordingly, we ask the Commission to consider the issues \n     raised herein; determine if adjustments are warranted in \n     light of the enhanced penalty provisions contained in this \n     title; and make recommendations accordingly.\n     Section 906. Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports\n       Summary. This section adds a new provision to the United \n     States Code (18 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\n     Sec. 1350), which requires the chief executive officer and \n     chief financial officer (or their equivalent) of an issuer, \n     foreign or domestic, to certify the accuracy of periodic \n     financial statements filed by the issuer with the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission under 15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 78m(a) or \n     78o(d). (An ``issuer'' is defined, under Section 2(a)(7) of \n     the Act, to mean an entity whose securities are registered \n     under Section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 \n     or that is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of \n     that Act.) The chief executive and financial officers must \n     certify that the periodic financial statement complies with \n     certain specified requirements of the Securities and Exchange \n     Act and that it ``fairly presents, in all material respects, \n     the financial condition and results of operations of the \n     issuer.'' Pursuant to Section 1350(c)(1), anyone who makes \n     such a certification ``knowing'' that the report accompanying \n     the certifying statement does not meet the statutory \n     requirements would, upon conviction, face up to $1 million in \n     fines, up to 10 years in prison, or both. Pursuant to Section \n     1350(c)(2), anyone who ``willfully'' certifies compliance \n     ``knowing'' that the periodic report accompanying the \n     statement does not comport with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1350 would face up to $5 million in fines, up to 20 \n     years in prison, or both.\n       Financial Reports. The backdrop to Section 906 is the long-\n     standing requirement under Section 13(a) and Section 15(d) of \n     the Securities and Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 78m(a) \n     or 78o(d)) that publicly-traded companies file reports with \n     the SEC regarding the financial well-being of the \n     corporation. See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78m(a) (``Every issuer of a \n     security . . . shall file with the Commission . . . such \n     information and documents . . . as the Commission shall \n     require to keep reasonably current the information and \n     documents required to be included in or filed with an \n     application or registration statement [and] such annual \n     reports . . . as the Commission may prescribe.'') Pursuant to \n     this provision, the SEC requires publicly-traded companies to \n     file numerous reports (e.g., Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F, 10-Q, 8-\n     K, 6-K), all intended to provide both the Commission and the \n     investing public with information regarding the financial \n     condition of the corporation. Willful failure to file these \n     periodic reports, or the making of materially \n     false statements therein, constitutes a felony. See 15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 78ff (``Any person who willfully violates any \n     provision of this chapter . . . or any person who \n     willfully and knowingly makes . . . [any] false or \n     misleading [statement] with respect to any material fact, \n     shall upon conviction be fined not more than $1,000,000, \n     or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both[.]'') (We \n     note that, in contrast to the ``willful'' standard we \n     apply in Section 906, courts have ascribed a different \n     meaning to ``willful'' violations of the 1934 Act, e.g., \n     United States v. Dixon, 536 F.2d 1388 (2d Cir. 1976) \n     (determining that an act is done ``willfully'' if it is \n     done intentionally and deliberately and not the result of \n     innocent mistake, negligence or inadvertence; a specific \n     intent to disregard or disobey is not required). As \n     explained more fully below, Congress uses ``willful'' in \n     Section 906 to create a specific intent crime, not the \n     general intent crime which courts have sometimes used in \n     interpreting the penalty provisions of the 1934 Act.) \n     While defendants have been prosecuted under 15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 78m and 78ff for filing false financial reports \n     with the SEC, see, e.g., United States v. Colasurdo, 453 \n     F.2d 585 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied. 406 U.S. 917 \n     (1972), the law has never required a company's top \n     corporate official to certify to the accuracy of the \n     company's financial reports. Section 906 closes this \n     loophole by imposing this responsibility upon the CEO and \n     CFO (or their equivalents) of all publicly-traded \n     corporations. Significantly, it does not mandate any \n     additional reporting requirements, but only applies to \n     those companies who are independently required, by \n     Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange \n     Act of 1934, to certify the accuracy of those reports. As \n     noted above, the law has always required that those \n     reports be materially accurate.\n       Executive Certification. The notion of requiring an \n     organization's primary or senior executive to certify a \n     statement submitted to the government, on threat of possible \n     criminal liability, is hardly novel. For example, Section \n     911(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1986 requires a senior executive of a defense \n     contractor to certify, to the best of his or her ``knowledge \n     and belief,'' that all costs included in a proposal for \n     settlement of indirect costs are allowable under the cost \n     principles of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and its \n     supplements. 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2324(h); 48 C.F.R. Sec. 52.242-4. \n     Like Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the regulation \n     implementing the certification requirement contained in \n     Section 911(a)(1) mandates that the certificate be executed \n     by a company's senior executives, who face potential criminal \n     liability if the representations contained in the \n     certification are shown to be inaccurate. See 10 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2324(i).\n       Such a certification of accuracy is especially important in \n     the securities context, since the robustness of financial \n     markets and the success of national securities regulation are \n     based on the full disclosure of a company's financial state. \n     During the summer of 2002, as daily reports of alleged CEO \n     criminal wrongdoing filled the news, congressional testimony \n     from finance experts touted the critical need to impose \n     responsibility upon top corporate officials in ensuring \n     accuracy in financial reports. For example, Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the Senate Committee \n     on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on July 16, 2002, the \n     day after the Senate passed S. 2673. Much of his testimony \n     focused on (1) the need for top corporate officials to report \n     accurately the financial health of their companies; and (2) \n     the need for criminal penalties for those who knowingly fail \n     to do so. Chairman Greenspan said the following: ``A CEO must \n     . . . bear the responsibility to accurately report the \n     resulting condition of the corporation to shareholders and \n     potential investors. Unless such responsibilities are \n     enforced with very stiff penalties for noncompliance, as many \n     now recommend, our accounting systems and other elements of \n     corporate governance will function in a less than optimum \n     manner. . . . Already existing statutes, of course, prohibit \n     corporate fraud and misrepresentation. But even a small \n     increase in the likelihood of large, possibly criminal \n     penalties for egregious behavior of CEOs can have profoundly \n     important effects on all aspects of corporate governance \n     because the fulcrum of governance is the chief executive \n     officer . . . . And I don't wish to make a generalized \n     statement, but I suspect that if the CEO issue [i.e., \n     accurate reporting of the financial health of a company] were \n     fully and completely resolved--which it never will be, \n     because we're dealing with human beings--I think all the rest \n     of the problems will just disappear . . . . [I]f you do not \n     get the CEO changing in the way that particular position \n     functions, a goodly part of the work of the Senate is not \n     going to be very effective . . . . [W]hat you can do is to \n     try to create an environment and a legal structure which very \n     significantly penalizes malfeasance.''\n       Likewise, several witnesses before the Judiciary \n     Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs echoed the testimony of \n     Chairman Greenspan, suggesting that the best way to protect \n     investors from fraud is to require corporate executives at \n     publicly-traded companies to disclose detailed information \n     about their companies' financial health. For example, \n     Professor Thomas Donaldson, Mark O. Winkelman Professor at \n     the Wharton School of Business at the University of \n     Pennsylvania, commented: ``The importance of accurate \n     information in fueling efficient economic activity is well \n     substantiated. Rational choice demands accurate information. \n     When companies fail to provide investors with accurate \n     information, investors make worse decisions and markets, in \n     turn, become less efficient.'' Testimony of Donaldson before \n     the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July \n     10, 2002, p. 4. Relatedly, he noted: ``Crony capitalism and \n     the lack of transparency were rightly implicated in the Asian \n     melt down of 1997-1998. Without transparency and reliable \n     numbers about the economic health of Asian companies, \n     investors were stymied from responding rationally to the \n     crisis. They were unable to dump their investments in poorer \n     companies and hold their investments in better companies \n     because they simply couldn't trust the numbers. In the \n     ensuing crisis, they dumped everything with pernicious \n     consequences. Today, we appear to be experiencing a \n     transparency discount in the American equity markets. \n     Investors pay less because they believe that they know \n     less.'' See id. at 2; see also Testimony of Devine before the \n     Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 10, \n     2002, p. 2 (``Two long-accepted truths are that secrecy is \n     the breeding ground for corruption, and sunlight is the \n     best disinfectant.'')\n       Thus, Section 906 simply seeks to facilitate full \n     disclosure and ensure the accuracy of financial reports by \n     requiring corporate executives' personal stamp of approval. \n     As Secretary Miller stated plainly but poignantly, ``[i]f the \n     CEO is required to certify the reports he will be hard \n     pressed later to say he thought the CFO had everything in \n     apple pie shape. So the certificate becomes the hook that \n     establishes accountability.'' Testimony of Miller before the \n     Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 24, \n     2002, p. 5.\n       State of Mind Requirement for Criminal Liability. Section \n     906 provides for a two-tiered penalty scheme for corporate \n     officials who certify financial statements which they know to \n     be false. It should be kept in mind that both penalties only \n     apply to corporate executives who certify statements \n     ``knowing that the periodic report accompanying the statement \n     does not comport with all the requirements set forth in this \n     section.''\n       While it is common for drafters of legislation to use the \n     mens rea terms ``knowing'' and ``willful'' interchangeably, \n     there are some criminal statutes which distinguish between \n     them. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 35 (knowingly conveying false \n     information triggers civil liability, while willfully \n     conveying false information is a felony). When these two mens \n     rea requirements are used in setting forth graduated \n     penalties for the same predicate conduct, courts construe \n     ``knowing'' to embody a general intent standard and \n     ``willful'' to embody a specific intent standard. As such, \n     knowing conduct is distinct from, and less intentional than, \n     willful conduct. See Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, \n     193 (1998) (noting that ``more is required'' for a finding of \n     ``willful'' misconduct; ``[t]he jury must find that the \n     defendant acted with an evil-meaning mind, that is to say, \n     that he acted with knowledge that his conduct was \n     unlawful'').\n       ``Knowing.'' Section 906 establishes 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1350(c)(1), making it a 10-year felony\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\n     for a corporate official to certify financial statements \n     ``knowing'' that they contain false or misleading \n     information. As explained above, ``knowing'' as used here is \n     meant to embody a general intent standard. It refers to \n     knowledge of the facts constituting the offense, as \n     distinguished from knowledge of the law. See Bryan, 524 U.S. \n     at 192 (quoting Justice Jackson). In other words, to certify \n     financial statements ``knowing'' them to be false simply \n     means to certify the financial statements intentionally, \n     voluntarily and with an awareness of their duplicity, rather \n     than by mistake or accident. Knowledge of the law is not \n     required, nor is a willful and intentional desire to evade \n     the law's requirements. Stated differently, Section \n     1350(c)(1) imposes criminal liability for corporate officials \n     who certify a financial statement ``knowing'' that it fails \n     to ``fairly present, in all material respect, the financial \n     condition and the operations of the issuer.'' It is not \n     required that the corporate official intended to violate the \n     statute (or even knew of the statute's certification \n     requirements). Rather, the government must only prove that \n     the corporate officer knew that the financial statements were \n     materially misleading or inaccurate.\n       That is not to say, however, that certifying executives can \n     evade liability by avoiding acquiring knowledge. We agree \n     with the sentiments of Secretary Miller, who noted that \n     ``[t]he certifying officer should be judged upon whether he \n     has been diligent, exercised due care, established procedures \n     for verification, made adequate investigations, and provided \n     appropriate supervision.'' Testimony of Miller before the \n     Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, July 24, \n     2002, p. 5. It is our intent that courts impose a duty on \n     these individuals to be reasonably informed of the material \n     facts necessary to prepare financial information for \n     submission to the SEC and for dissemination to the public. \n     This position is consistent with well-established law that \n     conscious avoidance, or a deliberate attempt to avoid \n     knowledge of the crime, will not be a defense to the criminal \n     penalties contained in a statute. See, e.g., United States v. \n     de Francisco-Lopez, 939 F.2d 1405, 1409 (10th Cir. 1991) \n     (```[T]he act of avoidance of knowledge of particular facts \n     may itself circumstantially show that the avoidance was \n     motivated by sufficient guilty knowledge to satisfy the . . . \n     `knowing' element of the crime.'''); United States v. Hanlon, \n     548 F.2d 1096, 1101 (2d Cir. 1977) (``It is settled law that \n     a finding of guilty knowledge may not be avoided by a showing \n     that the defendant closed his eyes to what was going on about \n     him; `see no evil' is not a maxim in which the criminal \n     defendant should take any comfort.''); United States v. \n     Jewel, 532 F.2d 697 (9th Cir.) (en banc) (``To act \n     `knowingly,' therefore, is not necessarily to act only with \n     positive knowledge, but also to act with an awareness of the \n     high probability of the existence of the fact in \n     question.''), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 951 (1976); see also \n     Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 46 n. 93 (1969).\n       On the other hand, the standard articulated here is not \n     tantamount to negligence or recklessness. We simply note the \n     well-established proposition that conscious avoidance of \n     certain facts should not provide immunity from prosecution; \n     in contrast, if lower-level corporate officials conspire to \n     hide the true financial health of the company from the CEO \n     for whatever reasons, the CEO will not be held liable if he \n     or she did not know these facts. We expect that this would be \n     a rare event, however, given the requirement that a CEO be \n     aware of the contents of their company's financial reports \n     filed with the SEC. See, e.g., Howard v. Everix Systems, \n     Inc., 228 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir. 2000) (``Key corporate \n     officials should not be allowed to make important false \n     financial statements knowingly or recklessly, yet still \n     shield themselves from liability in the preparation of those \n     statements. Otherwise, the securities laws would be \n     significantly weakened, because corporate officers could stay \n     out of loop such that . . . only the SEC could bring suit \n     against them in an individual capacity for their \n     misrepresentations.'') Nor does Congress intend Section 906 \n     to be a so-called ``public welfare law'' which would create \n     strict liability. See, e.g., United States v. Dee, 912 F.2d \n     741 (4th Cir. 1990) (holding that one who possesses hazardous \n     wastes will be presumed to be aware of federal regulations \n     governing such wastes, notwithstanding law's inclusion of a \n     knowledge mens rea requirement).\n       ``Willful.'' Section 906 also creates a new 20-year felony \n     provision, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350(c)(2), which applies to \n     corporate officials who ``willfully'' certify financial \n     statements which they know to be false. ``Willfully'' here is \n     meant to denote a specific intent standard. When used in the \n     criminal context, a ``willful'' act is generally one \n     undertaken with a bad purpose, or with knowledge that the \n     prohibited conduct is unlawful. See Bryan, 524 U.S. at \n     191-92. Under Section 906, certifying financial statements \n     which the CEO knows are false is not enough to be \n     ``willful.'' Rather, the act also must be done with an \n     evil intent to evade the law. That evil intent is an \n     intent to disobey or disregard the law, rather than an \n     intent to do wrong in some more general sense. A corporate \n     executive who certifies financial statements which he \n     knows to be false is not guilty under this section unless, \n     in addition to knowing what he was doing, he voluntarily \n     and intentionally engaged in conduct that he knew was \n     prohibited. See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, \n     142 (1994) (describing a `` `willful' actor as one who \n     violates `a known legal duty' ''); Cheek v. United States, \n     498 U.S. 192, 201 (1991) (establishing that ``the standard \n     for the statutory willfulness requirement is the \n     `voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty' \n     '').\n       Section 1350(c)(2)'s construction is consistent with prior \n     judicial interpretations of the word ``willful.'' As the \n     Supreme Court has observed, ``the word `willfully' is \n     sometimes said to be `a word of many meanings' whose \n     construction is often dependent on the context in which it \n     appears.'' Bryan, 524 U.S. at 191. ``Willfully'' may mean \n     either a requirement of general intent or specific intent. \n     Recognizing that ignorance of the law typically is no defense \n     to a criminal charge, Congress here intended to require a \n     more particularized showing of knowledge in order to access \n     the tougher criminal penalties under Sec. 1350(c)(2)--i.e., \n     knowledge of the specific law or rule that a defendant's \n     conduct is alleged to violate. In passing this section, \n     Congress relied on the Court's determination in cases like \n     Ratzlaf, 510 U.S. 135, and Cheek, 498 U.S. 192.\n       In these cases, the Court interpreted the term \n     ``willfully'' in two different statutes, one dealing with \n     structuring transactions and the other dealing with tax \n     evasion, as requiring a finding of specific intent. Ratzlaf, \n     510 U.S. at 141; Cheek, 498 U.S. at 200. Part of the Court's \n     reasoning was that the complex nature of these laws justified \n     an inference that Congress intended ``willfully'' to be a \n     specific intent requirement so that those who were ignorant \n     of the law, but exercised reasonable care, would not be \n     subjected to the same punishment as bad actors with an evil \n     intent. Ratzlaf, 510 U.S. at 144-46; Cheek, 498 U.S. at 200, \n     205. Stated differently, Congress made violations of these \n     statutes ``specific intent crime[s] because, without \n     knowledge of the . . . requirement, a would-be violator \n     cannot be expected to recognize the illegality of his \n     otherwise innocent act.'' United States v. Eisenstein, 731 \n     F.2d 1540, 1543 (11th Cir. 1984). Like the anti-structuring \n     and tax evasion provisions at issue in Ratzlaf and Cheek, \n     securities laws are complex, which is why Section 906 \n     incorporates different penalties for ``knowing'' violations \n     committed with general intent and ``willful'' violations \n     characterized by a specific intent to violate the law. In \n     effect, for the heightened penalties triggered by ``willful'' \n     violations, Section 906 carves out a limited and rebuttable \n     exception to the traditional rule that ``ignorance of the law \n     is no excuse.'' See Bryan, 524 U.S. at 196.\n       Finally, for purposes of clarity, we should mention that we \n     are aware that the term ``willfully'' is invoked and \n     interpreted differently in the context of civil \n     administrative disciplinary proceedings instituted by the SEC \n     under federal securities laws. For example, under Sections \n     15(b)(4) and 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \n     the SEC may discipline a registered broker-dealer in \n     securities or anyone associated or participating with the \n     broker-dealer if it finds in such proceedings that the \n     respondent has ``willfully'' violated or ``willfully'' aided \n     and abetted the violation by any person of any provision of \n     certain securities laws or rules. While, as we have noted, \n     the meaning of ``willfully'' depends on statutory context, in \n     the SEC administrative disciplinary context, it has been held \n     to mean ``no more than the person charged with the duty knows \n     what he is doing.'' Hughes v. Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949); see also \n     Seaman v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 603 F.2d 1126, \n     1135 (5th Cir. 1979), aff'd on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 \n     (1981); Arthur Lipper Corp. v. Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, 547 F.2d 171, 180 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, \n     430 U.S. 1009; Stead v. Securities and Exchange Commission, \n     444 F.2d 713, 714-15 (10th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. \n     1059. See also the discussion of willfulness in Wonsover v. \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, 205 F.3d 408, 413 (D.C. \n     Cir. 2000). The court reiterated its ``traditional \n     formulation of willfulness'' for purposes of Section 15(b) of \n     the Exchange Act. Citing its prior holding in Gerhard & Otis, \n     Inc. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 348 F.2d 798 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1965), the Court noted that ``willfully'' in that \n     provision ``means intentionally committing the act which \n     constitutes the violation,'' not that ``the actor [must] also \n     be aware that he is violating [the law].'' Tager v. \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. \n     1965); Edward J. Mawood & Co. v. Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, 591 F.2d 588, 595-96 (10th Cir. 1979) (same). \n     Needless to say, for purposes of Section 906, we do not adopt \n     the ``general intent'' interpretation of ``willful.''\n       Expert Advice. Some defendants charged in white-collar \n     cases have attempted to avert criminal liability by claiming \n     reliance on expert advice. See, e.g., Ratzlaf, 510 U.S. at \n     142 n.10 (`` `[S]pecific intent to commit the crimes' . . . \n     might be negated by, e.g., proof that defendant relied in \n     good faith on advice of counsel.''); Eisenstein, 731 F.2d at \n     1543-44 (same). To the extent that it exists, the so-called \n     ``reliance on expert'' defense is held to apply only when the \n     defendant can demonstrate that he fully disclosed all \n     relevant facts to his accountant or attorney and that he \n     relied in good faith on the expert's advice. See United \n     States v. Johnson, 730 F.2d 683, 686 (11th Cir.), cert. \n     denied, 469 U.S. 867 (1984); United States v. McLennan, 563 \n     F.2d 943, 946 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 969 \n     (1978) (noting that ``[a]dvice of counsel is no defense \n     unless the defendant gave his attorney all of the facts, and \n     unless counsel specifically advised the course of conduct \n     taken by the defendant''). It is not Congress' intent to\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\n     disrupt this line of authority. We presume that, where it is \n     a reliance on expert advice that is truly at issue, see \n     Johnson, 730 F.2d at 686-87 (discounting defendants' defense \n     where reliance on expert advice was irrelevant to the real \n     claims at issue), the same standard articulated in the above-\n     cited and other authority would apply to the criminal \n     provisions contained in this title.\n       Finally, the duty imposed by the Section 906 certification \n     requirement is not intended to end once a financial statement \n     and accompanying certification are submitted. Upon \n     discovery that a statement contains an error, immediate \n     correction and disclosure of the correction should be \n     required.\n       Interplay With Section 302 of S. 2673: Scope of \n     Certification Requirement. At the time I offered the Biden-\n     Hatch Amendment to S. 2673, that bill already had a provision \n     (now codified at Section 302), which is similar to Section \n     906, with three significant exceptions. First, the provision \n     does not apply to the chairperson of a company's board of \n     directors (my original legislation and subsequent amendment \n     to S. 2673 applied the certification requirement to chief \n     executive officers, chief financial officers, and board \n     chairpersons). Second, it contains no criminal enforcement \n     provisions. Third, the scope of corporate filing activity \n     subject to the requirements of Section 302 is far narrower, \n     as I explain below.\n       Section 302 provides that the SEC must require, for each \n     company filing periodic reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d) \n     of the Exchange Act, that the principal executive officer and \n     the principal financial officer, or persons performing \n     equivalent functions, make certain certifications in each \n     annual or quarterly report filed with or submitted to the \n     SEC. Section 302, by its terms, only applies to annual and \n     quarterly reports and, accordingly, its scope is so cabined. \n     Section 906, on the other hand and quite intentionally, \n     includes no such limitation of its scope. It is intended to \n     apply to any financial statement filed by a publicly-traded \n     company, upon which the investing public will rely to gauge \n     the financial health of the company. So, Section 906 applies \n     to annual and quarterly reports (e.g., Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-\n     F, 10-Q) but, unlike Section 302 certifications, is also \n     intended to apply to so-called ``current'' reports like Forms \n     8-K and 6-K (foreign issuer submissions), as well as \n     submissions of Form 11-K by employee benefit plans. The above \n     list is merely illustrative, not exhaustive, and Congress \n     intends the SEC to issue guidance on any additional reports \n     which are subject to Section 906.\n       We are aware of the SEC's historic position that the term \n     ``periodic reports'' describes Forms 10-Q, 10-K, 10-QSB, 10-\n     KSB, 40-F and 20-F, which are required to be filed at \n     specified intervals in time, and not Forms 8-K and 6-K, which \n     are only required to be filed upon the occurrence of \n     specified events. We in no way intend to import the more \n     expansive scope of Section 906 into broader securities \n     regulation; the wider view of ``periodic report'' is for \n     purposes of implementing this specific certification \n     requirement only.\n       Note that Section 906 does not require certification that \n     the financial statements are in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles (GAAP). That omission is \n     intentional in that the certification is designed to ensure \n     an overall accuracy and completeness that is broader than \n     financial reporting requirements under generally accepted \n     accounting principles. In so doing, for purposes of this \n     section, Congress effectively establishes possible liability \n     where statements may be GAAP-compliant but materially \n     misleading. See States v. Simon, 425 F.2d 796, 808 (2d Cir. \n     1969) (finding that accountants can be criminally liable for \n     preparing financial statements that are GAAP-compliant but \n     materially misleading).\n       Certification Form. We do not intend to prescribe the \n     precise form or format of certification (e.g., whether the \n     certification should appear on the signature page or among \n     the exhibits or appendices to the report) or method of \n     submission to the appropriate regulators. On these questions, \n     Congress properly defers to the expert judgment of \n     experienced officials at the SEC, who we trust will fully \n     consider the liability implications of these administrative \n     options. What is important is that the ultimate form reflect \n     the substantive requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act--\n     including a recognition that, as the text of the statute and \n     the foregoing explanation should make clear, certification \n     under Section 302 applies to a subset of the certifications \n     required by Section 906. Nevertheless, I have encouraged the \n     SEC and the Justice Department to develop a single form which \n     could be used for certifications under both Sections 302 and \n     906. Section 906 certification establishes a ``floor'' of \n     minimum certification requirements, while Section 302 cites \n     some additional factors. Accordingly, any company properly \n     certifying under Section 302 will also satisfy the \n     requirements of Section 906. Thus, it may be possible for the \n     SEC to develop a unitary certification for the sake of \n     administrative ease. However, for companies that need only \n     certify under Section 906, a separate certification \n     satisfying the somewhat lesser requirements of Section 906 \n     may be appropriate.\n       Penalties for Failure to File Section 906 Certification. \n     Some observers have asked whether failure to file a \n     certification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350(a)--as opposed \n     to certifying a false financial report as accurate in \n     violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350(c)--triggers criminal \n     liability. It does. Pursuant to Section 3(b) of the Sarbanes-\n     Oxley Act, ``a violation by any person of this Act . . . \n     shall be treated for all purposes in the same manner as a \n     violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . . . and \n     any such person shall be subject to the same penalties, and \n     to the same extent, as for a violation of that Act or such \n     rules and regulations.'' As noted above, the criminal \n     provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 78ff) include a 10-year felony for ``willful'' \n     violations. Accordingly, willful failure to file a \n     certification pursuant to Section 1350(a) of Title 18 \n     triggers the criminal provisions of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78ff. (As \n     noted above, courts have interpreted ``willful'' violations \n     of the 1934 Act to require only general intent to commit the \n     crime.) Significantly, the U.S. Department of Justice concurs \n     with this analysis. See Letter from Assistant Attorney \n     General Daniel J. Bryant to the Honorable Joseph R. Biden, \n     Jr., December 26, 2002 (``[A]s you have suggested, the \n     Department may utilize Section 78ff's criminal penalties to \n     prosecute executives who violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by \n     willfully failing to file Section 906's required \n     certification.''). Of course, in addition to this penalty \n     scheme, failure to file the required Section 1350(a) \n     certification may also result in an economic penalty, since \n     Wall Street analysts and investors would surely take note of \n     the failure and punish offending companies by shifting their \n     investment dollars to compliant companies. This potential \n     economic penalty should in no way mitigate application of the \n     criminal penalty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5331-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5331-S5332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I rise today in commemoration of the \nArmenian genocide. As the 88th anniversary of this horrific event \napproaches, I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to the \nmen, women and children who were murdered or displaced in the 20th \ncentury's first systematic attempt to extinguish an entire people.\n  On April 24, 1915, the Turkish Ottoman government initiated a \ncampaign to expel 1.75 million ethnic Armenians from its borders. \nTurkish authorities operated under the baseless claim that its Armenian \ncommunity would be disloyal in a time of war since they were neither \nTurks nor Muslims. On April 24, government leaders rounded up 300 \nArmenian leaders, writers, thinkers and professionals in what was then \nConstantinople for their deportation or, for many, their deaths. In \nnearby areas, 5,000 of the poorest Armenians were killed in their homes \nor on the streets. Over the course of the subsequent 2 years, between \n500,000 and 1 million Armenians were killed and 750,000 were forced to \nleave their homes.\n  Henry Morgenthau, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire \nremarked, ``I am confident that the whole history of the human race \ncontains no such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and \npersecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the \nsufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.''\n  Records of eyewitness accounts allow us to gain an incomplete yet \npainful understanding of the atrocities the Armenian people faced. An \nAmerican missionary wrote, `` . . . All tell the same story and bear \nthe same scars: their men were all killed on the first days [sic] march \nfrom their cities, after which the women and girls were constantly \nrobbed of their money, bedding, clothing and beaten, criminally abused \nand abducted along the way.''\n  Another account by an Armenian and corroborated by a German \nmissionary said, ``We all had to take refuge in the cellar for fear of \nour orphanage catching fire. It was heartrending to hear the cries of \nthe people and children who were being burned to death in their houses. \nThe soldiers took great delight in hearing them, and when people who \nwere out in the street during the bombardment fell dead, the soldiers \nmerely laughed at them. . . . ``\n  I wish we could say that such events are in the past and that history \nwill never again have not been learned and millions of other people and \nraces have suffered at the hands of malicious leaders who have acted \nupon their messages of hate and intolerance.\n  Each year during my tenure in the Senate, I have spoken out about the \nArmenian genocide. I believe the highest tribute we can pay to the \nvictims of any genocide is by acknowledging the horrors they faced and \nreaffirming our commitment to fight against such heinous acts in the \nfuture. It is important that we take the time to remember and honor the \nvictims, and pay respect to the survivors, especially as that \ngeneration passes on.\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the continued \nvitality of the Armenian culture, and in honoring and remembering the \nvictims of the Armenian genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5332-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REGIME TARGETS INDEPENDENT MEDIA IN BELARUS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, recently I introduced S. 700, the \nBelarus Democracy Act, a bipartisan inititive aimed at supporting \ndemocratic forces in the Republic of Belarus. As co-chairman of the \nCommission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I want to report to \nmy colleagues on the pressures faced by independent media in that \ncountry. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has just released \ntheir annual report documentating the dangers journalists face around \nthe world, including Belarus.\n  In May of 2002, CPJ named Belarus one of the 10 worst places in the \nworld to be a journalist due to the worsening repression under Europe's \nmost authoritarian regime. Throughout the year the situation of the \ncountry's independent media deteriorated as Belarusian leader \nAleksander Lukashenka mounted a comprehensive assault on all \nindependent and opposition press.\n  While criminal libel laws had been on the books since 1999, they were \nnot used by the Government until 2002. The law stipulates that public \ninsults or libel against the President may be punished by up to 4 years \nin prison, 2 years in a labor camp, or by large fine. Articles in the \ncriminal code which prohibit slaundering and insulting the President or \ngovernment officials are also used to stifle press freedom. The \ncriminal code provides for a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment \nfor such offenses.\n  Journalists critical of the fall 2001 presidential elections were \ntargeted. Mikola Markevich and Pavel Mazheyka of Pahonya and Viktar \nIvashkevich of of Rabochy were sentenced to corrective labor for \n`libeling'' the President in pre-election articles. On March 4, a \ndistrict court in Belarus commuted Milola Markevich's sentence from \ntime in a corrective labor facility to ``corrective labor at home.'' On \nMarch 21, a district court released Pavel Mazheyka on parole. Under \nBelarus law, prisoners may be released on parole after serving half \nterm their.\n  Other charges were leveled later in the year against a woman who \ndistributed anti-Lukashenka flyers, an opposition politician for \nlibeling the President in a published statement, and a Belarusskaya \nDelovaya Gazeta reporter for criticizing the Prosecutor General of \nBelarus. A former lawyer for the mother of disappeared cameraman Dmitry \nZavadsky received a 1\\1/2\\ year prison sentence suspended for 2 years \nfor libeling the Prosecutor General.\n  Last August the independent newspaper Nasha Svaboda was fined 100 \nmillion Belarusian rubles for civil libel of the chairman of the State \nControl Committee. The paper closed when it could not pay the fine. \nThere are other forms of pressure and harassment as well.\n  The CPJ report notes the financial discrimination faced by nonstate \nmedia, including pressure from government officials on potential \nadvertisers not to buy space in publications that criticize Lukashenka \nand his regime. Government officials also regularly encourage companies \nto pull advertising and threaten them with audits should they fail to \ndo so, according to CPJ.\n  When the Belasrusian Government increased newspaper delivery rates, \nonly nongovernmental papers had to pay. When the Minsk City Council of \nDeputies levied 5 percent tax on newspapers, government papers were \nagain exempt. Such tactics caused such indepdents as the Belaruskaya \nMaladzyozhnaya, Rabochy, Den and Tydnyovik Mahilyouski to go under.\n  According to the State Department's recently released County Reports \non Human Rights Practices ``the regime continued to use its near-\nmonopolies on newsprint production, newspaper printing and \ndistribution, and national television and radio broadcasts to restrict \ndissemination of opposition viewpoints.''\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support S. 700, the Belarus \nDemocracy Act, in support of those brave individuals in Belarus, \nincluding representatives of independent media, who speak out in \ndefense of human rights and democracy in a nation which enjoys neither.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5332-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5332-S5333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE SECURITY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the threat of \nbioterrorist attacks on American agriculture.\n  Agroterrorism is a real and continuing concern. When Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Tom Ridge last month raised the threat advisory \nlevel to high, he launched Operation Liberty Shield to increase \nsecurity and readiness in the United States. One part of Operation \nLiberty Shield involved taking additional steps to guarantee our food \nsecurity. The government started to inspect imported food more \ncarefully. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, alerted the food \nand agricultural community to give greater care in monitoring feedlots, \nstockyards, processing plants, import and storage areas.\n  An ongoing outbreak of avian influenza in the Netherlands is an \nexample of the type of crisis we might face, and the coordination that \nmay be needed, if a terrorist launched an attack on our agriculture. \nMore than 9 million of the estimated 100 million chickens in the \nNetherlands were slaughtered to prevent the disease spreading since the \noutbreak began in late February. Some 800 farms in the eastern \nNetherlands were affected. Dutch exports of fowl and poultry products \nwere stopped. The cost so far to farmers and the government is an \nestimated $108 million.\n  The Dutch Government took a number of strong steps to contain the \ndisease. The Dutch Army was called up to help. Some 100 troops joined \nmore than 400 police and customs officers to enforce a quarantine \naround the epicenter of the outbreak and to keep the disease from \nspreading to nearby Germany and Belgium. A ban on movements of live \nchickens and eggs within the country was imposed in early April. This \nled to some inconvenience to consumers since the supply of eggs in \ngrocery stores was limited.\n  A coordinated attack by terrorists on some of our leading chicken \nproducing states, for example, Georgia, Arkansas, Alabama and North \nCarolina, with an impact equivalent to the natural outbreak in the \nNetherlands would have serious consequences.\n  Egg and chicken production in the United States is a $20 billion plus \na year industry. Another $10 billion is spent on processing and getting \nthe chicken and eggs to market. We export more than a billion dollars \nof chicken products a year. Some 30,000 farm families are involved in \nraising chickens. Three hundred thousand people work in processing and \ntransporting chickens for market.\n  On any given day there are some 1.5 billion chickens sitting in \nchicken coops in the United States. Over a hundred million birds might \nhave to be slaughtered. If there was a ban on shipment of chickens and \neggs, not only would chicken producers suffer, so would related \nindustries. The trucking industry, food processing industry, food \nretailers, and those involved in exporting chicken products abroad \nwould all feel the impact. Billions of dollars in losses could result. \nThe impact on farm families and employment could be substantial.\n  Of course, my concern about agroterrorism is not limited to the \npoultry industry. Agriculture and related industries, such as food \nprocessing, manufacturing, and transportation, account for \napproximately 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product and nearly \n17 percent of domestic employment. The deliberate and coordinated \nspread of livestock or crop diseases could have a devastating effect on \nour nation.\n  USDA is the lead authority in responding to agricultural emergencies. \nIt has taken several steps to improve our ability to counter a \nterrorist attack upon our nation's agriculture. USDA has created a \nhomeland defense council and increased border inspection and research \nactivities. USDA's overall activities, and actions in support of \nOperation Liberty, are commendable. But we need to do more to prepare \nourselves.\n  Responding to an agroterrorist attack will require coordinated \nefforts by\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nthe USDA, and other federal agencies. The Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Departments of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, Defense, Transportation, and Justice will all have \na role to play. In addition, these agencies must coordinate with \nstates, localities and farmers and ranchers.\n  In February, I introduced the Agriculture Security Assistance Act, S. \n427, and the Agriculture Security Preparedness Act, S. 430. The purpose \nof this legislation is to encourage additional and improved \ncoordination and preparedness on the federal, state, regional, and \nlocal level.\n  The Agriculture Security Assistance Act, S. 427, will assist States \nand communities preparing for and responding to threats to the Nation's \nagriculture. My bill aims to improve our detection and response \ncapabilities so they are rapid and swift enough to contain the spread \nof a disease. S. 427 directs USDA to work with each State to develop \nand implement response plans. The legislation establishes grant \nprograms for communities and States to incorporate modeling and \ngeographic information systems into planning and response activities. \nThis funding also will help animal health professionals participate in \ncommunity emergency planning activities and assist farmers and ranchers \nin strengthening the biosecurity measures on their own property.\n  The Agriculture Security Preparedness Act, S. 430, will enhance \nagricultural biosecurity by strengthening interagency and international \ncoordination. The Act will establish senior level liaisons in DHS and \nHHS to coordinate with USDA on agricultural disease emergency \nmanagement and response. This bill will task DHS and USDA to work with \nthe Department of Transportation to address one of the largest risk \nfactors in controlling the spread of a plant or animal disease: the \nmovement of animals, plants, and people between and around farms.\n  Although our ability to respond to an agroterrorism attack is \nimproving, there is still much more that could and should be done. The \nbills I have introduced will take the necessary steps to further \nenhance the actions already taken to improve agricultural security in \nthe United States. I look forward to the Senate's support for these \nimportant bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5333-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5333-S5334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE MOBILIZED RESERVE SAVINGS ACCOUNT ACT AND THE DEPLOYED SERVICE \n          MEMBERS FINANCIAL SECURITY AND EDUCATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, we are all very proud of the \noutstanding service of our military personnel during a series of \nsignificant military operations. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines, both Active and Reserve, have responded admirably to our \nNation's call to service. These brave military personnel have \ndemonstrated superb service by their participation in Operation Noble \nEagle, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since \nthe 1991 Persian Gulf war, our personnel have served in a number of \nother contingency operations, including operations in Kosovo, Bosnia, \nSouthwest Asia, and Haiti.\n  For the most part, our service men and women serve without complaint. \nHowever, we know that continuous deployments create hardships for them, \ntheir families, and for employers of members of the Guard and Reserve \nwho have been ordered to active duty. There is no way to remove all of \nthe hardships that go with extended and dangerous military service, but \nwe can make sure that they are adequately compensated when they do \nendure these hardships.\n  The Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee recently \nheld two hearings that included testimony about our Guard and Reserve \nTroops. We learned:\n  Although income loss data for current operations is not available, \ndata for past military operations show that about a third of mobilized \nGuard and Reserve personnel have some income loss, a third have no \nchange, and a third actually report an income increase. GAO reported \nthat a DoD survey conducted in 2000 revealed that ``the average total \nincome change for all members (including losses and gains) was almost \n$1700 in losses.'' Certain groups, such as self-employed reservists and \nmedical professionals in private practice, reported greater income loss \nthan the average estimated for all reservists.\n  Reserve component members who have been mobilized are eligible for \nthe same pay and benefits, health care, and family support as their \nActive component counterparts, although some of them face challenges in \nunderstanding and accessing their benefits. All of the services have \nprograms in place to help the members and their families to obtain \ntheir benefits.\n  Despite the isolated news reports about income loss, Reserve \ncomponent leaders indicate that their service members are not \ncomplaining about income loss and that they are happy about being \ncalled up to do what they signed up to do.\n  It is very important that we not create an income disparity whereby a \nmobilized Reserve component member would be paid more than his or her \nActive component counterpart of the same grade and experience \nperforming the same duties.\n  About a third of Reserve component members are involved in some sort \nof educational program. Some have reported difficulties in maintaining \ntheir educational status; loss of academic credits, scholarships and \ngrants; and loss of tuition and other fees paid when they were ordered \nto active duty. Although many colleges and universities are providing \nrelief, not all are.\n  We also know that our Active component service members have been \nstretched with these frequent and lengthy deployments. Granted, they \nare in a little different circumstance because they volunteered for \nfull-time military service, but these deployments are wearing on them \nand their families just as much as the mobilization affects Reserve \ncomponent members and their families.\n  With this in mind, I recently introduced two bills, the Deployed \nService Members Financial Security and Education Act of 2003 and the \nMobilized Reserve Savings Account Act.\n  Deployed Service Members Financial Security and Education Act of 2003 \nis designed to compensate both Active and Reserve military personnel \nfor frequent and lengthy deployments. It will authorize a new special \npay of $1,000 per month for:\n  Active and Reserve component military personnel who are deployed for \n191 or more consecutive days;\n  Active and Reserve component military personnel who are deployed for \n401 or more days out of a rolling 730 day period; and\n  Reserve component military personnel who are mobilized for a second \ntime within a year of being released from and earlier call-up.\n  This bill will also amend the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act \nto protect the educational status and tuition payments of service \nmembers ordered to active duty and it will limit interest rates on \ntheir student loans while on active duty.\n  The Mobilized Reserve Savings Account Act will authorize a pretax \nsavings plan for Guard and Reserve members that they can use to \nsupplement their military income when they are ordered to active duty. \nThis will serve as an incentive for those who know that their income on \nactive duty will be less than their normal income.\n  These bills are relatively modest proposals that will assist our \nservice men and women who are asked to spend the most time away from \ntheir homes and families.

Madam President, although I voted in favor of the \nconference report on S. 151, I must register my profound concern with \ncertain provisions that were added to the conference report that have \nnothing to do with protecting children.\n  I am referring to title IV of the conference report that mandates \nsweeping changes to the Nation's sentencing laws and guidelines. These \nprovisions stem from an amendment added to the bill in the House, and \nlater modified under unusual circumstances in the conference committee.\n  These provisions will drastically impact the discretion and \nindependence of Federal judges and the judiciary to impose just \nsentences not just for child and sex abuse crimes, but for all crimes. \nThese provisions will alter the sentencing laws of the United States, \nwith little or no public debate or hearing on the issue, and with \nlittle or no research or study on whether too many Federal judges are \nin fact abusing their discretion or improperly granting departures from \nmandatory minimum sentences.\n  As my colleague from Massachusetts pointed out, if the majority on \nthe conference committee had limited these changes to the serious \ncrimes of sex abuse of children and child pornography, there would be \nlittle or no objection to these provisions. But they didn't. They \nallowed the de novo appellate review and other provisions to stand, \nprovisions which will restrict the ability and discretion of Federal \njudges to grant downward departures for all offenses.\n  Unfortunately, as the majority is well aware, the child abduction \nnotification provisions and virtual child pornography provisions of S. \n151 are too important to delay any longer than necessary. I cannot vote \nagainst those provisions--we must do everything we can to strengthen \nthe hand of State, Federal, and local law enforcement, as well as \nprosecutors, to protect our children from sexual predators.\n  It is just unfortunate that this must-pass legislation was taken \nadvantage of to move sweeping reforms of the larger U.S. criminal \njustice system, reforms the Senate did not debate and on which no \nhearings were held. I hope we will be able to revisit this matter in \nthe near future.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, yesterday I joined my colleagues in \nvoting for S. 151, the PROTECT Act, legislation that is intended to \nhelp reduce the incidence of child abduction in our country. The bill \npassed unanimously on a vote of 98 to 0. I voted for this bill because \nI believe it contains many important and needed provisions, but I did \nso with reservations about a couple of different sections of the bill \nthat, in my view, deserved further deliberation.\n  Before I discuss these reservations, let me start by discussing the \nmost important provisions in this bill. First, this legislation \nestablishes a national AMBER alert system, which includes the \nestablishment of an AMBER alert coordinator within the Department of \nJustice to assist states with their AMBER alert plans, and which will \nhelp to eliminate gaps in the network through better regional \ncoordination among plans. I was pleased to be a cosponsor of the stand-\nalone version of this bill in both the 107th and 108th Congresses. My \nhome State of New Mexico already has an Amber alert plan, which was \nrecently codified by our State legislature, and I am hopeful that this \nnew Federal legislation will allow my State to receive funding under \nthe new grant programs created by this bill.\n  Second, the bill includes the so-called ``Code Adam Act,'' which \nwould require Federal buildings to establish procedures to locate a \nchild that is missing in the building. The original Code Adam--one of \nthe country's largest child safety programs--was created by Wal-Mart in \n1994 and is now used in more than 36,000 stores nationwide. It is also \nsupported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\n  Third, in spite of the many extraneous provisions added by the House, \nthe bill includes much of the original PROTECT Act, which passed the \nSenate unanimously last year. These provisions provide needed tools to \nprosecutors to help them deal with the problem of child pornography in \na way that should pass constitutional muster. Congress first addressed \nthis issue in the 1996 Child Pornography Protection Act, but a \nsignificant portion of that law was struck down by the Supreme Court \nlast year. I am pleased with the work of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nin working through the issues raised by the Supreme Court in a \nthoughtful and bipartisan way, and I am hopeful that this new measure \nwill help ensure that child pornographers are held accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  I would like to say a few words now about my reservations in voting \nfor this bill. Title IV of the bill makes significant new changes to \nFederal sentencing procedures in the name of reform. While many of \nthese changes may turn out to be beneficial, at no point in the \nlegislative history of this bill was there an opportunity for critical \nquestions to be raised and answered about these new sentencing reforms. \nTitle IV was added in conference as an amendment with little \nopportunity for the minority to even read the amendment or engage in a \nthoughtful debate. Further, several of my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee have noted their objections to what they view as a \nmisrepresentation of the amendment in conference. I do not believe this \nis the way in which we should do business, and I am disappointed that \nthere was not an opportunity for my colleagues to debate their \nlegitimate concerns further.\n  In particular, Senator Leahy raised concerns that this amendment \ncould potentially undermine the Federal sentencing system and prevent \njudges from imposing just and responsible sentences. As justification, \nSenator Leahy cites remarks by Chief Justice Rehnquist on the nearly \nidentical Feeney amendment, which was added to the bill on the House \nfloor. In those remarks, the Chief Justice said, ``This legislation, if \nenacted, would do serious harm to the basic structure of the sentencing \nguideline system and would seriously impair the ability of courts to \nimpose just and responsible sentences.''\n  Whether one agrees with the sentencing reform provisions in this bill \nor not, the very fact that the Chief Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court has voiced concerns about it leads me to believe that \nmore time was needed for both the Senate and the House to consider the \nscope and potential impact of this legislation.\n  Finally, I would like to comment on another piece of the PROTECT Act, \nwhich was added as an amendment in conference by Senator Biden. The \nIllicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, previously known as the RAVE Act, \nmodifies the current so-called ``crack house'' statute to make clear \nthat anyone who knowingly or intentionally uses his or her property, or \nallows another person to use his or her property, for the purpose of \ndistributing, manufacturing, or using illegal drugs will be held \naccountable. The provision also allows for civil suits against \nviolators.\n  I have received many calls and letters from people in my State who \nhave raised legitimate concerns about this legislation. While I fully \nsupport efforts to ensure that our youth do not fall victim to drugs, \nand while I understand that Senator Biden modified his bill slightly \nfrom the previous Congress to address concerns that were raised, I \nwould have preferred that this legislation be allowed to go through the \nnormal legislative process. This would have allowed a public airing of \nthe many concerns that I have heard, and would have provided an \nopportunity for the Senate Judiciary Committee to address those \nconcerns, as necessary.\n  I hope very much that during the remainder of this Congress we can \nrevisit both these new provisions related to sentencing and the RAVE \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5334-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5334-S5335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ROSS SWIMMER\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I necessarily missed last evening's vote \non the nomination of Ross Swimmer to be the Special Trustee for \nAmerican Indians because of a family obligation.\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\nHowever, had I been present, I would have opposed this nominee, as I \ndid when his nomination was considered by the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, on which I serve. I would like to take a few moments to \nexplain why I do not support this nomination.\n  Ordinarily, I believe the President has the right to choose who will \nserve in his administration. The position of Special Trustee for \nAmerican Indians is unique, however. Congress created the position of \nSpecial Trustee in 1994 in large part because of the historical failure \nof the Department of the Interior to live up to the Federal \nGovernment's trust responsibility to Native Americans. The Special \nTrustee was and is intended to be an advocate on behalf of tribes and \nindividual Native Americans to ensure that those trust duties are met. \nIn my view, Native Americans deserve someone in this position in whom \nthey can have confidence. Regrettably, Mr. Swimmer is not that person.\n  Many tribal leaders from my State have shared with me their very deep \nconcern that Mr. Swimmer would not be an independent voice and advocate \non behalf of Native Americans within the Department of the Interior. In \nfact, under previous administrations and in recent months, he has been \nan integral part of the Department of the Interior team that has sought \nto implement trust management reforms without the full support of and \nconsultation with the Native Americans whose assets they manage. To \nmany of my Native American constituents, this is akin to allowing the \nfox to guard the henhouse.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. Swimmer has now been confirmed by a majority of the \nSenate to serve as Special Trustee for American Indians, and I wish him \nsuccess in that position. He has made a commitment to me and others to \nconsult with tribes in a timely and meaningful way, and I will \ncertainly be working with Mr. Swimmer to ensure that is the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5335-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WAR CRIMINALS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

BOWEN BALLARD\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I take this opportunity to recognize \nthe retirement of a friend and outstanding Air Force Officer, Major \nGeneral A. Bowen Ballard. Major General Ballard's superior and \nexceptionally distinguished Air Force career warrants comment as the \nAir Force says thank you and goodbye to one of its best.\n  Major General Ballard has served this Nation and the United States \nAir Force for more than 37 years. His service has been marked by \nincreasingly demanding command and staff positions, culminating as the \nMobilization Assistant to the Commander, Air University, Maxwell AFB, \nAL.\n  Throughout his military service, Major General Ballard has served \nwith distinction and honor. It is my privilege to recognize his many \nsignificant contributions and to commend him for his outstanding \nservice. A son of Alabama, Major General Ballard grew up in Montgomery \nand attended elementary and junior high school in Cloverdale. After \ngraduating from Lanier High School, he enlisted in the Alabama Air \nNational Guard as an intelligence specialist, while at the same time he \nattended the University of Alabama earning a degree in business and \nfinance.\n  In 1966, he was commissioned and resumed his service in Air Force \nIntelligence. Major General Ballard attended the Air Intelligence \nSchool at Lowry Air Force Base, CO, and from 1967 until 1974, he filled \nvarious intelligence positions with the 187th Tactical Reconnaissance \nGroup, Alabama Air National Guard.\n  Leaving the Alabama Air National Guard and joining the Air Force \nReserve in 1974, Major General Ballard was assigned to the Air Force \nIntelligence Service at Fort Belvoir, VA, where he played a key role in \ntransitioning Air Force Special Operation Forces from the Tactical Air \nCommand to the Military Airlift Command and participated with Air Force \nSpecial Operation Forces on an international basis. Major General \nBallard was involved with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and \nthe United States European Command for many years.\n  During his assignment as the Mobilization Assistant to the Chief of \nStaff, Intelligence, Headquarters United States Air Force, Major \nGeneral Ballard was recalled to active duty in a key position of \nleadership to manage the planning, directing, and establishing of \npolicies and procedures for all USAF intelligence activities.\n  As the Mobilization Assistant to the Director of the National \nSecurity Agency/Chief, Central Security Services, Fort George G. Meade, \nMD, Major General Ballard's guidance and direction was critical in \nidentifying and resolving critical issues affecting the Air Force \nduring one of the most turbulent and demanding times in our history.\n  Major General Ballard frequently met with the senior military \nleadership, to include the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air \nForce, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and members of the Senate \nand Congress, effectively presenting crucial positions involving \nspecific operational intelligence and professional military education \nissues. He achieved unparalleled success in charting the strategic \ndirection and employment concepts as the Chairman of the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense's Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence \nSteering Council. Major General Ballard represented commanders of the \nAir University and Air Force Space Command on numerous panels, boards, \nand work groups, including personally leading the development of \ncreative and innovative improvements to the Joint Reserve Intelligence \nProgram. Major General Ballard was directly responsible for \nidentifying, developing and implementing a significantly new direction \nfor Reserve Intelligence roles and missions in space operations. Under \nhis untiring leadership, the Air Force Space Command Reserve \nIntelligence Program transformed into a vital partner in on-orbit space \ncollection intelligence assessments.\n  As the Mobilization Assistant to the Commander, Air University, he \nassisted the commander with significant improvements to Air University \nschools in curricula and coursework, joint programs, faculty \nmanagement, computer technology, and communications systems. As a \nresult of his efforts, all graduates of Air Command and Staff College \nand Air War College now receive masters degrees in military science. \nMajor General Ballard's leadership skills were constantly in high \ndemand. For the Joint Chiefs, he developed the Joint Chiefs of Staff/\nDepartment of Defense Strategic Plan, providing unprecedented joint \ncontingency support to operations in both Operation Noble Anvil and \nOperation Allied Force. For the combatant commanders, he applied his \nfocus on language and distributed joint reserve component intelligence \noperations and implemented a flexible solution which paid significant \ndividends in the military theater of operations and in the global war \non terrorism. Major General Ballard also established the foundation for \njoint cryptology reserve component support to the European and Pacific \nCommand. The formulation and justification of cryptolgic reserve \nsupport elements blossomed into greatly improved reserve component \nsupport in intelligence operations ensuring a significant reserve \naugmentation force well into the 21st century. Major General Ballard \nhas demonstrated time and time again superior performance, planning, \ncoordinating, directing, and managing of Air Force operational \nintelligence programs, and Air Force Reserve intelligence mission \naugmentation activities. Major General Ballard's\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nwork with the Air University Integrated Program Review process resulted \nin significant increases in Individual Mobilization Augmentee positions \nto meet critical Air University mission needs. As a direct result, Air \nReserve forces made significant and long-lasting contributions to \nsuccessful Air University mission operations. From determining the \neffective and efficient use of Reserve Force personnel in war and \nduring peacetime, to redefining roles, missions, force structure, \ntraining, morale, finance, recruiting, and retention, Major General \nBallard always led from the front.\n  We wish to extend congratulations to Major General Ballard on the \noccasion of his retirement. We are honored to recognize his many \naccomplishments and ask that our colleagues in the United States House \nof Representatives join in recognizing his very worthy achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5336-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5336-S5337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NUCLEAR EARTH PENETRATOR WEAPONS: THE MYTH AND DANGER\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the myth and \ndangers posed by the nuclear earth penetrating weapons proposed by the \nBush administration.\n  The administration suggests that new nuclear weapons could be needed \nto destroy a growing number of hard and deeply buried targets, HDBT. \nThe Intelligence Community has estimated that there are over 10,000 \npotential HDBTs worldwide. Many of these are near the surface, serve \ntactical roles, and can be attacked with conventional weapons. But some \nhundreds of these targets have stronger concrete reenforcement, or are \nburied at great depths, or are in tunnels. They play a strategic role, \nprotecting senior leaders, command and control centers, or stored \nweapons of mass destruction. Of particular concern are the very \nhardened or deeply buried HDBTs located in so-called rogue nations\n  To attack the most deeply buried structures, the administration would \nlike to have a nuclear weapon that could destroy a bunker some 300 \nmeters, or about 1,000 feet, underground without causing substantial \n``collateral damage.'' The administration is proposing to explore two \nnew nuclear weapons for attacking this category of targets. The first \nis the so-called Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, or RNEP for short. \nThe second is a new class of low-yield nuclear warheads.\n  These two initiatives are often confused in the press or thought to \nbe different versions of a mini-nuke bunker-busting nuclear weapon. The \ntwo candidates being considered by the administration for modification \ninto a RNEP, the B61 and B83 bombs, have been in the U.S. arsenal for a \nnumber of years. They are not, however, low-yield weapons. In fact, \nthey have yields in the tens of kilotons to megaton range.\n  Due to congressional concerns, the fiscal year 2003 Defense \nauthorization bill required the Department of Defense to deliver to the \nArmed Services Committees of both Chambers a report on the need for an \nRNEP before funds could be spent on the program. On March 19, 2003, the \nadministration delivered the report. After a 30-day waiting period, the \nadministration has said it will begin to study whether the B61 or B83 \nbombs can be modified into a RNEP. The administration plans to spend \nsome $15 million on this work in fiscal year 2004, and the study could \ncost as much as $46 million.\n  As for low-yield nuclear weapons, these are nuclear weapons with an \nexplosive yield of less than 5 kilotons. Ten years ago, Congress placed \na prohibition on ``research and development'' that could lead to the \nproduction of a new low-yield nuclear weapon in the fiscal year 1994 \nDefense Authorization Act. In the early 1990s, advocates of low-yield \nweapons claimed that precision strikes with such weapons could be used \nto attack weapons of mass destruction in third-world states that had \nacquired them. Congress was concerned that the development of such \nweapons would send the wrong message about the U.S. commitment to \nnonproliferation. In addition, there were fears that if such weapons \nwere developed, the firewall between nuclear and conventional weapons \nwould be removed.\n  The administration now seeks to remove the prohibition on research on \nlow-yield weapons research. The administration's Nuclear Posture Review \ncalls for exploring new nuclear weapons ``concepts'' to be able to \nattack HDBTs with reduced collateral damage. According to the \nadministration, the congressional restriction on research on low-yield \nnuclear weapons ``impedes this effort.''\n  Ignoring the policy implications of making a nuclear weapon an \nacceptable tool to be used like a conventional weapon, there is still \nthe critical question of whether such a weapon could destroy a deeply \nburied target without massive collateral damage. Could a weapon burrow \nso deep that its nuclear explosion could be safely contained within the \nEarth? The short answer to this question is no.\n  To be a bunker buster, the weapon design must protect the warhead and \nassociated electronics while it tunnels into the ground. This severely \nlimits the missile to smaller impact velocities, which, in turn, \nseverely limits how far down it can go. In fact, limits on material \nstrengths make 50 feet about the maximum depth to which a missile could \npenetrate into dry rocky soil while maintaining its integrity until the \nwarhead detonates.\n  The radioactive fallout from a nuclear weapon detonated at a maximum \ndepth of 50 feet could not be contained. Even a low-yield nuclear \nweapon of 0.1 kiloton, according to Princeton physicist Robert Nelson, \nmust penetrate about 230 feet underground for the explosion to be fully \ncontained. Based on the experience of U.S. underground tests at the \nNevada Test Site, a 5-kiloton explosive has to be buried at least 650 \nfeet to be fully contained. A 100-kiloton explosive must be at least \n1,300 feet deep.\n  To comprehend what would happen if a nuclear bunker-busting weapon \nwere used, consider the damage that would result from the use of a \n``low-yield'' 1-kiloton warhead. Such a weapon would be one-thirteenth \nthe size of the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima, and of a size that \nmay be pursued if the congressional prohibition on research on low-\nyield weapons is removed. At the maximum depth possible of 20 to 50 \nfeet, a 1-kiloton warhead would eject more than 1 million cubic feet of \nradioactive debris from a crater bigger than a football field. If such \nlow-yield weapon were used to attack a HDBT in or near a city, it could \ndevastate the area. There would be major collateral damage because the \nejected radioactive debris would create a lethal gamma-radiation field \nover a large area.\n  For the shock of a nuclear explosion to reach a hardened target at \n1,000 feet, a much larger warhead would be required, like the B61 and \nB83 bombs being considered for the RNEP. But the B61 and B83 bombs \nwould dig a much larger crater and create a substantially larger amount \nof radioactive debris, causing that much more radioactive fallout and \ndevastation.\n  I also am concerned about the logistical problems of using nuclear \nweapons in a combat setting. Destroying bunkers requires knowing \nexactly where they are and delivering a weapon with precision and \naccuracy. During Operation Enduring Freedom, American Special Forces \nwere used as spotters on the ground near the targets to provide the \nintelligence necessary to strike suspected al-Qaida command bunkers and \nweapon depots. Our Special Forces would be in great danger if on-the-\nground spotting were required for nuclear bunker busters.\n  As we have seen in our efforts to target Saddam Hussein, his bunker \ncomplexes are often located inside Baghdad. Leaders of other ``rogue \nstates'' can be expected to construct their command and control centers \ninside their capital cities too. The potential for collateral damage to \nour troops and the public our forces are liberating are obvious.\n  Another consideration is battlefield assessment. Some bomb damage \nassessment can be done from the air, but if a closer look is needed, \nhow soon could troops be sent in to determine if the strike was \nsuccessful? The answer depends on the importance we place on the safety \nand health of our forces. If we use the underground Nevada Test Site as \none real-world example, it will be a very long time. If battle planners \nneed assessment more quickly, or we need to recover evidence of what \nwas contained in a bunker, then American soldiers and marines will be \nput at risk.\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n  This is not a theoretical consideration. We are discussing DNA \ntesting of bodies found in Iraq to determine if they are in fact Saddam \nHussein, his sons, or his closest associates. Had the administration \nused a nuclear weapon to destroy Saddam Hussein's command bunker, this \ntask would be infinitely more difficult, and more dangerous.\n  I appreciate the challenge that deeply hardened bunkers pose. I am \nnot convinced that RNEP or low-yield nuclear weapons are the answer. \nIndeed, the Pentagon already has a number of conventional weapons \ncapable of destroying hardened targets buried at 50 feet, or putting \nthem out of action by blocking entrances and exits. Moreover, ADM James \nEllis, Commander-in-Chief of U.S. STRATCOM, recently told Congress that \nhe plans to emphasize conventional options in STRATCOM's new global \nstrike mission in order to reduce U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons. \nResearch and development have improved the precision, penetrating \ncapability, and explosive power of conventional weapons dramatically \nover the last decade. Further research and development on conventional \nweapons to attack buried and hardened targets are underway.\n  Sometimes, the simplest solution is the correct one. We do not need a \nnuclear weapon to destroy a tunnel entrance or a mineshaft. The same \nresearch in material science and precision guidance that will allow a \nmissile to aim and protect the warhead to penetrate farther should be \napplied to conventional bunker busters. Conventional bunker busters \ncould meet the challenge of threatening the several hundred most \nhardened and deep targets in question. Conventional bunker busters \nwould not place civilian populations or our forces at undue risk and \nharm, and would keep the barrier between nuclear and conventional \nweapons high and wide.\n  Finally, we must keep in mind the serious international implications \nof the administration's pursuit of new nuclear weapons designs. Russian \nnuclear weapons designers have advocated new generations of more usable \nnuclear weapons. If the United States starts down this path, Russia \nwill be encouraged to do the same. If Russia begins, maybe China will \ntoo. A new arms race in supposedly low-yield and ``usable'' nuclear \nweapons will result. If NATO forces move farther east, Russia may \ndeploy such weapons opposite NATO forces. China may view them as usable \nin crisis with Taiwan. We should stop this new tactical nuclear arms \nrace before it starts. We should not develop the RNEP. We should keep \nthe prohibition on research on the low-yield nuclear weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5337-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JIM CLAYTON\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Tennessean, James L. Clayton, better known as Jim.\n  Jim Clayton is the son of a sharecropper and was raised in West \nTennessee. This impressive Tennessean has lived the American dream of \nHoratio Alger. From his most humble beginnings, he has gone on to \nbecome one of the wealthiest men in the United States. Mr. Clayton is \nthe entrepreneur behind Clayton Homes, Inc., a $1.2 billion \nmanufactured-housing company, which is one of Tennessee's great \neconomic treasures.\n  Last week, Warren Buffett, the widely respected head of Berkshire \nHathaway, recognized what we in Tennessee have long known about the \nquality of Clayton Homes by offering $1.7 billion for the purchase of \nClayton Homes' manufactured-home empire.\n  Mr. Clayton has served as chairman of the board of Clayton Homes, \nInc., since he founded the original Clayton auto sales companies in \n1956. In 1966, he expanded and branched out into manufactured housing \nand sold his automobile dealerships in 1981. The Clayton Homes \ncorporate headquarters is located in the county of my hometown, Blount \nCounty, TN. Clayton Homes employs 2,500 Tennesseans who work in its \nsales centers and factories in excellent jobs. Thousands more \nTennesseans are employed in good jobs as a result, direct and indirect, \nof Clayton Homes. And I am pleased to say that as a result of the \nnegotiations, Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to leave Clayton Homes and \nits employees in Tennessee.\n  I want to say a few words about Jim Clayton, who is a good and long-\ntime friend. Mr. Clayton received his college degree from the \nUniversity of Tennessee in 1957 and his law degree from the University \nOf Tennessee College Of Law in 1964. He has received several honorary \ndoctoral degrees and numerous business awards, including many Wall \nStreet Transcript Gold Awards, Silver Awards, and a Bronze Award as the \ntop chief executive in the manufactured-housing industry. Forbes, the \nbusiness magazine, has named Clayton Homes, Inc., one of its 200 Best-\nManaged Companies at least nine times. Clayton Homes has received the \nPlatinum Award for being one of the top companies in the United States. \nJust this year, Worth magazine recognized Jim Clayton as one of \nTennessee's wealthiest residents. Mr. Clayton's amazing story from \nsharecroppers' son to America's business elite can be found in his \nfascinating autobiography, First a Dream.\n  Mr. President, not only is Jim Clayton outstanding in the business \narena, he is also an outstanding member of the Knoxville, TN community. \nHe has made generous contributions to many charitable causes, including \n$3.25 million for construction of the Knoxville Museum of Art; $1 \nmillion for the University of Tennessee College of Law for its Center \nfor Entrepreneurial Law; $1 million to start the Clayton Birthing \nCenter at Baptist Hospital; and many grants to K-12 educational \nprograms, most of which were given anonymously.\n  Mr. Clayton also generously donates his time to various committees \nand community organizations that work to improve Knoxville and its \nsurrounding communities.\n  I know Mr. Clayton and count him as a friend. Despite his great \nwealth and success, I know him to be a warm and humble person. But my \ncolleagues need not take the word of one of Mr. Clayton's friends. Many \nother Tennesseans have told me over many years of how helpful, kind, \nand approachable Mr. Clayton is, what a perfect gentleman he is. Mr. \nPresident, compliments do not get much better than that.\n  Mr. President, this brief statement cannot capture all the strengths \nof Jim Clayton and his manifold good works for his employees, his \ncustomers, his community, and his State. I did want to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention the accomplishments and legacy of Jim Clayton, \nand I am honored to recognize his contributions to Tennessee and \nAmerica as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5337-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5337-S5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NATURALIZATION AND FAMILY PROTECTION FOR MILITARY MEMBERS ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Madam President, Ralph Waldo Emerson once put \ninto words what many know about the art of education, but many of us \nsometimes fail to realize: ``The secret of education is respecting the \npupil.''\n  I rise today to recognize an exceptional teacher whom we are \nfortunate to have in South Dakota, who has never forgotten this maxim. \nIndeed, she has chosen to live by it. Connie Krueger of Rapid City, SD \nwas recently recognized for her commitment to education and to her \nstudents by the South Dakota Council of Teachers of English when she \nwas named the 2003 Language Arts Teacher of the Year. I want to take a \nmoment today to recognize Connie for this highly deserved honor, and to \ncommend her lifelong dedication to learning and young people.\n  I consider myself especially lucky to have known Connie before she \nformally became an educator, when we both roamed the halls of \nVermillion High School as fellow students. Even as a teenager, it was \nevident that Connie had a passion for life and learning that was almost \ncontagious. Connie and I were two of the many students influenced by \nanother great teacher, Mrs. Donna Gross. Connie credits Mrs. Gross as \nbeing a large part of the reason for her decision to enter the field of \neducation, and I know that Mrs. Gross is very proud of what Connie has \ndone for students and education in South Dakota.\n  One of Connie's many contributions to education in South Dakota is \nher participation in, and advocacy for, the Dakota Writing Project. \nFunded by the National Writing Project, the Dakota Writing Project is a \ncollaborative university and school staff development program to \nimprove the teaching and learning of writing in South Dakota \nclassrooms. Connie has been instrumental in the growth and development \nof the project, which gives teachers the opportunity to learn from \nother teachers, while also demonstrating the cross-disciplinary \nimportance of writing. Through her work with the project, Connie not \nonly empowers her colleagues, but also provides educational benefits to \nall the lives that her colleagues touch.\n  At the heart of everything that she does is the interest in her \nstudents. On her nomination form for the award, Connie wrote that she \n``will honestly answer any question my students ask, although I reserve \nthe right to not answer if the question makes me uncomfortable. I've \nyet to use that veto.'' It is this kind of respect and openness with \nher students, coupled with her love for the subject matter, that has \nmade he such an exceptional educator.\n  Her love of education, and of English, is also evident in the \nprofessions that her own children, Mike and Heidi, have chosen. Mike \naspires to be a teacher, and Heidi is completing her doctorate in \nlinguistics at the University of Chicago. I know Mike and Heidi are \nvery proud of the prestigious honor bestowed upon their mother, and the \nhard work and dedication she has shown them over the years.\n  In a recent article highlighting her award, Connie stated that her \ngoal for this year has been, ``Be joyful.'' Well, thanks to Connie, \nmuch joy, knowledge, and inspiration has been shared with students and \neducators across South Dakota.\n  I consider myself one of the many lucky South Dakotans whose lives \nhave been touched by Connie, and I thank her for her hard work, her \ndedication, and for sharing her passion for life and learning with all \nof us. Our State is truly blessed by her extraordinary talent and \ncommitment to educational excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5338-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMYRTLE BEACH'S CAROLINA FOREST HIGH SCHOOL TO COMPETE IN WE THE PEOPLE \n                              COMPETITION\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I want to recognize the \nstudents of Carolina Forest High School in Myrtle Beach, SC, who will \nbe visiting Washington in late April to compete in the national finals \nof the ``We The People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. \nRight now the students are conducting research and preparing for the \ncontest, which will test their knowledge of the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights against 1,200 students from across the country. They \nhave earned the trip by showing they were the best of the best in my \nState, all the more remarkable considering the school graduated its \nfirst class just 3 years ago.\n  Obviously, I hope my fellow South Carolinians win it all, but, \nwhatever happens, we are all winners from this contest. When young \npeople, on their own, want to understand the fundamental principles and \nvalues of our democracy, they are more likely to vote. They are more \nlikely to participate in political life. They are more likely to take \nserious the civic duties that this Nation needs of our citizens. I wish \nthese young South Carolinians the best of luck and thank them for their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5338-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE STUDENTS FROM WEST WARWICK HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. REED. Madam President, today I rise in the special \nrecognition of the students of West Warwick Senior High School for \nrepresenting the State of Rhode Island in the national competition for \nthe ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. This \nyear's national competition will take place on April 26 to 28, 2003.\n  The ``We the People'' program and competition are administered by the \nCenter for Civic Education. The program is an extensive one, developed \nto educate students about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The \ncompetition is modeled after hearings in Congress and consists of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on \nconstitutional topics. The students' testimony is followed by a period \nof questioning by the judges who probe their depth of understanding and \nability to apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  Our current global situation has increased the importance of \ninitiatives which help young people to understand the fundamental \nideals and principles of our government. We cannot take these ideals \nand principles for granted. Instead, we must hold them as standards in \nour endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional \ndemocracy. It is of vital importance for future generations to \nunderstand the convictions that bind us together as a nation.\n  I believe that these students from West Warwick deserve added \nrecognition. Not only is this their second consecutive State \nchampionship, this year's State competition took place just 2 weeks \nafter the tragic fire in West Warwick that injured and took the lives \nof almost 290 family, friends, and neighbors of these young adults. In \nspite of their hometown's mourning, these students were able to \ncontinue their diligent preparation for the statewide ``We the People'' \ncompetition, and win. The West Warwick High School students will be \njoining 1,200 others from across the United States.\n  On behalf of all Rhode Islanders, I would like to congratulate the \nfollowing students: Carly Alvernaz, Linzy Alvernaz, Jennifer Bartley, \nStacy Costa, Sara Dalton, Ryan Desrochers, Megan Dougherty, Jillian \nDrummond, Elizabeth Duggan, Katheryn Flynn, Ashley Iasimone, Thomas \nKelly, Paris Legault, Paul Piacitelli, Daniel Politelli, Lisa Powers, \nAli Shihadeh, Nicholas St. Germain, Christen Varin, Russell Venditto, \nand Meaghan Whitford. In addition, I would like to acknowledge their \nteacher Marc Leblanc, the Rhode Island State coordinator, Michael \nTrofi, and the district coordinator, Henry Cote, for their dedication \nto this program over the years. I wish the students from West Warwick \nHigh School the best of luck at the ``We the People'' national \nfinals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5338-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5338-S5339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             COMMUNITY HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise to salute a World War II \nveteran from my home State of Oregon. Today, I want to recognize the \nlife and contributions of Hazel Ying Lee, a courageous woman who died \ntragically in the line of duty.\n  Hazel Ying Lee was born in Portland, OR in 1912. At the tender age of \n19, Ms. Lee piloted her first flight. The same year, she earned her \ncommercial pilot's license at a time when fewer than 1\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\npercent of American pilots were women.\n  When she was 20 years old, Ms. Lee traveled to China to contribute to \nthe war effort. At the time, women were not allowed to join the Chinese \nair Force, so Ms. Lee worked to open a school in Canton during that \ntime and worked for an information group.\n  In 1938, Ms. Lee returned to the United States just prior to the \nJapanese invasion of China. Because of her previous flight training, \nMs. Lee was able to enter the Women's Flying Training Detachment, WFTD, \nand trained to fly a range of military planes. Ms. Lee was one of 112 \nproud women graduates from the fourth WFTD. Upon her completion of the \nprogram in 1943, Ms. Lee joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots, \nWASP, an elite group that made invaluable contributions to the war \neffort.\n  Ms. Lee was assigned to the Air Transport Command's 3rd Ferrying \nSquadron at Romulus Army Air Base in Michigan. From this post, it was \nher duty to transport aircraft to military positions from the factories \naround the United States. These women were responsible for the \ntransportation of over 70 different kinds of aircraft, all critically \nneeded for the war.\n  While at Romulus Army Air Base, Ms. Lee attended Officer Candidate \nSchool in preparation to become a commissioned officer. Upon the \ncompletion of that training, Ms. Lee was one of a very select group of \nwomen qualified to fly all the Army's single engine fighter aircraft.\n  In November of 1944, Ms. Lee went to the Bell aircraft factory at \nNiagara Falls, NY, to pick up a new fighter plane to be flown to Great \nFalls, MT. Bad weather complicated her trip and caused delays in \nlanding in Montana. Ms. Lee was cleared to land by the control tower \nwhile another plane was descending to land on the same runway. As both \nplanes lowered to the darkened landing strip, the control tower radioed \nfor them to pull up. Due to a radio malfunction, the two aircraft \ncollided and crashed onto the runway. Ms. Lee sustained severe burns \nand trauma in the resulting fire. Heroic efforts were made to save her, \nbut, sadly, Hazel Ying Lee died of her injuries on November 25, 1944.\n  Ms. Lee made a selfless commitment to her country in a time of great \nperil, ultimately giving her life to her duty. It is with humble \nrespect and praise that I offer my recognition today to Hazel Ying Lee, \nin hopes she will always be remembered for her bravery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5339-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              RYAN QUARLES\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Madam President, I have known Hootie Johnson for \nthe past 50 years and yes, there is no one more well thought of, more \npopular, more respected in South Carolina.\n  A star football hero in college, he came on as a natural leader in \nthe banking business. He is one with this so-called vision, leading the \nway to integration, opportunity and, yes, as head of Augusta National \nhaving women play the course. I have read extreme nonsense from every \nangle critical of Hootie and withheld public comment because I knew \ncoming from the State it would lack a certain amount of credibility. \nNow, Sally Jenkins in this morning's Washington Post has responded for \nme in her column ``Hootie and the Blowhard''. I ask that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  The article follows:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 11, 2003]\n\n                         Burk Is Way Off Course\n\n                           (By Sally Jenkins)\n\n       Augusta, GA.--Dorein Vanderzahm poked her umbrella into the \n     red clay Georgia field and announced, definitively, ``Fire \n     ants.'' If you stooped down and examined the dirt, there they \n     were, swarming over the crabgrass acre where Martha Burk will \n     hold her protest against Augusta National, ready to blister \n     ankles. ``I think they may come as an additional surprise to \n     her,'' Vanderzahm said. Burk is liable to be surprised by \n     many things here, given her reliance on old southern \n     caricatures, the redneck sheriff with the star-shaped badge, \n     the mush-mouthed Bubba, and the southern magnolia who swings \n     her umbrella soft as a hanging fern. That's why Burk's \n     campaign against Augusta National's all-male membership has \n     been greeted with fire-ant hostility by many here, and why \n     even the women of Augusta find it ultimately weak, and wrong: \n     because it's based on stereotype and mischaracterization.\n       If you're a white male of a certain age and luckless enough \n     to speak with a twang, then apparently you must be a tobacco-\n     spitting good old boy, no matter what your actual record. For \n     months now, Burk has done her best to make Hootie Johnson, \n     the honey-voiced president of Augusta National, out to be a \n     sexist hick or worse. What's more, some of the media has \n     shamelessly perpetuated the image, most notably the New York \n     Times, which has relentlessly excoriated him while until \n     recently giving Johnson's notable career as a civil rights \n     activist and women's advocate short shrift.\n       The truth about Johnson, a banker from South Carolina, is \n     that he's a longtime progressive who has fought long and hard \n     to integrate South Carolina's schools, banks, businesses and \n     politics, and launched the careers of scores of women and \n     minorities. He has also fought to remove the Confederate flag \n     from the statehouse. He is nobody's chauvinist, or bigot, or \n     good old boy. And yet when a Ku Klux Klan crank applied for a \n     permit to protest at Augusta, Burk actually said, and got \n     away with it, ``Augusta National should not be shocked by the \n     KKK's endorsement. They have behaved in a manner that \n     attracts this type of support.''\n       This smearing of southern white men has eroded any \n     inclination to listen to Burk around here, and it's a kind of \n     discourse that would be considered universally despicable if \n     it was turned on women or minorities. People have been taking \n     roundhouse swings at privileged white men for a long time; \n     that's nothing new. But Burk is not just fire-breathing; she \n     is inaccurate. Burk seems not to have done any homework on \n     who Hootie is, what he has done or what The Masters\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n\n     is--she actually suggested they move the tournament to a \n     different course. She is so wrong about so many things it's \n     tough to take her seriously on anything about which she might \n     be right.\n       The fact is that Johnson defies category, and for that \n     matter so does Dorein Vanderzahm. Vanderzahm doesn't agree \n     with Burk--``not a bit,'' she said.\n       Vanderzahm was born and raised in Augusta--she knows about \n     the fire ants because she used to cut through the field--and \n     it would be convenient for Burk if Vanderzahm was a \n     downtrodden southern housewife or a mindless belle, but she's \n     not. She's a physician, who disagrees with Burk on principle, \n     and because she finds the whole campaign silly. ``I think she \n     has an overblown sense of importance,'' Vanderzahm says.\n       Burk also has portrayed local law enforcement as heavies, a \n     bunch of Bull Connors doing the bidding of rich men, because \n     they won't allow her to protest in front of the main entrance \n     to the club. They cite safety and traffic reasons--reasons \n     perfectly legitimate to anyone who has ever tried to \n     negotiate the choked intersection. Deputy sheriff Johnny \n     Whittle sat in his black-and-white squad car, parked under an \n     old tree in the field of crabgrass where Burk will protest. \n     He will be in charge of keeping the peace at Burk's protest. \n     A heavy badge was pinned on his uniform pocket, and his shirt \n     collar was buttoned tight, above which loomed a face that was \n     more John Wayne than John Wayne's. ``Oh, we're used to it,'' \n     he said. ``We've been stereotyped our whole lives. Everybody \n     says watch out for the Georgia police, but we try to get out \n     of locking people up.''\n       Whittle expects nine groups of protestors to show up \n     Saturday, including the Burk flotilla, the Rainbow/PUSH \n     Coalition, the New Black Panther Party, a hilarious anti-\n     Burkist faction called People Against Stupid Protests, and \n     the lone self-described KKK member, whom Whittle simply \n     refers to as ``that person, for lack of a better word.'' \n     Whittle adds, ``None of us agree with him, but we have to \n     protect him.'' Not that Whittle agrees with Burk, either.\n       ``They don't let me in that club,'' Whittle said. ``Are \n     they discriminating against me, too? To be honest, I don't \n     want to go in there and set down where they smoke those \n     stinking cigars. It just seems like there's a lot of better \n     things to be done in the cause for women.''\n       Burk filed suit complaining that by being relegated to the \n     field, she will miss her audience. She lost the suit. \n     Actually, the field is centrally located across the street \n     from the course; anyone going to the tournament, or for that \n     matter making a run to Eckerd, can't miss it. Thursday, even \n     before she arrived and on a day when play was cancelled, \n     people rolled down car windows as they passed the field, and \n     shouted, ``Say no to Martha!'' Kiosks sold ``I Support \n     Hootie'' buttons, as well as golf balls that said, ``Drive \n     Burk Out'' and T-shirts that said ``The Burk Stops Here.'' \n     What Burk should worry about is not whether the audience will \n     miss her, but whether she has lost her audience \n     altogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5340-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5340-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5340-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the \nConcurrent resolution (H.

A bill to reauthorize the Museum and Library Services Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nreauthorizing the Museum and Library Services Act. I am joined in this \neffort by Senator Reed, Senator Frist, Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, \nand several other colleagues of mine. Libraries and museums serve as \nimportant cultural institutions in communities throughout our Nation, \nand this legislation will provide them with continued Federal support \nthrough innovative grant programs administered by the Institute of \nMuseum and Library Services.\n  Specifically, this bill authorizes $250 million for libraries and \n$41.5 million for museums in 2004, and such sums as necessary in 2005 \nthrough 2009. In addition, it authorizes a doubling of the minimum \nstate allotment under the Grants to State Library Agencies Program, up \nto $680,000. That provision, coupled with the expected increase in \nappropriations for 2004, will greatly benefit New Hampshire's \nlibraries.\n  The bill contains a number of other important provisions. Recognizing \nthe important of school libraries, it requires that the Institute's \nlibrary activities be coordinated with the school library provisions of \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. My bill also prohibits projects \ndetermined to be obscene from receiving Federal funds, requires the \nInstitute to conduct analyses of the need for museum and library \nservices and the effectiveness of funded projects in meeting those \nneeds, consolidates the library and museum advisory boards into one \nentity, and prohibits funds appropriate under the Act's authority from \nbeing used for library or museum construction.\n  furthermore, this bill increases the indemnity limits in the Arts and \nArtifacts Indemnity Act, thereby facilitating the international \nexchange and display of works of art, books, rare documents and other \npublished materials, artifacts, and films and other audiovisual media. \nThis will ensure that people throughout the world are exposed to \nAmerican culture and that our own citizens will have richer educational \nopportunities available as well.\n  I want to thank Senator Reed for his leadership on this issue, as \nwell as Senator Frist, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Enzi, particularly. \nTogether we have crafted a bipartisan bill that will serve our museums \nand libraries well in the coming years. I expect to move this bill \nthrough the HELP Committee soon, and look forward to its speedy \npassage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to join Senators Gregg, \nKennedy, Frist, and others in introducing the Museum and Library \nServices Act.\n  This legislation, which extends the authorization of museum and \nlibrary services through fiscal year 2009 and makes several important \nimprovements to current law, is a compromise based on S. 238, \nbipartisan legislation I introduced with Senators Kennedy, Cochran, \nCollins, Snowe, and others in January.\n  Like S. 238, this bill ensures that library activities are \ncoordinated with the school library program I authored, which is now \npart of the No child Left Behind Act of 2001. It also doubles the \nminimum State allotment under the Library Program, which will enable \nsmaller States such as Rhode Island to benefit and implement the \nvaluable services and programs that larger States have been able to put \nin place. It includes an increase in the indemnity limits under the \nArts and Artifacts Indemnity Act to ensure continued support for \nAmerican museums as they facilitate international cultural exchanges \nthrough touring exhibitions here in the U.S. and loans of American art \naround the world.\n  The bill also updates the uses of funds for library and museum \nprograms and increases the authorization under the Library services and \nTechnology Act, LSTA, from $150 million to $250 million and the Museum \nServices Act from $28.7 million to $41.5 million. We should meet these \nfunding levels in the appropriations process due to the strong \nbipartisan nature of the bill we are introducing today. I personally \nbelieve that our libraries and museums should be more robustly funded, \nparticularly as these institutions play increasingly important roles in \nour lives. Indeed, the bipartisan bill that Senator Kennedy and I put \nforward earlier this year included even higher funding levels. But, in \nan effort to move this bill forward, I have agreed to support this \ncompromise.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work \nfor its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 889. A bill to accord honorary citizenship to the alien victims of \nthe September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States and \nto provide for the granting of citizenship to the alien spouses and \nchildren of certain victims of such attacks; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Terrorist \nVictim Citizenship Relief Act, a bill that would provide citizenship \nrelief to many families adversely affected by the attacks of September \n11, 2001.\n  In the time since that tragic day, I have met with several of the \nfamilies of the victims of the terrorist attacks to discuss a variety \nof measures in the wake of that national calamity. They have been \ndealing with a personal anguish that many of us can only imagine. In my \nview, Congress must do more to help the families of the victims of \nSeptember 11, and the Terrorist Victim Citizenship Relief Act should be \na part of that effort.\n  When American citizens, foreign nationals, and immigrants perished in \nthe cowardly terrorist acts of September 11, the immigration status of \nhundreds of families was thrown into turmoil. The attacks were on \nAmerican soil on a major American institution and directed at the \nUnited States. Yet American citizens were not the only victims. \nHundreds of temporary workers and immigrants died shoulder-to-shoulder \nwith thousands of Americans. Their deaths should be acknowledged and \ntheir families should be honored.\n  My legislation would bestow honorary citizenship on legal immigrants \nand non-immigrants who died in the disaster. This would honor their \nspirit and their tremendous sacrifice. Perhaps more important, the bill \nwould offer citizenship to surviving spouses and children, subject to a \nbackground investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In the \nspirit of fairness and unity, it is appropriate and responsible to \noffer the privilege of citizenship to families who lost so much because \nof this attack on the United States.\n  About 3,000 people lost their lives when four planes crashed on that \nfateful September morning. Nationals from\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\nsome 86 countries perished in the attack, including visitors, non-\nimmigrant workers, and legal permanent residents.\n  America was not the only country that suffered losses. There was good \nreason the complex was called the World Trade Center. In the September \n11 attacks, 86 countries including England, Germany, Mexico, Colombia, \nJapan, Canada, Australia, the Philippines, Ireland, South Africa, and \nPakistan suffered tragic losses. And there were many more.\n  In New Jersey, there are dozens of poignant stories of immigrant \nfamilies who experienced tragic losses in the World Trade Center \ndisaster. These innocent people have lost husbands and wives, sons and \ndaughters, sisters and brothers. Their families have been fractured and \ntheir livelihoods jeopardized.\n  Immigrant families have been forced to grapple with a bureaucratic \nnightmare, wading through the myriad of programs available to the \nfamilies of victims in an effort to keep their heads above water. They \nare often disheartened to learn that, although their loved ones died in \nthe same attack, non-citizens are ineligible for many of the programs \ndesigned to assist the surviving families of victims.\n  Concerns about immigration status have only added to the tremendous \nburden immigrant families are already confronting. Take the example of \none New Jersey woman who came to my office seeking assistance. Her \nimmigration status was directly dependent on the non-immigrant worker \nstatus of her husband who died in the attack. Both of her children were \nborn in the United States. They are full citizens and are enrolled in \nAmerican schools.\n  She wants to continue to raise her children in the United States. \nHowever, under the antiterrorism legislation that was passed in the \nlast Congress, this mother of two is technically deportable right now. \nMy legislation would grant her citizenship immediately, helping her to \navoid the burden of removing her children from the only country they \nhave ever truly known, while they are still grappling with the loss of \ntheir father. Granting her citizenship is the right thing to do.\n  This woman's story is but one of many. My office has received \nnumerous inquiries from immigrant families concerned that their \nimmigration status has been undermined by the death of a loved one. \nMany families were in the process of preparing the necessary paperwork \nto apply for a change in status, only to have their potential sponsor \ndie alongside thousands of others in the World Trade Center attack. \nThis legislation would ensure that those families would be allowed to \nbecome American citizens and avoid undue paperwork and heartache.\n  When perpetrating their horrific crime, the terrorists did not \ndistinguish between immigrants and American citizens or between \nundocumented workers and legal permanent residents. They were attacking \nthe United States, and, in the process, killed thousands, citizens and \nnon-citizens alike. In death, citizenship was irrelevant.\n  The thousands who died did not know it when they went to work, but \nthey were at the front lines in the next American war. Their deaths are \na tragedy that every civilized human being wishes could be reversed. \nUnfortunately, we cannot turn back the clock. However, we can \nacknowledge the tremendous loss of hundreds of immigrant families by \nallowing them to take on the full rights and responsibilities of \nAmerican citizenship.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 889\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorist Victim Citizenship \n     Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, the United States suffered a \n     series of attacks which led to the deaths of thousands of \n     people.\n       (2) Hundreds of foreign nationals perished in the attacks \n     on the American institutions on American soil.\n       (3) At that time, the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service was processing applications for adjustment in \n     immigration status for immigrants who perished in the \n     attacks.\n       (4) The immigrant or nonimmigrant status of many immigrant \n     families depends on the sponsorship of those who perished.\n       (5) The former Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     publicly stated that it would not take action against foreign \n     nationals whose immigration status is in jeopardy as a direct \n     result of the attack.\n       (6) The Commissioner of the former Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service James Ziglar stated that ``the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service will exercise its \n     discretion toward families of victims during this time of \n     mourning and readjustment''.\n       (7) Only Congress has the authority to change immigration \n     law to address unanticipated omissions in existing law to \n     account for the unique circumstances surrounding the events \n     of September 11, 2001.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECEASED ALIEN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS DEEMED TO \n                   BE UNITED STATES CITIZENS.\n\n       Notwithstanding title III of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), and except as \n     provided in section 5, each alien who died as a result of a \n     September 11, 2001, terrorist attack against the United \n     States, shall, as of that date, be considered to be an \n     honorary citizen of the United States if the alien held \n     lawful status under the immigration laws of the United States \n     as of that date.\n\n     SEC. 4. CITIZENSHIP ACCORDED TO ALIEN SPOUSES AND CHILDREN OF \n                   CERTAIN VICTIMS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.\n\n       Notwithstanding title III of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), and except as \n     provided in section 5, an alien spouse or child of an \n     individual who was lawfully present in the United States and \n     who died as a result of a September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attack against the United States shall be entitled to \n     naturalization as a citizen of the United States upon being \n     administered the oath of renunciation and allegiance in an \n     appropriate ceremony pursuant to section 337 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1448), without \n     regard to the current status of the alien spouse or child \n     under the immigration laws of the United States, if the \n     spouse or child applies to the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     for naturalization not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall record the date of naturalization of any person granted \n     naturalization under this section as being September 10, \n     2001.\n\n     SEC. 5. EXCEPTIONS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an alien \n     may not be naturalized as a citizen of the United States, or \n     afforded honorary citizenship, under this Act if the alien \n     is--\n       (1) inadmissible under paragraph (2) or (3) of section \n     212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or deportable \n     under paragraph (2) or (4) of section 237(a) of that Act, \n     including any terrorist perpetrator of a September 11, 2001, \n     terrorist attack against the United States; or\n       (2) a member of the family of a person described in \n     paragraph (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mrs. Collins, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 890. A bill to amend the individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct to provide grants to State educational agencies to establish high \ncost funds from which local educational agencies are paid a percentage \nof the costs of providing a free appropriate public education to high \nneed children and other high costs associated with educating children \nwith disabilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nSupporting Success for High Need Students Act, and I thank Senator \nCollins and Senator Kennedy for joining me in offering this \nlegislation. In recent years, I have come to this floor many times to \ntalk about special education, often in the context of the need to fully \nfund the Individuals with Disabilities Act, or IDEA as it is often \nknown.\n  Mandatory full funding of IDEA is an important issue that should have \nbeen settled many years ago. The Federal Government should be meeting \nthe commitment it made over 25 years ago to fund 40 percent of the \nexcess cost of special education. Two years ago, this body finally \nrecognized that reality and passed an amendment to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act that would have fulfilled that promise for \nstudents, schools, districts and States struggling to make up where we \nfall short. I was disappointed that the President made it clear that he \ndid not support funding this long-standing mandate, and that the House \nvoted not to accept the Senate amendment. At that time I voiced my \ncommitment to continuing to fight to provide the full funding that is \nlong overdue, and I will continue that fight. Unfortunately though, \nthere is a small minority of\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nstudents whose educational needs will not be adequately supported even \nwhen IDEA is fully funded.\n  High-need students, whose disabilities may make education an \nextremely expensive endeavor, must nonetheless have the services and \nsupports they need to receive a full, appropriate public education. \nChildren who are severely autistic or have severe developmental \ndisabilities, for example, may need special facilities, equipment, \neducational tools, medical services, professional individualized \nattention and other resources in order to get the education they need \nto succeed. These needs often far exceed those of most students with \ndisabilities, and so do their costs. The National Center for Education \nStatistics estimates that the average per pupil expenditure to educate \na child in the United States was $7,156 in the 2000-01 academic year. \nThe cost of educating a high-needs student can far exceed that. Costs \noccasionally exceed $150,000 per year--more than 20 times the average--\nto provide students with disabilities the education they need. However, \nno price is too high to fulfill the civil rights of America's children.\n  With so many Americans out of work, and State and local budgets \nsqueezed to the brink of disaster, these costs can be a prohibitive \nburden for school districts to shoulder. Small, rural school districts \nor districts near specialized medical facilities--which are often in \nour major cities, but can be in unexpected locations such as near a \nmajor military base--are most heavily impacted by these costs. But in \nthe right combination of circumstances, such as a family with \nquadruplets who are all severely developmentally delayed, any district \ncan feel the pinch of the costs incurred from educating these high-need \nchildren.\n  I know that educators, administrators and elected officials at every \nlevel want to do the right thing. They are trying to give students with \ndisabilities the best education they can. But too often, they simply \nlack the resources to do so, or they find themselves faced with a no-\nwin situation--choosing between implementing an after school program \nfor the entire district or funding one high-need student's \nIndividualized Education Plan. The losers in this equation are the \nstudents--with or without disabilities--their parents, and our society \nas a whole. The resulting tensions do a grave disservice to our \ncommunities.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today--the Supporting Success for High Need \nStudents Act of 2003--is a carefully crafted bill that would address \nthis problem. This legislation adds funding to IDEA targeted \nspecifically for high-need students. It authorizes $750 million in \nfiscal year 2004 for grants to be administered by the States. This \nfunding would be allocated to the States using the same formula that \napportions funding for IDEA part B. If a high-need student's education \ncosts more than four times the average per pupil expenditure, the \nschool district would be able to apply for a grant to offset those \ncosts. I believe that we should preserve incentives for school \ndistricts to manage those costs, so my bill would allow districts to \nrecover three-quarters of the costs above that 400 percent threshold to \neducate high-needs students. Districts could not be reimbursed with \nthese funds for any legal costs incurred through due process \nproceedings, or costs that should be reimbursed by Medicaid. The funds \nwould only cover education and related services included in an \nappropriately formulated Individualized Education Plan.\n  To illustrate, let's assume that four times the average per pupil \nexpenditure is $25,000. If a school district were serving a student \nwhose education cost $45,000 a year, that district could recoup about \n$15,000 from the State grant. If a district were serving a student \nwhose education cost $225,000, that district could recoup about \n$150,000. This bill would not make up all the additional costs of \neducating high-need students, but it would give struggling districts a \nmuch-needed lifeline by making them a lot more manageable.\n  It has often been noted that the moral test of a society is how it \ncares for its weakest members. It is the government's appropriate role \nand duty to protect the basic human dignity of all its citizens to \nensure that even the neediest among us have a fair opportunity to \nrealize their dreams and potential. That is why we passed the special \neducation law over 25 years ago, and that is why we should pass the \nSupporting Success for High Need Students Act his year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Ensign, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Corzine, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 893. A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \nestablish provisions with respect to religious accommodation in \nemployment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join concerned \ncolleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, as well as concerned \ncitizens, including Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs among many \nother faiths. We come together in support of a simple proposition. \nAmerica is distinguished internationally as a land of religious \nfreedom. It should be a place where people should not be forced to \nchoose between keeping their faith and keeping their job. That is why I \nam joining with Senators Kerry, Ensign, Mikulski, Smith, Murray, Hatch, \nLieberman, Brownback, and Corzine in introducing the bipartisan \nWorkplace Religious Freedom Act.\n  This legislation provides a much needed, balanced approach to \nreconciling the needs of people of faith in the workplace. It \nrecognizes that work and religion can be reconciled without undue \nhardship. Americans continue to be a religious people, many with a deep \npersonal faith commitment. With this commitment comes personal \nreligious standards which govern personal activity. For example, some \nAmericans don't work on Saturdays, while others don't work on Sundays. \nNot because they're lazy or frivolous, but because their faith \nconvictions call for a Sabbath day, requiring a day to be set aside as \nholy.\n  Similarly, some Americans need to wear a skullcap to work, or a head \ncovering, or a turban. As a Nation whose great strength rests in \ndiversity, surely we can protect such diverse yet simple and \nunobtrusive expressions of personal faith. Surely we're generous \nenough, and respecting enough as a Nation, to support others in genuine \nexpressions of their faith. I am particularly anxious for the religious \nminorities, for the Muslims and the Jews and the others who are very \nsmall in number but great in conviction. In our increasingly diverse \nsociety, many remain among us who still hold to ancient, heartfelt \nprinciples governed by a deep personal belief. I submit to you they \ndeserve the decency of respect which includes our protection in \npreserving their peaceful religious expressions. This is a core \nprinciple which cannot be compromised, because it speaks to the essence \nof who we are as a people committed to preserving freedom. Religious \nfreedom is best protected and maintained by respecting the diversity of \nreligious traditions, especially minority religions. The tragedy of \nSeptember 11, 2001 has reminded us that religious pluralism is one the \ngreat strengths of this country and an example to much of the world.\n  In this land of religious freedom, one would hope that employers \nwould spontaneously accommodate the religious needs of their employees \nwhenever reasonable. That is, after all, what we do whenever possible \nhere in Congress. For example, we don't conduct votes or hearings on \ncertain holidays so that Members and staff can observe their religious \nholy days. While most private employers also extend this simple but \nimportant decency to their workers, some unfortunately do not.\n  Historically, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was meant to \naddress conflicts between religion and work. On its face it requires \nemployers to ``reasonably accommodate'' the religious needs of their \nemployees as long as this does not impose an ``undue hardship'' on the \nemployer. The problem is that our Federal courts have essentially read \nthese lines out of the law by ruling that any hardship is an undue \nhardship. This is not right, nor does it hold with the spirit of this \ngreat Nation which was founded as a refuge for religious freedom. Thus, \na Maryland trucking company can try to force a devout Christian truck \ndriver to take a Sunday shift. A local sheriff's department in Nevada \ncan tell a Seventh Day Adventist that she must work a Saturday shift if \nshe wants to continue working for them.\n  The Workplace Religious Freedom Act will re-establish the principle \nthat employers must reasonably accommodate the religious needs of \nemployees such as these. This legislation is carefully crafted and \nstrikes an appropriate balance between religious accommodation, while \nensuring that an undue burden is not forced upon American employers. It \nis flexible and case-oriented on an individual basis. Thus, a smaller \nbusiness with less resources and personnel would not be asked to \naccommodate religious employees in exactly the same fashion as would a \nlarge manufacturing concern.\n  I am proud of the fact that this is a bipartisan effort. I am proud \nthat this legislation is supported by such a broad spectrum of groups \nranging from the Christian Legal Society, the Union of Orthodox Jewish \nCongregations, the\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\nSouthern Baptist Convention, the National Council of Churches, the \nNorth American Council for Muslim Women, the Sikh Resource Taskforce, \nthe Seventh Day Adventist Church, the American Jewish Committee and \nmany others.\n  America is a great Nation because we honor not only the freedom of \nconscience--but also the freedom to exercise one's religion according \nto the dictates of that religious conscience. This liberty, known as \nthe ``first freedom,'' is worthy of our continued vigilance. It should \nbe supported from all quarters through religious accommodation in both \nthe public and private sectors. This fundamental freedom is protected \nhere in this legislation which re-establishes an appropriate balance \nbetween the demands of work and the principles of faith.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am extremely pleased to join with my \ncolleague Senator Santorum today to introduce the Workplace Religious \nFreedom Act of 2003. Senators Ensign, Mikulski, Smith, Murray, Hatch, \nLieberman, Brownback, and Corzine have all joined us as original \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n  The Workplace Religious Freedom Act would protect workers from on-\nthe-job discrimination related to religious beliefs and practices. It \nrepresents a milestone in the protection of the religious liberties of \nall workers.\n  In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require \nemployers to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice or \nobservance unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the \nemployer. This 1972 amendment, although completely appropriate, has \nbeen interpreted by the courts so narrowly as to place little restraint \non an employer's refusal to provide religious accommodation. The \nWorkplace Religious Freedom Act will restore the weight to the \nreligious accommodation provision that Congress originally intended and \nhelp assure that employers have a meaningful obligation to reasonably \naccommodate their employees' religious practices.\n  The restoration of this protection is no small matter. For many \nreligiously observant Americans the greatest peril to their ability to \ncarry out their religious faiths on a day-to-day basis may come from \nemployers. I have heard accounts from around the country about \nemployers who will not make reasonable accommodations for employees to \nobserve the Sabbath and other holy days, or for employees to wear \nreligiously-required garb, such as a yarmulke, or for employees to wear \nclothing that meets religion-based modesty requirements.\n  The refusal of an employer absent undue hardship to provide \nreasonable accommodation of a religious practice should be seen as a \nform of religious discrimination, as originally intended by Congress in \n1972. And religious discrimination should be treated as seriously as \nany other form of discrimination that stands between Americans and \nequal employment opportunities. Enactment of the Workplace Religious \nFreedom Act will constitute an important step toward ensuring that all \nmembers of society, whatever their religious beliefs and practices, \nwill be protected from an invidious form of discrimination.\n  Even after September 11, 2001, with a heightened sense of religious \nsensitivity among the American people, securing greater protections for \nthe religious needs of employees is a major issue. In October 2001, the \nU.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a Muslim woman who \nwas pressured by her employer to stop wearing her head scarf. We must \ncome together now to pass this bipartisan legislation.\n  It is important to recognize that, in addition to protecting the \nreligious freedom of employees, this legislation protects employers \nfrom an undue burden. Employees would be allowed to take time off only \nif their doing so does not pose a significant difficulty or expense for \nthe employer. This common sense definition of undue hardship is used in \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act and has worked well in that \ncontext.\n  We have little doubt that this bill is constitutional because it \nsimply clarifies existing law on discrimination by private employers, \nstrengthening the required standard for employers. This bill does not \ndeal with behavior by State or Federal Governments or substantively \nexpand 14th Amendment rights.\n  This bill is endorsed by a wide range of organizations including the \nAgudath Israel of America, American Jewish Committee, American Jewish \nCongress, Americans for Democratic Action, Anti-Defamation League, \nBaptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, Bible Sabbath Association, \nB'nai B'rith International, Central Conference of American Rabbis, \nChristian Legal Society, Church of Scientology International, Council \non Religious Freedom, Family Research Council, General Board of Church \nand Society The United Methodist Church, General Conference of Seventh-\nday Adventists, Guru Gobind Singh Foundation, Hadassah--WZOA, Institute \non Religion and Public Policy, The Interfaith Alliance, International \nAssociation of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, International Commission on \nFreedom of Conscience, International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, \nIslamic Supreme Council of America, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, \nJewish Policy Center, NA'AMAT USA, National Association of \nEvangelicals, National Conference for Community and Justice, National \nCouncil of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., National Council of \nJewish Women, National Jewish Democratic Council, National Sikh Center, \nNorth American Council for Muslim Women, Presbyterian Church (USA), \nRabbinical Council of America, Republican Jewish Coalition, Sikh \nCouncil on Religion and Education, Sikh Mediawatch and Resource Task \nForce, Southern Baptist Convention Ethics and Religious Liberty \nCommission, Traditional Values Coalition, Union of American Hebrew \nCongregations, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, United Church of \nChrist Office for Church in Society, and United Synagogue of \nConservative Judaism.\n  I want to thank Senator Santorum for joining me to lead this effort. \nI look forward to working with him to pass this legislation so that all \nAmerican workers can be assured of both equal employment opportunities \nand the ability to practice their religion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 895. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nwireless telecommunications equipment in the definition of qualified \ntechnological equipment for purposes of determining the depreciation \ntreatment of such equipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nclarify the tax rules governing the depreciation of wireless \ntelecommunications equipment. I am joined by my distinguished colleague \nfrom Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n  Our current depreciation system, the Modified Accelerated Cost \nRecovery System, MACRS, was last reformed in 1986. At that time, the \nwireless telecommunications industry was in its infancy. Therefore, \nwireless telecommunications equipment, which is primarily computer-\nbased technology, was not assigned to a specific asset class.\n  The IRS has provided only limited guidance with respect to the \ndepreciation of wireless telecommunications equipment. In 1998, the IRS \nissued Technical Advice Memorandum, TAM, 98-25-03, which asserted that \nthe classes of assets used to provide wireless telecommunications \nservices are comparable to wireline telecommunications assets and, \nthus, should be assigned to wireline asset classes. The TAM concluded \nthat mobile switching centers should be classified in the same asset \nclass with computer-based telephone central office switching equipment, \n5-year property. However, the TAM failed to take a clear position with \nregard to the classification of cell site equipment, so there is no \npractical guidance for IRS revenue agents or taxpayers to follow.\n  Over the past decade, the IRS and wireless telecommunications \ncompanies have expended significant resources in audits and settlement \ndisputes involving the depreciation of wireless telecommunications \nequipment. This has resulted in ad hoc, inconsistent, and costly case-\nby-case determinations of the appropriate class\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\nlife for this equipment. It has created the current situation in which \nsimilarly situated companies are being treated differently, with some \nbeing required to depreciate their wireless telecommunications \nequipment over 5 years, and others over 10 years or longer.\n  I believe Congress should act to clarify the depreciation rules for \nwireless telecommunications equipment to provide certainty to the IRS \nand the taxpayer, thereby putting an end to the costly dispute \nsettlement process; to ensure a level playing field for taxpayers; and \nto provide fair tax-treatment of wireless telecommunications equipment. \nGiven the nature of this equipment and the rapid technological advances \nin the wireless industry, I believe the most appropriate classification \nfor wireless telecommunications equipment is as ``qualified \ntechnological equipment'' with a 5-year depreciable life.\n  The bill I am introducing with my colleague from Arkansas would make \nthis important clarification to the tax laws. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to enact my legislation that will provide more \nrational tax-treatment of wireless telecommunications equipment. By so \ndoing, we will take an incremental step toward modernizing the Tax \nCode's outdated depreciation rules.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 899. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrestore the full market basket percentage increase applied to payments \nto hospitals for inpatient hospital services furnished to medicare \nbeneficiaries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that will increase Medicare reimbursement to hospitals. While we \ncorrected in the omnibus appropriations bill the reimbursement issue \nfor physicians and rural hospitals, nothing was done to assist teaching \nhospitals or give hospitals a full inflationary update. Texas hospitals \nalone are facing a loss of $53 million in 2003 due to Medicare \nreimbursement cuts.\n  Hospital admissions have risen from 31 million patients in 1990 to 33 \nmillion in 2000, and the number of days in the hospital is rising as \nwell. Increased admissions, rising liability premiums, and the cost of \nadvanced technology have forced hospitals to cut back on services. The \ncost of a pint of blood increased 31 percent in 2001, an additional \n$920 million burden to hospitals. Such costs are continuing to rise, \nyet Medicare reimbursements to hospitals are not keeping pace with \ninflation and their margins are slowly shrinking. Fifty-eight percent \nof hospitals are losing money on the Medicare patients they treat.\n  This legislation, the American Hospital Preservation Act, restores \nthe market basket update and the reimbursement for indirect medical \neducation, IME, payments to teaching hospitals. The market basket \nupdate is an inflationary adjustment to account for the rising costs of \ngoods and services, and the IME payments give teaching hospitals an \nadditional Medicare reimbursement due to their higher costs of \ninpatient care. Both of these factors were cut by the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997. Restoring the cuts means $289 million to Texas hospitals \nand $6 billion nationwide over the next five years. Major teaching \nhospitals are experiencing their lowest profit margin since the late \n'90s, 2.4 percent. Patients, especially those who are seriously ill, \nrely on teaching hospitals, which make up 78 percent of all trauma \ncenters and 80 percent of all burn beds. Although only 23 percent of \nall hospitals are teaching hospitals, they deliver over two-thirds of \ncharity care.\n  Emergency rooms are increasingly used as a primary care clinic \nbecause patients cannot find a physician who accepts Medicare, and they \nare treating more individuals who are uninsured. In 2000, hospitals \nprovided $21.6 billion in uncompensated care.\n  Lower reimbursement rates coupled with bioterrorism risks and a \nworkforce shortage make our hospitals a time bomb waiting to go off. \nOur hospitals are always open and must accept anyone who walks through \ntheir doors. It is our responsibility to ensure they have adequate \nresources from the Federal Government.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the American \nHospital Preservation Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill convey the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project, the \nsavage Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, and the Intake \nIrrigation Project to the pertinent irrigation districts; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that helps a large number of family farmers on the border \nof Montana and North Dakota. The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Projects \nTitle Transfer moves ownership of these irrigation projects from \nFederal control to local control. Both the Bureau of Reclamation and \nthose relying on the projects for their livelihood agree there is \nlittle value in having the Federal Government retain ownership.\n  I introduced this legislation in the last Congress, and continue to \nbelieve it helps us to achieve the long term goals of Montana \nirrigators, and the mission of the Bureau of Reclamation. In the past I \nasked John W. Keys III, commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, his \nposition on title transfers of irrigation projects like the Lower \nYellowstone, where local irrigation districts have successfully managed \nthe Federal properties, and where the Bureau has encouraged the \ntransfer of title to the Districts. His response to me was very \nencouraging. He stated this type of title transfer ``makes sense and is \nan opportunity to move facilities from Federal ownership to more \nappropriate control.'' During our discussion Commissioner Keys promised \nto work with me and the Irrigation District to make this a reality, and \nI look forward to it.\n  The history of these projects dates to the early 1900's with the \noriginal Lower Yellowstone project being built by the Bureau of \nReclamation between 1906 and 1910. The Savage Unit was added in 1947-\n48. The end result was the creation of fertile, irrigated land to help \nspur economic development in the area. To this day, agriculture is the \nnumber one industry in the area.\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\n  The local impact of the projects is measurable in numbers, but the \ngreatest impacts can only be seen by visiting the area. About 500 \nfamily farms rely on these projects for economic subsistence, and the \nentire area relies on them to create stability in the local economy. In \nan area that has seen booms and busts in oil, gas, and other \ncommodities, these irrigated lands continued producing and offering a \nfoundation for the businesses in the area.\n  As we all know, the agricultural economy is not as strong as we'd \nlike to it to be, but these irrigated lands offer a reasonable return \nover time and are the foundation for strong communities based upon the \nideals that have made this country successful The 500 families impacted \nare hard working, honest producers, and I can think of no better people \nto manage their own irrigation projects.\n  Every day, we see an example of where the Federal Government is \ntaking on a new task. We can debate the merits of those efforts on an \nindividual basis, but I think we can all agree that while the \ngovernment gets involved in new projects, there are many that we can \nsafely pass on to State or local control. The Lower Yellowstone \nProjects are a prime example of such an opportunity, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in seeing this legislation passed as quickly as \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord., as follows:\n\n                                 S. 900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make technical amendments to the Higher Education \nAct of 1965, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce, along with my \ncolleagues Senator Enzi and Senator Cochran, the Higher Education \nTechnical Amendments Act of 2003. This legislation makes several \ntechnical and non-controversial changes to the Higher Education Act, \nHEA, and is designed to expand access to higher education, provide \nrelief from burdensome legal requirements, improve the financial aid \nprocess, and bring greater clarity to the law.\n  My bill provides for the re-enactment of two provisions in the HEA \nthat expired at the end of the last fiscal year, and which are of great \nimportance to students, their families, and schools. These provide \nschools having low student loan default rates with exemptions from the \nrequirement that loan proceeds be disbursed in multiple installments, \nand the requirement that the disbursement of loan proceeds to first-\ntime undergraduate borrowers be delayed for 30 days after classes \nstart. Thousands of institutions of higher education across America \nhave traditionally counted on these exemptions to save them time and \nmoney in the disbursement of their limited financial aid resources. \nThese provisions should also serve as an incentive for schools to keep \ntheir default rates low. At a time when both student and institutional \nbudgets are being squeezed, we should do what we can to provide them \nwith relief.\n  Furthermore, this legislation provides for greater access to federal \nfinancial aid for those students participating in distance education \nprograms. Specifically, it provides a waiver to the rule that a school \nhaving a 50 percent or more of its students or 50 percent or more of \nits courses in distance education is ineligible for the Title IV \nstudent aid programs. Schools eligible for the waiver must already be \nparticipating in the programs and must have low cohort default rates.\n  This bill will also clarify that the HEA provision that limits the \naid eligibility of a student convicted of one or more drug offenses \napplies only to those offenses that occur while the student is in \nschool and receiving aid. Thus, students who may have had drug problems \nin the past but who want to turn their lives around through \npostsecondary education will be able to do so.\n  The bill makes a number of other beneficial changes to the HEA. Most \nnotably, it: Helps protect home-schooled students by making it clear \nthat institutions of higher education will not lose their institutional \neligibility for Federal financial aid by admitting home-schooled \nstudents; clarifies the Federal policy on the return of financial aid \nfunds when students withdraw, to better protect students' grant aid; \nremoves barriers to students seeking forbearance from lenders on \nstudent loan payments, by eliminating the requirement that new \nagreements between lenders and borrowers be in writing; instead, the \nbill allows a lender to accept a request for forbearance over the \ntelephone, as long as a confirmation notice of the agreement reached is \nprovided to the borrower and the borrower's file is updated; makes \nclear that under the Thurgood Marshall Legal Educational Opportunity \nProgram, the U.S. Department of Education can provide scholarship aid \nto low-income and minority students to prepare for and attend law \nschool; eases requirements for Hispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, by \nallowing them to apply for federal HSI grants without waiting two years \nbetween applications; corrects a drafting error in current law that \nmistakenly bars students attending certain nonprofit schools of \nveterinary medicine from eligibility for the Federal Family Education \nLoan Program; requires the GAO to conduct a study on how institutions \nof higher education report teacher pass rates on state certification \nexams; allows financial aid administrators to use ``professional \njudgment'' to adjust a student's financial need in cases where the \nstudent is a ward of the court; and expands the use of technology to \nprovide voter registration material directly to students in a timely \nmanner.\n  The Higher Education Technical Amendments of 2003 will provide \nimportant benefits to our Nation's postsecondary students. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 902. A bill to declare, under the authority of Congress under \nArticle I, section 8, of the Constitution to ``provide and maintain a \nNavy'', a national policy for the naval force structure required in \norder to ``provide for the common defense'' of the United States \nthroughout the 21st century; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, article I, section 8, clauses 12 and 13 \nare the source of Congress' power regarding the Army and the Navy. \nInterestingly, while clause 12 of the Constitution gives Congress the \npower to raise and support armies, clause 13 requires Congress to \nprovide and maintain a navy. Thus, while we have discretionary \nauthority with regard to the establishment of an army, the Constitution \npresumes that we will always have and maintain a navy.\n  Despite this constitutional duty, our current surface fleet is \nsmaller than our fleet in 1917, the year before we entered World War I. \nWhat is worse, the future looks even more bleak. At current build \nrates, we will sink below a 200 ship navy. In fact, we are building \nships at rates unseen since 1932--the height of the great depression.\n  I submit that this policy is unsustainable. The U.S. Navy is not only \na great pillar of American military might, it is an important tool in \nour diplomacy. American ships conduct about 175 international exercises \nevery year. Yet, in recent years we have had to scale back \nparticipation, and in some cases, cancel exercises because the ships \nwere simply not available. These joint exercises improve our ability to \ncoordinate activity with our allies. They allow us to instill American \nnotions of professionalism and service into the navies all around the \nworld, and they give us important intelligence on emerging naval \ncapabilities.\n  Additionally, the Navy serves as a powerful deterrent in situations \nshort of war. How many situations have we used our Navy as a symbol of \nAmerican resolve. The firepower and strength represented by a carrier \nbattle group has been important in the Taiwan Straights, in the Sea of \nJapan and in the Persian Gulf. There is no reason to believe that it \nwill become any less so in future years.\n  The Quadrennial Defense Review puts the requirements for the number \nof ships in the Navy at 360. Naval strategists warn that we are already \nproportioning risk. In other words, we are already deciding what seas \nwe will leave underprotected, so as to ensure that we will have enough \nships to cover flash points.\n  The legislation I am offering today is a simple statement of policy. \nIt states that it is the policy of the United States to return to a \nNavy of at least 375 ships. This should include 15 carrier battle \ngroups and 15 amphibious ready groups. Yet, even this number is a \ndramatic decrease from our high point of a 600 ship navy. However, it \nis an achievable goal, if Congress begins to appropriate resources to \nthe Navy shipbuilding account at reasonable levels.\n  The bill is based on another policy statement we adopted into law in \n1999--the National Missile Defense Act. That law provided guidance to \nour authorization and appropriations process. It also provide guidance \nto the President's budget. It has been successful in ensuring that the \nlast two administrations have budgeted sufficient resources to keep our \nnational missile defense program on track. This statement of policy is \nmore important still. It is not a statement about a future technology, \nit is a statement about a military capability that this country dare \nnot abandon.\n  I trust that the Senate shares my commitment to the future of our \nfleet. While it may come at real expense, I know my colleagues share \nthe view that it is an expense worth making. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that this bill is adopted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nemployers in renewal communities to qualify for the renewal community \nemployment credit by employing residents of certain other renewal \ncommunities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Renewal Community Program has been a \ntremendous success in promoting economic growth in my home State of \nLouisiana. It has boosted local economies and cut unemployment in areas \nthat need it most. The Department of Housing and Urban Development \ndesignated 40 urban and rural areas around the country as renewal \ncommunities, under the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000.\n  Renewal communities can take advantage of wage tax credits, tax \ndeductions, capital gains tax exclusions, and bond financing to \nstimulate job growth, promote economic development, and create \naffordable housing. This assistance goes to areas with poverty rates of \nat least 20 percent, and unemployment rates that are one-and-a-half \ntimes the national level. Households in renewal communities have \nincomes that are 80 percent below the median income of households in \ntheir local jurisdictions.\n  One of the most beneficial business incentives under the program is \nthe wage tax credit an employer can receive for hiring and retaining \nresidents of renewal communities. Businesses can receive up to a $1,500 \nFederal tax credit for every newly hired or existing employee who lives \nand works in the Renewal Community.\n  Louisiana has four renewal communities. One is in New Orleans and the \nremaining three cover a large portion of the Central and Northern parts \nof the State. These three renewal communities have common borders. This \nis a tremendous benefit for Louisiana, but it also creates some \nproblems. Under the rules of the program a business in one renewal \ncommunity cannot receive the wage tax credit if they hire someone who \nlives outside that renewal community, even if that person lives in the \nrenewal community right next door.\n  A good example of what I am talking about is in the northern part of \nthe State. The Ouachita Renewal Community which covers the City of \nMonroe in Ouachita Parish is surrounded by a number of parishes that \nfall into the North Louisiana Renewal Community--Morehouse Parish to \nthe north, Richland Parish to the east, Caldwell Parish to the south, \nand Lincoln Parish to the west. The borders of these two renewal \ncommunities are literally two or three miles apart. Monroe is the \neconomic hub of that part of my State. People from Morehouse, Caldwell, \nand Richland Parishes will naturally look for work there. But under \ncurrent law, a company in Monroe cannot get a wage tax credit for \nhiring someone who lives in the renewal community right next door.\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\n  The situation in Louisiana is fairly unique. I am not certain whether \nCongress really anticipated that one State would receive more than one \nrenewal community designation or that those renewal communities would \nbe so close together. I certainly understand the desire to promote \neconomic development in specific areas. That can work if renewal \ncommunities are far apart. But when they are so close together as they \nare around Ouachita Parish, or a little further south in the middle of \nmy State, where the Central Louisiana Renewal Community borders the \nNorth Louisiana Renewal Community, then we need to make the program \nmore flexible. A person living in Franklin Parish near the border with \nCatahoula Parish does not necessarily know that both parishes lie in \ntwo different renewal communities. If the closest job is in Catahoula \nParish, that is where a Franklin Parish resident is going to go. The \nproblem is that a business in Catahoula Parish would not receive the \ntax break for hiring the worker from Franklin Parish--only a few miles \naway.\n  We need to add some common sense flexibility to the Renewal Community \nprogram. Today I am introducing legislation that will allow the \nemployers in one renewal community to hire employees from an adjacent \nor nearby renewal community and still receive the wage tax credits \ngranted under the Act. This legislation essentially treats renewal \ncommunities that are within five miles of each other as one. This bill \nwill make a small change in the Renewal Community program, but it will \nmake a big difference to the people of my state.\n  This legislation will make a very important program more successful \nfor Louisiana and other states like it. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 905. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na broadband Internet access tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nBroadband Internet Access Act of 2003. Last year, this bill had broad \nbipartisan support with 65 cosponsors. Its companion legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives had 227 cosponsors. If the Senate considers an \nappropriately targeted and sized economic growth package, which \nincludes investment incentives for businesses, this legislation should \nbe a priority for inclusion in that legislation as it will help jump \nstart a struggling sector of the economy.\n  The convergence of computing and communications has fundamentally and \nforever changed the way America lives and works. Individuals, \nbusinesses, schools, libraries, hospitals, and many others, reap the \nbenefits of advanced networked communications exponentially each year. \nHowever, where just a decade ago access to low bandwidth telephone \nfacilities met our communications needs, today many people, businesses \nand other organizations require the ability to transmit and receive \nlarge amounts of data quickly--as part of electronic commerce, distance \nlearning, telemedicine, and even for mere access to many web sites. \nThis need will only continue to grow. In the near future, access to \nbroadband services will be as critical as having a telephone.\n  Over the last several years, companies have built networks that meet \ntoday's broadband need as fast as they can. Even with the recent \ndownturn in the telecommunications industry, technology companies \ncontinue to roll out the current generation of broadband facilities in \nurban and suburban areas. They continue to tear up streets to install \nfiber optics, convert cable TV facilities to broadband telecom \napplications and develop innovative new DSL technologies. As the \neconomy improves, these companies will greatly expand the rate of \ndeployment of these and other technologies for urban and suburban \nconsumers providing them access to the cutting-edge technologies and \nservices.\n  Other areas of this country are not as fortunate. In rural and inner \ncity areas access to even the current generation of broadband \ncommunications is limited. Investment continues to lag behind wealthier \nurban and suburban communities. This imbalance has only been \nexacerbated due to the telecommunications industry's recent financial \ntroubles. In fact, only a limited number of broadband providers exist \noutside the prosperous areas of big cities and suburban areas \nnationwide. A few positive signs are occurring though. Small rural \ntelecommunications companies are slowly expanding into providing these \nservices. They are limited in their ability to provide these services \nbecause of the expense of installing the infrastructure. This is \nbecause in many cases rural areas are more expensive to serve, terrain \nis difficult and populations are widely dispersed. Importantly, many of \nour current broadband technologies cannot serve people who live more \nthan eighteen thousand feet from a phone company's central office--\nwhich is the case for most rural Americans. In inner cities, companies \nmay believe that lower household income levels will not support a \nmarket for their services, so they choose not to invest in these \ncommunities. This is a classic situation of market failure that we must \naddress.\n\n  The implications for the country if we allow this broadband disparity \nto continue are alarming. People and businesses in well served \ncommunications and computing regions, often located in prosperous urban \nand suburban communities, will be able to build upon the inherent \nadvantages of a networked economy. People and businesses in other \nareas, often in rural areas as in inner cities, including many areas in \nmy State of West Virginia, would continue to be at an economic and \neducational disadvantage.\n  We have seen how savvy businesses have crushed their competitors who \nfailed to take advantage of technological innovations, businesses in \ninfrastructure-rich areas that already have an advantage, ultimately \ncould crush competitors in infrastructure-poor areas. This is equally \ntrue for rural and inner city students, workers trying to gain new \nskills, and regular individuals who want to participate in the \ninformation-based New Economy compete against their non-rural peers. \nThe result could be devastating for Americans who live in rural areas \nor in our inner cities: job loss, tax revenue loss, brain drain, and \nbusiness failure concentrated in their communities.\n  Denying Americans who live in rural areas and inner cities a chance \nto participate in our information-based global economy is also bad for \nthe national economy. Businesses will be forced to locate their \noperations and hire their employees in urban locations that have \nadequate broadband infrastructure, rather than in rural or inner city \nlocations that are otherwise more efficient due to the location of \ntheir customers or suppliers, a stable or better workforce, and cheaper \nproduction environments. It is not an understatement to say that the \ndeployment of technology could fundamentally transform the future of \nrural and inner city America.\n\n  We have to make a decision on whether or not rural and inner city \ncommunities are going to have the same opportunities as their wealthier \nurban and suburban counterparts. I, along with many of my colleagues, \nbelieve they should and must. The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2003 \nwould address this disparity.\n  The Act would give companies the incentive to build current \ngeneration broadband facilities in rural areas by using a very targeted \ntax credit. It would offer any company that invests in broadband \nfacilities in rural or inner city areas a tax credit equal to ten \npercent of their investments over the next 5 years. This tax credit \nwill help fight the growing disparity in technology that I just \ndescribed. The credit is also restricted to investments needed for \nhigh-speed broadband telecommunications services. This means that only \npowerful broadband services are covered. Companies cannot claim that \ninferior services qualify for the credit. Only facilities that can \ndownload data at a rate of speed of 1.0 megabytes per second, and \nupload data at 180 kilobytes per second qualify. These speeds will \nallow the broadest possible number of technologies to be eligible for \nthe credit.\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\n  In addition, the bill provides a 20 percent tax credit for companies \nthat invest in next generation broadband services. These powerful new \nservices that can deliver data capacities of 22 megabytes per second \ndownload and 5 megabytes per second upload will be the infrastructure \nthe economy requires as the digital economy expands. We need to reward \nthe companies who have the foresight to invest in these next generation \nbroadband services--they will benefit the whole country. These limited \ncredits will provide the market the ability to affordably and \nprofitably serve rural and inner city communities.\n  The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2003 is part of the solution to \nthe critically important digital divide problem. Rural Americans and \nAmericans living in inner cities must have the chance to participate in \nthe technological revolution that shows no signs of abating. Without \naccess to broadband services they will not have this chance. I hope \nthat the Members of this body will support this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 905\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the certification of programs to \nprovide uninsured employees of small business access to health \ncoverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, today I rise to introduce the Health \nCare Access for Small Businesses Act of 2003.\n  Last month, thousands of Americans participated in a week-long \ndiscussion about covering the uninsured. The sheer breadth of the \ngroups that participated in the unprecedented effort demonstrates the \nurgency of this issue. Labor unions were united with business groups, \ndoctors with nurses, and charity health care providers with for-profit \nhospitals and insurance companies. They all came together to call on \nCongress to find a way to provide health coverage for uninsured \nAmericans.\n  I was glad to see awareness being raised about who the uninsured are \nand what it means to be without health coverage in America. There is a \ngreat misconception that uninsured Americans are largely unemployed or \non Welfare. That is simply not the case. More than 80 percent of \nuninsured Americans are part of working families, and almost half work \nfor small businesses. If we can help small businesses cover their \nemployees, we will have made great progress in covering the uninsured.\n  The bill I am introducing today is aimed at making coverage more \naffordable for employees of small businesses through what is called a \n``three-share'' program. The three-share model is an innovative \ncommunity-based idea that has been working across the U.S. from \nCalifornia to Arkansas to North Carolina; and of course in Michigan.\n  The name three-share stems from the program's payment structure. \nPremiums are shared between the employer who pays 30 percent, the \nemployee who pays 30 percent and the community which covers the \nremaining 40 percent of the cost.\n  In a three share model, a non-profit or local government entity \nserves as the manager of the plan. They design a benefit package by \nnegotiating directly with providers or contracting through an insurance \ncompany. Then, they recruit small businesses that have not offered \ninsurance coverage to their employees for the past year. The average \ncost for coverage is about $1,800 per year, much lower than the \nnational average for commercial insurance, which on average costs \n$3,500 for a single person and $8,500 for a family. Of the $1,800, the \nemployer and employee would each pay approximately $540 and the \ncommunity would pay about $720.\n  Different three share plans have received funds for the community \nportion from various places. In Michigan, most of the money has come \nfrom Medicaid funds. A plan in California uses money from the tobacco \nsettlement while a plan in Arkansas raises funds through church events \nand other community initiatives.\n  Unfortunately, despite the nuances that distinguish three share plans \nfrom one another, they all share a common challenge: they all lack a \nstable and sustainable funding source for the community share.\n  If passed, my bill would help alleviate that problem by offering a \nrefundable tax credit to small businesses who participate in three \nshare plans. Businesses would pay their own share plus the community \nshare up front and receive the community share back through a \nrefundable tax credit.\n  My bill would also encourage the development of more three share \nplans by providing seed money through the Community Access Program at \nthe Health Resources Services Administration.\n  This bill would maintain the current employer-based system and \nleverage every $1 of public money with $2 of private funds. It would \nnot impose any new funding mandates on state or local governments nor \nwould it create new bureaucracy. It is an innovative community-based \napproach that could work throughout the country if funding is \navailable.\n  Insuring more working families will also take the pressure off state \nMedicaid budgets. Adequate care for those presently uninsured will also \nhelp slash the billions we wind up spending on uncompensated care.\n  Finally, I believe providing health care for these families fulfills \na moral commitment. No one in America who gets up in the morning and \ngoes to work should go to sleep at night fearful that an illness or \ninjury in the family could wipe out everything they have worked for.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a fact sheet be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objeciton, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 906\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Access for Small \n     Businesses Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) For most of the past 16 years, the number of Americans \n     without health insurance has been on the rise, reaching more \n     than 41,000,000 in 2002.\n       (2) People without health insurance are less likely to get \n     preventive care and often delay or forgo needed care. They \n     are therefore more likely than those with health insurance to \n     be hospitalized for conditions that could have been avoided.\n       (3) Not only are the health and financial circumstances of \n     uninsured Americans adversely affected by the lack of health \n     insurance, their care is ultimately being paid for in the \n     least efficient manner: after they get sick.\n       (4) People who were uninsured during any part of 2001 \n     received $99,000,000,000 in care, of which $34,500,000,000 \n     was not paid for either out of pocket or by a private or \n     public insurance source. Federal, State, and local \n     governments covered 85 percent of such uncompensated care, \n     amounting to $30,000,000,000.\n       (5) Private health insurance enrollees also help pay for \n     uncompensated care through higher premiums.\n       (6) Covering more Americans will not only contribute to \n     better overall health, it will lower the amount of health \n     care costs assumed by taxpayers, businesses, and consumers.\n       (7) Helping small businesses gain access to affordable \n     health care benefits is essential to insuring more Americans.\n       (8) Eighty-two percent of uninsured people are part of \n     working families.\n       (9) More than \\1/2\\ of small businesses with less than 50 \n     employees do not offer their employees health insurance.\n       (10) Innovative community-based solutions have developed \n     and should serve as a model for insuring more Americans.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Dozens \n     of communities around the country, using seed money from a \n     federal grant program called the Community Access Program \n     (CAP), have developed and implemented a unique way to make \n     health coverage affordable to small businesses through \n     ``three-share'' programs.\n\n\n                          three-share programs\n\n       A three-share program is a community-based health plan that \n     is paid for jointly by the employer, employee and the \n     community.\n       Under a typical three-share model, a community-based \n     entity, either a non-profit or local government does the \n     following:\n       1. Works with local health care providers or an insurance \n     entity to develop a benefit package;\n       2. Signs up small businesses in the community that do not \n     offer health insurance to their employees; and\n       3. Takes responsibility for administering the program.\n       An enrolled small business and their employees each pay 30 \n     percent of the monthly premium while the community pays the \n     remaining 40 percent.\n       thousands of Americans who previously went without health \n     insurance are now covered through three-share programs. \n     Unfortunately, entities managing these programs are \n     struggling to secure a steady revenue source for the \n     community share of the costs.\n\n\n      The Health Insurance Access for Small Businesses Act of 2003\n\n       The Health Insurance Access for Small Businesses Act of \n     2003 encourages the development of more three-share programs \n     by increasing seed money for non-profits or local governments \n     interested in creating a program in their community. The bill \n     provides sustainable funding for the community share if the \n     costs through a refundable tax credit for small businesses.\n       Expand seed funding for three-share through Community \n     Access Program (CAP)--CAP is a grant program designed to help \n     communities expand coverage to the uninsured that has helped \n     many non-profits and local governments start three-share \n     programs. Funding is authorized to increase by $50 million \n     for FY04.\n       Refundable tax credit for the community portion--This bill \n     will establish a steady revenue stream for the third share \n     through a refundable tax credit to the employer. The employee \n     would pay 30 percent of the premium through payroll \n     deductions.

The \n     40 percent would be returned to the business through a \n     refundable tax credit.\n\n\n                               Specifics\n\n       Target group: Small businesses not currently offering \n     health coverage to employees or distressed small businesses, \n     as defined by the Small Business Act, that are in jeopardy of \n     dropping health coverage because of rising premiums and \n     economic hardship.\n       Employer Eligibility:\n       Located within a community defined by the administering \n     entity\n       Has not offered or contributed to health care benefits of \n     employees for previous 12 consecutive months\n       Qualifies as a ``distressed business'' under HRSA \n     regulations.\n       Employee Eligibility:\n       Works full time (a minimum of 35 hours);\n       Lacks access to health coverage through employer;\n       Lacks access to health coverage through a family member or \n     common law partner;\n       Is not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare;\n       Agrees to payroll deductions.\n       Family Eligibility:\n       Spouse of participating employee not covered through their \n     employer or any public insurance program;\n       Dependent of participating employee under the age of 23 not \n     eligible for SCHIP.\n       Shared Premiums: Average benefit is estimated to be $540 \n     per year for an employee, $540 for employer and $720 will be \n     refunded through the tax credit to the employer.\n       Employer pays 30 percent of annual cost;\n       Employee pays 30 percent of annual cost;\n       Refundable tax credit to employer for 40 percent of the \n     total annual cost.\n       Minimum Benefits: All benefit packages must include the \n     following:\n       Physicians services;\n       In-patient hospital services;\n       Out-patient services;\n       Emergency room visits;\n       Emergency ambulance services;\n       Diagnostic lab and x-rays;\n       Prescription drug benefits.\n       Note.--People may not be excluded because of pre-existing \n     conditions.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \nflat tax only on individual taxable earned income and business taxable \nincome, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I rise to speak about the subject of \ntaxation from a little different perspective, a legislative proposal \nwhich, if adopted, would add very considerably to productivity in \nAmerica, and that is a proposal for a flat tax. In the fall of 1994, \nRichard Armey of the House of Representatives introduced a flat tax. I \nstudied it, then in the spring of 1995, I introduced a flat tax for the \nSenate. That was the first one introduced. I have introduced it in \nsuccessive years.\n  I usually pick April 15, because April 15 is tax filing day. But this \nyear we are going to be in recess for the spring break. I had thought \ntoday would be the last day we would be in session. That is open to \ndebate at this point. I just came from a conference of the \nAppropriations Committee, and there are a great many unresolved issues. \nI posed the question to my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee: \nWhat time do we vote on Sunday?\n  Some of my colleagues may be listening on C-SPAN2, and that will give \nthem a jolt: What time do we vote on Sunday? Or we might not vote as \nearly as Sunday. We might pick a time on Monday.\n  I got the attention of the clerks, too, by talking about something \nimportant: When are we going to finish the business of the Senate? The \ndistinguished Parliamentarian is nodding his head in chagrin as to what \nis happening here.\n  Some suggestions have been floated around the Appropriations \nCommittee of a way to solve this impasse between the House and the \nSenate on appropriations, the impasse between the House and the Senate \non the budget, and that is a constitutional amendment for a unicameral \nlegislature. That would be a shocker. For anybody watching C-SPAN2, \nthat means one chamber. Then the question would come up: Which chamber \nwill it be?\n  Nobody is going to go to a unicameral legislature, and I do not know \nwhen we are going to conclude the business of the Senate. I may be \noffering this flat tax legislation on the wrong day. Perhaps I ought to \nwait, because we may still be here on April 15, which would be next \nTuesday.\n  In all seriousness, we have the most extraordinarily complex system \nfor filing taxes ever devised. In the midst of an overwhelming \nbureaucracy and a regulatory system in Washington, DC, nothing compares \nto the Federal tax code.\n  The Federal tax code has grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 6.9 \nmillion words and 17,000 pages at the present time. A study showed that \nmore than 13 hours are consumed by the average American--rather, more \nthan 13 hours are consumed on average--there is no such thing as an \naverage American--on average by taxpayers in filling out the principal \nForm 1040. And if one goes to the various schedules, it can be another \n5\\1/2\\ hours or 7\\1/2\\ hours.\n  I just finished filling out my tax return, and it is inordinately \ncomplicated. It is insufficient to be a Philadelphia lawyer to \nunderstand the Federal tax code, and then the State taxes, and then \ncity taxes, the wage tax, the property tax, and the real estate tax. It \nis a nightmare.\n  It is possible to change all of that by going to a flat tax, and then \nthe tax return would be on a postcard. The wonders of television. \nPeople can see the postcard. It will take about 15 minutes to fill out \na postcard, which would identify the individual, specify the total \ncompensation, specify the allowance, the number of dependents, and in \nthe course of 15 minutes it would be finished.\n  This tax would be calculated on a flat rate of 20 percent. It would \nbe very beneficial to people at all levels of the income strata except \nfor those who engage in tax shelters. The average American today, or in \nthe middle income, a family of four, which does not itemize deductions, \npays taxes on all income over $19,850. Under this flat tax, there would \nbe a personal exemption of $27,500 for a family of four, and taxes \nwould be paid only over that amount.\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\n  After having just criticized charts, my staff has brought me a chart \nwhich they prepared. I certainly would not want to omit the showing of \nthis chart. The writing is too small for reading on C-SPAN2, but it \nspecifies the identity of the person, the total compensation, the \npersonal allowance, and it can be filled out in the course of 15 \nminutes.\n  A superior depiction, in my opinion, is the postcard. People can deal \nmore easily with postcards than they can with charts.\n  I have provided for two deductions which I am maintaining, deductions \non interest and charitable contributions. It may be that ultimately we \nwill have a totally flat tax, which would reduce another percent down \nto 19 percent. I have included interest on home mortgages because it is \nso prevalent, and I believe Americans might be very surprised not to be \nable to deduct their interest on home mortgages. That interest on home \nmortgages has been a great stimulus for housing construction and also a \ngreat encouragement for people to own their own homes. That is very \nimportant as a societal matter.\n  I have also retained the deduction on charitable contributions, which \nremains very important. That was reinforced by the Senate earlier this \nweek by providing an increase in charitable contributions deductibility \nlooking toward faith-based initiatives.\n  What I would like to do most emphatically would be to get the debate \nstarted. This body, the House, and the Treasury Department have never \nseriously considered a flat tax. It ought to be seriously considered. \nWhether it would be accepted or not would be the outcome of the debate. \nThe flat tax proposal which I am bringing to you today, which is \nmodeled after the outline by Professor Hall and Professor Rabushka of \nStanford University, has been very carefully thought through. It is a \nneutral tax scheme. An analysis of people at various income levels \nshows that it is universally beneficial for all except those who engage \nin tax shelters and pay no tax at all.\n  The greatest benefit would be the savings to the American people of \nsome 5.8 billion hours a year and some $194 billion in preparation \nexpenses. I have actually seen estimates on the cost of tax compliance \nas high as $800 billion. Again, these estimates are such that nobody \nreally knows, but as lawyers say in litigation, the pain and suffering \nthat goes with filing these returns, or the cruel and unusual \npunishment involved in making these computations and the study \ninvolved, it would be a great relief to the American people. It would \nbe win, win, win. There would be great savings in time. There would be \nsavings in individual taxes, and there would be a tremendous stimulus \nto the economy so that so many corporations and businesses would no \nlonger have to have a special office, which is the practice in many \nplaces, for the tax collector who comes in to conduct the audit on a \nyearly basis.\n  To reiterate, in less than one week, American taxpayers face another \nFederal income tax deadline. The date of April 15 stabs fear, anxiety, \nand unease into the hearts of millions of Americans. Every year during \n``tax season,'' millions of Americans spend their evenings poring over \npage after page of IRS instructions, going through their records \nlooking for information, and struggling to find and fill out all the \nappropriate forms on their Federal tax returns. Americans are \nintimidated by the sheer number of different tax forms and their \ninstructions, many of which they may be unsure whether they need to \nfile. Given the approximately 325 possible forms, not to mention the \ninstructions that accompany, simply trying to determine which form to \nfile can in itself be a daunting and overwhelming task. According to \nthe Tax Foundation, American taxpayers, including businesses, spend \nmore than 5.8 billion hours and $194 billion each year in complying \nwith tax laws. That works out to more than $2,400 per U.S. household. \nMuch of this time is spent burrowing through IRS laws and regulations \nwhich fill 17,000 pages and have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to \nover 6.9 million words in 2000. By contrast, the Pledge of Allegiance \nhas only 31 words, the Gettysburg Address has 267 words, the \nDeclaration of Independence has about 1,300 words, and the Bible has \nonly about 1,773,000 words.\n  The majority of taxpayers still face filing tax forms that are far \ntoo complicated and take far too long to complete. According to the \nestimated preparation time listed on the forms by the IRS, the 2002 \nForm 1040 is estimated to take 13 hours and 10 minutes to complete. \nMoreover this does not include the estimated time to complete the \naccompanying schedules, such as Schedule A, for itemized deductions, \nwhich carries an estimated preparation time of 5 hours, 37 minutes, or \nSchedule D, for reporting capital gains and losses, shows an estimated \npreparation time of 7 hours, 35 minutes. Moreover, this complexity is \ngetting worse each year. Just from 1998 to 2002 the estimated time to \nprepare Form 1040 jumped 96 minutes.\n  It is no wonder that well over half of all taxpayers, 56 percent \naccording to a recent survey now hire an outside professional to \nprepare their tax returns for them. However, the fact that only 29 \npercent of individuals itemize their deductions shows that a \nsignificant percentage of our taxpaying population believes that the \ntax system is too complex for them to deal with. We all understand that \npaying taxes will never be something we enjoy, but neither should it be \ncruel and unusual punishment. Further, the pace of change to the \nInternal Revenue Code is brisk--Congress made about 9,500 Tax Code \nchanges in the past 12 years. And we are far from being finished. Year \nafter year, we continue to ask the same question--is there not a better \nway?\n  My flat tax legislation would make filing a tax return a manageable \nchore, not a seemingly endless nightmare, for most taxpayers. My flat \ntax legislation will fundamentally revise the present Tax Code, with \nits myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. This legislation would \ninstitute a simple, flat 20 percent tax rate for all individuals and \nbusinesses. This proposal is not cast in stone but is intended to move \nthe debate forward by focusing attention on three key principles which \nare critical to an effective and equitable taxation system: simplicity, \nfairness, and economic growth.\n  My flat tax plan would eliminate the kinds of frustrations I have \noutlined above for millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us \nto scrap the great majority of the IRS rules, regulations, and \ninstructions and delete most of the 6.9 million words in the Internal \nRevenue Code. Instead of billions of hours of non-productive time spent \nin compliance with, or avoidance of, the tax code, taxpayers would \nspend only the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-\nsized form. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find \nvaluable hours freed up to engage in productive business activity or \nfor more time with their families instead of poring over tax tables, \nschedules, and regulations.\n  My flat tax proposal is dramatic, but so are its advantages: a \ntaxation system that is simple, fair and designed to maximize \nprosperity for all Americans. A summary of the key advantages are:\n  A 10-line postcard filing would replace the myriad forms and \nattachments currently required, thus saving Americans up to 5.8 billion \nhours they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  The flat tax would eliminate the lion's share of IRS rules, \nregulations and requirements, which have grown from 744,000 words in \n1955 to 6.9 million words and 17,000 pages currently. It would also \nallow us to slash the mammoth IRS bureaucracy of 117,000 employees.\n  Economists estimate a growth of over $2 trillion in national wealth \nover 7 years, representing an increase of approximately $7,500 in \npersonal wealth for every man, woman, and child in America. This growth \nwould also lead to the creation of 6 million new jobs.\n  Investment decisions would be made on the basis of productivity \nrather than simply for tax avoidance, thus leading to even greater \neconomic expansion.\n  Economic forecasts indicate that interest rates would fall \nsubstantially, by as much as two points, as the flat tax removes many \nof the current disincentives to savings.\n  Americans would be able to save up to $194 billion they currently \nspend every year in tax compliance.\n  As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is simplified, there \nwill be far less opportunity for tax avoidance and fraud, which now \namounts to over $120 billion in uncollected revenue annually.\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\n  Simplification of the tax code will allow us to save significantly on \nthe $7 billion annual budget currently allocated to the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  The most dramatic way to show what the flat tax is to consider that \nthe income tax form for the flat tax is printed on a postcard--it will \nallow all taxpayers to file their April 15 tax returns on a simple 10-\nline postcard. This postcard will take 15 minutes to fill out.\n  At my town hall meetings across Pennsylvania, the public support for \nfundamental tax reform is overwhelming. I would point out that in those \nspeeches that I never leave home without two key documents: 1, my copy \nof the Constitution; and, 2, a copy of my 10-line flat tax postcard. I \nsoon realized that I needed more than just one copy of my flat tax \npostcard. Many people wanted their own postcard so that they could see \nwhat life in a flat tax world would be like, where tax returns only \ntake 15 minutes to fill out and individual taxpayers are no longer \nburdened with double taxation on their dividends, interest, capital \ngains and estates.\n  This is a win-win situation for America because it lowers the tax \nburden on the taxpayers in the lower brackets. For example in the 2002 \ntax year, the standard deduction is $4,700 for a single taxpayer, \n$6,900 for a head of household and $7,850 for a married couple filing \njointly, while the personal exemption for individuals and dependents is \n$3,000. Thus, under the current tax code, a family of four which does \nnot itemize deductions would pay taxes on all income over $19,850--\nthese are personal exemptions of $12,000 and a standard deduction of \n$7,850. By contrast, under my flat tax bill, that same family would \nreceive a personal exemption of $27,500, and would pay tax on only \nincome over that amount.\n  The tax loopholes enable write-offs to save some $393 billion a year. \nWhat is eliminated under the flat tax are the loopholes, the deductions \nin this complicated code which can be deciphered, interpreted, and \nfound really only by the $500-an-hour lawyers. That money is lost to \nthe taxpayers. $120 billion would be saved by the elimination of fraud \nbecause of the simplicity of the tax code, the taxpayer being able to \nfind out exactly what he or she owes.\n  This bill is modeled after legislation organized and written by two \nvery distinguished professors of law at Stanford University, Professor \nHall and Professor Rabushka. Their model was first introduced in the \nCongress in the fall of 1994 by Majority Leader Richard Armey. I \nintroduced the flat tax bill--the first one in the Senate--on March 2, \n1995, S. 488. On October 27, 1995, I introduced a Sense of the Senate, \nresolution calling on my colleagues to expedite Congressional adoption \nof a flat tax. The Resolution, which was introduced as an amendment to \npending legislation, was not adopted. I reintroduced this legislation \nin the 105th Congress with slight modifications to reflect inflation-\nadjusted increases in the personal allowances and dependent allowances. \nI re-introduced the bill two Congresses ago on April 15, 1999--income \ntax day--in a bill denominated as S. 822. More recently, I introduced \nmy flat tax legislation as an amendment to S. 1429, the Tax \nReconciliation bill. The amendment was not adopted.\n\n  Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat \ntax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing \nour Nation's Tax Code and the policies which underlie it. I began the \nstudy of the complexities of the Tax Code over 40 years ago as a law \nstudent at Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my \npractice in my early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the \nspring of 1962, I published a law review article in the Villanova Law \nReview, ``Pension and Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operations for \nClosely Held Corporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova \nL. Rev. 335, which in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt \nretirement benefits available to some kinds of businesses but not \nothers. It was apparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities \nof the Internal Revenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to \nsome. Einstein himself is quoted as saying ``the hardest thing in the \nworld to understand is the income tax.''\n  The Hall-Rabushka model envisioned a flat tax with no deductions \nwhatever. After considerable reflection, I decided to include in the \nlegislation limited deductions for home mortgage interest for up to \n$100,000 in borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500. While \nthese modifications undercut the pure principle of the flat tax by \ncontinuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying and charitable \ncontributions, I believe that those two deductions are so deeply \ningrained in the financial planning of American families that they \nshould be retained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and also \npolitical practicality. With only those two deductions maintained, \npassage of a modified flat tax will be difficult, but without them, \nprobably impossible.\n  In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a \nmodified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that \nthe revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19-\npercent rate, is based on a well-documented model founded on reliable \ngovernmental statistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19 \npercent to 20 percent to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage \ninterest and charitable deductions.\n  This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their source so that \nthere is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, capital gains, \ngifts or estates. Restructured in this way, the Tax Code can become a \npowerful incentive for savings and investment--which translates into \neconomic growth and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the \nstandard of living for all Americans.\n  The key advantages of this flat tax plan are threefold: First, it \nwill dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove \nmuch of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and \ncorporate taxpayers and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their \nenergies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which \nrewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth \nin all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and \nsavings accounts.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within 7 years of \nenactment, this type of a flat tax would produce a 6-percent increase \nin output from increased total work in the U.S. economy and increased \ncapital formation. The economic growth would mean a $7,500 increase in \nthe personal income of all Americans. No one likes to pay taxes. But \nAmericans will be much more willing to pay their taxes under a system \nthat they believe is fair, a system that they can understand, and a \nsystem that they recognize promotes rather than prevents growth and \nprosperity. My flat tax legislation will afford Americans such a tax \nsystem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill, be printed in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the United States Consensus Council to \nprovide for a consensus building process in addressing national public \npolicy issues, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nwould create a United States Consensus Council. Designed to facilitate \na consensus building process on important national issues, the U.S. \nConsensus Council is modeled upon similar entities that have operated \nsuccessfully in several States. The council would be a nonprofit, \nprivate entity that would serve both the legislative and executive \nbranches of government. Its role would be to build agreements among \nstakeholders on public policy issues where there are diverse and \nconflicting views and bring these agreements back to Congress or other \ndecision-makers for action.\n  A good example of such a consensus council is the Montana Consensus \nCouncil. Established in 1994, this council has helped to facilities \nagreements on a range of contentious public issues. The Council, for \nexample, facilitated development of a plan for the cleanup of hazardous \nwaste sites that was overwhelmingly approved by the State legislature. \nIt also helped mediate a dispute between recreationists and ranchers \nover water rights and, with the input of key stakeholders, an agreement \nwas successfully reached.\n  The North Dakota Consensus Council, created in 1990, has helped build \nagreements on numerous local and State issues, including facilitating a \nfive year effort to develop a strategic plan for the future of North \nDakota and an economic development strategy to implement that plan.\n  The U.S. Consensus Council Act was introduced in the last Congress by \nSenator Dorgan and cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators. The \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs favorably reported the bill last \nfall, but the full Senate did not have an opportunity to act on it \nbefore adjournment. I am pleased that Senator Dorgan, along with \nSenators Santorum and Conrad, have joined me in reintroducing the \nlegislation today.\n  The legislation would establish the U.S. Consensus Council as an \nindependent nonprofit corporation under the District of Columbia \nNonprofit Corporation Act. The Council would not be an agency or \ninstrumentality of the United States. The Council's role would be to \ndesign and conduct processes that bring together key stakeholders and \nbuild agreements on complex public policy issues. The resulting \nrecommendations would be advisory, subject to the normal legislative or \nregulatory processes.\n  The Council's powers would be vested in a 12-member part-time Board \nof Directors. Each of the leaders of the majority and minority in the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate would appoint two board \nmembers, and the President would appoint four members. Members of the \nBoard cannot be Federal officers or employees.\n  A President, selected by the Board, would be the chief executive \nofficer of the Council.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Collins, in introducing legislation that would create the \nUnited States Consensus Council. This council would be a nonprofit, \nquasi-governmental entity. Its role would be to build agreements among \nstakeholders on legislative issues where there are diverse and \nconflicting views and bring these agreements back to Congress or other \ndecisionmakers for action.\n  We all talk about the benefit of working across party lines to \ndevelop consensus on a variety of policy issues. This bill would help \nto institutionalize this goal and provide ongoing support to Congress \nby bringing stakeholders to the table to resolve a wide range of \ndifficult national issues.\n  The North Dakota Consensus Council in my home State serves as a model \nfor this national proposal. In North Dakota, the Consensus Council has \nhelped to find common ground on the use of grasslands in the western \npart of the State, the structure of judgeships across the State, and \nflood mitigation efforts in the Red River Valley. By bringing together \nall of the interested parties, the North Dakota Consensus Council was \nable to find solutions to problems that had previously seemed \ninsurmountable. Washington, DC, is ripe with opportunity for the same \nkind of consensus building and mediation. We can not only build on the \nexperience of consensus building in North Dakota, but similar successes \nin Montana, Florida, Oregon, and many other States.\n  The United States Consensus Council would bring people together and \nthen\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\nhelp to develop recommendations. These recommendations would be \nadvisory and would not circumvent any of the normal legislative \nrequirements or processes. The board of directors would be appointed by \nthe President and the bipartisan congressional leadership. The council \nwould remain neutral on substantive policy matters.\n  The council would focus on issues that are contentious or deadlocked, \nor they could be emerging issues where mediation could help to prevent \nlater polarization.\n  The council's role will be to design and conduct processes that lead \nto common ground on effective public policy for a particular issue. The \ncouncil could be called upon to convene key stakeholders in face-to-\nface meetings over time to build agreements on complex issues.\n  I have long been a supporter of building consensus and finding ways \nto reach compromise. I believe that this legislation could help the \nCongress and the administration to find that middle ground. There are \nso many important issues that get deadlocked in Washington, and this \napproach will help to break that logjam. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move this bill through the \nprocess.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 909. A bill to provide State and local governments with \nflexibility in using funds made available for homeland security \nactivities; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will provide State and local governments the flexibility they need \nfor preparedness activities associated with the planning, procurement \nand training for homeland security and counter terrorism activities.\n  Quite simply, this legislation would permit State and local \ngovernments to use up to twenty percent of any funds provided for the \nprocurement of new equipment to train first responders in the use of \nthat equipment and secondly, allow State level Emergency Management \npersonnel to conduct activities such as FEMA related strategic planning \non behalf of smaller communities that may not otherwise have the \nresources to adequately perform that planning.\n  I became acutely aware of this need when I visited the Maine \nEmergency Management Agency and learned that, although they had been \nprovided the funds to purchase new chemical and biological protection \nequipment, they had not received any funds to train personnel to use \nthat equipment.\n  As we are all aware, homeland security needs at the State level vary \nwidely. From State to State, there are varying degrees of risk, varying \npercentages of full-time versus volunteer responders, and different \nareas of strengths and weaknesses in the responder community. Any \nsuccessful Federal program that seeks to improve response capability \nmust therefore have flexible rules for implementation.\n  For example, in fiscal years 2000 through 2002, FEMA funded states \nfor terrorism preparedness activities. The State of Maine received \n$246,000 annually for these activities and the funds were administered \nthrough the Emergency Management Performance Grant. Those funds were \nbased on a strategic plan submitted by each State that outlined its \nmost urgent needs, and the steps to be taken to meet those needs. If \nplanning was the need, the State could put an emphasis on planning. If \ntraining or exercise was the need, they could stress that.\n  While there was no set quota for how much money had to go to local \ncommunities, States were required to track performance measures that \nshowed how local communities were benefitting because in rural States \nsuch as Maine, it is often more efficient and cost-effective for States \nto sponsor programs for the benefit of local officials, rather than \nproviding funds to communities that may not have the organizational \ninfrastructure to plan and execute programs.\n  States were given wide authority to reimburse communities for time \nand equipment costs, purchase training materials, and contract for \nservices--whatever was necessary to accomplish the ultimate goal of \nimproved preparedness for responders. These dollars could also support \nbasic emergency management activities, such as incident command \ntraining, emergency planning or exercise design, which supported the \ncommunities' overall all-hazard preparedness as well as their \ncapability to react to a terrorist incident.\n  By contrast, let's go back and look at FEMA's FY2002 Supplemental \nBudget and the Office of Domestic Preparedness' funding for emergency \nresponse equipment for it was during this cycle that the previous \nflexibility began to be restricted. First, while the FEMA FY2002 \nSupplemental Budget supported emergency operations planning, Citizen \nCorps, Community Emergency Response Teams, CERT, and emergency \noperations center assessment and improvement, 75 percent of the funding \nfor planning and for Citizen Corps and CERT efforts was required to be \npassed through to local communities, even if the capacity to administer \nthose funds was generally lacking and the communities would have been \nbetter served by programs brought to them by the state.\n  In addition, planning dollars could not be spent on exercises to test \nplans, or training to support those plans. Funds for Citizen Corps and \nCERT programs, which are voluntary efforts, could not be used for any \nother preparedness purpose, even if no communities came forward \ndesiring to participate in those programs. It is likely that Maine will \nreturn a portion of these funds because the local need for them does \nnot exist. Furthermore, emergency operations center assessment funds \ncould only be spent on assessment, even if a current assessment of \nfacilities was in place.\n  The Office of Domestic Preparedness' funding for the procurement of \nequipment has been equally restrictive. The lion's share is of course \nfor equipment, and only equipment that provides protection, detection, \ndecontamination and communications could be procured.\n  Beyond the fact that it took two rounds of funding to build a \ncritical mass of resources such that equipment purchases could begin in \nearnest, much of this equipment is highly technical in nature, and \nrequires extensive training to operate safely and properly. However, of \nthe funds provided for that equipment, none could be used for training. \nWhile there were some exercise funds, they were specifically targeted \nto weapons of mass destruction. With the FY2003 allocation, some \nfunding has been allocated for training, which is a positive step but, \nagain, it comes with very strict limits and dollars allocated for \nexercise cannot be used for training, or vice versa.\n  In the emergency management world, planning comes first, then \ntraining, then exercise.\n  If you need a plan, you can't substitute an exercise and get the same \nresult. If you need an exercise, you can't substitute training. Even \nwithin the training and exercise grants, there are restrictions that \nmake it extremely difficult for full-time departments, for example, to \nfree up employee time to take needed training or participate in \nexercises. And with the focus on homeland security, the need for \nflexibility to improve basic response capability has also been \noverlooked. In communities that do not have the resources to create \nspecial response forces for every hazard--and that includes all towns \nin Maine--it is imperative to be able to build a base of planning and \ntraining for all hazards, on which one can build the capability to \nrespond to a terrorist incident.\n  Our strategy in Maine has been to build a regional response \ncapability. In some areas we could build that capability around \nexisting response capacity, and in others we have had to build \ncapability from the ground up.\n  For example, the Portland and South Portland fire departments have \nformed a regional response team and are undertaking training required \nto stand up a fully qualified hazardous materials response team. This \nentails 80 hours of training for each individual. But, I'm told the \nCity of Portland is in the process of cutting 20 fire positions and \nsome police officers because of budget constraints at the local level, \nas they are facing additional security requirements around the city. \nThis makes it very difficult to free up responders for the required \ntraining, especially as there are no budget dollars for overtime, and \nno Federal grant currently\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\navailable will reimburse training costs to include overtime.\n  In other parts of the State, private paper companies have stepped up \nand volunteered their already-trained hazardous materials teams to \nrespond off site. During the anthrax scare in the fall of 2001, these \nteams responded to any and all ``suspicious package'' calls, at a cost \nof $2,000 per hour to field a team of 22 people.\n  These companies have responded out of patriotism and a sense of civic \nresponsibility, and despite challenging economic times in the paper \nindustry. These teams are now faced with maintaining the full ``level \nA'' capability and further facing more than 20 hours of additional \ntraining to be fully WMD compliant. No grant monies currently available \nallow reimbursement for their response or for their training time.\n  In Maine, we have by necessity been flexible in our approach to each \nregion, looking at the different needs in planning, training, exercise \nand equipment procurement. However, it is becoming increasingly \ndifficult to practice flexibility when the Federal programs that \nprovide the resources to build capability are becoming more and more \nrigid.\n  The events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent anthrax attacks \nhave brought our Nation to heightened level of awareness. Nowhere is \nthis more evident than in Maine's hospitals, upon which we rely to \nrespond quickly and effectively in the event of any disaster affecting \nour residents' health.\n  While hospitals have always had disaster plans in place, recent \nevents have dramatically changed the definition of ``disaster''. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, hospitals have stepped up their readiness efforts \nto be better prepared in responding not only to conventional disasters, \nbut also to the more concrete threat of previously unimaginable \nterrorist attacks using chemical, biological or radiologic agents that \ncould lead to large-scale emergencies with mass casualties.\n  Hospitals have to change their mind-set on established norms and \nstandard ways of operating to embrace a broader spectrum of roles and \nresponsibilities. The relationship between traditional first responders \nand the non-traditional role of hospitals in community-wide first \nresponse overall is moving closer, emphasizing the need for \ncollaboration and compatibility.\n  No one doubts that in the event of a weapons of mass destruction \nevent, hospitals are likely to see large numbers of potentially \ncontaminated patients seeking treatment. The reality is that hospital \nemergency department staff and hospital providers in general are truly \nthe new ``first responders.'' Hospitals are critical elements of the \ncommunity response system and if they are not prepared and protected, \nthere will be serious gaps in the system that could cause it to break \ndown completely.\n  One of the largest barriers to optimal emergency preparedness is \nstaff education and training. To date, hospitals have had to absorb all \nthese costs, as the limited funding assistance available to hospitals \nhas not been permitted to be spent on education and training. The full \ncosts of providing training is daunting, particularly in these lean \neconomic times of declining reimbursement to hospitals.\n  The costs of the courses and/or instructors' fees pale in comparison \nto the staff time that must be paid to attend any given course. Staff \ntime must essentially be paid twice--first to pay the staff person's \non-duty time to attend the course or drill, and once again to pay \nanother staff person's time to replace the worker being trained. The \ncost of staff time is significant, and even finding staff to replace \nthe one attending training is especially costly due to the nursing \nshortage in hospitals. Consider the following facts: The vacancy rate \nfor hospital staff nurses in Maine has been 8-9 percent. The average \nhourly rate for registered nurses in Maine is $21.67, and rising. Any \nstaff training must be done on a large scale so that trained staff are \navailable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  As just one example of training needed, Maine recognizes that \nhospitals need to be prepared to manage contaminated patients who come \nto their facility. The Maine Emergency Management Agency is working to \nprovide hospitals with the necessary equipment, but the training \nnecessary to competently use that equipment is extensive and currently \nunderfunded.\n  According to Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration \nregulations, staff must be trained to the hazardous material \n``operations'' level in order to safely use the equipment. Meeting \nFederal Government standards for that level of training requires at \nleast two full days of initial training, with refresher courses \nrequired annually. Conservatively speaking, if 35 Maine hospitals train \n25 nurses to that level, the approximate cost of nursing staff time \nalone for the initial course would be $606,760. And remember, because \nsix to eight staff members are required to man the decontamination \nline, the nursing costs are just the beginning.\n  The same staffing costs apply to sending staff to local and regional \nemergency drills and training sessions--which are absolutely critical \ncomponents of Maine's disaster readiness. It is simply not possible for \nhospitals to absorb all of these costs, given the declining \nreimbursements. Hospital operating margins in Maine declined from an \naverage of 2.3 percent in 2001 to 1.7 percent in 2002 and about one \nthird of all Maine hospitals experienced zero or negative operating \nmargins in 2002.\n  Yet, our hospitals continue their efforts to provide the best \npossible patient care while simultaneously increasing their level of \nemergency preparedness. Federal assistance with training funding would \nprovide excellent support for hospitals, as they work to respond to any \ncrisis and protect their staff so they can perform the critical \nfunctions of caring for the citizens of Maine in any crisis.\n  These are but a few examples of the burdens being experienced by \nState, local and private industry responders as they struggle to \nprepare themselves and the citizenry to prevent and respond to \nterrorist attacks and other crises. This legislation will provide some \nof the flexibility emergency management personnel require to be truly \nprepared. I urge my colleagues to support this much needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 910. A bill to ensure the continuation of non-homeland security \nfunctions of Federal agencies transferred to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \npreserve important non-homeland security missions in the Department of \nHomeland Security. I am pleased to be joined by the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Carper, and the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, in this effort to guarantee the fulfillment of non-homeland \nsecurity functions Americans rely on daily.\n  Many of these non-homeland security functions are especially \nimportant to the State of Hawaii. The Coast Guard provides essential \nsearch and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and protection of our \ncoastline. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service protects the \nState's fragile ecosystem from invasive species. The Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency assists municipalities in reducing the destructive \neffects of natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and tidal \nwaves.\n  To preserve these vital functions, the ``Non-Homeland Security \nMission Performance Act of 2003'' would require the Department of \nHomeland Security to identify and report to Congress on the resources, \npersonnel, and capabilities used to perform non-homeland security \nfunctions, as well as the management strategy needed to carry out these \nmissions.\n  The measure would require the Department to include information on \nthe performance of these functions in its annual performance report. \nOur legislation also calls for a General Accounting Office, GAO, \nevaluation of the performance of essential non-homeland security \nmissions.\n  The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security created \nadditional management challenges and has fueled growing concerns that \nthe performance of core, non-homeland security functions will slip \nthrough the cracks. Just last week, the GAO testified before the House \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure that\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\nthe Coast Guard has experienced a substantial decline in the amount of \ntime spent on core missions. Moreover, GAO found that the Coast Guard \nlacks the resources to reverse this trend. Coast Guard Commandant \nThomas H. Collins is quoted as saying that his agency has more business \nthan it has resources and is challenged like never before to do all \nthat America wants it to do.\n  These same concerns extend to the entire Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The Department of Homeland Security's Bureau of Citizenship \nand Immigration services provides asylum for refugees and helps \nimmigrants become American citizens. The Customs Service protects and \nmonitors foreign trade so essential for a healthy American economy. And \nthe Secret Service protects and monitors against identity theft, \ncounterfeiting, and other financial crimes.\n  In fact, the General Accounting Office has added the transformation \nof and implementation of the Department to the GAO High Risk list, \npartially as the result of existing management challenges to fulfill \nnon-homeland security missions.\n  The cost of creating a Department of Homeland Security should not \ncome at the expense of these essential missions. Agencies should strike \nthe proper balance between new homeland security responsibilities and \ntheir critical non-homeland security missions. Enhancing traditional \nmissions also enhances domestic security which depends on sound \nmanagement strategies that ensure adequate resources and personnel.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the ``Non-Homeland Security Mission \nPerformance Act of 2003.'' Our bill takes important steps to ensure \nthat Americans will not see a decline in non-homeland security services \nas a result of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 910\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Non-Homeland Security \n     Mission Performance Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Federal agencies included in the Department of Homeland \n     Security perform important non-homeland security functions on \n     which all United States citizens rely, such as the protection \n     of fisheries and agriculture, communication and \n     transportation infrastructures, and medical supplies.\n       (2) Federal agencies included in the Department shall \n     ensure the continuation of non-homeland security functions as \n     new homeland security responsibilities are adopted.\n       (3) A strategy to address non-homeland security functions \n     is needed to meet the daily needs of Americans and to \n     preserve the security of the Nation.\n       (4) Non-homeland security functions are complementary to \n     homeland security functions and often share personnel, \n     resources, and assets. It is appropriate for each Under \n     Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure \n     that non-homeland security functions are performed.\n       (5) Agencies in the Department of Homeland Security perform \n     essential non-homeland security functions Americans rely on \n     everyday, including the following:\n       (A) The United States Coast Guard has vital non-homeland \n     security functions, including search and rescue, fisheries \n     enforcement, law enforcement, marine safety, and aids to \n     navigation.\n       (B) The Department of Homeland Security Bureau of \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services provides important \n     immigration and citizenship services and benefits including \n     processing and approving requests for citizenship, \n     adjudicating asylum for refugees, and immigration benefits, \n     such as refugee and intercountry adoptions.\n       (C) The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assists \n     local communities to prepare for and respond to floods, \n     hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornadoes, and other natural \n     disasters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     supplements State and local responses to natural disasters \n     and the mitigation of damage, and prevention of disasters, \n     such as earthquakes.\n       (D) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the \n     Animal Research Service develop strategies to prevent and \n     control foreign or emerging animal and plant disease \n     epidemics vital to farmers, the economy, and the protection \n     of the environment.\n       (E) The Secret Service is charged with safeguarding payment \n     and financial systems by protecting against counterfeiting, \n     identity theft, credit card fraud, cell phone fraud, computer \n     and telecommunications fraud, money laundering, and other \n     financial crimes.\n       (F) The United States Customs Service protects our free \n     trade essential for a healthy economy by working to lower the \n     cost of trade compliance, providing guidance on the conduct \n     of legal trade, and monitoring imports to ensure compliance \n     with public health and safety laws. Customs protects \n     intellectual property and combats money laundering, child \n     pornography, and drug trafficking.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) ensure the continuation of non-homeland security \n     functions of Federal agencies; and\n       (2) ensure that Federal agencies develop sound management \n     strategies and allocate sufficient funding to carry out non-\n     homeland security functions.\n\n     SEC. 3. NON-HOMELAND SECURITY FUNCTIONS PERFORMANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--For each entity in the Department of \n     Homeland Security that performs non-homeland security \n     functions, the Under Secretary with responsibility for that \n     entity, in conjunction with the head of that entity, shall \n     submit a report on the performance of the entity and all the \n     functions of that entity, with a particular emphasis on \n     examining the continuing level of performance of non-homeland \n     security functions to--\n       (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n       (2) the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate;\n       (3) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;\n       (4) the Committee on Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (5) the Select Committee on Homeland Security of the House \n     of Representatives; and\n       (6) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (b) Contents.--The report referred to under subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) to the greatest extent possible, provide an inventory \n     of the non-homeland security functions of the entity and \n     identify the capabilities of the entity with respect to those \n     functions, including--\n       (A) the number of employees carrying out those functions;\n       (B) the budget for those functions; and\n       (C) the flexibilities, personnel or otherwise, used to \n     carry out those functions;\n       (2) contain information relating to the roles, \n     responsibilities, organizational structure, capabilities, \n     personnel assets, and annual budgets, specifically with \n     respect to the capabilities of the entity to accomplish non-\n     homeland security functions without any diminishment;\n       (3) contain information relating to whether any changes are \n     required to the roles, responsibilities, functions, \n     organizational structure, modernization programs, projects, \n     activities, recruitment and retention programs, and annual \n     fiscal resources to enable the entity to accomplish non-\n     homeland security functions without diminishment; and\n       (4) contain the strategy the Department will use for the \n     performance of non-homeland security functions and homeland \n     security functions.\n       (c) Submission of Reports.--During the 5-year period \n     following the date of the transfer of an entity that performs \n     non-homeland security functions to the Department of Homeland \n     Security or the date of the establishment of an entity that \n     performs non-homeland security functions within the \n     Department of Homeland Security, the Under Secretary with \n     responsibility for that entity shall submit an annual report \n     described under subsection (a).\n       (d) Annual Evaluations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall monitor and evaluate the implementation of this \n     section.\n       (2) Reports.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and every year during the succeeding 5-\n     year period, the Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall submit a report to the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Reform \n     of the House of Representatives containing--\n       (A) an evaluation of the implementation progress reports \n     submitted under this section;\n       (B) the findings and conclusions of the Comptroller General \n     of the United States resulting from the monitoring and \n     evaluation conducted under this subsection, including \n     evaluations of how successfully the Department of Homeland \n     Security is meeting the non-homeland security functions of \n     the Department; and\n       (C) any recommendations for legislation or administrative \n     action the Comptroller General of the United States considers \n     appropriate.\n       (e) Performance Reports.--In performance reports submitted \n     under section 1116 of title 31, United States Code, the \n     Department of Homeland Security shall--\n       (1) clarify homeland security and non-homeland security \n     function performance; and\n       (2) fully describe and evaluate the performance of homeland \n     and non-homeland security functions and goals to Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 911. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na rebate of up to $765 to individuals for\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\npayroll taxes paid in 2001, to provide employers with an income tax \ncredit of up to $765 for payroll taxes paid during the payroll tax \nholiday period, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we are living in difficult economic \ntimes. Too many people are out of work and the economy is not growing \nenough to put them back to work permanently. The March unemployment \nrate was 5.8 percent and it has been holding around this mark for about \na year. More bad news came just last week when the number of jobless \nclaims soared to 445,000 for the week ending March 29. That is the \nhighest number of weekly claims for unemployment benefits in almost a \nyear.\n  While unemployment has been rising, other economic indicators are \ndropping. New orders for manufactured goods in February decreased $4.9 \nbillion or 1.5 percent; shipments also fell 1.5 percent, the largest \ndecrease since February of last year.\n  These cold, hard numbers cannot measure the unease and uncertainty \nmany Americans feel today. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence \nIndex fell 2 more points in March after a 3 point drop in February. \nWhen your neighbor is out of work and cannot find a job, you worry that \nyou might be next. So you hold off on buying that new washing machine, \nthe new car you need to get to work, or you put that dream vacation on \nhold. Americans have experienced losses in their pensions and 401(k) \nplans. When you combine all of this with the uncertainty surrounding \nthe war against terrorism and the war with Iraq, you create a great \ndrag on the economy.\n  I think all of my colleagues agree that the economy is not where we \nwant it to be right now. We agree that it needs a booster shot. We have \npartisan disagreement over specifics and the size of the stimulus. But \nif we put aside our partisan differences, I believe we can come up with \na bipartisan solution to help the economy in the short term.\n  We can accomplish this if we agree on a few, narrow principles for an \neconomic stimulus plan. First, we should aim toward providing an \nimmediate boost to the economy. We do not need tax cuts that will only \nbegin to help several years downs the road. The economy needs help \ntoday. Second, the urgent need for the boost today means that the \neconomic stimulus plan must be simple and easy to administer so that \nfull effects can be felt right away. Third, I believe that a stimulus \nplan must be fiscally responsible. While the economy needs a boost \ntoday, that boost should not come at the expense of our ability to meet \nour needs tomorrow. And finally, the stimulus package must be \nequitable. It must be fair. It should touch all Americans, not just a \nselect few.\n  Today, along with my colleague Senator Corzine, I am introducing one \nidea for economic stimulus that meets all of these principles. We \npropose that all working Americans receive tax relief equivalent to the \namount of payroll taxes paid on the first $10,000 of earnings--a total \nof $765. The rebate would be made in two installments. The first would \ncome within 2 months of passage of the bill and the second would come \nby December 1st of this year. Employers would also receive an \nequivalent tax credit for their employees.\n  This plan meets the principles I have outlined. It is a short-term \nplan that will put spending money in the hands of working Americans. It \nwill be simple to administer--rebate checks were a part of the tax cut \nwe passed in 2001. The plan is fiscally responsible: the rebate checks \nwill be paid out of general revenues and not from the Social Security \ntrust fund. Finally, this plan is fair. Every working American will \nbenefit.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Congress will act quickly to revive our \neconomy. Today, Senator Corzine and I are putting one idea forward. My \ncolleagues have a variety of other ideas that they will put forward. \nThe Senate should look at each and put together a final package that is \nsimple, immediate, fair, and fiscally responsible.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Landrieu \nin introducing the Wage Tax Cut Act, legislation that would provide an \nimmediate boost to America's economy by providing wage tax relief to \nall working Americans and to businesses.\n  In short, this proposal would give all working Americans a wage tax \nbreak of up to $765, equivalent to the payroll taxes they have paid on \nthe first $10,000 of their earnings in the year 2001. Working couples \nwould receive tax relief of up to $1,530. This is a 1-year proposal in \nwhich all payments and tax credits would come out of the General \nTreasury. The Social Security and Medicare trust funds would not be \naffected in any way.\n  Every working American and business-owner would benefit from our \nproposal. This $765 tax cut would help American families make ends meet \nand stimulate the economy. It would pay for 5 week's worth of groceries \nfor a family of four; more than 2 months of child care; 3\\1/2\\ months \nof utility bills; and 7 months of gasoline.\n  The act would provide business-owners--small and large--a tax credit \nfor up to $765 on the wages of each of their employees. The tax credit \nfor businessowners would put more money in the hands of employers to \nspur investment in new people, plant, and equipment. By reducing \npayroll taxes, which amount to a tax on labor, we would encourage more \nemployers to hire new personnel, and to keep those they now have.\n  That is why the Business Roundtable, which represents 150 of the \ncountry's largest corporations with over 10 million employees, has \nendorsed the concept of payroll-based tax relief that we are proposing \ntoday.\n  This is a simple, fair, and affordable economic stimulus plan that \nwill get money in the hands of consumers and businesses that will be \nimmediately reinvested in our economy.\n  Unlike the President's proposed tax plan, the Wage Tax Cut Act would \nprovide immediate help to the economy, without being fiscally \nirresponsible. At $180 billion, its cost is only about 15 percent of \nthe $1.3 trillion in tax cuts included in the conference report on the \nbudget resolution.\n  At this important time in our Nation's history, when thousands of \nyoung men and women are bravely serving their country, we need to \nensure that the America to which they return is vibrant and strong. \nThis proposal would help create the jobs they need, and the prosperity \nthey deserve.\n  In December 2001, when Senator Bill Frist supported--in fact his own \nWeb site articulated--the stimulative impact that payroll tax relief \ncould have. It quoted the senator as saying:\n\n       A payroll tax holiday is truly a stimulative, temporary tax \n     cut that would be welcome news for most Americans, especially \n     during the holiday season. As economic growth stagnates and \n     unemployment numbers increase, putting additional money in \n     consumers' pockets will provide a much needed economic boost.\n\n  Senator Frist continued:\n\n       The key is for Congress to respond and pass a stimulus bill \n     now, and I believe that this proposal could provide us with a \n     bipartisan solution.\n\n  Senator Frist was right on the mark about the need, and stimulative \nimpact, of payroll tax relief then. It is my hope that Majority Leader \nFrist, and the rest of my colleagues, today will stand behind those \nwords and support this proposal to help reinvigorate out economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 914. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to apply \nlook-thru rules for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation to \ndividends from foreign corporations not controlled by a domestic \ncorporation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President I rise today to introduce legislation to \nsimplify an unnecessarily complex portion of the tax code that serves \nas an impediment to U.S. businesses attempting to compete in foreign \nmarkets. I am proud to be joined in this effort by my friends and \ncolleagues Sens. Breaux and Hatch. The Foreign Tax Credit, FTC, was \ndesigned to ensure that U.S. corporations were not subject to double \ntaxation on foreign income. A number of limitations were placed on \nthese credits in order to guard against attempts to reduce U.S. taxes \non income earned here. Consequently, income earned abroad is sorted \ninto separate ``baskets'' based on how the income is earned, also known \nas ``look-through'' treatment.\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\n  Unfortunately, income from certain corporate joint ventures has not \nalways been afforded look-through treatment. In the past, income from a \n10/50 company, a U.S. firm has substantial ownership, at least 10 \npercent but not a controlling interest 50 percent, was subject to \ndifferent tax treatment. In 1997, Congress attempted to address \ndisparity with legislation affording look-through treatment for \ndividends paid by 10/50 companies. However, the bill included vague \ntransition rules that were complex and expensive for U.S. companies.\n  Our bill would resolve these transition issues by restoring parity in \nthe tax treatment of joint-venture income to other income earned \noverseas by U.S. companies. Everyone, from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation in the 2001 simplification study to the Clinton Administration \nin its budget documents, has called for simplification in this area.\n  Legal and political realities in foreign markets often necessitate \nthe use of corporate joint ventures with local firms. U.S. \ninternational tax rules should not penalize companies with overly \ncomplicated and costly limitations purely because they choose or are \nforced to do business in a certain form. The 10/50 transition rules \ndidn't allow the full use of foreign tax credits, thus over-taxing \nincome generated from these business ventures. We need to eliminate the \nlast vestiges of the 10/50 regime in order to level the international \nplaying field for U.S. companies.\n  I ask that all my colleagues consider and support this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 914\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Energy and Science Research \n     Investment Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Office of Science of the Department of Energy is \n     the largest Federal sponsor of civilian research in the \n     physical sciences and plays a major role in supporting \n     interdisciplinary research that contributes to other \n     scientific fields, including the life sciences, mathematics, \n     computer science, engineering, and the environmental \n     sciences;\n       (2)(A) Department of Energy laboratories have scientific \n     capabilities that are unmatched in typical academic or \n     industrial institutions;\n       (B) scientific teams of the laboratories are capable of \n     developing integrated approaches to grand scientific \n     challenges that are often beyond the reach of individual \n     experimenters; and\n       (C) the Human Genome Project exemplifies that capability;\n       (3) the facilities at the Department of Energy laboratories \n     are invaluable to scientists across disciplines, including \n     those from academia, industry, and government;\n       (4)(A) for more than half a century, science research has \n     had an extraordinary impact on the economy, national \n     security, medicine, energy, life sciences, and the \n     environment; and\n       (B) in the economic arena, studies show that about half of \n     all United States post-World War II economic growth is a \n     direct result of technological innovation stemming from \n     scientific research;\n       (5) the Office of Science programs, in constant dollars, \n     have been flat funded for more than a decade, placing the \n     scientific leadership of the United States in jeopardy and \n     limiting the generation of ideas that will enhance the \n     security of the United States and drive future economic \n     growth;\n       (6)(A) because the cost of conducting research increases at \n     a faster rate than the Consumer Price Index, flat funding for \n     the Office of Science has led to a decline in the number of \n     grants awarded, students trained, and scientists supported; \n     and\n       (B) flat and erratic funding has also led to an underuse of \n     the facilities that the United States has invested hundreds \n     of millions of dollars to construct; and\n       (7) higher funding levels for the Office of Science will \n     provide more opportunities to support graduate students in \n     research at universities in the fields of mathematics, \n     engineering, and the physical sciences, helping to alleviate \n     an increasing over-reliance on foreign talent in these \n     fields.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR SCIENCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Program Direction.--The Secretary of Energy, acting \n     through the Office of Science, shall--\n       (1) conduct a comprehensive program of fundamental \n     research, including research on chemical sciences, physics, \n     materials sciences, biological and environmental sciences, \n     geosciences, engineering sciences, plasma sciences, \n     mathematics, and advanced scientific computing;\n       (2) maintain, upgrade, and expand the scientific user \n     facilities maintained by the Office of Science and ensure \n     that the facilities are an integral part of the departmental \n     mission for exploring the frontiers of fundamental science;\n       (3) maintain a leading-edge research capability in the \n     energy-related aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology, \n     advanced scientific computing and genome research;\n       (4) ensure that the fundamental science programs of the \n     Department of Energy, as appropriate, help inform the applied \n     research and development programs of the Department; and\n       (5) ensure that Department of Energy research programs \n     support sufficient numbers of graduate students to maintain \n     the pipeline of scientists and engineers that is critical for \n     the future vitality of Federal laboratories and overall \n     United States science leadership.\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\n       (b) Authorities of Appropriations.--There are authorized to \n     be appropriated to carry out this section--\n       (1) for fiscal year 2004, $3,785,000,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 2005, $4,153,000,000;\n       (3) for fiscal year 2006, $4,586,000,000;\n       (4) for fiscal year 2007, $5,000,000,000; and\n       (5) for fiscal year 2008, $5,400,000,000.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, today I am pleased to introduce, with \nSenators Alexander, Bingaman and Warner, legislation that would \nauthorize increased funding for the Department of Energy's, DoE, Office \nof Science. For two decades, funding for the Office of Science has \nremained stagnant while the cost of conducting cutting-edge research \nhas continued to rise. Inadequate funding levels for the Office of \nScience, one of our Nation's leading sources of funding for research in \nthe physical sciences, threatens our Nation's leadership in all \nsciences and thus also our economic well-being and our security. In the \npast fifty years, roughly one-half of the Nation's economic growth has \nbeen derived from investments in science and technology.\n  The DoE's Office of Science portfolio is extensive. It is the chief \nsponsor of major research and user facilities benefitting researchers \nin the life sciences, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, \nmathematics, computer science, and engineering. Among these \ndisciplines, the Office of Science possesses primary responsibility for \nresearch in fusion energy physics, nuclear physics, and high energy \nphysics. Taken together, this research supports the DoE's \nresponsibilities for energy security and defense.\n  While much of this work is conducted by scientists and researchers at \nour world-class national labs, university-based research is greatly \nenhanced by DoE Office of Science funds. Over one-fifth of its budget \nis directed to university research, with 49 States receiving funding. \nThis funding plays a central role in supporting significant, long-term, \npeer-reviewed basic research. Such on-campus research helps attract \nmotivated students to the physical sciences. By stimulating the \ncuriosity of talented students, and giving them a chance to engage in \nquality scientific work, the Office of Science expands our knowledge \nbase while training the next generation of scientists and engineers.\n  The University of Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics shows \nthe value that is posed by DoE's efforts to support on campus research \nbe it through the DoE's Office of Science or other DoE programs. Since \nits founding in 1970, this lab has helped produce 161 Ph.D.'s. \nCurrently 57 students are pursuing their doctorates while working at \nthis facility. Additionally, the lab employs dozens of undergraduates \nand helps bring high school students to the facility each summer. By \nsupporting nearly 2000 researchers at more than 250 universities and \ninstitutions in cutting edge research areas such as physics, \nnanotechnology, materials, genomics, and superconductivity, the Office \nof Science is able to help draw students to the sciences.\n  It is the creation of the next generation of scientists that will \nfuel our nation's economic development and staff our nation's critical \nDoE facilities. According to the DoE Inspector General the ``Department \nhas been unable to recruit and retain critical scientific and technical \nstaff in a manner sufficient to meet identified mission requirements. . \n. . [I]f this trend continues, the Department could face a shortage of \nnearly 40 percent in these classifications within five years.''\n  If we do not increase funding for the DoE's Office of Science: \nmaintenance backlogs will increase even further at major DoE \nfacilities, major construction initiatives will lapse and even fewer \nresearch grants will be funded. As a result, our Nation's leadership in \noverall science and technology will be threatened since the physical \nsciences provide much of the core knowledge and instrumentation that \nfuel advances in many other critical fields of knowledge.\n  Increasing funds for the DoE's Office of Science will support \nresearch in exciting fields such as: nanotechnology, high energy \nphysics, genomics and supercomputing. By investing in the Office of \nScience, we can help scientists and engineers as they expand our \nknowledge of the universe and inform our interactions with it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 916. A bill to establish the National Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area \nin the State of Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the \n``National Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area Act of 2003.''\n  The story behind and about the Mormon pioneers' 1400 mile trek from \nIllinois to the Great Salt Lake Valley is one of the most compelling \nand captivating in our Nation's history. This legislation would \ndesignate as a National Heritage Area an area that spans some 250 miles \nalong Highway 89 and encompasses outstanding examples of historical, \ncultural, and natural resources that demonstrate the colonization of \nthe western United States, and the experience and influence of the \nMormon pioneers in furthering that colonization.\n  The landscape, architecture, artisan skills, and events along Highway \n89 convey in a very real way the legacy of the Mormon pioneers' \nachievements. The community of Panquitch for example, has an annual \nQuilt Day celebration to commemorate the sacrifice and fortitude of its \npioneers whose efforts saved the community from starvation in 1864. The \ncelebration is in remembrance of the Quilt Walk, a walk in which a \ngroup of men from Panquitch used quilts to form a path that would bear \ntheir weight across the snow. This quilt walk enabled these men to \ncross over the mountains to procure food for their community, which was \nfacing starvation as it experienced its first winter in Utah.\n  Another example of the tenacity of pioneers can be seen today at the \nHole-in-the-Rock. Here, in 1880, a group of 250 people, 80 wagons, and \n1000 head of cattle upon the Colorado River Gorge. Finding no pathways \ndown to the river, the pioneers decided to use a narrow crevice leading \ndown to the bottom of the gorge. To make the crevice big enough to \naccommodate wagons, the pioneers spent six weeks enlarging the crevice \nby hand, using hammers, chisels, and blasting powder. They then \nattached large ropes to the wagons as they began their descent down the \nsteep incline. It is because of such tenacity and innovation on the \npart of pioneers that the western United States was shaped the way it \nwas and much of that has contributed to the way of life and landscape \nstill found in the West today.\n  The National Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area will serve as a special \nrecognition of the people and places that have contributed greatly to \nour nation's development. It will allow for the conservation of \nhistorical and cultural resources, the establishment of interpretive \nexhibits, will increase public awareness of the surviving skills and \ncrafts of those living along Highway 89, and specifically allows for \nthe preservation of historic buildings. In light of the benefits \nassociated with preserving the rich heritage of the founding of many of \nthe communities along Highway 89, my legislation has broad support from \nSanpete, Sevier, Piute, Garfield, and Kane counties and is a locally \nbased, locally supported undertaking.\n  I believe this legislation will provide an exciting platform from \nwhich a significant part of our Nation's history can be highlighted. \nThe Senate passed this legislation last year as part of a larger \nnational heritage area package. While the overall package was not \nconsidered by the other body before the last Congress adjourned, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the \nadministration to pass this legislation during this session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 917. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to require the \nuse of a certain minimum amount of funds for winter motorized access \ntrails; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise to introduce a bill with great \nsignificance for snowmachine and snowmobile advocates both in Alaska \nand nationwide.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the use of snowmobiles is growing as a \nform of recreation. There are an estimated 1.64 million snowmobiles \ncurrently in use. In my State of Alaska, and in other northern States, \ntravel by snowmobile goes beyond recreation. In many areas it is a \nregular form of transportation when snow prevents\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\npeople from traveling any other way. Snowmobiles are used regularly to \nvisit neighbors, to hunt for a family's food supply, to carry people \nwho are sick or injured to a place they can receive care. In many parts \nof Alaska, snowmobiles are as common as cars.\n  Unfortunately, there is no existing program to provide for the proper \nmarking of snowmobile trails, to maintain trails, or even to encourage \nsafe use of these machines. The bill I am introducing today is intended \nto correct that situation.\n  First, my bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a \nsnowmobile education program. Second, the bill directs the Secretary, \nworking with the snowmobile industry and others, to estimate the amount \nof fuel tax attributable to snowmobile use in each State, and provides \nthat at least the same dollar amount be dedicated to the acquisition, \ndesign, planning, construction and maintenance of snowmobile trails.\n  At present, 30 percent of the Recreational Trails program funding is \nreserved for motorized uses, which may be combined with money for other \nuses, to establish multiple-use trails and associated facilities. \nHowever, although a portion of this funding comes from the tax paid for \nfuel used in snowmobiles, there is no guarantee that any of that money \nactually is used to benefit snowmobile activities.\n  My bill takes nothing away from any other part of the Recreational \nTrails program--it simply ensures that each State spends on snowmobiles \nwhat is collected from snowmobiles. That is simple fairness.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 917\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WINTER MOTORIZED ACCESS TRAILS.\n\n       Section 206 of title 23, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Snowmachine.--The term `snow\n     machine' means a motorized off-road vehicle intended to \n     operate on snow, and which is propelled by means of a \n     revolving track or tracks.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (d), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Winter motorized access trails.--\n       ``(A) Use of funds.--\n       ``(i) Determination by the secretary.--The Secretary shall \n     annually estimate revenues to the Highway Trust Fund derived \n     from fuel purchased in each State for use in snowmachines, \n     using information submitted by--\n\n       ``(I) the Department of Commerce;\n       ``(II) the Department of the Treasury;\n       ``(III) the International Snowmobile Manufacturers \n     Association; and\n       ``(IV) any other appropriate sources.\n\n       ``(ii) Use of funds.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--Of amounts made available to a State for \n     motorized access under the recreational trails program, not \n     less than the amount that is equal to the revenues derived \n     from fuel purchased for use in the State by snowmachines, as \n     estimated by the Secretary under clause (i), shall be used \n     for activities that enhance winter motorized recreational \n     trails, including--\n\n       ``(aa) trails on Bureau of Land Management or National \n     Forest land where such uses are not prohibited by law; and\n       ``(bb) trails designed for diverse uses in other seasons.\n\n       ``(II) Activities.--A State may use funds under subclause \n     (I) to--\n\n       ``(aa) locate, survey, and map winter motorized-use or \n     multiple-use trails;\n       ``(bb) document or secure public rights-of-way for trails;\n       ``(cc) reroute trails where necessary;\n       ``(dd) design and construct new trail routes;\n       ``(ee) link existing trail systems;\n       ``(ff) build trailhead facilities;\n       ``(gg) improve trails for safe travel and multiple uses;\n       ``(hh) establish safety caches of first aid and emergency \n     gear;\n       ``(ii) sign and mark trails;\n       ``(jj) purchase trail building and grooming equipment; and\n       ``(kk) mobilize trail volunteers as maintenance crews, \n     safety patrols, and trail ambassadors.\n       ``(B) Public information campaigns.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Of the sums available to the Secretary \n     for the administration of and research and technical \n     assistance under the recreational trails program and for \n     administration of the National Recreational Trails Advisory \n     Committee, $50,000 shall be used for each fiscal year for \n     public information campaigns educating the public about, and \n     encouraging, the safe use of snowmachines.\n       ``(ii) Content.--In designing the content of public \n     information campaigns under clause (i), the Secretary shall \n     consult with--\n\n       ``(I) representatives of snowmachine manufacturers and \n     users; and\n       ``(II) the Advertising Council.''.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kohl, and \n        Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 918. A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to implement fully \nby September 30, 2004, requirements for additional Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Civil Support Teams; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the tragic events of September 11, 2001, \nand the ongoing military action in Iraq have changed the way that our \ncountry thinks about defense policy, including about how we protect our \ncitizens here at home.\n  For that reason, it is vitally important that we fully implement \nsection 1403 of Public Law 107-314, the Bob Stump National \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, which requires the Secretary of \nDefense to establish an additional 23 Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil \nSupport Teams, WMD-CSTs, and that at least one team be located in each \nState and territory of the United States.\n  WMD-CSTs are made up of 22 full-time National Guard personnel who are \nspecially trained and equipped to deploy and assess suspected nuclear, \nchemical, biological, or other threats in support of local first \nresponders. There are currently 32 full-time and 23 part-time WMD-CSTs \nacross the country.\n  Chemical, biological, and other threats present new challenges to our \nmilitary and to local responders. The WMD-CSTs play a vital role in \nassisting local first responders in investigating and combating these \nnew threats. The September 11 terrorist attacks, and the terror alerts \nissued by the Department of Homeland Security, emphasize the need to \nhave full-time WMD-CSTs in each State.\n  As the events of September 11 so clearly and tragically demonstrated, \nlocal first responders are on the front lines of combating terrorism \nand responding to other large-scale incidents. As we rethink the \nsecurity needs of our country, we should support the creation of an \nadditional 23 full-time WMD-CSTs as soon as possible. Establishing \nthese additional full-time teams will improve the overall capability of \nWisconsin and the other 18 States and 4 territories with part-time \nteams to prepare for and respond to potential threats to the future.\n  In light of the tragic events of September 11, the ongoing threat of \nterrorist activities, and the military action in Iraq, the presence of \nat least one WMD-CST in each State is all the more imperative.\n  The provisions included in last year's Defense authorization bill \nrepresent an important step forward in the effort to establish WMD-CSTs \nin each State and territory. My bill would build on this progress by \nincluding a deadline by which these teams have to be established and \nproviding the resources necessary to staff, equip, train, and operate \nthese teams.\n  The legislation that I introduce today, the Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Civil Support Team Implementation Act of 2003, would \nrequire the Secretary of Defense to fully implement section 1403 by \nSeptember 30, 2004. The costs associated with setting up these new \nteams would be paid for by an across-the-board cut to the fiscal year \n2004 procurement account.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Leahy, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel, the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, the \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, the Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nSarbanes, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, the Senior Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords.\n  The terrorist attacks and the subsequent mobilization of tens of \nthousands of National Guardsmen and reservists, and the activation of \nhundreds of thousands of guardsmen and reservists for the military \ncampaign in Iraq, also underscore the need to provide adequate \nresources for and to ensure full-time manning of the National Guard. As \nwe\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\nmove to establish at least one 22-member WMD-CST in each State, we \nshould also allocate the necessary resources to ensure adequate \nNational Guard personnel end-strengths to provide for full-time manning \nand for the additional personnel necessary for these new teams.\n  For that reason, our bill would also authorize an additional 506 \nfull-time National Guard positions to man these new teams.\n  Given the important role that the men and women of the National Guard \nplay in our ongoing missions at home and abroad, we should ensure that \nthe establishment of these important teams does not put at risk full-\ntime manning in other vital areas of the National Guard's mission.\n  It is important that the additional WMD-CSTs are established as soon \nas possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 918\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to enhance \ncompetition among and between rail carriers in order to ensure \nefficient rail service and reasonable rail rates, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER, Mr. President, I am proud today to join a bipartisan \nand geographically diverse group of Senators to introduce the Railroad \nCompetition Act of 2003. When enacted, the Railroad Competition Act \nwill benefits rail shippers, retail shoppers, and, I believe, the \nrailroad industry itself, by promoting real competition in the nation's \nfreight rail transportation sector.\n  I am especially proud to be working on this issue alongside two of my \ncolleagues, Senators Dorgan and Burns, with whom I have shared this \neffort for many years. This is an issue I have been dealing with since \nmy first days as Governor of West Virginia. I cosponsored similar \nbipartisan legislation during my first year as a United States Senator. \nIncluding today's introduction. I have sponsored legislation in six \ndifferent Congresses going back to 1985 to try to instill competition \nin the freight rail market to invigorate an industry that is essential \nto the commerce of this Nation. This is the fourth straight Congress in \nwhich Senators Burns and Dorgan have joined me to fight for fairness \nfor shippers in our states and throughout the country.\n  I frequently say that I have worked on this for my entire Senate \ncareer, and with little discernible success. Still, I am not dissuaded \nfrom pursuing this legislation again because I know our cause is right. \nWhat this bill does is really very simple. We seek nothing more than a \nfreight rail industry governed by the principles of capitalism--\ncompetition, service, fair prices, and the ability of sophisticated \nactors to conduct arms-length negotiations for these things. We also \nseek a return--not to the regulated industry that predates the Staggers \nAct--but to the competitive freight rail industry envisioned by the \nCongress that passed it.\n  If we are successful in this effort, it will mean a newly level \nplaying field for shippers and railroads. It will mean goods being \npicked up on time and being delivered on time. It will mean products \ntraveling short distances will not be priced per mile at a price that \nis almost usuriously higher than products traveling great distances. \nShippers moving small amounts of product will not be unduly \ndisadvantaged by railroads who answer to no person or governmental \nentity. What this bill will not do, is re-regulate the railroads.\n  The Railroad Competition Act will do the following: clarify that the \nSTB shall promote effective competition among rail carriers, helping to \nmaintain both reasonable freight rail rates and consistent and \nefficient rail service; create a system if ``final offer'' arbitration \nfor matters before the STB; authorize the STB to remove so-called \n``paper barriers'' in place for ten years or more that prevent short-\nline and regional railroads from providing improved service to \nshippers; remove the requirement for shippers to demonstrate ``Anti-\nCompetitive Conduct'' on the part of railroads--retains statutory \nauthority for STB to act in the ``public interest''; cap filing fees \nfor STB rate cases at the level of Federal district courts, reducing \nfiling fee from approximately $65,000; require railroads to quote rates \nto their customers; call for a Department of Transportation, DOT, study \nof rail competition; allow States to petition the STB for declarations \nof ``areas of inadequate rail competition,'' and creates applicable \nremedies; create position of Rail Customer Advocate at U.S. Department \nof Agriculture (USDA).\n  Perhaps the most striking aspect of the freight rail industry that \nthe authors of the Staggers Act sought to create, and to which we hope \nto give new life with this bill, is really fairly mundane. Upon \nenactment of this legislation, shippers weighing their transportation \noptions will be able to get railroads to do the most basic thing that \noccurs in business relationships--quote a price for the service \nrequested. In other words, railroads will tell shippers how much it is \ngoing to cost to move a certain amount of product from Point A to Point \nB. Hardly remarkable, hardly earth-shattering, but that very simple, \neveryday aspect of business negotiations is so rare in the freight rail \nsector today that it is hardly ever seen.\n  How can this be? How can railroads get away with not telling their \ncustomers how much they are going to be charged for a service? \nRailroads can carry out this bizarre practice, as well as other \namazingly anti-competitive business practices, because they are one of \nthe last unfettered monopolies in our economy. The Staggers Act only \npartially deregulated our freight rail industry, and provided for a \ngovernment entity to protect competition for shippers. That authority \nfell then to the now-defunct Interstate Commerce Commission, ICC, and \nthe power should now be exercised by the Surface Transportation Board, \nSTB. The ICC did not do a very good job of protecting competition, and \nthe STB has fairly consistently chosen not to.\n  This has resulted in a freight rail market in which customers have no \npower. In real-world terms, this means that electricity produced from \ncoal, and virtually everything you buy in the store--food, medicines, \npaper products, plastics, and anything made from any number of basic \nchemical products--is more expensive than it should be because \nrailroads abuse their monopoly power to keep rail rates artificially \nhigh.\n\n  In fact, even back in the bad, old days of the ICC-regulated rail \nsector,\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\nmany railroads enjoyed ``natural'' monopolies over portions of their \nnetwork. In most cases, this fact could usually be balanced by the \nnumber of railroads providing service. In the twenty-three years since \nCongress passed the Staggers Act, however, the previous number of Class \nI freight railroads--more than 40--has dwindled down to an all-powerful \nfew. This has expanded a handful of scattered ``natural'' monopolies to \nbasically four regional monopolies--two in the eastern United States, \nand two in the West (with the smallest of the Class I railroads \noperating its small network of track along the Mississippi). There is \nno balance in the system; there is only the railroad industry charging \nits take-it-or-leave-it prices and providing woefully bad service.\n  I would conclude by saying to my colleagues that this legislation has \nlaudable goals, but it is not revolutionary. We have seen how \ncompetition in other industries has strengthened the players willing \nand able to compete. It is not the reactionary, re-regulatory vehicle \nthe freight rail industry will try to tell you it is. It is nothing \nmore and nothing less than an attempt to implement fairness where it \nhas been lacking. The viability of so many of our industries--the \nrailroads included--depends on this legislation becoming law.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak about a bill, the \nRailroad Competition Act of 2003, which, along with Senators Burns, \nRockefeller, Craig, Baucus, Coleman, and Johnson, I hope will introduce \na bit of competition and better service in our railroad industry. The \ntruth is that our rail system is completely broken; deregulation has \nonly led to a system dominated by regional monopolies and both shippers \nand consumers are paying the price.\n  Since the supposed deregulation of the rail industry in 1980, the \nnumber of major Class I railroads has been allowed to decline from \napproximately 42 to only 4 major U.S. railroads today. Four mega-\nrailroads overwhelmingly dominate railroad traffic, generating 95 \npercent of the gross ton-miles and 94 percent of the revenues, \ncontrolling 90 percent of all U.S. coal movement; 70 percent of all \ngrain movement and 88 percent of all originated chemical movement. This \ndrastic level of consolidation has left rail customers with only two \nmajor carriers operating in the East and two in the West, and has far \nexceeded the industry's need to minimize unit operating costs.\n  But consolidation has not happened in a vacuum. Over the years, \nregulators have systematically adopted policies that so narrowly \ninterpret the procompetitive provisions of the 1980 statute that \nrailroads are essentially protected from ever having to compete with \neach other. As a consequence rail users to have no power to choose \namong carriers either in terminal areas where switching infrastructure \nmakes such choices feasible, nor can rail users even get a rate quoted \nto them over a ``bottleneck'' segment of the monopoly system.\n  The negative results of this approach have been astonishing in North \nDakota. It costs $2,600 to move one rail car of wheat to Minneapolis, \napproximately 400 miles. Yet for a similar 400 mile move between \nMinneapolis and Chicago, it costs only $918 to deliver that car. Not \nonly is that totally unfair to the captive farmer, but in the long run \nit is unsustainable.\n  It is actually $500 per car cheaper to ship a carload of corn from \nIowa to the PNW, through North Dakota, than it is if that carload were \nto originate in North Dakota. The farmer in Iowa pays $2,900, while the \nfarmer in North Dakota is charged $3,400.\n  The same pattern is true with shipments going to the Gulf of Mexico. \nMinot, ND is 1,732 miles from the gulf whereas the distance to the gulf \nfrom Herman, MN is 1,430 miles, a difference of only 332 miles. But \nwhen it comes to paying the shipping costs the farmer in Minot pays \n$1,630 more per car because Minot is just isolated enough that it \ncannot take advantage of trucks and barges the way Herman, MN, can \nmeaning the price of being captive is $1,600 per carload from central \nNorth Dakota.\n  Another example is Hastings, NE. Hastings is 1,700 miles from the \nPacific Northwest, PNW, grain markets in Portland, OR. But, if an \nelevator from Hastings wants to ship a carload of wheat to the PNW they \nwill pay $4,316. Meanwhile, Minot, ND, is 1,300 miles from Portland, \n450 miles closer than Hastings, NE, yet the farmer in Minot will have \nto pay $4,442 to ship the same carload of wheat to the PNW, a surcharge \nof $126 for a shipment that is shorter by 400 miles.\n  How has this happened? Since the deregulation of the railroad \nindustry, it has been the responsibility of the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, later renamed, the Surface Transportation Board, to make \nsure that the pro-competitive intent of the law was being upheld. It is \nthe STBs charge to protect captive shippers through ``regulated \ncompetition.''\n  In 1999 the GAO reported on how complicated it is for a shipper to \nget rate relief under the ``regulated competition'' approach at the \nSTB. The GAO found that this process takes up to 500 days to decide, \nand costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. That is hardly a rate \nrelief process, but it is the only relief shippers have under the law.\n  According to the North Dakota Public Service Commission ``while the \nStaggers Rail Act uses a revenue-to-variable cost ratio of 180 percent \nas a benchmark for reasonableness, North Dakota's rail rates on wheat \noften generate ratios of 270 to 400 percent. On an annual basis, North \nDakota's farmers and grain shippers pay $50 to $100 million in excess \nfreight rates [each year].''\n  The Railroad Competition Act of 2003 will seek to improve things by \nreaffirming the strong role the STB should play in protecting shippers \nby: clarifying national rail policy; requiring railroads to quote a \nrate of any given segment; facilitating terminal access and the ability \nto transfer goods among railroads in terminal areas; removing paper \nbarriers to competition; capping filing fees; creating a Rail Customer \nAdvocacy Office in the Department of Agriculture; designating Areas of \nInadequate Rail Competition; and by making the rate relief process \ncheaper, faster and easier through a streamlined arbitration process.\n  All Americans, whether they are farmers who need to ship their crops \nto market, businesses shipping factory goods, or consumers that buy the \nfinished product, deserve to have a rail transportation system with \nprices that are fair. It is time for Congress to stand up for farmers, \nbusinesses, and consumers by making it very clear that the STB has to \nbe a more aggressive defender of competition and reasonable rates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 920. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ncircuit and district judges, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to introduce today the \nFederal Judgeship Act of 2003. This bill will alleviate some of the \nstrain on the vastly overburdened Federal courts by creating a total of \n57 new judgeships: Eleven new circuit judgeships and 46 new district \njudgeships. It also converts five existing temporary judgeships to \npermanent positions. In addition, the bill confers Article III status \non the judgeships authorized for the Northern Mariana Islands and the \nVirgin Islands.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States endorses the provisions \nin this bill. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 921. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nmake grants to reimburse State and local governments and Indian tribes \nfor certain costs relating to the mobilization of Reserves who are \nfirst responder personnel of such governments or tribes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``State and \nLocal Reservist First Responders Assistance Act of 2003.'' My bill \nwould reimburse State and local governments for the additional costs \nthey incur when their first responders who also serve in the National \nGuard or the Reserves are called to active duty for 6 or more months.\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\n  I am pleased to have as original cosponsors of my bill Senators \nClinton, Corzine, Daschle, Leahy, Mikulski, Sarbanes, and Schumer.\n  The 1.2 million men and women who serve in the Guard and the Reserves \nare a crucial component of our military. They account for just 8.3 \npercent of the Defense budget but give us the capability, if necessary, \nor nearly doubling our Armed Forces personnel.\n  Not surprisingly, many police, fire, rescue, emergency medical \nservice, and emergency hazardous material disposal personnel serve in \nthe Guard and the Reserves. More and more of these men and women are \nbeing called to active duty for longer and longer tours, especially now \nbecause of the war with Iraq.\n  It's critical that we bolster our military capabilities here and \nabroad. But we must not do it at the expense of our safety and security \nat home.\n  Increasingly, I am hearing from State and local officials who are \nconcerned about the toll that Guard and Reserve call-ups are taking on \nemergency preparedness.\n  It can be a major problem in smaller towns where just a few call-ups \ncan decimate a local fire or police department. The Town of Ridgewood, \nfor instance, had a patrolman called up who also headed the EMS, \nemergency medical services. It is costing the town $200,000 to replace \nhim.\n  Because of the recession that began in March 2001 and the effects of \n9-11, State and local governments are financially strapped. We \nshouldn't leave them ``holding the bag'' when their first responders \nget called to active duty for months at a time.\n  My bill would establish a grant program to be administered by the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security, DHS. State and local units of \ngovernment could apply for grants to cover the unanticipated costs \nassociated with replacing a first responder called to active duty for 6 \nmonths or more.\n  Reimbursable costs could include the salary and benefits associated \nwith hiring a temporary replacement or the overtime paid to other \nemergency personnel who ``fill in'' for the first responder called to \nactive duty.\n  If a jurisdiction does not pay its reservist and uses the savings to \nhire a temporary replacement or pay others overtime, those ``costs'' \nwould not be reimbursable. Only net additional costs would be \nreimbursable.\n  My bill will help communities in my home State of New Jersey and \nacross the country maintain their ability to respond to terrorist \nattacks, natural disasters, and other emergencies.\n  A logical question to ask regarding my bill is, ``How much does it \ncost?'' The candid answer is, ``I don't know.''\n  The bill authorizes the appropriation of ``such sums as may be \nnecessary.''\n  The stipulation in the bill that the first responders must be called \nto active duty for 6 or more consecutive months is meant to keep the \ncosts of the bill under control and to ensure that the grant program is \nadministratively feasible.\n  I have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to get a handle on how many \nfirst responders have been called to active duty, and for how long. It \nappears that no one is really keeping track.\n  The anecdotal evidence of the need for my bill, however, is \noverwhelming.\n  According to the Department of Defense, there are a total of 221,186 \nReservists and National Guardsmen and women on active duty right now. \nMany of them, obviously, are first responders.\n  According to the Police Executive Research Forum, PERF, 452 of 1002 \nlaw enforcement agencies and departments across the country surveyed so \nfar have lost personnel to call-ups.\n  The Democratic Leadership Council, DLC, has determined that 27 of the \n44 police departments it has surveyed are experiencing personnel \nshortfalls caused, in part, by military call-ups.\n  Of the remaining 17 departments, 15 are in danger of being hurt by \ncall-ups.\n  According to the DLC, ``About 5 percent of the officers in these \ndepartments are reservists or members of the National Guard--and many \nare already being called up for service in the wars against terrorism, \nAfghanistan, and Iraq. On average, the activation of only 30 percent of \nthese reserves would cause a personnel shortage in these departments.''\n  The DLC report, entitled ``Cop Crunch'' and previewed in the March/\nApril issue of Blueprint, lists the following ten jurisdictions as most \nvulnerable to military call-ups: 1. Fresno, which has about 100 \nreservists who make up 14.4 percent of the force; 2. Virginia Beach, \nwhich has 90 reservists who make up 12.1 percent of the force; 3. \nMilwaukee, which has 110 reservists who make up 8.2 percent of the \nforce; 4. Miami, which has 86 reservists who make up 8.0 percent of the \nforce; 5. Memphis, which has 143 reservists who make up 7.5 percent of \nthe force; 6. San Antonio, which has 151 reservists who make up 7.4 \npercent of the force; 7. Los Angeles, which has 650 reservists who make \nup 7.3 percent of the force; 8. Oklahoma City, which has 70 reservists \nwho make up 6.8 percent of the force; 9. Wichita, which has 41 \nreservists who make up 6.7 percent of the force; and 10. New Orleans, \nwhich has 109 reservists who make up 6.7 percent of the force.\n\n  The DLC report also highlighted Baltimore's police department. The \nCity has lost the equivalent of an entire police district, 150 \nofficers, to active duty call-ups.\n  So, the need for my bill is obvious. State and local governments \ndesperately need our help. We shouldn't put our own communities, our \nown citizens, at risk to win the war with Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brownback, \n        Mr. Coleman, Mr. McCain, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Leahy, \n        and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 922. A bill to change the requirements for naturalization through \nservice in the Armed Forces of the United States, to extend \nnaturalization benefits to members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready \nReserve of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, to extend \nposthumous benefits to surviving spouses, children, and parents, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Brownback, Senator Coleman, Senator McCain, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Boxer, Senator Leahy, and Senator Hagel to \nintroduce this bill, the Naturalization and Family Protection for \nMilitary Members Act of 2003, which will expedite the naturalization \nprocess for noncitizen soldiers serving in active duty and in the \nselect reserves and enact safeguards to protect noncitizen immediate \nrelatives of American soldiers who are killed in action.\n  More than 48,900 noncitizens are currently serving in the United \nStates military and hundreds are serving from the State of Nevada. They \nplace their lives on the line for our country every day. In recognition \nand appreciation of their service, they deserve a naturalization \nprocess that does not unnecessarily delay the grant of citizenship or \nimpose other restraints because they are stationed in another country.\n  These noncitizen soldiers love America so much they are willing to \nmake great sacrifices to protect us and promote our values and even \ndefend the Constitution--although they do not fully enjoy its \nprotections. They deserve better treatment than they currently receive. \nLike many Americans, I was moved by the story of Corporal Jose Angel \nGaribay, who came to the United States from Mexico at the age of two \nmonths in the arms of a stranger because the trip was too rough for his \nmother to carry him through the hills near Tijuana herself. At the age \nof 11 he announced to his brother that he planned to join the United \nStates military. Although a noncitizen, he believed anything was \npossible in this land of opportunity and hoped to become a police \nofficer. The proudest day for the Garibay family was the day Jose \njoined the Marines. Sadly, on March 23, at the young age of 21, he died \nnear Nasirivah, Iraq. Who can say that Corporal Garibay, citizen or \nnot, is any less of a hero? Our noncitizen soldiers deserve a system \nthat does not drop current applications or disallow eligible \napplications for legal permanent residency by their immediate \nrelatives.\n  This Act will provide necessary relief to current noncitizens serving \nin active\n\n[[Page S5381]]\n\nduty and the ready reserves within the United States military by \nsetting forth an expedited process of naturalization. This Act will \nalso provide protections for noncitizen spouses, unmarried children, \nand parents of citizen and noncitizen soldiers who are killed as a \nresult of their service to file or preserve their application for \nlawful permanent residence.\n  I rise today in support of action that will recognize and honor \ncurrent noncitizen soldiers in the United States armed forces and will \nhonor the legacy of all of our soldiers who have been killed in action \nby providing fair and sympathetic treatment of their immediate \nrelatives seeking legal permanent residency.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect as if enacted on September 11, 2001.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, my colleagues and I are \nintroducing legislation to recognize the enormous contributions of \nimmigrants in the military. The Naturalization and Family Protection \nfor Military Members Act of 2003 will enable immigrant men and women of \nour Armed Forces to obtain easier access to naturalization, and it will \nestablish immigration protections for their families if they are killed \nin action.\n  In all our wars throughout our history, immigrants have fought side \nby side and have given their lives to defend America's freedom and \nideals. One out of every five recipients of the Congressional Medal of \nHonor, the highest honor our Nation bestows on our war heroes, have \nbeen immigrants. Their bravery is unequivocal proof that immigrants are \nas dedicated as any other Americans to defend our country.\n  Today, 37,000 men and women have the status of permanent residents, \nwho are not yet citizens, but are serving in the Army, Navy, Marine, \nAir Force, and Coast Guard. Another 20,000 permanent residents are \nserving in the Reserves and the National Guard. Since the war in Iraq \nbegan two and a half weeks ago, eight of the dead, two of the missing, \nand two prisoners of war are immigrants to the United States. Only four \nwere naturalized U.S. citizens.\n  Granting these men and women posthumous citizenship is the right \nthing to do, but we must do more. This bill gives members of the armed \nservices who are already lawful permanent residents, easier access to \nnaturalization. It gives certain immigration benefits to their \nimmediate family members in the event of their death. It would amend \nimmigration laws: to allow lawful permanent resident military personnel \nto naturalize after serving 2 years in the military. They can \nparticipate in naturalization interviews and oath ceremonies abroad at \nU.S. embassies, consulates, and overseas military installations. \nNaturalization fees would be waived.\n  Recruiting needs are immediate in wartime and readiness is essential. \nAs the war in Iraq goes on and our commitment to ending global \nterrorism continues, more and more of these brave men and women are \nbeing called to active duty. Many of them are members of the Selected \nReserve--Reserve and National Guard members subject to recall to active \nduty during a war or other national emergency. Many reservists have \nalready been activated, and many more expect to be called up at a \nmoment's notice to defend our country and assist in the war effort. \nThey too deserve special recognition for their bravery and sacrifice. \nOur bill does just that. Lawful permanent residents who are members of \nthe Selected Reserve will have naturalization benefits similar to those \nconferred on members of the regular forces on duty. They will have \nexpedited naturalization during times of war or hostile military \noperations.\n  Finally, our bill will protect the immigration status of immediate \nfamily members who were dependent upon their citizen or noncitizen's \nrelative, if the relative was honorably serving in the military and was \nkilled as a result of the service. We know the tragic losses endured by \nthese families for the sacrifices their sons and daughters have made. \nIt is unfair that they should have to lose their immigration status as \nwell.\n  Our legislation will amend the immigration laws to ensure that \ngrieving immediate family members are given the opportunity to legalize \ntheir immigration status and not be threatened with deportation. \nSpecifically, these family members--noncitizen spouses, children, \nparents of citizens and parents of noncitizens serving in the military \nwho are killed as a result of their service--will be able to file or \npreserve their application for lawful permanent residence.\n  The Naturalization and Family Protection for Military Members Act is \na tribute to the sacrifices that these future Americans are already \nmaking now for their adopted country. They deserve this important \nbenefit, and we urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the American people are united in support \nof our service members, many of whom are serving today in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere abroad. We have the finest Armed Forces in \nthe world, and we have asked them to bear a heavy burden. The Senate \nhas justly expressed our support for the troops, but we have an \nobligation to do more than just pass resolutions. We have to back up \nour words with actions.\n  That is why I recently introduced an amendment, which the Senate \nunanimously approved, to raise combat pay and increase family support \nfor our service members. That is why I joined several of my \ndistinguished colleagues today in introducing a bill that would help \nimmigrant soldiers and their families. The Naturalization and Family \nProtection for Military Members Act of 2003 would expedite \nnaturalization for legal permanent residents in the military and \npreserve the rights of noncitizen family members of deceased service \nmembers.\n  There are over 37,000 legal permanent residents on active duty and \nover 20,000 on reserve duty. These brave men and women have willingly \nput themselves in harm's way to defend our country. They are living \nproof that immigration is good for our country.\n  On the battlefield, there is no distinction between American citizens \nand noncitizens--everyone is an American service member sworn to defend \nour Nation. We owe a debt of gratitude to all service members, whether \ncitizen or noncitizen, who have put their lives on the line to keep us \nall safe and free.\n  But legal resident service members, who have voluntarily taken on a \nburden that many Americans will never know, face unnecessary hurdles on \nthe path to citizenship. Even more tragically, if, God forbid, they are \nkilled in combat, the law can prevent their immediate family members \nfrom naturalizing. This is a cruel and unjust manner in which to treat \nthe families of legal immigrants who gave their lives for our country.\n\n[[Page S5383]]\n\n  The sacrifices of these immigrant service members are a poignant \nreminder that too often our immigration law treats immigrants callously \nand unfairly, ignoring the tremendous contributions that they make to \nAmerican society. While preserving the integrity of our naturalization \nprocess, we should do everything we can to correct legal technicalities \nthat make it difficult for immigrant soldiers to become citizens and \nprevent their surviving family member from naturalizing.\n  It is important to note that this bill would not in any way \ncompromise the naturalization process or national security. It would \nnot automatically confer citizenship. Service members and their \nfamilies would still be required to petition for naturalization, at \nwhich time they would be subjected to a full background check.\n  For legal permanent residents in military service, the bill would \nreduce the required period of military service to apply for \nnaturalization during peacetime from 3 years to 2 years. The bill would \nalso allow them to naturalize overseas, and waive the filing fee for \ntheir naturalization applications. For service members who are posted \noverseas for long periods and are struggling to make ends meet, these \nprovisions are vitally important.\n  Currently, immediate family members of service members who are killed \nin the line of duty lose their right to file for citizenship. It is \nwrong and unjust to penalize people because their spouse, parent, or \nchild made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The bill would \npreserve the rights to petition for citizenship of noncitizen spouses, \nunmarried children, and parents of citizen soldiers who are killed as a \nresult of such service.\n  Passing this bill is the least that we can do to honor and support \nthe brave immigrant men and women who are serving our country during \nthese dangerous times. I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy \ntoday in introducing legislation to honor the contributions of \nimmigrants who have shown their dedication both to this country and to \ncreating a better future for themselves by joining the military. The \nNaturalization and Family Protection for Military Members Act of 2003 \nwill do two important things: it will offer easier access to \nnaturalization for immigrant men and women of our Armed Forces, and it \nwill establish immigration protections for their families if they are \nkilled in action.\n  In this time of war, it is especially important to recognize those \nwho are fighting as we speak to preserve our freedom and our way of \nlife. This is particularly true for those immigrants who have too often \ngiven their lives to defend our principles. In fact, after just 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks of our current conflict, of the 71 U.S. service members killed, \nseven missing and seven captured, eight of those killed, two of the \nmissing, and two of the captured are immigrants. Most important, only \nfour of the immigrants were U.S. citizens when the war began.\n  There are more than 30,000 noncitizens on active duty in the U.S. \nmilitary--approximately 2 percent of the total U.S. forces. In the \nReserves and the National guard are another 20,000 noncitizens. These \nimmigrants have proven a dedication to our country by joining the \nmilitary or the Reserves or National Guard, a dedication which should \nbe recognized and rewarded.\n  The bill we are introducing will do that. First, it provides easier \naccess to naturalization to members of the armed service who are \nalready lawful permanent residents. Currently, being a member of the \narmed service allows a permanent legal resident to reduce their wait \ntime for naturalization from 5 years to 3 years--our legislation would \nreduce the time to only 2 years. It would also ease this process by \nallowing naturalization interviews and oath ceremonies abroad at U.S. \nembassies, consulates, and overseas military installations, and by \nwaiving naturalization fees.\n  In addition, the bill provides for the immediate families of \nimmigrant service personnel killed in action by either giving them the \nopportunity to legalize their immigration status or by allowing them to \nproceed with their own applications for naturalization as if the death \nhad not happened. By protecting their immigration status, this element \nprovides critical acknowledgment of the sacrifices that the families of \nour military members make as well.\n  Finally, the bill also remembers those courageous men and women who \nensure that in times of war or hostility, our country is ready and our \nrecruiting needs are met. While we have seen success in Iraq in recent \ndays, this war is not yet over--in fact, we have truly only reached the \nbeginning of the end, not the end. As such, we must keep in mind that \nmore and more Reserve and National Guard units are being called to \nactive duty. Therefore, we have not forgotten the bravery of those who \nhave immigrated and filled our ranks. Our legislation says that \nnaturalization benefits similar to those conferred on members of the \nregular forces on duty will also apply to lawful permanent residents \nwho are members of the Reserves or National Guard. In other words, they \nwill have expedited naturalization during times of war or hostile \nmilitary operations.\n  This Nation has long reserved the Congressional Medal of Honor for \nthose select war heroes of unsurpassed courage. It is our highest honor \nand our greatest praise--and one out of every five recipients of this \nhonor have been immigrants. This accounting of the bravery and spirit \nof the immigrants in our Armed Forces speaks to the fact that they are \nas dedicated and as willing to sacrifice on our Nation's behalf.\n  The Naturalization and Family Protection for Military Members Act is \nan important piece of legislation that both honors and rewards \nimmigrants to this Nation. They are already legal permanent residents--\nthis simply ensures that they have the opportunity to truly become a \npart of this country through citizenship. I urge the Senate to give its \nfull consideration to this bill and to lend its support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Reed, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Harkin, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 923. A bill to provide for additional weeks of temporary extended \nunemployment compensation, to provide for a program of temporary \nenhanced regular unemployment compensation, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The economy continues to falter. Hundreds of thousands \nof hard-working men and women have lost their jobs, and consumer \nconfidence is the lowest in 9 years. Americans are suffering. College \ngraduates can't find jobs. Americans who have worked all their lives \nare out of work. Their unemployment benefits are running out. They are \nlosing their savings, and watching their 401(k) plans plummet. They are \nbeing forced to take desperate measures--selling their homes, moving \nback in with their parents, or cashing in their retirement savings.\n  Our first domestic priority should be to get America back to work. \nDemocrats have a plan to do just that. The Senate Democratic proposal \nfor economic growth will create more than 1 million jobs next year, \nthree times as many as President Bush's plan. It will provide fiscal \nrelief to states to avoid further lay-offs and make vital investments \nin the economy to achieve growth.\n  But out-of-work Americans also need help and they need it now. The \nEconomic Security Act I am introducing today will extend temporary \nFederal unemployment benefits for 6 months past the May expiration \ndate. It will provide additional weeks of benefits as in past \nrecessions and provide extended benefits to the more than 1 million \nAmericans who have run out of benefits but still cannot find work. It \nwill also give states the option to use Federal funds to extend \ncoverage to part-time workers and low-wage workers. This bill will help \nmore than 4 million workers, including 150,000 in Massachusetts.\n  The unemployment rate remains high at 5.8 percent, with 8.4 million \nAmericans out of work, and those numbers don't include discouraged \nworkers, who have dropped out of the labor force, or those working \npart-time because they can't find a full-time job. When these workers \nare included, the true unemployment rate is 10.4 percent.\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\n  Over the last two months, the economy has lost nearly half a million \njobs. More than 330,000 jobs have been lost in Massachusetts, including \n20,000 in Boston and 23,000 in Worcester. Such severe, persistent loss \nof jobs 2 years after the beginning of a recession is unheard of since \nthe Great Depression.\n  Richard Wilcox of Canton, MA has taken to standing on a street corner \nholding up a sign that says ``I need a job . . . 36 years experience: \nInsurance/Management.'' Thirty-six years of experience, and he has had \nonly two interviews after a year of sending out hundreds of resumes.\n  Mr. Wilcox is not alone. The crisis in our labor market has continued \nto worsen under the current administration's watch. Two and a half \nmillion more Americans have lost their jobs since the Bush \nadministration took office, and the number of long-term unemployed has \nnearly tripled.\n  The economy is still not showing clear signs of recovery, and the \nnumber of unemployed continues to grow. The administration's own budget \npredicts an average of 5.7 percent unemployment for this year. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that it will be 5.9 percent.\n  In this bleak condition, unemployed workers deserve to be able to \ncount on a further extension of benefits when the current one expires \nat the end of May. In the last recession, we enacted an extension of \nbenefits five times with overwhelming bipartisan support. Now as then, \nout-of-work Americans need our help.\n  In the last recession we also made sure that workers who ran out of \nFederal benefits but still could not find work were not left in the \ncold. Today, one in five unemployed workers has been out of work for \nmore than 6 months. One million of these long-term unemployed are \nwithout jobs and without any safety net. With three unemployed workers \nvying for every job, workers across the county are losing hope.\n  The current unemployment insurance system clearly needs to be \nmodernized to cover today's workers. Two glaring defects stand out. In \n1975, 75 percent of unemployed workers were eligible for unemployment \nbenefits, compared to only half of such workers last year. Many of the \nunemployed who fail to receive benefits are part-time and low-wage \nworkers. Only eight States provide benefits to unemployed residents \nseeking part-time work on the same basis as the benefits they provide \nto full-time workers. In addition, in all but a handful of States, low-\nwage workers are ineligible for benefits because their most recent \nearnings are not counted. Part-time and low-wage workers pay into the \nsystem, and they should be able to rely on it while searching for a new \njob.\n  We must pass another extension of unemployment benefits before the \ncurrent one expires at the end of May. We must not allow a repeat of \nlast year, when Democrats asked eight times for an extension and eight \ntimes were told no. Ultimately, we were able to work on a bipartisan \nbasis to provide benefits for out-of-work Americans, and I hope we can \ndo so again this time. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nsee that Americans here at home who've been hit by these troubled \neconomic times receive the support they need and deserve.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of The \nUnemployment Benefits Extension Act of which I am a proud cosponsor. \nThe purpose of this bill is to extend the Temporary Extended \nUnemployment Compensation, TEUC, program, for an additional 6 months \nthrough the end of November. Currently, extended umeployment insurance \nbenefits are scheduled to expire at the end of May. Beginning June \nfirst, individuals whose regular unemployment benefits expire will no \nlonger be eligible for extended benefits.\n  Extending the existing unemployment insurance benefits program for an \nadditional 6 months is estimated to provide assistance to between 2 to \n2.5 million working Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault \nof their own. This legislation also provides an additional 13 weeks of \nbenefits to unemployed workers who have already exhausted their \nextended benefits prior to enactment and remain unable to find work. \nThe bill also provides tempory Federal funding, through July 2004, for \nStates to implement alternative base periods, which could a worker's \nmost recent wages when determining eligibility, and to allow displaced \npart-income workers to seek part-time employment while receiving \nunemployment insurance workers. Improving the unemployment insurance \nsystem for part-time workers is important. A recent op-ed in the \nBaltimore Sun makes the point that:\n\n       The old rationale for excluding part-time workers from \n     unemployment insurance eligibility was that part-time workers \n     were not working to support their families. But this is not \n     true today.\n\n  I am convinced that we are going to still be in very difficult shape \nwhen the current extension of unemployment insurance benefits expires \nat the end of May. There is little chance that the labor market will \nsignificantly improve for unemployed workers between now and then. \nThere is growing evidence that the labor market is still in fact \ndeteriorating. The Federal Open Markets Committee's most recent \nstatement on interest rates concluded that, ``recent labor market \nindicators have proven disappointing.''\n  That is an understatement. Last month the economy lost 108,000 jobs \nin addition to losing 357,000 jobs in February. There are 1.8 million \nworkers who have been out of work for more than 26 weeks and are \nlooking for work but cannot find a job. The unemployment rate at 5.8 \npercent is higher today than when extended benefits were first enacted \nin March, 2002. Over 3.48 million Americans are currently drawing \nunemployment benefits. We have lost 2.6 million private sector jobs \nsince President Bush took office. No President in over 50 years has \nfailed to create jobs during a 4-year term in office, let alone lose \njobs during an administration. But it would take private sector job \ncreation of over 100,000 per month, every month, for the next 2 years, \nin order for the economy to dig out of the jobs deficit created during \nthis administration.\n\n  Yet instead of abandoning the economic policies which have failed, \nthe administration continues to pursue the same fundamental policy--\nlarge tax cuts which primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans. The \nadministration, whose budget contained nothing to further extend the \nunemployment benefits program, remains out of touch with today's \neconomic realities. Over 8.5 million Americans are unemployed and \nlooking for work but cannot find a job because there are no jobs to be \nhad. In situations like this the Congress has always provided extended \nunemployment benefits. In the last recession these benefits were \nprovided for 29 months. During the recession before that, they lasted \nfor 33 months. In both of those recessions extended benefits were \ndiscontinued only after a pronounced strengthening in the labor market.\n  Today these benefits are set to expire after only 15 months, well \nbefore the labor market has improved. If this happens it will mark not \nonly a departure from prudent fiscal policy that has been implemented \nin a bipartisan fashion in the past but will also harm economic growth \nand hurt millions of Americans. Extended unemployment insurance \nbenefits, already enacted by the Congress, have assisted 4.7 million \nworkers and provided $12 billion of stimulus into the economy. Federal \nReserve Chairman Greenspan has testified that, ``extended unemployment \ninsurance provided a timely boost to disposable income.''\n  This legislation also allows for all Americans who qualify to receive \nan additional 13 weeks of benefits. This would include the 1 million \nworkers who have already exhausted their extended benefits. These \nworkers need help. They want to find work but cannot find a job because \nthere are simply no jobs to be had.\n  I know that some of my colleagues oppose providing extended benefits \nfor more than 13 weeks to anyone. I have a differing viewpoint. I point \nout that at this stage of the last recession, a minimum of 20 weeks of \nadditional Federal benefits were provided for all Americans in every \nState. In the previous recession and jobless recovery extended \nunemployment insurance benefits lasted for 29 months and for much of \nthat time provided benefits for 26 to 33 weeks. In this recession and \njobless recovery, benefits are scheduled to expire only after 15 months \nand have provided only 13 weeks of extended benefits to the vast \nmajority of Americans.\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\n  Under normal circumstances with a growing labor market there is a \ncase to be made that providing too long of a duration of unemployment \ninsurance benefits would be harmful. However, in times when the labor \nmarket is weak and the job base is shrinking, the situation is very \ndifferent. Even Fed Chairman Greenspan acknowledged this in testimony \nbefore the Joint Economic Committee, stating: ``in periods like this [a \nshrinking labor market], that the economic restraints on the \nunemployment insurance system almost surely ought to be eased.'' \nUnfortunately, many are forecasting continued weaknesses in the labor \nmarket.\n  Today's Washington Post reports that the International Monetary Fund \nis forecasting economic growth of only 2.2 percent for the United \nStates in 2003, which the IMF's chief economist, Kenneth Rogoff noted \nis ``not yet enough to make a meaningful dent in unemployment.'' The \narticle goes on to state that: ``the jobless rate stood last month at \n5.8 percent, and the IMF projected that it will average 6.2 percent \nthis year.'' Considering the weak labor market that we face today and \nthe troubling forecasts for the remainder of the year, it appears to me \nthat we most certainly are in such a period as described by Chairman \nGreenspan and that the restraints on the unemployment insurance system \nought to be eased. This legislation accomplishes this goal in a \nfiscally responsible manner with an estimated cost of $16 billion, \nwhich is below the unemployment insurance trust funds current surplus \nof $20 billion.\n  Last year this issue was not properly dealt with, and as a result \nmillions of Americans suffered through the holiday season believing \nthat their benefits were going to expire. Yet when Congress reconvened, \nextended benefits were retroactively restored, 11 days after they had \nexpired. Let's not put these people through this again. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and to work expeditiously and \nprudently to enact it before the current program expires, less than 8 \nweeks from today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 924. A bill to authorize the exchange of lands between an Alaska \nNative Village Corporation and the Department of the Interior, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak \nabout a small community in the southwestern part of my State of Alaska.\n  Newtok, a Village with about 300 Yupik Alaska Native residents, is \nlocated in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta near the Ninglick River. Erosion \nfrom the Ninglick is slowly threatening Newtok, and the Village will be \nunder water in less than a decade and the Village airstrip in less \ntime. Once the Village airstrip--Newtok's only connection with the \noutside world--is flooded, the Village will not be able to survive.\n  The Village is surrounded by land owned by the Federal Government in \nthe Yukon Delta Wildlife Refuge. In 1997 the Newtok Native Corporation \nattempted to exchange land on higher ground with the Fish and Wildlife \nService, administratively, but these negotiations failed. Therefore, \naction by Congress is required to ensure the future of Newtok and its \nresidents.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to begin the process of moving \nNewtok to a location that is not threatened by erosion or flooding. The \nNewtok Native Corporation has identified a 10,943 acre tract of land on \nNelson Island for the location of the new Village. Newtok Native \nCorporation is willing to accept this land in the Yukon Delta Wildlife \nRefuge from the Fish and Wildlife Service in exchange for a 996 acre \npiece of land on Baird Inlet Island and another 11,105 acre plot \nnortheast of the present location of Newtok.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service desires the Newtok owned land for \necological reasons and Newtok needs the Federal land because of its \ngeology that keeps it safe from erosion. Both parties win in this \nexchange; the Federal Government improves the Yukon Delta Wildlife \nRefuge for the benefit of the American people, and villagers of Newtok \nhave the opportunity to move to a safe location and see that their \nculture and community endure.\n  Newtok needs to be moved before it is too late, and my bill is an \nimportant first step in the process of protecting this community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) The continued existence of the village of Newtok, \n     Alaska is threatened by the eroding banks of the Ninglick \n     River.\n       (2) A relocation of the village will become necessary for \n     the health and safety of the residents of Newtok within the \n     next 8 years.\n       (3) Lands previously conveyed to the Newtok Native \n     Corporation contain habitat of high value for waterfowl.\n       (4) An opportunity exists for an exchange of lands between \n     the Newtok Native Corporation and the Yukon Delta National \n     Wildlife Refuge that would address the relocation needs of \n     the village while enhancing the quality of waterfowl habitat \n     within the boundaries of the Refuge.\n       (5) An exchange of lands between Newtok and the United \n     States on an other than equal value basis pursuant to the \n     terms of this Act is in the public interest.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Consistent with section 103(c) of ANILCA, \n     these lands shall not be deemed to be included as a portion \n     of the Yukon National Wildlife Refuge and shall not be \n     subject to regulations applicable solely to public lands \n     within this Conservation System Unit.\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\n       (c) Effect on Entitlement.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to change the total acreage of land to which Newtok \n     is entitled under ANCSA.\n       (d) Effect on Newtok Lands.--The Newtok Lands shall be \n     included in the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge as of \n     the date of acceptance of the conveyance of those lands from \n     Newtok, except that residents of the Village of Newtok, \n     Alaska, shall retain access rights to subsistence resources \n     on those public lands as guaranteed under ANILCA section 811 \n     (16 U.S.C. 3121), and to subsistence uses, such as \n     traditional subsistence fishing, hunting and gathering, \n     consistent with ANILCA section 803 (16 U.S.C. 3113).\n       (e) Adjustment to Calista Corporation ANCSA Entitlement for \n     Relinquished Newtok Selections.--To the extent that Calista \n     subsurface rights are affected by this Act, Calista shall be \n     entitled to an equivalent acreage of in-lieu subsurface \n     entitlement for the Newtok selections relinquished in the \n     exchange as set forth in subsection 3(a) of this Act. This \n     additional entitlement shall come from subsurface lands \n     already selected by Calista, but which have not been \n     conveyed.

Res. 12. A joint resolution recognizing the Dr. Samuel D. Harris \nNational Museum of Dentistry located at 31 South Greene Street in \nBaltimore, Maryland, as the official national museum of dentistry in \nthe United States; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with Senator Mikulski, to recognize the Dr. Samuel D. Harris \nNational Museum of Dentistry, in Baltimore, as the official national \nmuseum of dentistry in the United States.\n  The principal purpose of this legislation is to help educate the \npublic about the critical importance of oral health to the overall \nhealth of all Americans. Three years ago, United States Surgeon General \nDavid Satcher issued a comprehensive report entitled ``Oral Health in \nAmerica,'' which identified the problem of dental and oral disease as a \n``silent epidemic'' facing the country. The report found that tooth \ndecay is the most common chronic childhood disease, which often \ninterferes with vital functions such as eating, swallowing, and speech. \nChildren around the country miss an estimated 51 million hours of \nschool each year due to dental illness. Despite Federal law mandating \nthat children eligible for Medicaid be given access to dental services, \nfewer than one in five of these children actually receive dental care. \nIn addition, close to one in four Americans between the ages of 65 and \n74 were found to suffer from periodontal disease, and over 8,000 men \nand women die from oral and pharyngeal cancers each year.\n  The report called for the development of a National Oral Health Plan, \nand recommended that actions be taken to ``change perceptions regarding \noral health and disease so that oral health becomes an accepted \ncomponent of general health.'' By designating an official national \nmuseum and learning center dedicated to dentistry, this legislation \ntakes an important step toward the achievement of this goal.\n  The Dr. Samuel D. Harris National museum of Dentistry is the largest \nand most comprehensive museum of dentistry in this country, and, \nindeed, the world. An affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, the \nMuseum sits on the grounds of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, \nfounded in 1840 as the world's first dental college. Many of the \nmuseum's permanent exhibits come directly from the College's vast \nhistorical collections. Housed in a building that served as the \nUniversity of Maryland Dental Department from 1904 to 1929, the Museum \nis located directly adjacent to historic Davidge Hall, the Western \nHemisphere's oldest medical building in continuous use.\n  In 1992, a retired pediatric dentist, Dr. Samuel D. Harris of \nDetroit, contributed $1 million of his personal funds toward the \ndevelopment of the Museum. He has since made further considerable gifts \nto the Museum's endowment, reaffirming his belief that education is the \nhallmark of preventive oral care. The Museum's name honors both his \ngenerosity and his mission.\n  With over 7,000 square feet of exhibit space, the Museum showcases \nthe people, objects, and events that created and defined the dental \nprofession, including one of George Washington's famed ivory dentures. \nThe Museum's vast archives also act as an important resource for \nresearch and serious academic study of dentistry's past, with a unique \ncollection of historical dental journals and other one-of-a-kind \ndocuments. Included in these collections are the first known dental \ndegree and dental license.\n  While its informative presentation of dentistry's history constitutes \nan important part of the Museum's exhibitions, its mission extends much \nfurther, with the ultimate goal of educating the public about the \ncritical importance of oral health. The Museum's interactive exhibits \nmake it particularly effective in this regard, and over 26,000 students \nhave benefited from the Museum's vigorous educational programs since \nits opening in 1996.\n  By designating the Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry as \nthe official national museum of dentistry, we will not only recognize \nthe critical role that dentists and oral health professionals have \nplayed in the history of our Nation's health care system, but enhance \nawareness and understanding of the importance of dentistry to public \nhealth.\n  The Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry has been endorsed \nby the American Dental Association, the American Association of Dental \nSchools, Oral Health America, the Pierre Fauchard Academy, the American \nCollege of Dentists, the International College of Dentists, and the \nAmerican Academy of the History of Dentistry. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of a letter from the American Dental Association in \nsupport of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   American Dental Association\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the 147,000 members of \n     the American Dental Association, we write to express our \n     strong support for your resolution to recognize the Dr. \n     Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry, located in \n     Baltimore, Maryland, as the official national museum of \n     dentistry in the United States.\n       As the most comprehensive dental museum in the world, it is \n     a national and international resource whose primary mission \n     is to educate people, especially children, about the history \n     of dentistry and the importance of good oral hygiene. The \n     museum uses state-of-the-art, interactive exhibitions and \n     expert presentations to deliver the message that oral health \n     is important to achieve overall health. Currently, the museum \n     is displaying an exhibit entitled, ``The Future is Now! \n     African Americans in Dentistry.''\n       The museum is affiliated with the University of Maryland at \n     Baltimore, home of the world's first dental school, founded \n     in 1840. it contains hundreds of interesting and significant \n     dental artifacts, not the least of which is George \n     Washington's dentures. It also serves as a national center of \n     learning with an extensive library from which scholars may \n     study the evolution of dental treatment and learn of the \n     numerous accomplishments of the dental profession over the \n     years.\n       The museum is endorsed by the American Dental Association, \n     National Dental Association, American Dental Education \n     Association, American College of Dentists, International \n     College of Dentists, and the American Academy of the History \n     of Dentistry among others.\n       Thank you for recognizing the museum, which is truly a \n     national treasure.\n           Sincerely,\n     T.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to H.R. 1770, which is being held at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1770) to provide benefits and other \n     compensation for certain individuals with injuries resulting \n     from administration of smallpox countermeasures, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nSmallpox Compensation Act of 2003.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senator Judd Gregg, the distinguished \nChairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He \nhas done a tremendous benefit for the Nation through this critical \nlegislation when there is such great need to improve our public health \npreparedness.\n  I commend Senator Edward Kennedy for his efforts to achieve \nbipartisan consensus on the smallpox legislation we are considering \ntoday. I also thank all of the members of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, and for the work of Representatives \nBilly Tauzin and John Dingell for their efforts to develop and pass \nthis legislation.\n  Finally, the President of the United States deserves great credit for \nworking to ensure that America is prepared against the threat of \nbioterrorism, and that the Nation's healthcare workers, first \nresponders, and their families are protected from adverse affects that \nmay result from smallpox vaccinations. Without President Bush's \ncommitment, we could not have reached this critical agreement.\n  We know the grave danger that a smallpox attack poses. Smallpox is \none of the deadliest diseases known to man. Health experts, the Federal \nGovernment, and State and local health entities continue to address the \nsmallpox threat, including the development of a long-term immunization \nplan.\n  The administration has taken great steps to meet this threat by \nsetting forth an immunization plan for our Nation's healthcare workers \nand first responders.\n  However, too many healthcare workers have been deterred from \nreceiving the smallpox vaccine--in part because of uncertainties about \nwhat would happen, and how they would provide for themselves, if they \nsuffered a serious adverse reaction to the vaccine.\n  This legislation helps to respond to that fear. It makes clear that \nadequate compensation will be available if an individual becomes ill or \ndies as a result of receiving the smallpox vaccine.\n  Passing this legislation will help strengthen President Bush's plan \nto vaccinate healthcare workers, public health officials and first \nresponders--a vaccination strategy that is vital to our national \nsecurity.\n  This legislation is part of a long-term strategy. We must continue to \nwork to ensure appropriate liability and compensation measures for \nfuture countermeasures, as well as strong communications, surveillance, \ncapacity-building and research efforts to strengthen our overall public \nhealth infrastructure to respond to emerging public health threats.\n  Indeed, this is not purely a public health issue; it is also an issue \nof national security. We must ensure that an adequate number of \nhealthcare workers and first responders are vaccinated in order to \nprotect the American people should smallpox be used as an offensive \nweapon. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, NIH, \nhas noted, in fact, that we would have perhaps only 2-3 days to \nvaccinate exposed individuals and prevent death in the event of an \noutbreak. This task would be nearly impossible without having an \nadequate number of individuals vaccinated prior to an outbreak.\n  While the risk of a smallpox attack is not necessarily high, the risk \nis real.\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\nAnd the results could be devastating. They would surely be even more \ndevastating without having enough people vaccinated before an outbreak. \nSo we need to act here, and we need to act quickly.\n  In addition, we also must act in the coming weeks to pass the \nPresident's Project Bioshield Act of 2003 and legislation to improve \nour overall vaccine liability system. These are also critical longer \nterm steps in rebuilding our defenses against infectious disease \noutbreaks, whether naturally-occurring or as a result of the use of \noffensive use of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Again, I commend the President, Chairman Gregg, Senator Kennedy, and \nall of my colleagues, who have worked to craft this bipartisan \nlegislation. I am very pleased to support this legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, with a mortality rate of over 30 percent, \nsmallpox was one of the world's most feared diseases until a \ncollaborative global vaccination program eradicated the disease in the \n1970s. Smallpox no longer occurs naturally, and today can only be found \nin laboratories in the United States and Russia. Or so we believe. With \nthe fall of the Soviet Union, some in the intelligence community are \nconcerned that samples of the virus may have found its way to other \ncountries, including Iraq. This is of grave concern to our Nation and \nthe entire global community. Highly contagious and easily dispersed in \nthe air, smallpox virus can be a deadly weapon in terrorist hands.\n  Congress and the administration have responded to this potential \nthreat by authorizing the purchase of approximately 300 million doses \nof smallpox vaccine, enough for every man, woman, and child in America. \nEqually important, the administration developed a plan to respond in \nthe event of an outbreak of the disease. Since the administration \nlaunched its smallpox vaccination plan on January 24, 2003, over 30,000 \nhealth care workers have been inoculated. To adequately prepare our \nNation for the possibility of such an attack, however, more health care \nproviders must be immunized. Additionally, it is critical that we begin \nvaccinating other emergency personnel, such as law enforcement \nofficers, firefighters, and paramedics.\n  However, confusion as to the threat posed by the smallpox virus and \nconcerns about the safety and potential side-effects of the vaccine, as \nwell as the availability of compensation for any vaccine-related \ninjuries, have impeded the program's progress. Although severe adverse \nreactions to the smallpox vaccine are very rare, we must ensure that \nhealth care and emergency workers who suffer such reactions receive \nappropriate medical care and compensation. Moreover, since the smallpox \nvaccine is made up of a live virus, we must also provide protection to \nany family members, patients, and others who are accidentally infected \nby these inoculated workers.\n  That is why I introduced the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection \nAct of 2003 (S. 313), which I chair. The bill before us reflects the \nbipartisan agreement that was reached after many weeks of hard work and \nlong discussions with Republicans, Democrats, and the White House on \nthis legislation.\n  The Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act would create a ``no \nfault'' system to compensate vaccinated health care and emergency \nworkers injured by the smallpox vaccine and other smallpox \ncountermeasures, including any persons who accidentally contract \nsmallpox from the vaccine. All persons experiencing any adverse events \nfrom the smallpox vaccine would be reimbursed for all reasonable \nnecessary medical expenses and be compensated for lost wages.\n  In the rare event of death, the victim's family would receive a \n$262,100 lump-sum benefit payment. If there are any surviving children, \nthen the family would have the option of receiving either the lump-sum \nor a $50,000 annual death benefit payment until the children become 18 \nyears of age.\n  Those who become permanently and totally disabled as a result of the \nvaccine could receive up to $50,000 annually in lost wages. Those who \nare temporarily disabled could receive up to $50,000 annually in lost \nwages, up to a lifetime total of $262,100. No such lifetime limit would \napply in the case of permanent and total disability.\n  While those harmed by the smallpox vaccine retain the right to sue \nthe federal government for negligence, all vaccine related claims must \nfirst go through the compensation program. Finally, the legislation \nincludes some clarifications of section 304 of the Homeland Security \nAct, to ensure that providers, such as hospitals, doctors, nurses, and \npublic healthcare workers, are protected from personal liability in the \nadministration of the smallpox vaccine and in caring for infected \npersons.\n  The Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act is an important \nelement of our national smallpox vaccination program that will help \nensure its timely implementation. I do hope that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services will carry out the smallpox vaccination \nprogram in a manner that appropriately monitors and evaluates newly \nproposed technologies, devices, and other elements of the program, in \norder to assure the safest route of administration. To this end, I \nanticipate that the Secretary will review periodically for possible \ninclusion under the program new and modified technologies, tasks, and \nprocedures that may reduce the risks and increase the safety of the \nprogram and its administration. I understand that the Secretary will \ncontinue to engage in dialogue with the affected parties and to ensure \nthe safe and effective administration of the smallpox vaccine.\n  Our Nation's healthcare and emergency workers will be on the front \nline in responding to any smallpox attack. Now, more than ever, we need \nto provide piece-of-mind and security to healthcare and emergency \nworkers who volunteer to be vaccinated. This compensation package will \ngive these workers the confidence they need to proceed with \nvaccinations. It is imperative that Congress pass the Smallpox \nEmergency Personnel Protection Act as swiftly as possible, so that we \ncan ensure that our healthcare and emergency workers and their families \nare protected and that this country is prepared to respond in the event \nof an attack.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, America faces a crisis because of our \nlack of preparedness for a bioterrorist attack. For months, we've \nworked to develop a fair, reasonable package to end this crisis. Today, \nwe can finally say that we have an agreement, and I commend Senator \nGregg, Senator Frist, Senator Mikulski and all our colleagues on the \nHealth Committee for all they've done.\n  I also thank the many representatives of nurses and other health \nproviders, police officers and fire fighters for working with all of us \nto create a fair compensation program. We have come a long way and \nwe're grateful for their intense commitment to this urgent challenge.\n  Smallpox is one of the cruelest, most contagious, and deadliest \ndiseases ever known. Modern medicine has eradicated this disease in \nnature, but unfortunately is has been preserved as a weapon of war. The \nformer Soviet Union weaponized the deadly virus--and control over these \ndangerous biological materials is often weak. Other nations probably \nhave stocks of the virus--and none of us can be sure that the virus \nwon't find its way into the hands of a terrorist.\n  If we remain unprepared, an attack with smallpox could kill vast \nnumbers of Americans. Smallpox is deadlier than tanks, or bombs. It is \nmore lethal than machine guns or rocket-propelled grenades. It \nthreatens the security of every American. We can and must protect our \ncountry against the use of smallpox as a weapon.\n  Vaccination provides almost complete protection against the disease--\nbut the protection can come at a high price in some cases. For an \nunfortunate few, it can cause serious side effects such as \nencephalitis, blindness or severe infections. Recent deaths after the \nvaccination of civilian and military personnel have raised concern that \nthe vaccine may cause heart attacks. The number of people who \nexperience these devastating effects is small, so the cost of meeting \ntheir needs will not be great. But the failure to meet their needs can \nbe devastating for them, and devastating for the overall preparedness \neffort.\n  At long last, after many negotiations, we can now say that the \nnation's first responders will have an effective compensation program. \nThey deserve it and our nation's security demands it.\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\n  The agreement we have reached ensures that those who participate in \nthe vaccination program will receive fair compensation if they suffer \nside effects from the vaccine. The compensation package is \nsignificantly more generous than the original proposal. Workers who are \npermanently and totally disabled will receive two thirds of their lost \nwages--three quarters if they have dependents--up to $50,000 a year, \nwith no lifetime cap on those benefits. Workers who are temporarily or \npartially disabled will receive the same benefit, but with a lifetime \ncap of $262,100--the same cap as for firefighters and police officers. \nThe children of anyone who dies as a result of vaccination will be \neligible for the same benefits as those with permanent and total \ndisability until they reach 18 years of age.\n  The intent of the bill is that these benefits should be exempt from \ntaxation, as in other worker compensation programs, including the \nPublic Safety Officers Benefit program. The intent is also that these \nbenefits be indexed for inflation.\n  The benefits in this plan will go further than in the original plan \nin improving the health of those who are injured. Instead of limiting \nbenefits to medical services and items needed only for immediate \ntreatment of injury, the plan covers a wider range of medical needs \nincluding rehabilitative care and palliative care.\n  Our agreement also takes the important step of extending eligibility \nfor compensation to all workers called upon to receive the vaccine. \nThere are no deadlines to coerce persons into signing up for the \nprogram.\n  Thanks to the effective work of Senator Mikulski, the bill now \nincludes strong provisions to make sure that the public has adequate \ninformation about the risks of vaccination, the voluntary nature of the \nprogram, and the availability of potential benefits and compensation. \nthe bill also ensures voluntary screening for potential participants to \nidentify health conditions that could put them at risk. Medical follow-\nups will evaluate adverse health effects, and effective screening and \ncounselling will reduce them.\n  So far, the vaccination plan is faltering. Only a small fraction of \nthose who we rely on to protect us--the men and women in our hospitals \nand fire departments and police departments--have been willing to have \nsmallpox vaccinations. They know the risks, and they worry that if they \nare injured or killed by the vaccine, they and their families will not \nbe compensated adequately.\n  That is why it is so important to guarantee help for persons no \nlonger able to work as a result of reactions to the smallpox vaccine, \nand to guarantee that their children have financial security as well.\n  Under certain circumstances, those who have been vaccinated can \nspread the virus used in the vaccine to others and cause them to become \nill. Recently, concerns about the safety of the vaccine were raised by \ntwo heart attack deaths among the 31,000 civilians who have been \nvaccinated, and one heart attack death among the 300,000 military \npersonnel who have been vaccinated. Five other civilians suffered heart \nattacks that were not fatal. No one knows whether the heart attacks \nwere the result of the vaccine--but they have added new concern about \nthe vaccination.\n  This agreement is a major step forward. We still have far more to do \nto be fully prepared for bioterrorist attacks, but this agreement is a \nmajor step forward against what could well be the worst of all \nterrorist attacks, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

Res. 37\n\n       Whereas on the evening of April 18, 1775, Paul Revere was \n     sent for by Dr. Joseph Warren and instructed to ride to \n     Lexington, Massachusetts, to warn Samuel Adams and John \n     Hancock that British troops were marching to arrest them;\n       Whereas after leaving Charlestown on his way to Lexington, \n     Paul Revere alerted the inhabitants of villages and towns \n     along his route, stopping in Medford (formerly Mystic) at the \n     home of Isaac Hall, the captain of the Medford Minutemen \n     during the Revolutionary War, before continuing on through \n     Arlington (formerly Menotomy) and arriving in Lexington \n     around midnight;\n       Whereas William Dawes and a third rider, Dr. Samuel \n     Prescott joined Paul Revere on his mission and they proceeded \n     together on horseback to Lincoln;\n       Whereas while en route they encountered a British patrol \n     that arrested Paul Revere, but William Dawes and Samuel \n     Prescott managed to escape and continued on to Concord where \n     weapons and supplies were hidden;\n       Whereas the midnight ride of Paul Revere was brilliantly \n     and forever commemorated by the great American poet Henry \n     Wadsworth Longfellow in his 1861 poem ``Paul Revere's Ride'';\n       Whereas the actions taken by Paul Revere, William Dawes, \n     and Samuel Prescott afforded the Minutemen time to assemble \n     to confront the advancing British troops and were heralded as \n     one of the first great acts of patriotism of our Nation;\n       Whereas 38 Lexington Minutemen boldly stood before 600-800 \n     British troops who had gathered at Lexington Green;\n       Whereas Captain Parker of the Lexington Minutemen commanded \n     his men, ``Don't fire unless you are fired on; but if they \n     want a war, let it begin here.'';\n       Whereas when the British continued onto Concord, a battle \n     ensued at the Old North Bridge, where Minutemen from every \n     Middlesex village and town routed the British and forced them \n     into retreat back to Boston;\n       Whereas Ralph Waldo Emerson immortalized this moment in \n     American history as where ``the embattled farmers stood and \n     fired the shot heard 'round the world.'';\n       Whereas the United States has recognized the historic \n     significance of the Nation's original patriots with the \n     creation in 1959 of the Minute Man National Historical Park, \n     located in Concord, Lincoln, and Lexington, Massachusetts, to \n     preserve and protect the numerous significant historic sites, \n     structures, properties, and landscapes associated\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\n     with the opening battles of the American Revolution, and to \n     help visitors understand and interpret the colonial struggle \n     for their rights and freedoms; and\n       Whereas the heroic acts of April 19, 1775, are celebrated \n     in Massachusetts and Maine every year as part of Patriot's \n     Day with a reenactment of Paul Revere's famous ride, battle \n     reenactments, educational programs, parades, and civic \n     activities, and remembered by Americans across the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) expresses support for the celebration of Patriot's Day;\n       (2) recognizes the extraordinary dedication to freedom \n     demonstrated by the Nation's first patriots during the \n     earliest days of the Battle for Independence in April 1775; \n     and\n       (3) honors those first patriots who lost their lives in \n     defense of liberty and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5392-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        EMERGENCY WARTIME SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2003\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nCOLLOQUY BETWEEN SENATOR SMITH AND CHAIRMAN STEVENS ON ARMY PROCUREMENT \n              OF THE CHITOSAN HEMORRHAGE CONTROL DRESSING\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to a revolutionary development in hemorrhage control which is \nexpected to save lives of American soldiers now lost due to \nuncontrolled bleeding on the battlefield.\n  According to military physicians, 90 percent of soldiers killed in \nwar die before they reach a medical facility, most often of blood loss. \nWounds to the extremities are considered the main preventable cause of \ndeath in military action.\n  Using Army funds added by Congress over the past few years to spur \nmedical technology to help our soldiers, researchers at the Oregon \nMedical Laser Center at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center in \nPortland have developed a hemorrhage control dressing made principally \nof chitosan and vinegar. Chitosan is an inexpensive material found in \nthe exoskeleton of shrimp.\n  Last fall the FDA cleared the external use of this dressing. The \napproval was expedited at the request of the Commander of the Army's \nMedical Research and Materiel Command, who wrote to the FDA, and I \nquote:\n\n       This dressing will significantly improve the ability of \n     medics to control hemorrhage from extremity wounds. As a \n     result of independent efficacy studies done at the United \n     States Army Institute of Surgical Research, we feel that the \n     Hemcon chitosan bandage is critical in our efforts to the \n     control of severe external hemorrhage in the combat \n     environment.\n\n  Subsequent to FDA clearance, this bandage was incorporated into \nmilitary medical doctrine. According to the newest draft tactical \ncombat care doctrine, ``. . . every combatant should carry both a \ntourniquet and a hemostatic dressing as part of his personal gear \nloadout, and should be trained in their use.''\n  The dressing is now being manufactured by an Oregon company, HemCon, \nunder contract to the Army. I believe the Army should make a major \ncommitment of funds to speed these bandages to our troops. I inquire of \nthe Chairman if there is sufficient flexibility in this bill for the \nArmy to purchase this dressing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleague for his inquiry and would respond \nthat we have provided billions of dollars to the Army, with knowledge \nthat there are uncertainties remaining in our action in Iraq. Certainly \nI would encourage the Army to place purchase of these bandages among \ntheir highest priorities, given the indications I have seen of the \nlives to be saved.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank my distinguished colleague, who continually shows \nhis dedication to the men and women of our armed forces. Equipping each \nof our soldiers in Iraq with this bandage would be a very positive step \nwe can take to save lives. Even if, as we all hope, the main military \nthrust of our forces in Iraq is successfully concluded in the near \nfuture, it is likely that threats from isolated but armed Iraqi \nparamilitary forces will remain in the months ahead. I would encourage \nthe Army to procure these bandages as quickly as possible to meet the \nmilitary's own goal of providing one to each soldier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5392-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5392-S5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING MICHAEL KELLY\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 121, which was \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 121) honoring the life of Washington \n     Post columnist and Atlantic Monthly editor Michael Kelly in \n     expressing deepest condolences of the Senate to his family on \n     his death.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Michael Kelly died nearly a week ago \nwhile covering the U.S. Army's Third Infantry Division's march to \nliberate Baghdad. It is difficult for me to believe that he was only 46 \nyears old. Michael Kelly's contributions to American journalism and \nAmerican politics were not the contributions of a young man but those \nof a witty, political observer whose love of his country and delight in \nthe pastime of American politics was as boundless as the American dream \nitself. Michael Kelly, so deeply committed to preserving freedom and \nliberty, should be in Baghdad right now relishing in the awakening of \nthe Iraqi people to their new lease on life, liberty, and freedom from \nfear.\n  I did not fully realize the extent of his contribution to the \nAmerican political discourse until I opened the Washington Post \nyesterday and noticed that his Wednesday column was dark. At that \nmoment, I realized how gaping a void Michael Kelly's death has left in \nthe pages of newspapers throughout the country, and in the hearts and \nminds of his countless readers.\n  He was in life, and will remain in death, an icon for all who shared \nhis interest and obvious passion for the theatre of American politics. \nHis bemused commentary and good-natured derision from the balcony of \nour political arena--and his delight in watching political virtuosi and \nvaudevillians march across the stage--place him in my book among the \ngreat political commentators of our time.\n  Although I did not know Michael Kelly, his writings reminded me of \nthe satisfaction and glory that accompanies fighting for just causes \nand deeply held beliefs, however unpopular they may be in certain \ncircles. His life and work stand as reminders of why partisanship--even \nbitter partisanship--can be often an immensely positive contribution to \nAmerican politics. Like that of my former colleague and friend, the \nlate Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Michael Kelly's style of partisanship \nmade an eloquent and thoughtful contribution to the important debates \nabout the future of our country.\n  Michael Kelly's style--witty, acerbic, curmudgeonly, and \nindependent--invited obvious comparisons to another famous American \njournalist: H.L. Mencken. Like Mencken, Kelly relished the opportunity \nto fire rhetorical grapeshot across the bow of his political \nadversaries. His refusal to mute his criticism of liberal politicians \nwhile he was serving as the editor of the left-leaning New Republic is \nreminiscent of Mencken's long-running feud with President Roosevelt. \nThere is also a superficial connection, too, as Kelly spent an early \npart of his career as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, a newspaper \nmade famous under the stewardship of its iconic reporter and editor.\n  More substantively, Michael Kelly, like Mencken, was much more than a \nnewspaperman. He was a man of letters, and a powerful political voice.\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\nKelly's most recent endeavors stand as testament to his immense \nintellect and lasting impact. His tenure as editor of The Atlantic \nMonthly has resulted in dramatic success for that venerable magazine. \nAnd for whatever informal polling is worth, I can attest that members \nof my staff routinely compete for copies of The Atlantic when they \narrive in my office mailroad each month.\n\n  He left the comfort of his editor's desk recently to join the U.S. \nArmy's Third Infantry Division as an embedded journalist. Having \ndoggedly defended the moral and security justifications for disarming \nSaddam Hussein's brutal regime, Michael Kelly risked his life to bear \nwitness to the liberation of the Iraqi people.\n  Michael Kelly was an eloquent advocate of the moral arguments for \nregime change in Iraq. Regarding the liberation of the Iraqi people, \nKelly wrote in February:\n\n       There are 24 million of them, and they have been living \n     (those who have not been slaughtered or forced into exile) \n     for decades under one of the cruelest and bloodiest tyrannies \n     on earth. It must be assumed that, being human, they would \n     prefer to be rescued from a hell where more than a million \n     lives have been sacrificed to the dreams of a megalomaniac, \n     where rape is a sanctioned instrument of state policy, and \n     where the removal of the tongue is the prescribed punishment \n     for uttering an offense against the Great Leader.\n       These people could be liberated from this horror--\n     relatively easily and quickly. There is every reason to think \n     that a U.S. invasion would swiftly vanquish the few elite \n     units that can be counted on to defend the detested Saddam \n     Hussein; and that the victory would come at the cost of a \n     few--likely hundreds, not thousands--Iraqi and American \n     lives. There is risk; and if things go terribly wrong it is a \n     risk that could result in terrible suffering. But that is an \n     equation that is present in any just war, and in this case \n     any rational expectation has to consider the probable cost to \n     humanity to be low and the probable benefit to be tremendous. \n     To choose perpetuation of tyranny over rescue from tyranny, \n     where rescue may be achieved, is immoral.\n\n  His predictions have proven accurate, and it is a heartbreaking \ntragedy that he did not survive the march to Baghdad, where he would \nhave witnessed a new birth of freedom in a land strangled for so long \nby tyranny and oppression.\n  Michael Kelly is survived by his wife, Madelyn, his young sons Tom \nand Jack--whose endeavors he recorded lovingly and amusingly in his \ncolumns--and his parents, Thomas and Marguerite Kelly. My prayers and \ndeepest condolences go out to them for their loss.\n  So today I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Michael \nKelly's life and recognizing his lasting contribution to the twin \nworlds of American journalism and American politics. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this resolution\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to this \nmatter appear in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This special recognition of children \nwill provide us with an opportunity to reflect on our future, \narticulate our dreams and aspirations, and find comfort and security in \nthe support of our family members and communities. This resolution \ncalls on the American people to join with all children, families, \norganizations, communities, churches, cities, and States across the \nNation to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting America's youth by supporting \nthis resolution designating April 30, 2003, Dia De los Ninos: \nCelebrating Young Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5394-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE LABORERS' \n                  INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 36, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Daschle, Frist, Hagel, Johnson, and Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 36) expressing the \n     sense of the Congress regarding the blue star service banner \n     and the gold star.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, today I join with my colleague, Senator \nHagel, to urge adoption of a Senate concurrent resolution on behalf of \nour troops and their families. Specifically, the resolution encourages \nfamilies of military personnel to display the Blue Star Service Banner, \na tradition dating back to World War I. The Blue Star Service Banner \nindicates that a loved one is serving our country in the active duty \nmilitary, and honors their devotion and sacrifice.\n  The Blue Star Service Banner has its origins in World War I, when \nmothers of soldiers often sewed blue stars onto white flags by hand, in \norder to express their love, pride, and concern for their sons serving \nabroad. The practice was widespread throughout the two World Wars, \ncoming to serve not only as a symbol of pride but also as a reminder to \nour Nation's citizens of their call to support the war effort. The \nflying flag urged civilians to remember their commitment to ration gas \nand food, to buy war bonds, or to work in the factories producing much-\nneeded materials, all in support of the brave men who were placing \ntheir lives on the line in defense of our country.\n  Today, as a new generation of brave men and women faces grave \npersonal risk on the front lines of Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nOperation Enduring Freedom, let us renew this time-honored tradition \nand again hoist flags in support of our troops. Let the families of \nthese men and women display their love, pride, and concern for their \nloved ones, who have made such tremendous commitments to our country. \nAnd let these flags remind American citizens of the ways we can support \nour troops' efforts abroad: by expressing our gratitude, by making \npersonal sacrifices through donations or volunteer efforts, and by \ncontinuing to demonstrate liberty and democracy to the world through \nvigorous debate and civic participation in the institutions that make \nour country great.\n  Our Nation's active-duty military now consists of more than a million \nmen and women, supported by even more families and households, and I \nintroduce this bill today out of respect and solidarity with them all. \nIn particular, I would like to pay tribute to my colleague from South \nDakota, Senator Tim Johnson, who is Congress' only ``Blue Star \nParent.'' As you might imagine, given our relationship, I am \nparticularly well acquainted with this family and their son, Brooks, a \nsergeant in the Army's 101st Airborne Division, now engaged in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Thank you, Barbara and Tim Johnson, and thank \nyou, Brooks, for your contribution to our nation's security.\n  As images of the conflict in Iraq fill up our television screens and \nnewspapers, many Americans feel helpless and distant, and we long for a \nway to support our troops. The Blue Star Service Banner allows military \nfamilies to demonstrate their support, their pride, and their concern \nfor the young men and women who serve our nation with such dedication. \nI urge you to support the passage of this important resolution and to \njoin with me in calling upon the military families among your \nconstituents to fly the Blue Star flag high and proudly.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent the concurrent resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable en bloc, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 36) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 36\n\n       Whereas the Blue Star Service Banner was patented and \n     designed in 1917, during the height of the First World War, \n     by Army Captain Robert L. Queissner of the 5th Ohio Infantry, \n     who had two sons serving on the front lines;\n       Whereas the banner quickly became the symbol for a family \n     member serving the Nation and families began proudly \n     displaying these banners in their front windows during the \n     First World War;\n       Whereas each Blue Star on the banner represents a family \n     member serving in the Armed Services and symbolizes hope and \n     pride;\n       Whereas beginning in 1918, the Blue Star would signify the \n     living, and a smaller Gold Star would be placed on top of the \n     Blue Star, forming a blue border, if the family member was \n     killed or died while on active duty, to symbolize his or her \n     sacrifice for the cause of freedom;\n       Whereas the placement of a Gold Star on top of a Blue Star \n     recognizes that those who served together and came home, as \n     well as their families, will always remember the sacrifice of \n     those who died and honor their families;\n       Whereas the banners were displayed widely during the Second \n     World War;\n       Whereas many of the banners displayed during the First and \n     Second World Wars were hand-made by the mothers of those \n     serving in the Armed Forces;\n       Whereas the legacy of the banner continued during the \n     Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf Wars and other periods of \n     conflict, as well as in times of peace;\n       Whereas the Blue Star Service Banner is the official banner \n     authorized by law to be displayed in honor of a family member \n     serving the United States, while the Gold Star may be \n     displayed in honor of a family member who has made the \n     ultimate sacrifice for the Nation;\n       Whereas for over 85 years, families have proudly displayed \n     the Blue Star Service Banner showing service men and women \n     the honor and pride that is taken in their sacrifices for \n     freedom;\n       Whereas the banner may be displayed by members of the \n     immediate family of a loved one serving in the Armed Forces, \n     including active duty service in a unit of the National \n     Guard, Merchant Marine, or the Reserves;\n       Whereas the banner may be flown by families with a service \n     member stationed either domestically or overseas;\n       Whereas the display of the banner in the front window of a \n     home shows a family's pride in their loved one and is a \n     reminder that preserving America's freedom demands great \n     sacrifice; and\n       Whereas this reminder is especially timely during the \n     current conflict with Iraq and the war on terrorism: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) calls on all Americans to honor the men and women of \n     the United States Armed Forces and their families;\n       (2) honors the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces and their families;\n       (3) encourages these families to proudly display the Blue \n     Star Service Banner or, if their loved one has made the \n     ultimate sacrifice, the Gold Star; and\n       (4) calls on the media to recognize the importance of the \n     Blue Star Service Banner and its symbolism of the devotion \n     and service of the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces.\n       Sec. 2. The authority on which this resolution rests is the \n     authority of Congress to make all laws which shall be \n     necessary and proper as provided in Article I, section 8 of \n     the United States Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5395-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE BLUE STAR FLAG AND \n                             THE GOLD STAR\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 66, H.R. 145.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 145) to designate the Federal building located \n     at 290 Broadway in New York, New York, as the ``Ted Weiss \n     Federal Building.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President. I rise today to express my \noverwhelming support for H.R. 145, a bill to designate the Federal \nBuilding located at 29 Broadway in New York City as the ``Ted Weiss \nFederal Building.'' The building currently houses the offices of the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2, as well as some Internal \nRevenue Service offices and some Federal Bureau of Investigation \noffices.\n  Ted Weiss was born in Gava, Hungary, on September 17, 1927. At the \nage of 11, to escape persecution by the Nazi regime, Ted Weiss and his \nfamily took passage on one of the last passenger ships to leave \nHamburg, Germany in 1938. The Weiss family settled in the United \nStates, and in 1946, Ted Weiss graduated from Hoffman High School in \nSouth Amboy, NJ. Upon his graduation, Ted Weiss joined the United \nStates Army. After one year in the Army, Ted Weiss enrolled at Syracuse \nUniversity, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1951 and a law \ndegree in 1952.\n  Ted Weiss became a naturalized United States citizen and was admitted \nto the practice of law in 1953. From 1955 to 1959, Ted Weiss served as \nan Assistant District Attorney for New York City. He also served on the \nNew York City Council from 1962 to 1977. In 1976, Congressman Weiss was \nelected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve in the 95th \nCongress, and each of the seven succeeding Congresses.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I am very pleased to lend my full support for this \nlegislation. Ted Weiss was a valued member of the House of \nRepresentatives and a good friend to many. For many years, Ted and I \nworked together as co-chairs of the Congressional Arts Caucus. Ted was \ntireless in his support for the arts and recognized the value of making \nthe arts accessible to all Americans. The naming of the Federal \nBuilding at 29 Broadway is a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated his \nlife to public service and the betterment of our nation. Ted Weiss was \nan American hero, and he is dearly missed here in the halls of \nCongress.\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

CURTIS NATIONAL PARK SERVICE MIDWEST REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS \n                                BUILDING\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 70, S. 703.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 703) to designate the regional headquarters \n     building for the National Park Service under construction in \n     Omaha, Nebraska, as the ``Carl T. Curtis National Park \n     Service Midwest Regional Headquarters Building.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late \nNebraska U.S. Senator Carl T. Curtis. Curtis represented Nebraska in \nCongress for 40 years, longer than any other Nebraskan. He began at an \nearly age. A well-known anecdote depicts Curtis as a young boy near \nMinden, NE, delivering speeches to the animals on his family's farm, in \nthe absence of more engaging company. Not that he always found it here \nin Congress.\n  Curtis's life was always about hard work, common sense, and \naccomplishment. He began his career by obtaining a law degree by \n``reading the law'' on his own and passing the bar. In Nebraska \npolitics, he was known as a giant-killer, defeating two incumbent \nGovernors, one former Governor, one Governor-to-be, and two former \nHouse Members. He is the only elected official in Nebraska State \nhistory to win statewide office while losing both Omaha and Lincoln. \nCurtis remained determined and victorious in the Senate when, in 1975, \nhe waged a successful battle against Senator Jacob Javits, R-NY, for \nthe chairmanship of the Senate Republican conference. As the new \nchairman of the Republican conference, he changed its role to be that \nof a research body, providing Republican Senators with relevant \ninformation on emerging national issues. The function of the current \nSenate Republican conference began under Curtis's leadership.\n  During his 16 years in the House and 24 years in the Senate, Curtis \nserved on the Finance, Agriculture, Rules, and Space Committees. He \nhelped establish a blueprint for flood control and irrigation along the \nMissouri River. He worked tirelessly to enact the energy tax bill and \nthe Tax Reform Act of 1976. Throughout his life, Curtis was an advocate \nfor small business, agriculture producers, and social security reform. \nHe was a selfless public servant who respected and lived traditional \nAmerican values.\n  Outside of the Halls of Congress, Curtis actively supported his \nfellow Republicans. One of his political highlights came when he was \nasked by the late Arizona U.S. Senator, Barry Goldwater, to serve as \nhis floor manager at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San \nFrancisco. With Curtis's help, Goldwater won the GOP Presidential \nnomination that year.\n  After Curtis finished his distinguished tenure in Congress in 1979, \nhe went back to practicing law in Nebraska, while continuing to be an \nactive voice in politics and an adviser to many Republican candidates \nand officials. He also filled his time writing his book, ``Forty Years \nAgainst the Tide,'' which highlighted his opposition to the welfare \nstate. After Curtis retired, he spent many happy days in Nebraska with \nfriends, family and his wife Mildred.\n  Curtis had a full political career, but the cornerstone of his life \nwas his family and friends. His first wife, Lois Wylie-Atwater, \nchampioned him throughout his political career, along with their two \nadopted children. After Lois's death, Curtis found companionship in \nMildred Genier Baker. They married in 1972. Curtis's journey came to an \nend on January 24, 2000, but his remarkable legacy lives on. Senator \nCurtis was a friend and political mentor to many of us. We will always \nappreciate his willingness to help each of us, his courtesies, his \nfriendship and his integrity. Naming the new Park Service building in \nOmaha after Senator Carl T. Curtis is an appropriate\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\ntribute to a legendary public servant and leader.\n  Mr. SUNUNU.

Madam President, tonight the Senate will consider the \nsupplemental appropriations conference report to begin to fund the war \nin Iraq. For many hours today, members of the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees worked to complete action on the legislation, \nand I am pleased to report that we are nearing a final package.\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\n  Despite the progress today, however, I remain concerned about the \npath on which this conference report places the Congress.\n  For decades, Presidential administrations have sought to wrap their \nfingers around the purse strings, push away the Congress, and ignore \nthe Constitution--this Constitution which I hold in my hand. It does \nnot matter what administration it is. It does not matter the political \nparty of the President. What matters is nothing more than raw power. \nThat executive branch is always out there seeking to expand its power. \nTwenty-four hours every day, the administration is somewhere on the \nglobe reaching, seeking to grasp more power. When Congress is out on \nrecess, when Congress is at home, when the men and women of the \nCongress are sleeping, the executive branch is there. At some point on \nthe compass, on the high seas, in the tundra of the far north, in the \ntropics, it is always, always awake, always there. What matters is \nnothing more than raw power. Congress has it. The executive branch \nwants it. And the executive branch will use virtually any excuse to get \nit.\n  It was not long ago that I joined with the late Senator from New \nYork, Daniel Moynihan, the Republican Senator from Oregon, Mark \nHatfield, the Democratic Senator from Michigan, Carl Levin, and two \nMembers of the House of Representatives, Congressman David Skaggs of \nColorado and Congressman Henry Waxman of California, to challenge the \nline-item veto. Every President in the 20th century, save for William \nH. Taft, sought some form of line-item veto. Foolishly, on March 23, \n1995, the United States Senate passed by a vote of 69 to 29 the Line-\nItem Veto Act, giving the Office of the President--or seeking to give \nthe Office of the President--the power to pick and choose which items \nin appropriations bills to fund and which to ignore. With the line-item \nveto, a President had the power to threaten and to intimidate Members \nof Congress, the people's directly elected representatives. It gave to \none man the power to change unilaterally a bill that was the product of \nthe give and take, the debate and compromise between and among 535 men \nand women who were directly elected by the people to represent them in \nCongress.\n\n  Fortunately, 5 years ago this June, the United States Supreme Court \nhad the wisdom to see the danger of this approach. The Justices on that \nHigh Court ruled 6 to 3 to overturn the Line-Item Veto Act. God save \nthe United States. We do not say it in this body, ``God save the \nKing.'' There is no monachist party in the Senate, or there should not \nbe. We say, ``God save the United States.''\n  So the Justices, as I say, ruled that Congress did not have the \nauthority to delegate away its constitutionally granted power of the \npurse. We just cannot do it. We might want to foolishly, but Congress \ncannot do that. It cannot delegate away its constitutional power over \nthe purse. Thank God for the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The Court understood precisely what was at stake, even though some \nhere did not. The absolute bedrock of the people's continued freedom \nfrom tyranny and excesses of all types of authority is the power of the \npurse. That is it. Cicero said: There is no fortress so strong that \nmoney cannot take it.\n  James Madison summed up in a very few words the significance of this \npower in protecting the people's rights and the people's liberties.\n\n  In Federalist No. 58, he wrote--now get this:\n\n       This power over the purse, may in fact be regarded as the \n     most compleat and effectual weapon with which any \n     Constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  Let me read that again, from the Federalist No. 58. Madison wrote:\n\n       This power over the purse, may in fact be regarded as the \n     most compleat and effectual weapon with which any \n     Constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  Every Senator should have to sleep with those words of Madison under \nhis pillow at night. Not every Member would need to do that but some \nwould. All too often Senators stand up at that desk and put their hand \non the Holy Bible and swear before God and man that they will support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic, and they turn right around and seek to give away \nthe power over the purse which constitutionally vests in this branch--\nseek to give it away to a President.\n  Why, the President is just a hired hand. He will be around here for a \nlittle while and then he will have to go away, have to go back home. \nThe same for Senators; we are hired hands. We will not be here forever. \nWe have to have a new contract every 6 years to stay and continue to \nserve.\n  It is this essential tool, the power of the purse, control of the \npurse by the people's representatives in Congress, and that tool lies \nat the very foundation of our Nation's liberties, our Nation's \nfreedoms. Take away Congress's power over the purse and the people's \nliberties cannot be assured. It is that fundamental.\n  The power over the purse, it is the fulcrum of the people's leverage. \nIt is that power over the purse that caused Englishmen centuries ago to \nshed their blood, to wrest from tyrannical monarchs that power over the \npurse and place that power in the hands of the representatives of the \npeople, in the House of Commons in England.\n  Too many of us forget our roots. Too often we forget our roots. The \nroots of the Constitution go back not just to 1787 but a thousand years \nto the Magna Carta in 1215 and beyond.\n  As enshrined in the Constitution, the power over the purse is one of \nthe chief protectors of all of our cherished freedoms: The freedom of \nthe press, the freedom to assemble, freedom of religion, all of these \nare freedoms. And that power over the purse vested in this body and the \nother body of the Congress is a precious power.\n  This control of the purse is one of the most effective bulwarks ever \nconstructed to repel a despot, control a tyrant, shackle the hands of \nan overreaching chief executive. Chip away at this fundamental barrier \nand one chips away at the very cornerstone of the people's liberties. \nIncredibly, Members of Congress in this day seem to be intent all too \nmuch on doing just exactly that, steadily chipping away at the power of \nthe purse and at the other constitutional powers and prerogatives of \nthe people's representatives in Congress.\n  Since that June day nearly 5 years ago when the High Court struck \ndown the Line Item Veto Act, administrations have sought ways around \nthe High Court ruling. So I say that executive branch is always there, \nalways reaching, always probing, always seeking to get around that \nconstitutional power of the purse. They have sought to chip away at \nthis Constitution. They have sought to control the crucial power of \nappropriating. That concerted executive branch effort has continued \nright to this hour in this supplemental request.\n\n  I am always amazed, seemingly more so than ever in recent times, that \nthe judicial branch will always stand for the judicial branch. It will \nalways act to protect itself. The executive branch will always act to \nprotect itself and it seeks, as I say, for more and more power. But it \nis the legislative branch--the branch that is closest to the people, \nthe branch that is first mentioned in the Constitution, the first \narticle of the Constitution, the very first sentence of the \nConstitution--that more and more so in recent years is willing to give \naway its prerogatives, to yield to the executive branch.\n  Ours is a government of three equal branches. We have no king in this \ncountry. Our forebears fought a war to break away from the king, King \nGeorge, III. Those signers of the Declaration of Independence put in \njeopardy their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor, to be \nindependent of the king. They could have been arrested, hauled away, \nput on ships, sent across the Atlantic to England and hanged for what \nthey did in signing that Declaration of Independence. They put their \nlives on the line when they did that.\n  I have to wonder, when Members of the legislative branch will be so \nobsequious to a President. We see it when we have a Democratic \nPresident, many Members on my side of the aisle will be obsequious. \nThey are willing to hand over to that President the line item veto. I \nsee it when a Republican President is in the White House so many on\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nthat side of the aisle are so obsequious to the President, as though he \nbrought them here, as though they were elected by a President.\n  The President is a hired hand, just as I am. Why should we be so \nobsequious to a President? He is no king. Our forefathers fought a war, \nas I say. Nathan Hale gave his life for his country.\n  I often talk to these pages. I get a new lease on life just talking \nwith these young people and breathing the fresh air of their vigor, \ntheir vision, and their enthusiasm. I say to them: Who is Nathan Hale? \nI tell them the story of Nathan Hale, if they have not heard it. We do \nnot have history books today like we had when I went to school. I \nstudied Muzzy. It was not a book filled with pictures. There were very \nfew pictures, but it was crammed with text. And there for Muzzy did I \nget my hero from the patriots of the Revolutionary period, from those \nwho wrote the Constitution, who wrote the Bill of Rights, who wrote the \nDeclaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, and \nNathan Hale.\n  Nathan Hale answered the call of George Washington to go behind the \nenemy lines and bring back drawings of the British gun emplacements. \nAnd on the night before he was to return to the American lines, Nathan \nHale was arrested as a spy. The next morning, he stood before a crude \ngallows, a wood coffin within sight, knowing that his body would soon \nlie and grow cold in that wood coffin. He was asked by the British \ncommander, a Commander Cunningham, if he had anything to say. There \nwith his hands clasped behind him, he said:\n\n       I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my \n     country.\n\n  What a lesson we can all draw from that man who gave his only life. \nDid he die to give a President the power of the purse? We did not have \na constitution at that point. But I cannot believe that he would have \ndied to give a President the power of the purse. He died because he was \nfighting for independence, to make this Nation a separate nation from \nthat nation which was ruled by a king.\n  Just a few weeks ago, after months of stiff-arming Congress's request \nfor information regarding the cost of military action in Iraq, the \nPresident finally provided the details of the first installment payment \ntotaling $74.7 billion. Of that amount for the Department of Defense, \nthe President sought $62 billion. But the President wanted the \nSecretary of Defense to pick and choose how to spend more than $59.8 \nbillion of that money. Congress was asked to provide this funding in an \naccount labeled the Defense Emergency Response Fund. Around here, this \nfund is nicknamed DERF. I can think of another explanation for DERF: \nThe Dangerous Erosion of the Right to Fund. No, it was not flexibility \nthat the President sought; it was control; it was power.\n  The President's supplemental sought another $1.4 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense to allow the Secretary of Defense to allocate \nfunds to pay nations that have provided support for the global role on \nterrorism. And again, the Secretary of Defense would decide where, how, \nwhen to invest those dollars--not the Congress. Nowhere in the \nConstitution is the Secretary of Defense given the power of the purse. \nNowhere is the Secretary of Defense even mentioned--because there was \nnot any Secretary of Defense when that Constitution was written.\n  Again, however, it was not flexibility that the President sought; it \nwas power. Time after time in line after line, this administration \nsought unprecedented authority to spend the people's money--your \nmoney--you, the people out there looking at this Chamber through those \nelectronic eyes; your money. How it wanted, where it wanted, when it \nwanted, why it wanted.\n  The cry went out: Give us flexibility. That was the cry of the \nadministration when it sent up this supplemental appropriations bill. \nGive us flexibility. But it was not really flexibility that the \nadministration wanted; it was power--power, power over the purse, power \nover the Congress.\n\n  Wisely, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees limited this \npower grab in this supplemental request. Despite the best efforts of \nthe administration, the conference report holds to almost all of the \ncommittee's limitations and presentations. But it took a vote of the \nconference this morning to give protection to the prerogatives of this \nCongress.\n  With that vote--and the prerogatives of the Congress, I say, are the \nprerogatives of the people; that is what we are really talking about, \nthe people--with that vote, the House and Senate conferees approved a \n5-day notification on how the Secretary of Defense and the President \nmay choose to spend $15 billion in the Defense Emergency Response Fund. \nFive days' notification is not too great a burden for the \nadministration to meet, and you would not have thought the \nadministration would have resisted that with every ounce of its \nstrength.\n  I read in the newspaper something to the effect that the President \nwas on the floor, the Vice President visited offices around this Hill, \nand the Secretary of Defense was on the phone urging Members to stand \nby the administration. The administration resisted this bipartisan \neffort to require this short notification, but the conferees acted to \nprotect the people against a would-be power grab by the administration. \nIf there is an imminent danger facing the Nation today, the Commander \nin Chief does not need to wait to respond. He will not have to say that \nhe cannot stop an attack against America simply because he has to tell \nCongress first. He has the inherent constitutional right to counter any \nimminent direct threat facing the United States. A 5-day notification \nrequirement on the DERF does not tie the President's hands at all, but \nit does help to protect the people's liberties against an overreaching \nexecutive.\n\n  Despite the good work by the conferees to limit the so-called \nflexibility, I fear that this conference report is nothing more than a \nfirst step down a slow road to oblivion for Congress. Because of this \nPresident's insatiable desire--and especially this administration, I \nsay, after having watched for 50 years one administration after \nanother, Republican and Democrat--because of this administration's \ninsatiable desire to control the power of the purse, what we are \nwitnessing in this DERF is a unique and creative strategy to circumvent \nthe people's directly elected representatives.\n  What will be next? Which department will seek its own emergency \nresponse fund with no strings, no questions, no examination? Why not \njust hand each department in this administration a huge check at the \nstart of each fiscal year and say: Here you go, boys. Have a good time. \nSend us a postcard.\n  Put a sign on the Capitol dome: Going out of business.\n  I hope this will be the last time Congress feels the need to \naccommodate an emergency response fund that contains so few strings, so \nfew protections for the people. After all, it is their money. I have \nheard that many times, ``It's their money.'' Well, now I say it, yes, \nit is their money.\n  Since this war began I have stated my strong support for the men and \nwomen engaged in military action and for their families. I have pledged \nevery resource necessary to speed their victory and their safe return \nhome. I will keep that pledge and vote for this conference report.\n  But I have also sworn an oath to protect and defend this \nConstitution. I will not stand by quietly while we demolish this \ndocument that has served us well for more than 200 years as the \nfoundation of this Republic.\n  The bill that we are talking about is only the downpayment on this \nwar. Remember that--only the downpayment on this war. We have asked the \nadministration time and again, and the administration's representatives \nwho came to the Hill: What will be the cost? What will be the cost?\n  Secretary Rumsfeld said the cost is not knowable. So in the \nPresident's budget that he sent to the Hill there was not one thin dime \nfor the war.\n  This bill is only the downpayment on this war and on the occupation \nand reconstruction of Iraq. This conference report is only a fraction \nof the cost. As this body writes the checks for the rest of the war and \nthe reconstruction, the Senate should defend vigorously the power of \nthe purse and ensure that the system of checks and balances is \npreserved.\n  Madam President, I personally want to thank the Senator who presides \nover the Senate at this late hour, the hour of 9 o'clock p.m. lacking 1 \nminute. Here she presides, the junior Senator from\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nAlaska, Lisa Murkowski. I apologize to her for keeping her waiting. I \napologize to all the staff, the floor staff, Republicans and Democrats, \ntonight. And I certainly want to express every good wish for them, to \nwish them happiness and safety--safety in a dangerous world and at a \ndangerous time.\n  I hope that we will all keep in mind the true meaning of Easter as we \ndepart for the holidays. Let us depart, as we shall, hoping that we \nhave served our country to the best of our ability, knowing as we do \nthat even that is not good enough for this country, this land.\n\n  I would like to depart this evening in the spirit of the poet Henry \nVan Dyke, who wrote that marvelous poem ``America For Me.''\n\n  'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down\n  Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n  To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,\n  But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n  So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n  My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be\n  In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n  Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars.\n\n  Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n  And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n  And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study Rome,\n  But when it comes to living, there is no place like home.\n\n  I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled;\n  I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains filled;\n  But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day\n  In the friendly West Virginia woodland where Nature has her way.\n\n  I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack!\n  The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n  But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,\n  We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n  Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n  I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling sea,\n  To the blessed Land of Room beyond the ocean bars,\n  Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars.\n\n  Madam President, I thank you and I thank all Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/11/senate-section/article/S5400-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
