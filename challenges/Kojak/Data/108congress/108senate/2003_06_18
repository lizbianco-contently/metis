Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period for \nmorning business until 10 a.m. At 10 a.m., the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 1, the prescription drug benefits bill. Chairman \nGrassley will be in the Chamber at that time and will be prepared to \noffer the necessary changes to the legislation. It is then hoped we \nwill begin an orderly consideration of amendments.\n  I know there are a number of Members on both sides of the aisle \nconsidering offering amendments. I encourage Senators to work with the \nchairman and ranking member, the managers of the bill, to schedule \nconsideration of those amendments. As amendments are offered, we will \nbegin scheduling votes in order to make progress on this bill over the \ncourse of this week.\n  As I had laid out previously, we will finish the legislation prior to \nthe July 4 recess. I look forward to substantive debate as we go \nforward in addressing this bill.\n  We will have rollcall votes throughout today's session. For the \ninformation of all Senators so they can plan for the next week and a \nhalf, we will have votes on Friday and next Monday on this bill. We \nhave had two good days of substantive opening statements where Members \nhave been allowed to discuss their views on this important program of \nMedicare, how we can best strengthen it, how we can best improve it, \nand at the same time add a substantial prescription drug benefit in a \nway that can be sustained over the next 10, 15, 20 years, where we know \nthere is going to be this unprecedented demographic shift of doubling \nof the number of seniors over the next 30 years.\n\n  So I am very pleased with the bipartisan progress we have made to \ndate. I am pleased that we will be able to go with amendments early in \nthe course of today and look forward to addressing a number of those \namendments over the course of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8009-6", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8009-S8010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. As we all knew yesterday, the problem with not having \namendments was that CBO had not completed scoring on the Medicare bill. \nIt is my understanding there is scoring on the bill and Senators \nGrassley and Baucus will offer either some technical changes or maybe a \nsubstitute to comply with mistakes made by staff during the very busy \nweekend they had.\n  Is that the understanding of the leader?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is generally my understanding. Again, \nfor our colleagues, in order for the process to start and to allow us \nto really begin the amendment process, we have to have what is called a \nscoring from CBO. We were in touch with them at 8:30 and 9 this \nmorning. It is my understanding we will have that scoring, but before I \ncan say anything further with absolute certainty, we will know \nsomething in the next 30 minutes or so. Once we get that scoring that \nis both in the aggregate but also line by line--and we did not have a \nline by line at 7 this morning, and people are working around the clock \non it, but once we have that line by line, we will be able to go \ndirectly to the managers' package and then also directly to the \namendments. I am very hopeful that at 10 this morning that process will \nstart.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the leader, now that we have had \npeople make a lot of opening statements, we are waiting to offer \namendments. Senator Stabenow is going to offer our first amendment, \nfollowing whatever the managers decide to do with their opening \namendments.\n  So we are anxious to go to work, and hopefully we can do that as soon \nas possible. However, as we all know, it cannot be done until the \nscoring is complete. Otherwise, a point of order\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\nwould be available against any amendment. So we look forward to getting \ninto this as quickly as we can.\n  Mr. FRIST. Again, all of this demonstrates that everybody is working \nas hard as they can to address this situation in a reasonable, step-by-\nstep fashion. So I am very pleased with where we are today. Both sides \nare very anxious to begin the amendment process, which is very good \nbecause all too often people push their amendments off until the last \nminute and we have many amendments flowing. In this particular case, we \nhave encouraged people to come forward and let the managers know what \namendments they plan to offer and then talk about the amendments so \nthey can adequately plan. Indeed, that is under way.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8010-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am seeking the right of recognition at 10 to speak on \nthe Medicare bill for half an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. My only question would be, and I say to my friend, I do \nknow that we have Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski who asked to be \nrecognized as in morning business, and if we do not go on the--well, I \nreally do not see any problem with having debate on that.\n  Mr. GREGG. How long does Senator Mikulski wish to speak?\n  Mr. REID. She is in the Chamber. I did not see her behind me.\n  How long does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Speaking to the Senator through the Chair, my remarks \nare about 5 or 7 minutes. I might add, there is a crisis in national \nservice with volunteers. Senator Bond and I have a legislative \nsolution. That is why we wanted to speak in morning business.\n  The corporation is blaming Congress when they, my colleagues would be \ninterested to know, oversubscribed by 20,000 volunteers. So Senator \nBond wanted to share our fix with the people. I could do this in about \n5 or 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I do not see any problem at \nall having the Senator from New Hampshire begin his statement when the \nhour of 10 arrives. It is indicated that the two Senators will complete \ntheir statements prior to that time. I ask that following his \nstatement, a Democrat, if one wishes to speak, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, my understanding is it \nwould be for debate only until the managers come back to the Chamber. \nMay we have a general understanding that this is for debate only until \nthe managers come?\n  Mr. REID. I understood from the Senator from New Hampshire that that \nwas part of his request, that it would be for debate only.\n  Mr. GREGG. That was not a part of the request, but if the leader \nwishes, I will make that part of the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from New Hampshire? If not, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks time? The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8010-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8010-S8012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what a mess we have at the Corporation \nfor National and Community Service. The Congress has funded 50,000 \nAmeriCorps volunteers, as we have year after year. But, guess what. The \ncorporation has enrolled 70,000 volunteers. It seems the corporation \ncannot count. As a result, there will be fewer volunteers this year.\n  Fortunately, because of a bipartisan collegial relationship on the \nVA/HUD subcommittee, Senator Bond and I are going to fix this problem \nfor the volunteers and for the communities they serve. We are \nintroducing something called the Strengthen AmeriCorps Program Act, \nand, frankly, it gives AmeriCorps the fix it needs to straighten out \nthe mess they created.\n  This bill is simple and straightforward. It gives the AmeriCorps \nProgram the flexibility within the current funding for 2003 so there \ncan be 50,000 AmeriCorps volunteers this year.\n  I have been reading in press reports, but most of all I have been \ngetting calls from constituents and other Senators who support \nAmeriCorps. What are they concerned about? They are concerned that it \nappears there will be cuts by as much as 15,000 volunteers. I am \nconcerned about that, too, and the effects on our communities and the \nyoung people who serve them while earning a scholarship for college.\n  I believe the public has a right to know what happened. So I want to \nexplain to advocates and my colleagues what is happening and why the \ncorporation has cut AmeriCorps. Congress has not cut AmeriCorps. It is \nbecause there is a persistent pattern of mismanagement at AmeriCorps. \nThe corporation has over-enrolled 20,000 volunteers. When you make a \nmistake of 20,000 it is not a mistake, it is mismanagement. Two \nthousand would have been a mistake; 20,000 is mismanagement. The \ncorporation has violated the law, mismanaged taxpayers dollars, and \ncreated uncertainty for our volunteers and our communities.\n\n  In April, at the VA/HUD subcommittee, I called on the National \nService CEO, Dr. Leslie Lenkowsky, to fix the problem. He promised he \nwould do that by June 1. But, guess what. He called on May 30 and said \nhe just could not do it. Then out came the shrinking of the number of \nvolunteers, and out came the blaming on Congress. Instead of fixing the \nproblem, he blamed Congress. I wish the corporation was as good at \naccounting as it is blaming. They had 10 weeks to get their act \ntogether and they did not do it.\n  I was very stern with Dr. Lenkowsky and the Board of Directors at the \nhearing. I must say I thank the Board Chairman, Mr. Stephen Goldsmith, \nfor responding constructively to the criticism of myself and other \nMembers of the Congress. They took it to heart. They are beginning to \nreform national service. They are doing due diligence. They are putting \nmore time into the oversight than, frankly, Dr. Lenkowsky.\n  Dr. Lenkowsky is the Chief Executive. He has failed to respond to the \nsituation, failed to respond to the subcommittee request, failed \nvolunteers, failed communities, and in the schools I went to when you \nget that many ``Fs'' you just flunk out.\n  Today, I am asking Dr. Lenkowsky to resign. I am really sorry we have \ngotten to this point, but we cannot continue this. I think if we are \ngoing to have a national service program, we need to have a national \nservice program that serves the Nation and follows the directives of \nthe Congress.\n  We have worked on a bipartisan basis in this subcommittee year after \nyear after year. We saved this program. It is usually zeroed out in the \nHouse. It is a gimmick to get us to rescue it. And now, once again, \nthanks to the leadership and constructive relationship with Senator \nBond, we are going to strengthen AmeriCorps. Without our cooperation \nand leadership at VA/HUD, AmeriCorps wouldn't even be here. So\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\nwe need to pass the Strengthen AmeriCorps Program quickly. It is an \naccounting fix that is certified and approved by OMB and GAO.\n  I support our President's call to national service. I want to work \nwith President Bush in a bipartisan way to take national service into a \nnew century. That is why I have worked with Senator McCain, Senator \nBayh, and others to do that. Most of all, I want to work with my \ncolleague Senator Bond, once again, as we always have, to sustain \nnational service. Now we have legislation to clean up the mess that the \ncorporation had. But the only way I think the corporation is going to \nget any momentum is if its current executive either steps aside or \nsteps down.\n  I hope Congress moves this bill in a matter of days. The Nation needs \nit because the volunteers need it and the communities need the \nvolunteers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure today to rise to join \nmy colleague and good friend, the Senator from Maryland, in introducing \nlegislation that will strengthen the Corporation for National Community \nService, the AmeriCorps Program.\n  I assure my colleagues the Strengthen AmeriCorps Act of 2003 is a \nbipartisan bill introduced with Senator Mikulski as ranking member, and \nthe chair of the Appropriations Committee and members of the \nauthorizing committee. The Senator from Maryland and I believe the bill \nwill not only address some of the corporation's accounting problems \nbut, more importantly, it will protect and expand volunteer service \nopportunities across the Nation.\n  Many of my colleagues--I wouldn't be surprised if all of our \ncolleagues--have heard from their constituents and the media in recent \nweeks about the potential cuts to the AmeriCorps Program. This bill \naddresses, to the best extent we can, those concerns--some have \nlongstanding concerns about the management and financial problems of \nthe corporation--by creating a budgeting mechanism that ensures the \ncorporation has the funds needed to pay educational awards.\n  Under this bill, the corporation would be able to enroll about 50,000 \nAmeriCorps members without the need for additional funds. Looking at \nthe allocation that is available for the VA/HUD subcommittee, \nadditional funds are not a very great prospect at this time, I regret \nto say. We have to deal with what OMB has given us and the allocations \nwe received from our distinguished and all-knowing senior colleagues on \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n  It is truly unfortunate--my colleague has already referred to it--\nthat there has been a plague of significant and longstanding management \nproblems, neglected for many years, in the corporation. One notable \nresult of this neglect has been the inappropriate and illegal practice \nof enrolling more AmeriCorps members than the corporation had budgeted. \nOne would think a group of dedicated public servants running the \nAmeriCorps Program could count. They have not.\n  Last year, the corporation overenrolled the AmeriCorps Program by \nmore than 20,000 people. They have done it year after year, the year \nbefore and the year before that and the year before that. They came to \nthe VA/HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Committee to bail \nthem out. We were able to provide $43 million more than requested in \nthe 2003 appropriations bill to meet the needs of these members and \nmore. But because of continued poor budgeting practices, the VA/HUD \nsubcommittee also approved another $64 million in deficiency \nappropriations in the 2003 supplemental appropriations to cover \nadditional shortfalls.\n  When the overenrollment problem first surfaced, we asked the GAO and \nthe corporation's inspector general to review the accounting practices \nof the corporation and its internal controls to determine the causes of \nthis problem. Further, we asked the GAO's Comptroller General to review \nthe corporation's underlying statute to determine whether the \ncorporation's practice complied with the law, and other fiscal laws \nsuch as the Anti-Deficiency Act.\n  Both the General Accounting Office and the IG found the corporation \ndid not comply with the law by incorrectly recording its funding \nobligation. GAO identified several factors that led to the \ncorporation's incorrect accounting practice. The factors included \ninappropriate obligation practices, little or no communication among \nkey corporation executives, too much flexibility given to grantees \nregarding enrollments, and unreliable data on the number of AmeriCorps \nparticipants.\n  That is the official word. My unofficial word is they can't count.\n  GAO also found that the corporation was not following the law in \nrecording its legal liabilities.\n  This bill responds to the problems identified by the auditors and \nallows the corporation to maximize the number of AmeriCorps enrollees \nthat can participate in the program.\n  In short, the bill allows the corporation to fund AmeriCorps grants \nbased on the estimate of the number of members who will likely complete \nand use their education award to ensure that the AmeriCorps Program is \naccountable to taxpayers and the volunteers.\n  It is our expectation the corporation will use conservative \nassumptions in developing its funding formula. This is especially \nimportant since the corporation has repeatedly failed to meet funding \nobligations resulting in action by Congress to provide additional \nfunding, including deficiency appropriations.\n  I serve notice here and now: Don't come back to us if you screw it up \nagain. You are not going to get bailed out.\n  Further, because of poor data, the bill requires the central reserve \nfund to give the corporation an extra cushion in case the actual usage \nrate exceeds the assumption used in the formulary.\n  We believe we should pass this legislation as quickly as possible. It \nprovides for clarification of the corporation in determining grant \naward allocations to its grantees in the States. Without this \nlegislation, uncertainty and disagreement will delay and limit the \nenrollment of AmeriCorps volunteers.\n  Considering the demand and need for the program, we cannot afford to \nwait. We designed this legislation with significant input from the \nadministration. This is one of the President's top priorities. It has, \nI can assure you, their undivided attention.\n  We think it is a reasonable and fair approach to the issue. It \nmitigates harm to the AmeriCorps Program in a manner that will ensure \naccountability and fiscal integrity.\n  Keeping in mind the problems identified by the auditors which led to \nthe enrollee freeze last November, we designed this legislation to \nensure that we do not repeat those past mistakes. The enrollee freeze \nwas unfortunate. It was an avoidable mistake, if the corporation had \nproperly managed and monitored its programs.\n  We need to put these enrollment issues behind us. This program has \nhad a difficult and star-crossed history. It is unfortunate. And we are \nhere in June revisiting the implementation of the program to ensure \nboth accountability and credibility. We need to ensure the State and \nlocal programs are meeting both the program requirements and the \ncommunity needs.\n  I will tell my colleagues the corporation has hired a very strong CFO \nin getting a handle on these problems. And they do have the full \nattention of not only the administration through OMB but GAO and the \nIG.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill I wish to introduce on behalf \nof myself, the Senator from Maryland, and Senators Specter, Collins, \nAlexander, Santorum, and Kennedy be held at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as the \nSenator knows, by holding the bill at the desk, it will not be referred \nto the committee of jurisdiction which I happen to chair, and which the \nSenator from Missouri is a member, as is the Senator from Maryland, and \nwhose abilities I greatly respect. Obviously, I always have \nreservations about not having a bill referred to the proper committee \nof jurisdiction and have it step outside the proper process in the \nSenate, which is the bill should go to the committee of jurisdiction.\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\n  But I believe the Senators from Missouri and Maryland are addressing \na critical problem, and one for which, as appropriators, they have a \nunique responsibility. This issue has to be resolved. I hope in \nresolving it we can also address issues such as the Corporation of \nNational Service, which is a very strong organization, and which \nbecause of the mismanagement of these funds may be cut out of the \nfunding process.\n  But I am not going to make the objection which logically a chairman \nshould make to this type of request of holding it at the desk because I \ndo think the Senators from Maryland and Missouri are doing very \nexcellent work here, and it needs to be passed quickly. Therefore, I am \nwilling to forego the committee of jurisdiction to get this bill \nthrough.\n  I congratulate Senators for bringing the matter to the attention of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my deep appreciation to the \nchairman of the committee. We have shared this with the staff. But it \nwas done on a very tight time schedule. I apologize to him for not \nbeing able to talk with him directly about it. I assure him it is a \nbrief bill. If he has any questions, we will be happy to work with him.\n  I hope we can bring it up as quickly as possible because of the \ncompelling nature of resolving this problem. If we can get it passed \nquickly, I will be happy to make a note of the particular organization \nin which he is interested and ensure that our friends at the \nCorporation for National Service know about the high priority the \nchairman of the authorizing committee places on this organization.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, want to express my appreciation \nto the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Gregg. I think it is \ngracious of him to let us keep the bill at the desk knowing the urgency \nof the need to test it.\n  I think the point he raises about the need for regular oversight on \nnational service is well taken. I look forward to participating in that \nhearing. I thank him for his courtesy and for his sensitivity to the \nurgency of the situation and his commitments regarding volunteers.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I will simply \nsay I am always courteous to appropriators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand there was a unanimous consent \nrequest that the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized. Is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, how much time \ndoes the Senator need? I would be happy to yield on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Seniors on fixed \nincomes understand how difficult it is to fill those prescription drugs \nto stay healthy.\n  For 8 or 10 years, we have been struggling to find some way to give \nthem a helping hand to pay for their prescription drugs. There have \nbeen a lot of different proposals. Some people said the way to do it is \nto eliminate Medicare altogether. Others have said the best thing to do \nis put it, as appropriate, in Medicare.\n  What we have coming before us from the Senate Finance Committee by \nSenators Grassley and Baucus is an effort to create a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors. To my mind, it falls short of what we need.\n  Isn't it interesting that in the course of this debate about this new \nbill there is one group which we have not heard from? Why is it the \npharmaceutical companies and drug companies haven't said a word about \nthe new prescription drug bill? I think the answer is obvious. Because \nthis new prescription drug bill offered by Senators Grassley and Baucus \nhas no effort in it--none whatsoever, as far as I am concerned--to keep \ndrug prices under control.\n  If you ask any family in America, or any senior, they will tell you \nthe cost of prescription drugs has increased 10 to 20 percent a year. \nIf you are a drug company, and the Federal Government says it is going \nto help your customers pay for the drugs, but they don't have to \ncontrol your prices at all, you don't have to keep them under control, \nthen, frankly, that is the best outcome you could hope for. You can \ncontinue to increase prices and know the Federal Government is going to \npick up a portion of the tab.\n  Of course, if you are a customer buying prescription drugs, it is \ngoing to be an elusive target. Even though the Federal Government is \noffering you some help in paying for prescription drugs, if you do not \ndo anything to contain the cost of prescription drugs, then ultimately \nit is going to go far beyond the family resources.\n  I stepped back and asked, Is there a better way to approach this? One \nthat achieves the result, which is to help seniors pay for prescription \ndrugs, and does it in a sensible way? I sat down and said: Take the \n$400 billion we allocated for this program and put into it some price \ncompetition. For example, in the Veterans' Administration we have \nestablished a formulary where they have said for 2,300 drugs, we will \nsave 40 percent to 60 percent of the cost. If the drug company wants to \ndo business with the Veterans' Administration, they have to bring down \nthe prices. Let us apply the same principle to our use of the Medicare \nrecipients and their drug prices.\n  I brought into question having this kind of formulary to reduce the \ncost. Then I brought in a proposal by Senators Schumer and Gregg that \nsays let us encourage more generic drugs which are cheaper and just as \neffective. And then I added an element, which the Senator from \nMichigan, who is on the floor, has been pushing for and will offer as \nan amendment.\n\n  Why wouldn't we let the Medicare Program itself offer a prescription \ndrug benefit? We know they have no profit margin. We know their cost of \nadministration is lower than any drug company. So put those three \nthings together, take the $400 billion, and what can you achieve?\n  Let me tell you what you can achieve. You can guarantee--guarantee; \nwhich this bill does not do--a $35 monthly premium for the seniors who \nvolunteer to sign up for the program. You can eliminate the $275 \ndeductible, which is part of the bill that is on the floor. And instead \nof a 50/50 split on the cost of prescription drugs, you can move to a \n70-percent Government pay, 30 percent being paid by the seniors, and \nyou can give full coverage. You do not have the gaps in coverage that \nare part of the existing bill on the floor.\n  How do you achieve this? Because, frankly, you keep the costs under \ncontrol. You have generic drugs as part of it. You have Medicare as \npart of the competition. And what period of time would the $400 billion \ncover? We are waiting for an official CBO number, but we believe it \nwould be a 5-year period. Then, at the end of 5 years, you can \nreauthorize the program, decide whether it has worked or whether it has \nnot worked.\n  I think this approach, which we call Medisave, is much more \npreferable to the Grassley-Baucus bill because it does say to seniors: \nWe are going to give you a better helping hand, 70 percent being paid \nby the Federal Government, no deductible, and a guaranteed $35 monthly \npremium. And the way we will achieve it is by reducing the cost of the \ndrugs, as we do in the Veterans' Administration today. I think that is \na sensible way to approach it.\n  To take the Grassley-Baucus approach is to open up the possibility \nthat the drug costs will just continue to skyrocket 10 and 20 percent a \nyear. And in that situation, the seniors will not be able to keep up \nwith them.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire was kind enough to yield to me until \n10:10. I see my friend, the Senator from Michigan, has come to the \nfloor. If the Senator from New Hampshire would not mind, I will yield \nthe remaining time I have until 10:10 to my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S8013]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Illinois. I \ncommend the Senator for his substitute. What the Senator is talking \nabout is exactly what the seniors of America are asking us to do to \nmake sure they have a comprehensive prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare which they know will be there, which is stable, dependable, \nwhere you can choose your own doctor no matter where you live in the \ncountry; that whether you live in the upper peninsula of Michigan or \nChicago, IL, you will have an opportunity to receive the health care \nyou need and deserve under Medicare.\n  By simply expanding that to include prescription drugs, and then \ncoupling that with the ability to keep prices down, I believe this is \nthe best possible approach to come before the Senate--in fact, the U.S. \nCongress. I am hopeful that colleagues, when this comes to the floor, \nwill rally around this plan.\n  What Senator Durbin has done is put together a plan designed for \nseniors, not designed for pharmaceutical companies or insurance \ncompanies, which is, unfortunately, why this process has become so \ncomplicated. For example, people look at me with bewilderment when I am \nexplaining that for the private sector plans in their region, if there \nare two or more, they would have to take one. But if there isn't, they \ncould have a backup, but then they would have to drop it and go back to \nan insurance plan. When I explain that plan, they scratch their heads \nand say: Why are you doing that?\n  Well, unfortunately, we have a plan put forward--and I have to say it \nis a valiant effort by many people to try to come to some consensus, \nand I appreciate that--but the reality is, it is designed much more to \nbenefit the pharmaceutical companies in particular than it is our \nseniors.\n  Why is our approach not supported by the pharmaceutical industry? For \none simple reason: If we have all 40 million seniors and people with \ndisabilities in one insurance plan, they can negotiate a big group \ndiscount, which is what they should be able to do. They should be able \nto come together, as one insurance plan, and negotiate a group \ndiscount. As Senator Durbin indicated, when you do that, you are not \npaying retail. In fact, the Federal Government does that on behalf of \nour veterans through the VA, and we are able to get about a 40-percent \ndiscount, which is a terrific deal for the veterans of this country. I \nam proud we do that, but why shouldn't that same opportunity be \navailable for every senior, for every person with a disability under \nMedicare?\n  So I just wanted to rise to congratulate the Senator's vision on \nputting forward the right plan that makes sure that, in fact, our \nseniors know they can count on a $35 premium. They would also not have \nto have a deductible. Seventy percent, as I understand, of their \nprescription drug costs would be paid for. There would be no gap in \ncoverage for the last few months of the year. Or if you found yourself \ngetting to a point where you reached the end of your coverage, and \nthen, unfortunately, your doctor indicates you have an even more \nserious illness to deal with, you would not be left wondering what to \ndo to pay for that treatment and medication.\n  This plan does what our seniors in this country are asking for. I \nbelieve it does what we should be doing for them. It is what they need, \nand it is what they deserve. It is what they have been waiting for.\n  I commend the Senator from Illinois for putting forward this option \nof which I encourage all of our colleagues to come together to embrace, \nstanding together to achieve a bipartisan victory that is in the best \ninterest of our American seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8013-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TAX RELIEF, SIMPLIFICATION, AND EQUITY ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue which we, as \nthe Senate, are going to address for the next 2 weeks, which is the \nquestion of how to put in place a drug benefit and to reform the \nMedicare system so that it is more viable.\n  This is, obviously, the most significant piece of legislation in the \narea of spending on which any of us in this Congress will vote. In \nfact, in my years in Congress, this is the most significant piece of \nspending legislation I have ever seen because it represents the most \ndramatic expansion, the greatest expansion of an entitlement in our \nhistory; therefore, it needs to be done right. In my opinion, there are \nissues which need to be addressed and which we need to discuss in order \nto accomplish that.\n  To understand the issue and to put it in context, you have to go back \nto the beginning of the problem. And the beginning of the problem, I \nhate to say it, was when I was born--1946, 1947 through 1955. It was \nthat postwar period, where America was full of itself, and our people \nwere returning from the war, and we repopulated our country with the \nlargest baby boom in the history of our country. That baby boom meant \nan explosion of people in our country, people who have contributed, I \nhope--people think immensely--over those years and decades since that\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\ntime. But in each decade, the postwar baby boom generation has moved \nforward, it has changed fundamentally, not only the demographics of the \ncountry but also the reaction of the country to various issues.\n  For example, in the 1950s, we had to build literally hundreds of \nelementary schools in order to accommodate this generation. In the \n1960s, there was, of course, the great upheaval of social \nconsciousness, which was driven primarily by the coming of age of the \nbaby boom generation and their concerns about civil rights, about the \nwar in Vietnam, about the rights of women.\n  So as this generation has moved through the tube of its time, there \nhas been a bubble which has significantly changed all around them. Now \nthat generation is headed for retirement and, as a result, our \nretirement systems which were put in place with a very appropriate \nsocial purpose of making sure that senior citizens were properly cared \nfor, which arose out of the period of the Depression in the 1930s, \nwhere so many people suffered--I was not alive then, but history tells \nus and the people who experienced it tell us that this was a period of \nimmense trauma--we as a culture decided we were wealthy enough and \nstrong enough to make sure that never happened again to our seniors. So \nwe put in place the Social Security system and the Medicare system as \nan effort to try to make sure seniors could live their final days of \ntheir retirement in dignity, financially and in health care.\n  These systems have been extraordinarily good systems for our Nation. \nBut now as this generation heads into retirement, these systems are \ngoing to come under immense pressure. The whole concept of both of \nthese systems was that there would be a pyramid where you would have a \nlarge number of people working and a smaller number of people retired, \nlike a pyramid. So that the large number of people working could be \npaying into the retirement system and benefiting those people in \nretirement. So the pyramid would work as long as there was a larger \nworking population than retired population.\n  The practical effect of the baby boom generation, the demographic \neffect, is that when we hit the retirement system, we go from a pyramid \nto basically a rectangle where essentially you will have about as many \npeople working as retired.\n  For example, in 1950 there were 12.5 people working for every 1 \nperson retired. This year, there is something like 3.3, 3.5 people \nworking for every 1 person retired. By the time we hit 2030, there are \ngoing to be 2 people working for every 1 person retired. The number of \npeople retired today is 40 million. The number of people who will be \nretired in the year 2030 will be 70 million, a 75 percent increase. So \nthe system, which was structured to be a pyramid and has worked very \nwell as a pyramid, simply won't work effectively as a rectangle. You \ncan't have about as many people working, paying retirement benefits, as \nyou have people taking those benefits because the practical effect of \nthat is you would have to dramatically increase the taxes on working \nAmericans in order to support nonworking retired Americans to a point \nwhere working Americans' lifestyles would be significantly reduced.\n  The debate today has to be put in the context of two fundamental \nissues: One, how do we benefit senior citizens with a reasonable drug \nprogram that is going to give them adequate drug care, adequate \nprescription drug opportunities; but, two--and we can't forget this \nissue in addressing the question--how do we make sure that in doing \nthat, we don't set up a situation where the next generation of young \npeople--these folks who are working as our pages, people who are in \nhigh school today, people who are in college today, people in their \ntwenties today--don't end up with a tax burden that is so large that we \nsignificantly reduce the quality of their life because we have decided \nthis year to give seniors a benefit which we cannot afford 5 or 10 \nyears from now because there will be so many seniors who are retiring.\n  We have to keep in mind, as we go through this reform effort and the \naddition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, those two groups--\nseniors and young people who will have to pay the taxes, our children \nand grandchildren, in order to support that program.\n  This brings us to the question of what type of program should we have \nwhich can accomplish that. To begin with, we have to put in place a \nMedicare Program which is cost sensitive, which has in place \nmarketplace forces which allow us to maintain a reasonable cost so that \nwe don't have a growth rate in Medicare that is so great that it simply \noverwhelms the ability of working Americans to pay the taxes to support \nit.\n  We know, for example, we already have a $13.3 trillion unfunded \nliability in Medicare. We know, for example, that under the present \nMedicare system, the costs of Medicare are exceeding the income of \nMedicare by about 71 percent and that by 2026 the Medicare system will \nbe insolvent under the present structure, insolvent because it has this \nhuge unfunded liability as a result of the huge demographic group, the \npostwar baby boom generation, entering the system.\n  These are facts that cannot be changed. The people are alive, the \nbaby boom generation exists, and we will retire. We will, therefore, be \non the Medicare system and on the Social Security system.\n  We have to find some way to address the Medicare system in a manner \nwhich will allow us to make it affordable as we move into the outyears. \nThis means putting some cost sensitivity into its structure. If we are \ngoing to add a new benefit to Medicare, we have to be sensitive that it \ndoes not at the same time create a massive new unfunded liability.\n  If, for example, we simply put on to the Medicare system a $330 \nbillion new drug benefit, which was the proposal last year from \nsomeone--that was the number; today it is $400 billion--that $330 \nbillion drug benefit over 10 years translates into a $4.6 trillion add-\non in unfunded liability in the system, which just means you have to \nraise taxes by that much on working Americans, on our children and \ntheir children, in order to pay for it. So we have to be thoughtful \nabout how we do this. As a parent and hopefully a future grandparent, I \ndon't want to reduce the lifestyle of my children and their children \nand their ability to participate in the American dream simply to \nsupport me when I am retired.\n  What does this bill do? This bill has two fundamental problems, both \nof which go to the issue. First, it adds a $400 billion drug benefit, \nbut it does it in a way that essentially says: We are going to take a \nlot of people who are already paying for their benefit, middle-income \nAmericans, Americans who have worked and have obtained a retirement \nbenefit, which includes a drug benefit, and we are going to move them \nfrom the private sector on to the public sector. We are essentially \ngoing to nationalize the drug delivery system for everybody who is over \n65, whether they want it or not. That policy has some fundamental \nflaws.\n  What do we need as a drug benefit? What we need is to make sure that \npeople who cannot afford to buy drugs today, people who are making the \ndifficult decision between purchasing a meal or maintaining their \nresidence and buying the drugs they need to be healthy, those folks who \nhave to make that type of choice, that they have support, that they \nhave a drug assistance program that helps them buy pharmaceuticals and \nassists them in a way that allows them to live a decent lifestyle \nwithout having to make terrible choices between the basics of life, \nsuch as food and housing versus their medical care.\n  We do need a drug benefit that does that, that takes care of the low-\nincome individual who is not covered today by a drug benefit. And we \nneed a drug benefit that says you don't have to spend your life savings \nin order to pay for your drugs. You don't have to wipe yourself out \nfinancially in order to be able to care for yourself physically as a \nresult of your needs to purchase pharmaceuticals. So we need \ncatastrophic coverage, where over a certain level you basically have an \ninsurance program that comes in and pays your costs. But this bill \ndoesn't do that.\n  What this bill does, as I mentioned, is it says to everyone that you \nshall have drug coverage, and it takes literally 40 percent of the \nseniors, as a conservative estimate, who presently have some sort of \nprivate coverage program and moves them onto the public coverage \nsystem. As a practical matter, in\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\ndoing that, it spends a lot of money but, more importantly, it creates \na lot of outyear liability because it essentially says the Federal \nGovernment shall have a nationalized drug system for everybody over 65 \nwhich will be paid for by earning Americans who are in their twenties \nand thirties and trying to raise families. Whether or not they are \nwealthy, they are going to have this sort of drug benefit. That really \ndoesn't make a whole lot of sense, in my opinion.\n  It would make much more sense if the drug benefit in the bill said \nsomething to the effect of, if you are a low-income individual and you \ndon't qualify for a State program, which already gives you a drug \nbenefit--which is Medicaid, basically--and your income is, say, under \n200 percent of poverty--I'll just pick that as a number because I think \nthat is a reasonable number--then you shall receive assistance in \npurchasing your prescription drugs. There are about 4 million to 5 \nmillion people in that category. There are 40 million seniors. In the \ncategory between those covered by Medicaid and those at 200 percent of \npoverty, there are approximately 4 million to 5 million people. The \ncost of doing that part of the drug benefit to make sure you had a \nreasonable drug benefit--and essentially those low-income seniors have \nthe support they need to pay for their drugs--can be $135 billion to \n$185 billion, depending how you score it. But it would not be $400 \nbillion.\n  So you could set up a reasonable program targeted at low-income \nseniors to make sure they had fair and reasonable coverage, with the \nsupport of the Government. Other seniors who are over that income level \nshould have the protection of a catastrophic program. But they should \nnot have the protection of a public program because they already have \nit.\n  It has been estimated that 75 percent of the seniors in the country \ntoday already have some form of drug coverage. Why should the Federal \nGovernment come in and replace that? Why should the Federal Government \ncome in and say to General Motors, which negotiated a contract with its \nemployees that when they retire they would get a health care package \nthat gave them drug coverage--why should you, a person working at a \nrestaurant in Claremont, NH, in your twenties, trying to raise two kids \nand send them to school--why should your Medicare and health insurance \ntax be taken to pay for a drug benefit for somebody who retired from \nGeneral Motors, who already has a benefit under the terms of the \nagreement they negotiated with General Motors? All you are essentially \ndoing is saying, if you do that, that some poor guy or woman who is \nworking hard to make ends meet in Claremont, NH, in a restaurant is \ngoing to bear the burden of what General Motors should be bearing for \nits retirees. You are replacing the obligation of General Motors with \nthe obligation of some poor guy or woman in their twenties or thirties \nwho is trying to raise a family and is working in a restaurant, and \nthey have two kids going to school. They have to buy a Chevrolet, which \nis a pretty expensive experience. They should not have to pay for the \nhealth care of the person who made that Chevrolet. But that is what \nthis bill essentially does.\n\n  The bill basically frees up, within 5 years--not immediately because \nthere are contracts in place--certainly by the time the baby boom \ngeneration retires, which is 2008, it basically frees up corporate \nAmerica from any obligation to bear any cost relative to retirement in \nthe area of drugs. Now, there may be some unions that will negotiate a \nstrong contract with their corporations and they will force them to \ncome and do some sort of wraparound. But the core of the drug benefit \nwill always be from here on out, once this bill is passed, that the \npublic sector will bear the burden of all the costs for drugs for all \nAmericans, no matter how wealthy they are, no matter what their income \nis, whether they had a union contract, agreement, or a Medigap policy \nthat covers the drug costs.\n  The practical effect of that is going to be that when the baby boom \ngeneration--my generation--hits retirement beginning in 2008, we are \ngoing to escalate the cost of this benefit radically--radically. So \n$400 billion is a conservative number for 10 years and, over the life \nof this program, $4.6 trillion is an incredibly conservative number. \nThis benefit, which is a very legitimate benefit and a very appropriate \nbenefit, should be targeted at people who need it, people who cannot \nafford it, people who are having to make the tough choices in their \nlife between the food they eat, the housing they have, and the drugs \nthey pay for. Those folks deserve Government support. But Bill Gates, \nwhen he retires, does not deserve Government support in the area of \npurchasing his drugs. Under this bill, he would get it.\n  So that is the first and most fundamental flaw in this bill. It \nessentially nationalizes and moves from the private sector literally \nmillions of people who are presently capable of having, and who are in, \nprograms that take care of their drug benefit. It does an aggressive \njob, I admit, on the low-income person and that should be kept in \nplace. There are a variety of ways to do that. But we should not \nnationalize the system for everyone.\n  The second flaw in this bill, the most fundamental flaw, is the issue \nof how you control the overall cost of Medicare. This is at the essence \nof the future financial soundness of this country. Today, Medicare \nconsumes about 14 percent of the GDP, if you include retirement \nbenefits, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. If you applied the \nprojections to the Medicare, which are in place, the fact that we have \na $13 trillion unfunded liability, and if you apply the unfunded \nliability projections to Social Security and Medicaid, then you will \nend up by 2030 having those three--Social Security, Medicare and \nMedicaid--absorbing 14 percent of the GDP. They do not do that today, \nobviously. Today, the Federal Government absorbs about 19 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. So you could see that if you project the \ncost of Medicare and Social Security out to 2030 and you have it using \nup 14 percent of the gross national product, and today we do all \nGovernment spending, all the Government responsibilities, including \neducation, national defense, and all the different issues of core \nGovernment needs we manage with 19 percent of the gross national \nproduct, we can see that by the time we get to the year 2030, there is \nnot going to be anything left that the Federal Government is going to \nbe able to do other than take care of the retirement accounts. We are \nnot going to be able to do national defense, education, roads, parks--\nall the important functions to have a strong Government and a good \nsociety. They are not going to be affordable unless we are willing to \nradically increase the taxes on the working Americans of this country \nwho will be our children and our grandchildren.\n\n  That is why I say reforming Medicare--and Social Security, for that \nmatter, which I have already worked on extensively--is one of the most \nfundamental issues we face as a country, getting those costs under \ncontrol in the outyears.\n  Does this bill do that? This bill attempts to create a market force \nin the area of Medicare by setting up something called PPOs, preferred \nprovider groups. The practical effect, though, is there are very few \nlikely scenarios under which the PPOs will be viable, under which \nprivate market forces will come into play. We will still have, \nbasically, a price-controlled situation, a single-payer situation.\n  We cannot reform Medicare unless we bring into Medicare market \nforces. We cannot control the price and delivery of health care unless \nwe start to put in place some sensitivity to the quality of care that \nis being delivered in the context of how it is being delivered, when it \nshould be delivered, and the amount that should be delivered. We cannot \ndo that in a single-payer system. We cannot do that in a price-\ncontrolled system. We can only do that if we have market forces that \nare competing and, thus, bringing to the table the essence of \ncompetition, which is competing on the basis of price and quality.\n  This bill in name attempts to do that through the PPO process. It is \nprojected, however, by CBO, the Congressional Budget Office--there are \nso many initials thrown around; we confuse people--that only 2 percent \nof the Medicare recipients will take advantage of this market-oriented \napproach.\n  The White House and the Office of Management and Budget projects it \nat\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\na much higher level. They say 45 percent will take advantage of this \nprogram, and that is because they are optimistic, and it is because it \nis their plan. I think the Congressional Budget Office has taken a much \nfairer and objective look at this. They have said: What in this plan \ncreates an atmosphere which would cause somebody to leave Medicare and \nmove over to a private provider? There is virtually nothing in this \nplan that would cause somebody to do that. There is no market force \nwhich is allowed to be brought into play to accomplish that because of \nthe way the pricing mechanism is set up under this bill.\n  The practical effect is that the market has been taken out of--at \nleast in a real sense, not in an illusory sense; it is there as a \nstated purpose--but as a practical likely effect, it has been taken out \nof the game. So we are going to move forward into the next generation \nwith the same program that we presently have with a drug benefit on top \nof it, which drug benefit essentially will cover everyone, no matter \nwhat their income levels are, no matter what their benefit structures \nare. They already exist.\n  Instead of improving the system, what we are going to end up with is \nthe same old Medicare system, a 1950s car with a brand new paint job on \nit in the form of the drug benefit but without anything in it that is \ngoing to fundamentally improve it as it moves into the next generation \nand the need to control costs in the next generation.\n\n  The practical effect of it will be that the $13.3 trillion unfunded \nliability that already exists in Medicare will have $4.6 trillion of \nnew unfunded liability put on top of that for the purpose of the drug \nbenefit, which are all massive numbers, but they come down to this: For \na child born today--John Jones or Mary Smith--when that child takes his \nor her first breath, that child gets with that breath a debt of $44,000 \nto pay for Medicare. That debt is going to have added to it $15,000 \nafter this bill passes to pay for the new Medicare benefit.\n  Yes, this bill does take care of our seniors and our baby boom \ngeneration group who are becoming seniors in a very generous way. One-\nhalf of the equation is addressed--seniors. That is always politically \nvery attractive. It polls very well. It gets you through the next \nelection. It makes you a hero with groups of people who are concerned \nabout seniors' rights. But the other half of the equation is our \nchildren and our children's children. It leaves them with an \nextraordinary bill and with no opportunity to affect it.\n  The great tragedy is this drug benefit gave us, the Congress and the \nexecutive branch, the first and best opportunity to substantively \nreform Medicare using the drug benefit basically as the carrot that \nbrings along the reforms. We could have used this benefit in an \nextraordinarily constructive way to assure that my generation, the baby \nboom generation, is not an undue burden on our children and our \ngrandchildren or on that fellow or woman working in a restaurant in \nClaremont.\n  Instead, what we have done with this bill is added a drug benefit \nwhich will make my generation very happy and seniors who are receiving \nit today very happy, which will leave in place a Medicare system that \nhas a $13 trillion projected unfunded liability and which will leave \nwith our kids a debt which is both unfair, inappropriate, and, \nironically, unnecessary were we approaching this with better policy.\n  I suppose, in understated terms, I have reservations about this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding, under the order now \nin effect, that a Democrat will be recognized; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Kennedy is here and ready to speak. Under the \nprevious order, a Democrat is to be recognized to speak now. The \nSenator has until 11 o'clock if he wants to use that time. At 11 \no'clock, the two managers of the bill will be recognized to offer a \nsubstitute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We now will be recognized?\n  Mr. REID. For debate only on the bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the minority whip yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will it be possible for me to gain some time following the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, \nhow long does the Senator wish to speak? I say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Gregg spoke for 30 minutes. Under the order, we \nhave the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have 9 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Kennedy has until the top of the hour.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to accommodate my friend. Do I understand the \nSenator from Michigan intends to offer an amendment this morning?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the intention, although there is no order in \neffect, is that at 11 o'clock, the two managers of the bill will be \nrecognized and, at that time, they will offer their substitute. At that \ntime, it will be open to amendment. It has been talked about for the \nlast 2 days that Senator Stabenow will be recognized to offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have, therefore, about 20 minutes between now and 11 \no'clock. I will be glad to divide that time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will require more time than that. The Senator, \nobviously, has the floor, as under the UC, which is fine. I am looking \nfor a window of about 15 or 20 minutes maximum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not know if the two managers of the \nbill would be willing to start at 11:15 rather than 11. They are in the \ncloakroom. While Senator Kennedy speaks, I will walk back and ask them.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That would be appreciated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho as well. \nAs I indicated, I was willing to share the time we had up to 11. As \nsoon as a Member is prepared to offer an amendment, I will yield the \nfloor because I do think we have had a good opportunity to make general \ncomments and opening statements over the period of these last 2 days, \nand I think the business of the Senate should require that we begin to \naddress some of the areas which need addressing.\n  I understood my friend and colleague from Michigan will be in the \nChamber shortly, and as soon as she is and it is agreeable with the \nmanagers, I will yield the floor.\n  To review very quickly, this is a momentous time. We give credit to \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee in moving this \nprocess forward in a way which I think can be a building foundation for \naddressing the critical issue which is on the minds of so many of our \nseniors, and that is a good, effective, reliable, affordable \nprescription drug program.\n  As has been mentioned previously, when we passed the Medicare Program \nin 1965, it provided for the hospitalization and physician fees, but it \ndid not provide for prescription drugs. Only about 3 percent of all of \nthe private sector insurance programs had a prescription drug program. \nWhat we have seen since that time is the extraordinary explosion of \nprescription drugs which are so necessary to enhance and improve the \nquality of life for so many of our seniors. They are as indispensable \nto our seniors as hospitalization and physician fees.\n  In 1965, we made a commitment and a pledge to our seniors that is \nreally the basis of a program that was developed in the late 1950s. It \nwas an issue that divided the two political parties in the 1960 \ncampaign. President Kennedy felt strongly about developing a Medicare \nsystem for our seniors. We had failed to provide national health \ninsurance for all Americans, a goal I am still committed to. It was \nHarry Truman's goal.\n  We are always reminded that we in the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats, effectively have national health insurance. There is not a \nsingle Member of this body who does not take the Federal employees \nprogram, rejects that, and takes their own homegrown program. They all \ntake the Federal employees program, which is heavily underwritten by \nthe Federal Government. I do not know of a single program that exists \nin this country that has the taxpayer underwriting what we in the \nCongress and the Senate have, including a prescription drug program.\n  So I am always interested in those who complain about our efforts to \ntry\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\nand pass a good, effective prescription drug program when we have it \nourselves. We have looked out after ourselves and we have been so slow \nin looking out after the needs of our fellow elderly citizens.\n  I arrived to the Chamber too late to hear my good friend--and he is \nmy good friend--from New Hampshire talk about the indebtedness this \nbill will provide in terms of the children of this country. This is a \n$400 billion bill and it is going to mean several thousand dollars of \nindebtedness to the children who are being born today. Well, that pales \nin significance when we think that under the Republican administration \nof the last 2 \\1/2\\ years we have passed a $2.3 billion tax reduction \nthat is going to mean billions and hundreds of billions of dollars of \nindebtedness for our children.\n\n  This program at least is going to make a difference in terms of the \nquality of life for seniors who have built this country and sacrificed \nfor their children and fought in the wars and fought to make sure we \nwere going to have economic recovery. It is an investment in them \nrather than just to the wealthiest individuals. I welcome the \nopportunity to debate, if we are going to have the chance to do it, \nwhich is of greater value to the Nation, which is of greater value to \nour fellow human beings, these extraordinary tax cuts or the \ndownpayment on the prescription drug program.\n  The principal reason we have been unable to bring this matter up and \ndevelop a bipartisan approach is because of ideology, which has been a \npart of the Republican commitment over the years, and that is to \nprivatize Social Security and privatize Medicare. They have been \nopposed to Medicare, opposed to Social Security, from the time \nimmemorial when these programs were passed. We heard the word \n``socialism'' talked about all during the debates on the Medicare \nProgram. Every other word was ``socialized medicine.'' We do not hear \nany of those words anymore. We hear words, as we heard from Newt \nGingrich, ``we want to see Medicare wither on the vine.'' But they are \nopposed to it.\n  So this issue has been divisive because those of us who have been \nstrongly committed to Medicare refuse to see that it is effectively \ndismantled by offering a prescription program that would be used to \neither bribe or coerce seniors out of the Medicare system into a \nprivate sector system and then to let the Medicare system wither on the \nvine. Our elderly people, our seniors, those who have contributed to \nthis country, know their doctor, they know their neighborhood, they \nknow their hospital, and they do not want to be forced out of Medicare \ninto an uncertain system. Many of us in this body are going to resist \nthat and fight that with every fiber in our body.\n  We have seen an alteration and change, and that is what has been \ndeveloped in the Senate Finance Committee legislation, which will \npermit those who are under Medicare to be assured that no matter what \npart of the country they live in they are going to be able to have \naccess to the prescription drug program that is outlined in this \nlegislation.\n  For those who want to go into the HMOs, there will be at least the \nopportunity for those in the private sector who want to risk providing \nthe benefit package that is in here, and want to take the chance, to be \nable to compete. That is the compromise that has certainly not \nsatisfied everyone--I certainly would not have drafted the bill as it \nis drafted today--but nonetheless it is the compromise that came out of \nthat committee and which I think Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \ndeserve credit for.\n  They have established a foundation in which this prescription drug \nprogram can be enhanced, strengthened, and built upon, both during the \ndebate over the next 6 days but also in the future years. As long as I \nam in the Senate and honored to represent the people of Massachusetts, \nI make the commitment and pledge that I am going to do everything I \npossibly can to make sure this is the kind of program which is worthy \nof our senior citizens in the future, but we will have a downpayment in \nthis program with this legislation.\n  In the past, we reviewed very briefly the need for this program and \nthe costs for this program. I think at the time that we are actually \ninto the amendments, we do not have to go back and speak about the \nenormous costs our elderly are paying, how their CPI, their adjustment, \nis not enough to make up for these escalating costs; the fact that \nthese prescription drugs are absolutely indispensable to the lives and \nwell-being of millions of our citizens. We know that is the truth. We \nknow we have an uncertain condition out there in terms of the seniors \nhaving access to the drugs. Many of them do not have it. Others are in \nretirement programs. An increasing number of the retirement programs \nare dropping individuals. Millions of others have them in Medicaid and \nthat is being cut back in a number of our States, and they are being \nleft out and left behind.\n  Millions are in HMOs, and almost half of those numbers have been \ndropped by the HMOs and other conditions have been put on in terms of \nrestricting the amounts that will be expended by the HMOs in the \nprescription drug program which is disadvantaging these individuals to \nan enormous degree. Medigap is not picking up the process. The fact \nremains, our seniors are enormously vulnerable today. Never have they \nbeen more vulnerable.\n\n  This is against another background that I will just mention very \nbriefly. We have seen in the Congress, in the Senate, over the period \nof this last 5 years the doubling of the NIH budget. Why was that done? \nThe reason it was done is the recognition that we have had, Republicans \nand Democrats alike, of the enormous opportunities for breakthroughs, \nin prescription drugs primarily, and in new technologies to deal with \nthe challenges in health care, mixing technologies and mixing \nprescription drugs to make further advances--which is certainly the \ngoal of Dr. Sahni at the NIH.\n  These are very bold and challenging new initiatives in which they are \ninvolved. We have seen the mapping of the human genome, with all that \nmeans, in the predictability of how genes are going to function and so \naverting dangers that presents to patients in the future, anticipating \nthat and developing medical technologies that can address that so we \ncan prevent individuals from developing, in this instance I am talking \nabout, several different types of cancers. The list goes on.\n  We have the most extraordinary opportunity now for breakthroughs in \nprescription drugs. Now that we have doubled the NIH budget, we have to \nask ourselves what is the sense of making these breakthroughs and \nspending billions and billions of dollars if we are not going to get \nthem out of the laboratory and into the homes of those who need them?\n  This bill is that downpayment that ensures the drugs get out of the \nlaboratory and to those who need them. That is why it is so important \nwe take action. We are seeing such progress. I see in my own State of \nMassachusetts--we have more biotech companies in our State than all of \nWestern Europe. I am always amazed at the continued dreams in these \nresearch labs in terms of potential breakthroughs and the progress that \nis being made. It is beyond the possible imagination of so many of us, \nto think someday we might really conquer cancer, we might really \nconquer Alzheimer's, we might really conquer diabetes or other \ndiseases. There are dreamers who believe it will be done, and in the \nnone-too-distant future.\n  We want to put in place a process, a procedure, a delivery system \nwhich is affordable, dependable, reliable, so those breakthroughs can \nget out and get to them. That is what this bill does.\n  I will just review this because these issues were raised. One of the \nfeatures, which is not a major feature but which I find has not been \nmentioned in most of the news reports, is that in January of next year \n5 million seniors will receive a card--some might have to pay $25 for \nit but no more than $25--that will guarantee them $600 worth of \nprescription drugs. If they do not use all $600, if they use just $400, \nthey can carry that over to next year. That is a real downpayment of \nthis legislation. Five million people are going to receive that. \nAlthough the Medicare program will take 3 years to get implemented, \nthis prescription drug card will soon provide needed relief to millions \nof seniors. That is an indicator to at least 5 million of our seniors, \nthat help is coming, help is on its way.\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\n  Let me give three quick examples of an average senior citizen with an \nincome of $15,000. That is the average senior citizen, if they have \ndrug costs at the national average of $2,300. This is the group this \nlegislation perhaps helps the least. We take great care of the 40 \npercent of the senior citizens with lowest incomes and we take care of \nthose with catastrophic expenses. This is the group we hope to provide \nadditional assistance. This individual would pay a $420 premium, and \nthey would pay $1,298 for cost sharing, and they would receive $604. \nThat may not sound like much, but that is $604 they do not get today.\n\n  Let's take the instance of an individual who has the same income, \naverage income, and has a great deal of medical expenses; $15,000 \nincome and they have $10,000 in expenses. They will end up paying the \n$4,500 but they get $5,400 in savings under this legislation. That is \nstill a good deal--I'd like it to be better, but at least they will \ngain significantly from this legislation if they have those kinds of \nbills.\n  Let's take the same individual. By and large this is 40 percent of \nall the senior citizens--not half but not far from it. Let's look at a \nperson just above the poverty line with $9,000 in income and the same \n$2,300 in drug expenses each year. That works out to about $190 per \nmonth.\n  Under this legislation, at $9,000 income, you would pay $5. That \nwould mean a monthly savings of $185.\n  If your income is $12,000 and you pay out the $190 per month in \nexpenses today, under this legislation you would pay $10 and would save \n$180 per month.\n  If your income is $13,500 and you have $190 in monthly costs, under \nthis legislation you would pay $23 and save $168. That is a major \nrelief for those families who are facing these extraordinary challenges \nacross this country.\n  I see the ranking members of the Finance Committee now on the floor. \nLet me wind up.\n  Mr. President, listen to this: 83 percent of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries are going to receive more out of this legislation than \nthey will pay in. Today, in part B of the Medicare only about 50 \npercent of seniors get out more than they pay in. Under this \nlegislation it would be 83 percent.\n  For those who go through what they call the doughnut hole, that is \nthe period of time when they are not getting the full assistance I \nwould like to see, it is important to recognize that two-thirds of \nthose who go into the doughnut hole go out the other end into the \ncatastrophic and get extra help. Only about 8 percent actually remain \nin that doughnut hole.\n  We are going to have the opportunity here to try to make some further \nadjustments to strengthen and improve this legislation.\n  Finally, let me say in watching what happened over in the House of \nRepresentatives, their legislation fails to have the kind of backup \nthis legislation has in the delivery of the Medicare benefit, which is \nunacceptable. They have what they call a premium support program which \neffectively would undermine the Medicare system, which is completely \nunacceptable. The means testing is in there, which would require \nindividuals to submit their tax forms to agencies of the Federal \nGovernment and insurance companies. I think that would be very \noffensive.\n  There are many different aspects of that legislation that are \nenormously troubling. But that is not this bill. That is not this bill.\n  So, again, I commend Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus and our \nRepublican leader, Senator Frist, for all they have done working this \nthrough. I look forward to the opportunity to address these amendments.\n  I see the hour of 11 has arrived.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, even though there may not be a unanimous \nconsent request that has been ordered, I ask that the two managers be \nrecognized now; that following whatever they decide to do the Senator \nfrom Idaho be recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes; and following \nthe statement of the Senator from Idaho that Senator Stabenow be \nrecognized to offer an amendment. We talked about her amendment for a \ncouple of days.\n  I ask all this in the form of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to offer a modification in \njust a minute. We are going to wait for our staff to come and present \nthe exact language which we will use in the unanimous consent request.\n  Before we do that, I have not had the opportunity to express my \nappreciation to the entire Senate for Senator Baucus's cooperation in \nbringing the bill here, and for everything we have done in order to \nbring a bipartisan bill here which was voted out of a committee on a \n16-5 vote.\n  In other speeches, I have talked about people who have been working \non this issue, such as Senator Breaux with the Breaux Commission. I \nhave talked about the tripartisan people who worked over the last 2 \nyears to bring a bill before the Senate last year, all of which set the \nstage for some of the subject matter we have before us. Senator Baucus \nand I hope we will have a continuation of the bipartisanship that has \nbeen expressed so far in that vote.\n  But I haven't had a chance to tell the Senate of my appreciation to \nSenator Baucus in working both at the staff level and his staff--\nmeaning the Finance Committee staff on the Democratic side, and the \nFinance Committee staff on the Republican side--doing a lot of nitty-\ngritty work to bring things together with a consensus that can be \narrived at at the staff level, but, more importantly, a lot of the \nthings Senator Baucus and I had to work out.\n  When it was all said and done, it was a very pleasant experience. I \ndon't say that because of the relationship Senator Baucus and I have, \nbut it is because of a continuation of the tradition of the Senate \nFinance Committee to do most of its business--albeit not all of its \nbusiness--in a bipartisan way.\n\n  We would not have an issue before us like this--and a lot of other \nissues that have come out of the Senate Finance Committee--without that \nsort of cooperation.\n  I think this deserves a little more special attention of \nbipartisanship and Senator Baucus's cooperation. This is the first \nmajor expansion of Medicare in 35 years. This is something that \ncandidates of both political parties have talked about the necessity of \ndoing--providing prescription drugs for seniors.\n  There is something which is very much of an issue to Montana and to \nIowa and to a lot of other States we call rural States. There is an \ninequity issue within Medicare reimbursement.\n  Working very closely with Senator Baucus last year to establish a \nBaucus-Grassley bill on Medicare rural equity, then moving this year to \nadopt the one earlier on a tax bill and duplicating that effort in this \nprescription drug bill was all done in a bipartisan way. You can only \nsay it so many times, but I don't think you can say it enough either, \nbecause people think the Senate is always a highly partisan body. \nSometimes we are too highly partisan. Sometimes it is OK to be \npartisan, I believe, in our system of government. But really nothing \ngets done in the Senate if there isn't some bipartisan cooperation. \nObviously, I take this opportunity to thank Senator Baucus for that \ncooperation.\n  We still have not had that agreement presented to us yet. I am going \nto ask Senator Baucus if we should let Senator Craig go ahead and speak \nfor his 15 minutes before we lay down our amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first I very much appreciate the kind \nwords by the chairman of the committee. It is wonderful working with \nthe Senator from Iowa. He is a good man.\n  With respect to the point made by the chairman, I agree. I think it \nmakes sense at this time, since we are still trying to get papers \nready, for the Senator from Idaho to proceed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we will let the Senator from Idaho \nfinish before we proceed with our unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and the ranking member for the work they have done on the \nFinance Committee on S. 1, the Medicare legislation.\n  The legislation before us today is a praiseworthy document, in that \nit is a\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\nstep forward toward the fundamental goals of providing prescription \ndrug relief for America's seniors and strengthening the Medicare \nprogram. This is certainly not to suggest that this legislation is \nwithout flaws, but it does begin the process of improving Medicare for \nour children and our grandchildren down the road and in what we hope \nwill be the right direction.\n  To paraphrase the words of a rather historic person, Benjamin \nFranklin, ``Is the sun rising, or is the sun setting'' on the promise \nof creating a federally funded but also privately competitive Medicare \nsystem that can succeed, both in holding down costs and in providing \nadequate coverage?\n  Only the future will tell whether what we have before us is the case \nof a sun rising on a new day in health care or simply a dramatic shift \nand a sun setting.\n  What I think is happening here today is the beginning of a very \nimportant debate for the remainder of this week and next week. I hope \nthat passage of this legislation will prove to be a major step forward.\n  As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I have convened a \nvariety of hearings over the last several months to carefully examine \nthe difficulties of all of the issues that are going to be talked about \nhere this week, including the long-term demographic pressures facing \nMedicare, the value of integrating competitive alternatives into the \nprogram, and the promise of making care coordination part of a \nstrengthened and improved Medicare prescription drug coverage.\n  All of these are important. But there is no question that \nprescription drug coverage is the political engine that drives this \ndebate, but it is just one of several grave challenges we face as we \ntake up this important legislation.\n  There is no question that drug coverage for America's seniors is long \noverdue, especially for those in the greatest of need. Except for \nMedicare, virtually every health care insurance plan in America today \ncovers prescription drugs. Medicare today is trapped in a 1960s model \nof health care delivery, and lags decades behind what the private \nsector has to offer.\n  This bill would address this problem. Beginning immediately, \nAmerica's seniors would receive a drug discount card enabling them to \npurchase drugs at a significant discount. More importantly, in 2006 \nseniors would be able to enroll in federally subsidized Medicare drug \ncoverage for a premium of about $35 a month--coverage that would be of \ngreater per-dollar value than that currently offered through Medicare \nsupplemental, Medigap, or wraparound plans.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation devotes the greatest \nshare of its drug assistance to seniors of low and modest income--most \nespecially seniors below 160 percent of poverty. These seniors--those \nwith annual incomes below about $13,500 for an individual, and about \n$18,200 for a couple--would receive special assistance of about 80 to \n90 percent for their drug costs, depending on income.\n  The truth is, the proportion of seniors who truly cannot afford \nprescription drugs is relatively small--perhaps 25 percent. It is on \nthese seniors in the greatest of need that our help should be focused.\n  Mr. President, even more important than drug coverage is the urgent \nneed to begin putting Medicare on a more modern and secure footing as \nthe 77-million-strong baby boomer generation moves even closer to \nretirement age. According to the Medicare Trustees, Medicare costs, \neven without any drug benefit, will more than triple over the next 75 \nyears, placing a tremendous burden on future generations.\n  Despite this looming challenge, Medicare today remains clogged by \nrigid bureaucracy and complex regulations regulations that are already \nbeginning to drive doctors and other health care providers out of this \nprogram, leaving our seniors, in many instances, without access to the \nhealth care they need.\n  Medicare, as we know it today, is micromanaged to the tiniest of \ndetails for medical payments and procedures, including the pricing and \nregulation of more than 7,000 medical procedures and over 500 hospital \nprocedures. Why are we so intent on micromanaging the system? Medicare \nregulations now total more than 110,000 pages of rules and regulations.\n  Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that doctors and hospitals report \nhaving to spend half an hour to an hour in paperwork for every hour \nspent in patient care. In other words, there is often more intensity on \ndoing the paperwork right than there is on good health care procedures \nfor the patient and all because of a Federal system that is so heavily \nmicromanaged. And of course, the risks to providers are high if they \nfail to perform the required regulatory tasks in the most minute of \nways.\n  Even more distressing, the heavily bureaucratic Medicare Program has \nultimately failed to keep up with the kinds of medical and health care \ncoverage innovations most of the rest of us take for granted. For \nexample, the current Medicare Program only covers a handful of \npreventive screenings and tests and in most cases will not even pay for \na standard physical.\n  Medicare also lags far behind the private sector in its use of care \ncoordination and disease management systems under which a patient's \ncare is coordinated and optimized, promoting better health outcomes and \nfewer days of hospitalization.\n  For certain chronic conditions, such as diabetes and congestive heart \nfailure, as many as 83 to 97 percent of America's health care plans now \noffer such care coordination. Medicare, meanwhile, has only barely \nbegun to experiment with demonstration projects in this area and some \nprominent experts, such as former CBO Director Dan Crippen, doubt that \ncare management can ever work effectively in Medicare as we know it \ntoday.\n  The bill before us seeks to bring Medicare into the 21st century, not \njust by providing prescription drug coverage, but also by offering \nseniors the choice to enroll in federally supervised but privately \noperated health care plans the same kind of choices and coverage \ncurrently enjoyed by millions of other Americans under age 65. Ideally, \nthese plans could include preferred provider organizations, fee-for-\nservice plans, HMOs, and even medical savings accounts.\n  The current Medicare system forces seniors to hunt for and purchase \nsupplemental plans for many of the things that Medicare does not cover. \nBy contrast, the new Medicare Advantage plans would give seniors one-\nstop shopping for comprehensive and integrated coverage including \nprescription drugs, preventive care, care coordination, and \nprotection against high catastrophic medical bills, benefits which are \nlargely unheard of in the traditional Medicare plan of today.\n\n  Importantly, these new choices would be entirely voluntary. Seniors \nwho want to keep their current coverage and stay in traditional \nMedicare would be free to do so. Also, the new prescription drug \nprogram would be offered in both the traditional program and in the new \nMedicare Advantage plans. No senior would see any reduction in Medicare \nbenefits under this bill. No benefits would be taken away--none.\n  I am also extremely pleased this bill includes a significant and \nnecessary package of improvements in rural health care and \nreimbursement. Among other changes, this legislation would improve \ncertain categories of rural payment and would make needed rule changes \nto assist critical access hospitals and other rural providers.\n  For far too long, doctors and hospitals in Idaho and other rural \nStates have suffered under payment classifications and reimbursement \nlevels that put them at a significant disadvantage and that make the \nalready difficult job of providing health care in rural America even \nmore daunting.\n  The underlying framework of this bill is a sound one, and it follows \nthe basic principles laid out by President Bush earlier this year--\nnamely, to strengthen traditional Medicare and keep it as an \nalternative for those seniors who want it, but also to provide a new \nfoundation for the future, one built on choices, competition, and \ninnovation.\n  This said, however, I am gravely troubled by certain aspects of this \nbill's current design--particularly the fact that we have not \nincorporated in it enough competitive alternatives.\n  First, I believe it is a mistake to offer exactly equivalent drug \nbenefits in the older, more traditional program\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nand in the new Medicare Advantage plans--and thereby not create a \nstrong competitive advantage for the Medicare Advantage programs. This \nis an important issue in causing seniors to make selections toward the \nmarketplace and toward a variety of alternatives--rather than to be \nfearfully hunkered down, if you will, in the old program. If we truly \nbelieve, as I do, that structured competition, rather than a \nperpetuation of top-down bureaucratic health care, is the better future \nfor Medicare, our legislation should reflect this commitment.\n  Second, this bill unwisely imposes a ceiling, or benchmark, on the \namount the Federal Government will pay the new Medicare Advantage \nplans. What we want is a variety of robust competitive alternatives in \nthe marketplace, and capping or creating a ceiling may threaten that \ngoal.\n  Third, the legislation creates an unnecessarily heavy-handed and \nrestrictive bidding system for the Medicare Advantage Program. Under \nthis program, HHS would choose only three winning plans for each of ten \nnational regions. Far preferable would be a system like the Federal \nHealth Benefits Program, under which any plan meeting basic federal \nstandards would be permitted to compete. It should be the marketplace, \nnot HHS bureaucrats, who decide which plans succeed or fail.\n  Fourth, I am concerned by this legislation's overall high level of \ncomplexity and prescriptiveness--prescriptiveness that threatens to add \nappreciably to the 110,000 pages of regulation already in place. Shame \non us if we do that. This bill, which I suspect weighs a few pounds, \nhas hundreds and hundreds of pages. I hope that, for every page of \nlegislation we do not also see 25 or 30 pages of ensuing regulation. If \nthat is the case, we will have created the opposite of what we should \nintend--namely walking away from the bureaucracy and into the \nmarketplace, into the opportunity of choice, and into a much freer \nenvironment--one that providers want to join, and one that provides \noptimum health care for the senior of today.\n  Over the course of the next week and a half, hopefully, amendments \nwill take us toward simplicity instead of toward the kind of \nmicromanagement we have seen in the past. History should not repeat \nitself here, and I think all of us should be concerned that it might. \nThis is because we have the great tendency to err on the side of the \nbureaucracy and the side of regulation, when, in fact, the \nmarketplace--as shown by the hearings I have held--can, in fact, be the \ngreater arbiter of health care when effective competition is provided.\n  These concerns are by no means exhaustive. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I am also concerned about the complexity and stability of \nthe proposed system for providing drug coverage in the traditional \nMedicare program, and I worry about the possibility that some employers \nmay react to the new Federal drug coverage by cutting back or dropping \nbenefits they currently provide to their retirees.\n  Finally, I want to caution my colleagues, in no uncertain terms, that \nneither this bill nor any of the alternative Democratic proposals \noffers a magic bullet for Medicare's future. The financial and \ndemographic outlook for Medicare is sobering in the extreme, and \nnothing can change the fact that hard choices lie ahead, regardless of \nwhat we do this year. This legislation could improve our prospects, but \nit is, at best, only a first step.\n  Majority Leader Frist, Senator Grassley, and others on the Finance \nCommittee deserve tremendous credit for bringing us to where we are \ntoday, as does President Bush for making prescription drugs and \nMedicare reform a top priority this year.\n  The coming weeks will be critical ones. I hope we can succeed in \nproducing a bill worthy of this historic opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the chairman and the ranking member. I \nalso thank Senator Frist, our leader, for insisting that this issue get \nto the floor for the kind of debate I trust we will have--and for \nworking with the House toward putting on our President's desk something \nthat we have long promised America's seniors: That those who are truly \nneedy will have access to prescription drugs and all seniors will have \naccess to a modernized Medicare Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the technical corrections in this \nmodification obviously have been agreed to by Senator Baucus or I would \nnot have offered it, and they are not controversial. The corrected \nitems in this modification are technical in nature. It merely perfects \npolicies in the Finance Committee's reported mark that were drafted \nincorrectly in S. 1. The corrected items also reflect drafting changes \nthat, while small, were important from CBO's perspective in getting us \na complete score. All of these technical changes are incorporated now \ninto this modified version of S. 1.\n  The new version also includes an official line-by-line score from the \nCongressional Budget Office. I am looking forward to getting on to \namendments at this point. I repeat what I said yesterday: My hope is \nthe spirit of comity and consensus building that existed in the Finance \nCommittee last week will be and can be, and I am surely going to work \nfor it to be, replicated here on the Senate floor. The Finance \nCommittee members reached across party lines to arrive at that \nconsensus. For some it was very difficult. But the final vote showed a \nlot of give and take because that vote out of committee was 16 to 5. I \nhope that same spirit will prevail here today and in the coming days \nthis week and next week that we are on the bill.\n  There was another part of the consent I did not ask. I now ask \nunanimous consent the amendment be agreed to--our professional staff \nhas some disagreement whether or not I should be making that motion at \nthis point, so I will not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan is now going to \noffer her amendment. We are willing to enter into a time agreement on \nthe amendment. There are a number of meetings at the White House, I am \ntold, that prevent our arriving at a definite time for the amendment \ntoday. I have spoken to the staff on both sides, and maybe at 3:15 we \ncould have a vote.\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\nMembers should keep that in mind, that we may be able to do that.\n  There is nothing definite at this stage. I want the record to reflect \nwe are not trying to stall movement of this bill. We have this \namendment, this important amendment. We are ready to vote on it earlier \nthan 3:15. But because of the White House calling Senators down, we \nwill be unable to do that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in addition to what the Senator \nexpressed, it is a desire on our part that we would have some votes yet \ntoday and that we would like to move along very quickly. I think the \nspirit he has set is one that is shared on our side, even to the point \nof being specific statements from our leadership, the extent to which \nthey would hope to have some votes today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. It was suggested earlier today that we would rotate back \nand forth on amendments. That is fine. I think we have more amendments \nthan you have, but if that is the case, we are happy to alternate back \nand forth.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if I may further add to what the Senator \nsaid, for our part, we would like to have a very general rule that we \nwould alternate back and forth, but it is also our belief on this side \nthat we would give great deference to the other side to offer \namendments, two Democratic or three Democratic amendments in order so \nwe could be very flexible on that. We did want to reserve and provide \nsome predictability to the order on the floor because there might be \nsome Members on the Republican side who would like to offer an \namendment, and they want some certainty when that would be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 931\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senators Boxer, Bob Graham, Rockefeller, Harkin, \nCantwell, Kerry, Bingaman, Jack Reed, Clinton, and Mikulski. I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Harkin, \n     Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Reed, Mrs. \n     Clinton, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     931.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require that the Medicare plan, to be known as the \nMedicare Guaranteed Option, be available to all eligible beneficiaries \n                             in every year)\n\n       Beginning on page 74, strike line 10 and all that follows \n     through page 84, line 3, and insert the following:\n       ``(e) Medicare Guaranteed Option.--\n       ``(1) Access.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Administrator shall enter into a \n     contract with an entity in each area (established under \n     section 1860D-10) to provide eligible beneficiaries enrolled \n     under this part (and not, except for an MSA plan or a private \n     fee-for-service plan that does not provide qualified \n     prescription drug coverage, enrolled in a MedicareAdvantage \n     plan) and residing in the area with standard prescription \n     drug coverage (including access to negotiated prices for such \n     beneficiaries pursuant to section 1860D-6(e)).

Mr. President, first of all, before explaining the \namendment, I commend my colleagues for their leadership on the Finance \nCommittee. They have been working very diligently--the chairman, \nSenator Grassley, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, and members \non both sides of the aisle. I commend them for bringing forward one of \nthe most critical issues affecting American people, American families, \nAmerican seniors today. While we may disagree on specifics and on what \nis the best approach, I very much commend them for giving us the \nopportunity to debate this critical issue and for the hard work that \nhas gone on, on both sides.\n  My amendment is a simple one. It would provide another choice of \nprescription drug plans for seniors on Medicare. In fact, it would \nprovide the choice the majority of seniors want to make on Medicare.\n  The underlying bill allows seniors to choose a prescription drug \nplan, but only if the plan is one offered by a private insurance \ncompany. My amendment simply allows seniors to get their prescription \ndrugs through the Medicare Program. It is creating one more option. The \nlegislation before us tries to expand health care choices for people on \nMedicare. Regrettably, it does not provide the full range of choices \nfor seniors.\n  Without my amendment, we are not in fact providing the full range of \nchoices, including the one for which the seniors are asking. My \namendment will allow seniors the choice to get their prescriptions \nfilled within traditional Medicare, to choose a private prescription \ndrug plan, or enroll in a PPO or an HMO. This range of choice will \nfoster competition among the different plans and allow our seniors to \nmake the best possible choice for themselves. This amendment puts all \nof the plans on the same footing and does not favor one over the other.\n  I think it is also important to note that the private plans described \nin the bill don't exist today. In fact, Robert Reischauer was quoted \nrecently in the New York Times saying, ``Private drug-only plans don't \nexist in nature.'' They don't currently exist in nature. So we are \ndesigning a system around plans that do not currently exist.\n  Medicare does exist. A Medicare plan is one that we know we can put \ntogether and that seniors can count on, at the same time giving the \nopportunity for new plans to be created, as\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\nwell as the structures of HMOs and PPOs.\n  I also think this plan could actually save the Federal Government \ndollars, and certainly the record would reflect that. There is ample \nobjective evidence that providing health care through the Medicare \nProgram is more efficient than through the private sector. This is one \narea where the evidence is clear, based on various points of \ninformation. Let me just share some with you.\n  On May 5, 2003, the New York Times reported on findings by MedPAC, \nour own nonpartisan advisory plan. MedPAC discovered that private \nhealth plan fees are about 15 percent higher than Medicare. The Center \nfor Studying Health Systems Change has also made similar findings. So \nwe know that if we go to private plans, on average, services will be \nabout 15 percent higher--more costly for fees for services. Surgeries, \nthey found, were about 26 percent more. Radiology was about 19 percent \nmore. Hospital and nursing home visits and consultations were 9 percent \nmore. On average, we know it doesn't in fact cost less to provide \nservices to private plans. Independent, nonpartisan organizations have \nfound that it in fact costs more.\n\n  Also, using private plans would likely cost additional dollars. In \nthe year 2000, our own General Accounting Office estimated that \npayments to Medicare+Choice plans--and those are the Medicare HMOs that \nwere set up in 1997--exceeded the costs that would have been incurred \nfor treating patients directly through traditional Medicare by an \nannual average of 13.2 percent.\n  So, again, we have a situation where our own nonpartisan, objective \nGeneral Accounting Office said that providing services through Medicare \nHMOs actually cost, on average, 13.2 percent more than the same service \noffered under traditional Medicare, where seniors get to select their \nown doctors and have the dependability of knowing that Medicare will be \nthere.\n  Thirdly, private plans are not necessarily more efficient than \nMedicare. The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human \nServices found that HMOs that contract with Medicare, on average, spent \n15 percent of their revenue on administrative costs rather than on \nhealth care. In fact, we know those numbers can be even higher in other \nprivate sector plans. Dollars have been put aside in this plan to cover \nhigher administrative costs. Some managed care systems spend as much as \n32 percent of their revenue. That means that for every precious dollar \nwe have that we want to help seniors pay for their medicine, about one-\nthird of that could go to administration.\n  By contrast, the Medicare plan spends only 2 percent of its budget on \nadministrative overhead. On average, a private HMO--and we realize more \nplans are being developed under this proposal than just HMOs, but if we \nlook at what we have to go on in terms of the differences, it is 2 \npercent administrative costs under Medicare and an average of 15 \npercent for HMOs. And we know that in some areas, in fact, it is even \nhigher administrative costs for other private insurance plans.\n  Furthermore, the enrollment experience with private plans in Medicare \nhas certainly not been stellar. In the past 5 years, 2.5 million \nseniors have been dropped by their Medicare HMO. As I have indicated \nbefore, one of those in fact was my own mother in Lansing, MI, who had \na very positive experience under a Medicare HMO. But the decision was \nmade, for financial reasons, to no longer cover Medicare recipients. \nShe lost her plan and her doctor, and she was left to figure out how \nelse she would be receiving care under Medicare.\n  In 2002, three plans in Michigan dropped out of Medicare+Choice \naltogether, while two dropped significant numbers of enrollees. More \nthan 31,000 seniors in Michigan have been dropped just since 2002. What \ndoes that mean in real terms for people? It means that they went into a \nsystem, they had a doctor, they were within a certain kind of health \ncare system; then the private managed care plan decided to pull out, \nand they were then left to go find another plan, actually another \ndoctor, and another way of providing health care.\n  Only 8 of 83 counties in Michigan now have private Medicare HMO \nplans, and all of them are concentrated in one area, southeastern \nMichigan, around metro Detroit, which means that those in the Upper \nPeninsula of our State don't have that choice. I expect it would be \nvery difficult for them to find a private sector plan, even into the \nfuture, in northern Michigan, the Upper Peninsula, or the west side of \nthe State. Right now, the only option is obviously around metro \nDetroit. None of the remaining Medicare HMOs in Michigan is accepting \nnew enrollees.\n  One Michigan provider even chose to pay a $25,000 fine to get out of \nMedicare+Choice and stop serving seniors immediately rather than go \nthrough the official withdrawal process. That requires more than 3 \nmonths of notice of intent to withdraw. By pulling out immediately, \nthis plan left our seniors in the lurch with very little transition \ntime to explore other ways in order to be able to get their health \ncoverage.\n  Because of the poor records of the Medicare+Choice plan, almost 9 out \nof 10 seniors--basically 89 percent--have decided to stay in \ntraditional Medicare. I believe they ought to have the choice to do \nthat. That is what my amendment is all about. It is saying to those \nright now who have had a choice of a private managed care plan or \ntraditional Medicare since 1997, who have chosen to stay with \ntraditional Medicare, to choose their own doctor, to know that \nregardless of where they live they will have the dependability, the \nstability of Medicare, it will be there for those individuals who have \nchosen overwhelmingly to stay in traditional Medicare--89 percent.\n\n  Any one of us would love that kind of a percentage when people are \nchoosing in an election. Eighty-nine percent of the seniors today have \nsaid they want traditional Medicare. Yet this choice they have made is \nnot available to them if there are two or more private sector plans \navailable in their region. Essentially, unfortunately, what the current \nplan says is you have made your choice; we do not like your choice; \npick again. My amendment would guarantee seniors would be able to have \nthat choice.\n  I know some colleagues strongly believe that moving seniors into the \nprivate sector is the best way to provide them prescription drug \ncoverage. While I respectfully disagree with this premise, I think it \nis a good idea to provide private sector options for those who desire \nthem.\n  Back to my own family, I think my mother should have that choice, and \nshe should be able to go into Medicare+Choice or another managed care \nplan if she so desires. I absolutely agree with that if it works for \nthem.\n  The question is whether the Federal Government should force seniors \ninto a plan, whether it is a private insurance plan or traditional \nMedicare. Should we be deciding what our seniors should have for their \nprescription drug coverage? Should we make that choice or should they \nmake the choice? That is why my amendment is so important. It will \nallow seniors to choose the appropriate plan for them, not the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I have heard a lot of arguments that we should provide seniors with \nthe same options that Members of Congress and Federal employees have in \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. Under that plan, we have \nseveral options ranging from fee for service to PPOs to HMOs. If we \nlike one of those options--and we choose that option, by the way--the \nFederal Government does not come in and say, If you work for the \nSenate, you cannot have option A, you can only get B, C, D, and only A \nunder certain circumstances. We say here is the range of options; you \nselect the one that works for you. If we like the one we selected, we \ncan stay in that plan as long as we want. As long as we are covered by \nthe Federal employees health plan, we can choose that plan. We are \nnever forced to switch plans.\n  Mr. President, can you imagine if we were living under the plan we \nare asking seniors to live under; if every employee had to switch back \nand forth, potentially, depending on what was offered in the private \nsector, rather than remaining with the plan they desired? We have never \nbeen forced to switch plans ourselves. It should be the same for our \nseniors. If we do not have to switch plans year to year, then seniors \nshould not have to switch either.\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\n  My guess is most of us like the plans we are in and probably want to \nstay with them. Certainly, if we do not, we have the opportunity to \nchange. But the last thing we want to do is switch health plans every \nyear or every other year and try to leaf through hundreds of pages of \nbrochures to evaluate the benefits of a new plan. I, for one, find it \nis difficult to find the time to do that. I cannot imagine anyone would \nwant the chore of going through every year or every other year all of \nthe paperwork to figure out what is best for them, particularly if they \nlike the plan they are in.\n\n  Many seniors want stability. They seek a good, solid, guaranteed \nhealth plan where they can see their own doctors. There are some \nseniors who prefer to experiment with private plans, and they should be \ngiven that option. But all seniors should have all options, and that is \nwhat my amendment would do. It would make sure the choice is in the \nhands of our seniors.\n  Again, this approach is within the framework of the bill. It is \nwithin the $400 billion that has been carved out within the budget \nresolution. It is within the framework of the benefits structure that \nhas been designed by the committee. This amendment does not change \nanything other than to say every senior should have the option, as 89 \npercent of them have chosen to do, to not only have their own doctor \nunder Medicare, but to have a prescription drug plan under Medicare \nregardless of where they live, and a plan they can count on and depend \non.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues who have been working diligently on \nthis issue. I know it has been a challenge for everyone. I believe this \namendment does exactly what the seniors of America want and allows all \nof us to enthusiastically embrace this proposal as being the right \nproposal.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my amendment to offer one more \nchoice to seniors. It builds on the structure of this bipartisan plan \nand provides more choices.\n  I know many of us believe this bill can be improved. Outside \nobjective critics have even used stronger language about the way this \nis restricted in the bill. For example, former CBO Director Robert \nReischauer said:\n\n       The benefit is rather skimpy and has a bizarre structure. \n     It is an insurance structure that exists nowhere in the \n     private sector or in nature.\n\n  Through this amendment we will have a structure that makes sense, \nthat is dependable, that is explainable, that is simple and \nstraightforward, that provides all range of options to seniors so they \ncan decide what it is they wish to do in terms of prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare. I will read a portion of it:\n\n       On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the \n     National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, \n     I am writing in support of your ``Medicare Guaranteed \n     Option'' amendment to S. 1. Since the current Senate \n     prescription drug bill, S. 1, wants to offer seniors choices, \n     your amendment would offer seniors real choices because they \n     would have the choice of what they really want, which is a \n     defined benefit under Medicare.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    June 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the millions of members \n     and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare (NCPSSM), I am writing in support of \n     your ``Medicare Guaranteed Option'' amendment to S. 1. Since \n     the current Senate prescription drug bill, S. 1, wants to \n     offer seniors choices, your amendment would offer seniors \n     real choices because they would have the choice of what they \n     really want, which is defined benefit under Medicare.\n       We understand that your amendment would allow traditional \n     Medicare to be an option that stands side-by-side next to the \n     other two or more private plans that are required to be in \n     that region. Instead of the current requirement that Medicare \n     stand as a fall back, only if there are no private plans in \n     the area, it would allow Medicare to be a third choice for \n     seniors who prefer to get their benefits through traditional \n     Medicare. We agree that seniors should have the right to \n     select the option in which they are most comfortable, and for \n     many, that choice might be to stay with traditional Medicare \n     versus one of private plans that are located within their \n     region.\n       We applaud your efforts and dedication on behalf of \n     America's seniors, and appreciate your continued leadership \n     on this issue. We look forward to continuing to work with \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                          Barbara B. Kennelly,\n\n                                                        President.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, again, I urge my \ncolleagues to join in this amendment. I am hopeful we can join together \nenthusiastically in embracing a system that has worked since 1965 for \nour seniors. I hope also we can join together to improve it, not only \nprescription drug coverage, but ways to minimize paperwork and focus \nmore on prevention, as the Secretary of HHS has suggested.\n  There are many opportunities for us to improve within the structure \nof Medicare a plan that is focused more on prevention, to eliminate the \npaperwork, and to do it together and still provide our seniors with the \nchoice for which they are asking.\n  In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Levin, Senator \nKohl, and Senator Dodd as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I congratulate the Senator from \nMichigan. She has worked very hard and, I might add, effectively in \nhelping make this a better bill.\n  Everyone in this body wants legislation passed that gives good, solid \nprescription drug benefits to seniors.\n  The debate is somewhat over delivery; that is, how we set the plan \nup, who provides the benefits and so on. The bottom line is the same \nfor all of us. We want good, solid prescription drug benefits for \nseniors.\n  The Senator from Michigan is probably as well-versed in this subject \nand more of an advocate for seniors than any other Member of this body, \nor at least as much as any other Member of this body. I thank her very \nmuch for what she has done.\n  The issue basically is that we have roughly $400 billion to spend \nover 10 years, and the question is how we best assure that seniors get \nthose benefits. Now, $400 billion over 10 years may sound like a lot of \nmoney to some folks but when it is cranked out in terms of deductibles, \ncopays, premiums and benefits, it is really a modest benefit for \nseniors. It is not a lot of money.\n  Some other programs give much more generous prescription drug \nbenefits than is called for under this legislation. For example, under \nTRICARE, that is the military plan, military retirees receive \nsubstantially more benefits than are called for under this bill. The \nsame is true for the VA. If the U.S. Government, under this \nlegislation, were to provide the same benefits for seniors generally \nthat the military does under TRICARE, this bill would not be $400 \nbillion, it would be upwards of $800 billion to a trillion dollars, \nwhich gives one a sense of the difference.\n  The VA's benefits are greater. The Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan, FEHBP, provides drug benefits that are greater than called for \nunder this bill.\n  I mention that so the expectations are not raised too high that this \nlegislation is going to be the be-all and end-all, that it is going to \nhelp seniors with all their drug expenditures. It will not, but it is a \nfirst step. It is a major advancement in helping seniors get their \nprescription drug benefits.\n  There will be many bills later on in the next several years as we \naddress ways to improve our health care delivery system generally, on \nhow we can help improve prescription drug benefits to seniors more \nspecifically, but we are operating under a bit of a constraint and the \nconstraint is $400 billion. That is what we in the Congress agreed to, \n$400 billion on the Senate side for prescription drug benefits for \nseniors.\n  Under that constraint, we have to work very hard to try to achieve \nsome balance. One goal is stability, another is efficiency. What do I \nmean?\n  Under stability, we clearly want this program to be as stable as \npossible so seniors know what they are getting for the premiums they \nwill be paying. This is a voluntary program. Seniors are not\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nrequired to sign up. What we want is a stable program. We do not want a \nprogram that is changing a lot. That is unsettling to seniors.\n  We also want to achieve efficiencies. By that I mean lower some \ncosts. The Medicare Program is growing exponentially. We all know that \nnot too many years from now, when the baby boomers start to retire, we \nare going to face some significant challenges on how we address \nMedicare payments generally, which certainly will include some \nprescription drug benefits. We want to try to cut costs, and the idea \nthat a balance is struck between stability and efficiency is \nessentially one where both private plans and the U.S. Government \nparticipate.\n  I strongly wish we were able to have more dollars to spend so we \nwould have more stability and have a program that more closely \nresembles the military's TRICARE plan or the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan or the Veterans' Administration plan, and even some \nprivate plans, but we do not. We are taking this steadily, a step at a \ntime.\n  The Senator from Michigan has a good idea. Her idea is that in the \ninterest of stability, as opposed to efficiency, that any senior would \nhave the right to participate for life in the Government-sponsored plan \nas opposed to the private sector. We in the Finance Committee have \nlabored mightily to try to find the right balance, and the right \nbalance is not easy to find, I must say. We have Senators from one side \nof the spectrum and Senators from the other side of the spectrum \nbending my ear and bending the ear of the chairman. Quite often, our \nears are bent so much we wonder if there is any rubber left in them. We \nhave been talked to.\n  I have been talked to very much by the wonderful Senator from \nMichigan about her amendment. If I had my druthers, it would be \nsomething I would prefer, but we are a bit constrained. I do not know \nthat I can support the amendment for that reason because we are trying \nto keep a balance.\n  I do want to highly commend the Senator for the great effort she has \nundertaken. She has clearly helped advance the ball in many ways. She \nwill continue to advance the ball, there is no doubt in my mind. She is \na great Senator for the people of the State of Michigan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nI have had a chance to hear what the Senator from Montana has said \nabout the amendment. I associate myself with his remarks. I also heard \nwhat he said about the Senator from Michigan being a fair player and \noffering alternatives, and I share his compliments of her and how she \napproaches these issues.\n  This is a place where we have some honest disagreements. We are going \nto debate those honest disagreements, and I hope the Senator from \nMichigan comes out on the short end of this debate when we have a \nrollcall vote.\n  Before I make some specific statements in opposition to her \namendment, I will state that the chart she has before her right now is \nan accurate chart, but I would like to comment on it from the \nstandpoint of not being maybe a complete picture. I think the \npercentages are very accurate but we also need to remember that \nMedicare+Choice is not offered in all parts of the United States. For \ninstance, in my State of Iowa, there is only 1 county out of 99--and \nthat is Pottawattamie County, Council Bluffs county seat across from \nOmaha--where there are about 4,000 people out of about 350,000 seniors \nwho belong to a Medicare+Choice plan, and I find that they like it very \nwell. They can join in that county because they are associated with \nOmaha across the river in Nebraska.\n  Also in several major cities in California, Arizona, Texas, Florida, \nand New York there are several, maybe even some rural areas in those \nStates, where they get a very high percentage. Now, how much higher \nthan 11 percent, I do not know, but I remember back in the mid-to-late \n1990s that I was able to say--whether I can still say it today, I do \nnot know--that 40 percent of the seniors in some large cities did, in \nfact, choose Medicare+Choice plans. Whatever higher percentage it is in \nthose cities, we have to realize that people are in these \nMedicare+Choice plans voluntarily.\n  I also have come in contact with many Iowans who winter in other \nStates where they have Medicare+Choice, and they do not seem to \nunderstand why we cannot have Medicare+Choice in Iowa, and I wonder \nthat myself. I took action in 1997 to very dramatically increase the \npayment to Medicare+Choices so they would come to the State of Iowa, \nbut they still have not come.\n  We have increased it from $300 per month per beneficiary up to a \nnational floor now of $490, and they still don't come, even considering \nthe fact that fee for service in Iowa is closer to the $300 per month \nper beneficiary. So I don't know why we can get almost 50 percent more \nand at least 70 percent more Medicare+Choice, yet the plans don't come \nto Iowa.\n  What I am saying to the Senator from Michigan is it is not fair to \nsay Medicare fee for service is so well liked by seniors, as her chart \nwould imply, that we ought to completely forget about anything but fee \nfor service. In a lot of places people like it. A high percentage of \nseniors are in it. They are in it voluntarily. They can come in one \nyear and get out the next if they want to go to the fee for service. In \nmy State of Iowa, citizens are irritated because in Arizona they see \npeople getting benefits through Medicare+Choice that we do not get in \nfee for service within the State of Iowa.\n  There is nothing wrong with your chart except I think it ought to be \nmagnified to some extent so that there are a lot of people with \nMedicare+Choice who like it. More would choose it if it was more widely \navailable. That is one of the advantages of our PPO section of the bill \nbefore the Senate: to give more people that opportunity. That does not \nnecessarily mean HMO. It can be preferred provider organization or it \ncould even be a fee for service.\n  Let me get back to the specifics of the amendment. The purpose of the \namendment is to make the Government-run fallback plan available in \nevery area all the time, even when the bill before us has very strict \nstandards for the presence of private plans, and that these be met, and \nwhen they are met or provided for, no fallback is needed.\n  In essence, this amendment would destroy our bill's competitive \nincentives and replace them with a Government-controlled regime for \ndispensing drugs in this country. The amendment before us would also \ncreate an unlevel playing field between the Government-run plans and \nprivate plans. As a result, it would discourage the initial entry of \nprivate plans, dooming the effort to provide the drug benefit through \ncompeting private plans. This would place the drug benefit right back \nin the very command-and-control mentality of Government-run health care \nplans we ought to try to move away from. It would reinstitute \nGovernment micromanagement, and it would bring about price controls.\n  It would ultimately put the Government into the full-time business of \nsetting drug prices and determining what drugs are covered and which \nare not.\n  This is the opposite result of what the underlying bill is seeking to \nachieve with a competitive private-sector-run prescription health plan. \nThe Government-run approach saves less than competing private plans. \nPrivate plans competing to enroll beneficiaries would achieve greater \nsavings because at-risk plans would work harder to negotiate lower \nprices and work harder to offer more affordable premiums.\n  This fact is brought out by CBO this year, but it reaffirms \neverything we knew about every plan in the Senate discussed last July, \nincluding the tripartisan plan that set out the tripartisan plan \nsavings and costing less as opposed to the Government-run plans that \nwere offered on the other side of the aisle last summer when we debated \nthis same issue.\n  CBO has indicated that a structure based on competing at-risk private \nplans has a higher cost management factor than Government-run plans \nwhich cannot respond quickly to market changes. The Congressional \nBudget Office recognizes that private plans will do a better job of \nmanaging drug costs and keeping pace with market changes.\n  Don't we want the seniors to have a right to choose? And they do have \nthe\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nright to choose. That is what this approach is all about: not forcing \nsomething down the throats of seniors. But don't we all think we ought \nto have programs that respond to the market because that gives our \nseniors an opportunity to select products and services that are the \nresult of the dynamics of our marketplace?\n  You know how long it takes Congress to make a decision. You know how \nlong it takes a bureaucracy to make a decision. It does not serve \nseniors as adequately as we should be serving seniors. In fact, we know \nalready the Government does a very poor job of reimbursing for \nprescription drugs because of the years of overpayment for the drugs \nalready covered under Part B of Medicare.\n  Medicare has been overpaying for Part B drugs for years because of \nits inability to keep up with the marketplace. Taxpayers are paying \nmore because CMS is about 2 or 3 years behind in pricing new therapies, \nsuch as new approaches in the area of prosthetics.\n  In fact, the bill before us includes reforms to Part B drug payments \nto end the overpayments Medicare is already making. But it has taken \nyears for General Accounting Office reports and investigations by the \nInspector General for Congress to act to fix this problem.\n  Overpayment for drugs in Part B has cost taxpayers billions of \ndollars and our underlying bill seeks to correct that problem. But we \nshould learn the lessons of history and recognize that if the \nGovernment is wasting billions in overpayments for the drugs covered \nunder Part B today, how much would be wasted by the Government if such \na system were used for all prescription drugs dispensed to the seniors.\n  In answering that question, don't believe the assumption in my \nquestion, believe what CBO has already said about it. The Congressional \nBudget Office has the expertise of pricing these things and accounting \nfor the costs. The potential waste, then, the overpayments for drugs \nand increased costs to the taxpayers has become astonishingly high.\n  Setting up a Government-run plan that undermines or eliminates \nprivate-sector competition will take choices and savings away from \nseniors. By pushing private plans out of the market, I believe, \nregardless of how well-intended the amendment by the Senator from \nMichigan is, it would reduce the broad array of choices that would \notherwise be available to beneficiaries under the bill before the \nSenate. This would deny seniors the opportunity to enroll in the plan \nthat best fits their needs by forcing these seniors into the typical \none-size-fits-all model.\n  This would effectively deny seniors a private plan operation, which \nwould deny them the enhanced savings achieved by the private plans. \nThis would effectively undermine a major principle of this legislation: \nthe right of seniors to choose. Seniors ought to have that right. They \nmay not want to exercise that right, but we should not assume, when \nthere are 40-some-million seniors in America, that one program is right \nfor all of them. We give alternatives. The right to choose is very \nimportant. The right to choose in Medicare is one of the major ways we \nmodernize and strengthen Medicare. Medicare has become a part of the \nsocial fabric of America, like Social Security. We do not want to, in \nany way, affect this integral part of the social fabric of America \nexcept to give American seniors more right to choose.\n\n  The amendment before the Senate by the Senator from Michigan takes \naway some right to choose or destroys the dynamics of the choices we \nare giving to seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I will respond to my colleague, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. First, I thank the Senator for his \nkind words and my esteemed ranking member from Montana, as well, for \nhis kind words. We have different views, different perspectives on how \nbest to provide seniors with prescription drug help, but we all share a \ncommon desire to do that and, within the confines we are operating \nunder, to create a way to do that.\n  First, the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the committee, is \ncorrect: A portion of the individuals who are in traditional Medicare \nare there because there are not plans available in their area. In \nMichigan, as I indicated in explaining the amendment, only 2 percent of \nthe people right now in Medicare in Michigan have access to \nMedicare+Choice. So it is definitely true.\n  It is my understanding, though, that CBO has said under the new plan \nonly 1 or 2 percent of the folks would go into managed care under this \nbill. If that is correct, we would not see much of a choice even if it \nwere available.\n  However, the larger point is whether or not the market has worked as \nit relates to health care for seniors. In 1965, when Medicare was \ncreated, it came about because at that time half the seniors in the \ncountry could not find health care insurance or could not afford it. \nThe market was not working for older Americans at that time.\n  I argue, also, the fact that there are no managed care plans in Iowa, \nnorthern Michigan, or other parts of the country. Again, it is a \nquestion of whether or not the market works in those circumstances. The \nreason Medicare came into being is because there were not health care \nplans in rural America, there were not health care plans available to \nthose who needed them. We decided in one of the best decisions that has \nbeen made by the Congress--I was not there at that time--one of the \nwisest things that was done at that time was to say our value, as \nAmericans, is that older Americans, the disabled in our country, should \nnot have to struggle to find health care. We believe health care should \nbe available to them whether they live in a rural community, whether \nthey live in a city or a suburb, anywhere in the United States. Our \npriority as Americans is to create a system that, regardless of where \nyou live, health care would be available and affordable for older \nAmericans and disabled.\n  Many say today we should be going in the exact opposite direction of \nexpanding what we are doing to make sure everyone has the opportunity \nfor the same health care that seniors and the disabled have in our \ncountry; that children and families, working hard every day, that \nindividuals working two and three part-time jobs who cannot find health \ninsurance, ought to have the ability to buy into a system of health \ncare coverage.\n  There is a great need to make sure that health care is available and \naffordable. Medicare has done that.\n  I agree there are improvements to be made, such as more focus on \nprevention. We can certainly streamline the paperwork and bring it into \nthe 21st century as far as technology and other options, to make the \nsystem better. From my perspective, here is a plan, unfortunately, that \nmoves away from that stability, the dependability and affordability of \nMedicare.\n  I see my esteemed colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, and I know he \nwants to speak. Members feel strongly about this issue. What we are \ndoing with this amendment is the ultimate choice. It is the real \nchoice. It is the choice the majority of seniors have already made, and \nit is the choice they want. Under the underlying bill, the only way \nthey could get to the place to choose what they want is if private \ninsurance plans were not available in their area. The plan goes through \nall kinds of changes to try and make that available, even if it costs \nmore.\n\n  Ask any small business, any large business in this country today, how \nfast their private insurance premiums are going up. We have seen small \nbusiness premiums double in 5 years. We have seen Medicare going up \nabout 5 percent. We see private sector going up 15, 20, 25, 30 percent \na year. This says rather than having a plan that goes up 5 percent a \nyear, we are going to design this so it goes up 15 or 20 percent a \nyear.\n  That does not make sense. In all honesty, the only group this makes \nsense for are the pharmaceutical companies who do not want folks in one \nplace to be able to bargain and negotiate lower prices, which is what \nMedicare would be able to do--negotiate lower prices.\n  For all who want to get this right for our seniors, I urge my \ncolleagues to join in creating real choice for our seniors. Give them \nthe opportunity for the choice they want. If, in fact, someone chooses \nto go into managed care, an HMO, PPO, or other kinds of private plans, \nthey should have that choice, as\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\nwell. This amendment allows them to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as the cosponsor of the Stabenow \namendment, I add my strong support for the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan.\n  Senator Stabenow has it right. She understands what is happening. \nSenator Stabenow has time and time again come to the floor to point out \nwe need to give seniors more choices rather than fewer choices. That is \nwhat we are doing with this amendment.\n  The bill we are considering in the Senate this week, S. 1, has a \nnumber of flaws despite its good intentions. Its prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors is far from comprehensive. There is a significant \ncoverage gap. Premiums are not fixed. Many of the copays are too high. \nThe bill does not contain the actual costs of prescription drugs. \nAlthough the generics amendment, which I assume will be added to the \nbill, which will certainly help in that regard, the bill does not go \ninto effect until 2006; interestingly enough, just to get us by the \n2004 election.\n  I have a number of concerns. I plan to speak about all of these as we \nproceed on this bill this week. One of the most significant flaws in \nthis bill is addressed by this amendment offered by Senator Stabenow; \nthat is, this bill requires seniors obtain the prescription drug \nbenefit through private insurance unless there are not two such private \ninsurance plans in their area. In other words, a prescription drug \nbenefit through Medicare is only available as a so-called fallback.\n  In other words, if you are a senior in, let us say, a rural State \nwhere there are no private HMOs--speaking about my State of Iowa, we \ndon't have one Medicare-based HMO in the State of Iowa. Let us say you \nare in an area and you have two private plans. You don't have a choice \nother than those two. That is all you have. You have those two. If you \nare in a State where there are not two plans, then you can get \nMedicare. Let us talk about this. It is only a fallback position. If \nthe two plans aren't there, then you can get it through Medicare.\n  What Senator Stabenow's amendment says is that we want a prescription \ndrug benefit through Medicare that would be available to all seniors at \nall times so they can have a real choice. Under this amendment, this is \nhow it would change the bill.\n  You are in an area and you have two private plans. You could also \nhave Medicare. Now you have one of three choices. Under the bill here, \nyou have one of two choices. We are expanding the choices. We are \nsaying you can go with private plan A, private plan B, or Medicare. You \nhave the choice. If private plans are so desirable and they are so \ngood, then let them compete against a Medicare benefit. Let us see \nwhich one a senior chooses.\n  I found the arguments propounded by my friend and colleague from my \nown State of Iowa Orwellian at best. The chairman of the committee was \ntalking about choices. We want to give seniors choices. If a senior has \none of two choices, or one of three choices, which one gives the senior \nmore choices? The chairman of the committee said the first one that \noffers two plans gives them more choices. That is Orwellian. It is \nOrwellian-speak that somehow two choices are more than three choices. \nGo figure.\n  To me, this is the key issue that needs to be fixed in this bill. I \nam glad it is the first amendment because it is vital. I think it \nrepresents the fundamental difference between many on our side and many \non the Republican side on this bill.\n  I want to be very clear. I am not against a free market. I am not \nagainst the private sector or private health insurance plans. But the \nreality is that the private sector by its very nature leaves certain \ngroups of people behind, especially in the health care area.\n  Let us be honest about it. People with disabilities are not a \nprofitable group. You have a disability. Try getting insurance. Try it. \nThere is no money to be made there. People with mental illnesses are \nnot a profitable group. We have been trying for some time to get mental \nhealth parity. We still don't have it because the private sector \nunderstands they can't make money.\n  Guess what other group is not profitable? Senior citizens are not \nprofitable. They use more health care as they get older. So they are \nnot profitable.\n  If you look back in history, that is why we established Medicare in \nthe first place in the 1960s--to care for those people who were left \nbehind by the private sector.\n  I remember as though it were yesterday when my father was in his \nlater years and had health care problems. In the 1950s my father was \nthen in his early seventies. He had been quite disabled from working \nfor over 20 years in coal mines. He had ``miners lung,'' as they called \nit then. Later they called it ``black lung.'' He had had some \naccidents. He was now in his late sixties. He was in his early \nseventies in the 1950s. His health was in bad shape. He was on Social \nSecurity. That is all he had. He had no life savings. He had no \ndividends. He owned no stock. My father only went to the 8th grade. He \nworked most of his life in the coal mines. After that, he worked as a \nhandyman. All he owned was a small house on 1 acre of land. That is all \nhe had. Thank God he worked enough to pay into Social Security to get a \nSocial Security benefit. But he had no health care insurance. He had no \noutside sources of income. He had some young kids, me being one of \nthem. We had no outside source of income at all. My father's income in \nthe 1950s on an annual basis was probably around about--I would be \nsurprised if it was over $2,000 or maybe $2,500 a year at the most. He \ncouldn't get health insurance.\n\n  There was no one who would sell my father health insurance, even if \nwe could have afforded it. Later on, when a couple of his kids got out \nof college and we looked around to try to see if we could get some, no \none would cover him. He was now in his midseventies and had black lung \ndisease. He had a few other problems. Try to find an insurance program. \nThere were health insurance programs at that time. There were a lot of \nhealth insurance programs that covered a lot of workers at that time \nthrough their employment but they were not about to cover my father. \nThat would not have been profitable.\n  I remember when Medicare came in. My father got his Medicare card. \nNow he could go to the doctor and go to the hospital.\n  There are those of us who lived through this and saw our parents \ndenied health care coverage because they couldn't afford a private \nhealth care plan because the private health care plans left them \nbehind. We look at this bill and say: Wait a minute. You are saying you \nare going to have these two private plans out there but you are not \ngoing to have a Medicare choice?\n  We experimented with private health care and HMOs. Guess what \nhappened. Seniors all over the country were dumped by plans. They had a \nplan. They signed up. As soon as the plan saw they weren't making \nmoney, they said: We are out of town. So seniors were dumped. We didn't \nhave a law that said you had to cover them. They just walked away from \nit.\n  That is what is going to happen with this bill, too. Obviously, they \ncan do it on an annual basis. That is another point of this bill that \nis going to get highlighted. A plan could be in effect and they find \nout after a year they are not making enough money. Bang, they walk \naway. Then maybe another plan will come in. Oh, well. Maybe a senior \ncan sign up for that. What is the coverage, or the copay, or what is \nthe deductible? It may be different.\n  For years, Republicans have not so subtly wanted to privatize \nMedicare. There were public comments such as then-Speaker Newt Gingrich \nwho said about Medicare that he wanted to ``let it wither on the \nvine.''\n  I think when you read those statements and the statements by the \nthird ranking Republican in the Senate who said that the basic Medicare \nbenefit basically needs to be done away with, you get an insight into \nthe long-term goal of those on that side.\n  What they state is their support for including the private sector \nhere to take advantage of the efficiency by the experience and the \nvirtues of private competition. All well and good. I am all for \ncompetition and efficiency. But what happens is that this bill now \nbefore us relies on the participation of private plans to deliver this \ndrug benefit to our seniors. But you have to set the rhetoric aside.\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\n  The current structure of this bill before us invests unwisely in \nprivate health plans to provide the drug benefit for seniors, and it \nrestricts their choice. It restricts it. As I said, the Senator from \nIowa, the chairman of the committee, spoke about giving seniors \nchoices. That is exactly what the Stabenow amendment does. If they do \nnot want to be in Medicare, they can go out and get a private plan. But \nunder the bill before us, if they do not want to be in a private plan \nand want to stay in Medicare, they cannot do it.\n  Now, again, for some reason I am having trouble understanding this \nargument made by the chairman of the committee that somehow having two \nchoices gives you more choices than having three choices. Someone has \nto really explain this to me because that is what the Stabenow \namendment does. It gives you three choices: Medicare, plan A, plan B. \nThe bill before us gives you two choices: plan A or plan B.\n  Now, again, this is especially bad for seniors in rural States where \nprivate plans have shown no interest in participating in the Medicare \nprogram. Now, again, the scheme in this bill of having the private \nplans only--if there was some history to back this up, and the chairman \nof the committee talked about history. Well, OK, let's look at the \nhistory. We know from history the administrative costs in Medicare are \nmuch lower than in private health plans--2 to 3 percent a year compared \nto 15 percent in the private health care plans. We know that. That is \nfact. That is data.\n  We also know that over the past 30 years Medicare spending has grown \nat a slower rate than private health care spending; about 9.6 percent \nfor Medicare, over 11 percent for private health care plans. We know \nthat. It is factual. Yet ignoring this history, in the plan before us, \nthis administration and the Republican leadership in the Senate insist \non relying almost solely on private plans to provide this drug benefit \nto our seniors.\n  As I said, the bill before us might be reasonable if we had some past \nhistory to back up the fact that the private health care plans were the \nmost efficient. They want to talk about efficiency. The facts show that \nadministrative costs are about one-fifth--one-fifth--as much in \nMedicare as in private plans, 2 to 3 percent compared to 15 percent. So \nefficiency? Obviously, Medicare is more efficient.\n  And the cost, well, as I said, over the last 30 years Medicare has \ngrown at a slower rate than private health plan spending. So which \ncosts more, Medicare or private health care plans? Well, we have the \nfacts. We have the data. This cannot be ignored.\n  The only way you can ignore this data and these facts is if your \nideology trumps experience. If you have an ideology that says we are \ngoing to set up a system that will ensure that Medicare sometime in the \nfuture fails, I guess you could ignore facts, you could ignore the \nhistory. And that is really what this is all about, folks.\n  The result of all this private plan investment means there is less \nmoney available to actually help seniors get the drugs they need. It is \nestimated that the underlying bill will actually pay private insurance \ncompanies over $25 billion just to participate. Boy, talk about a \nsweetheart deal.\n  OK, let me get it straight now. We want only two private plans out \nthere in a region for seniors. The bill will not let Medicare compete. \nThat is what the Stabenow amendment does for us, it allows Medicare to \ncompete. The bill will not. So you have two private plans out there. \nBecause why? ``They are more efficient. They have more experience,'' et \ncetera, et cetera. ``They will have competition, and the competition \nwill keep the price down.'' Then why are we giving them $25 billion in \nsubsidies to get them into the program? You would think they would be \nknocking the doors of the Senate down rushing to get in on this.\n\n  Let me proffer a question. What if we took out the subsidies to the \nprivate insurance plans? How many would come into this program? Zero. \nNo, we are going to give them $25 billion. What if we took that $25 \nbillion and we put it into a prescription drug benefit? Well, we could \ncut down what? We could cut down the deductible, maybe. We could cut \ndown the copays. We could close the coverage gap--all of which would \nhelp our seniors. No, no, no. We are going to take $25 billion and we \nare going to help the private insurance companies. We are going to coax \nthem. I have a different word. We are going to bribe them. We are going \nto bribe them with $25 billion of money to come in here.\n  Talk about efficiency. Boy, isn't the private sector grand. Isn't \ncompetition wonderful when the Government comes in with your taxpayers' \ndollars and gives them $25 billion so they can offer some kind of a \nprescription drug plan.\n  I mentioned just a minute ago about how in the past private plans \nhave come into existence. Seniors join them, and then the plans close \ndown, leaving the seniors holding the bag. That is the history. That is \nthe data. That is what has happened. Because of the structure of this \nplan, seniors could be forced to switch plans and drugs on a yearly \nbasis--yearly--as private plans may join and then pull out of the \nmarkets.\n  So you have these two plans out there. Your grandparents, your \nparents, join plan B because it looks good for them, and it turns out \nmaybe the first year it is OK for them, but the plan they joined finds \nthey are not making enough money. Guess what. At the end of the year \nthey walk away.\n  Now, what do your grandma and grandpa do then? Well, they can go to \nmaybe plan A, or maybe another plan will come in, have a different \ncopay, different deductible, different this, different that. And I will \ntell you, if you think your health plan today is confusing--and it is. \nI look at my health care plan every year when the open season comes \naround and I try to make heads or tails of it. I was trained as a \nlawyer. I may not be a very good one, but I was trained as a lawyer, \nand reading these things is confusing, even for someone trained. Put \nthese plans out there for the average senior citizen to read every year \nof who gives what, what is the benefit--total confusion.\n  Then what happens? Well, people get confused. They get upset with the \nprogram. Seniors talk among themselves at their various groups and \nclubs, and they find out that Mrs. Jones over here, while she has an \nincome of $14,640 a year--guess what--her deductible and her copays are \nup here, they are high. Mrs. Smith, her friend and neighbor, who comes \nto the same club, her income is $14,639--$1 less--and she gets all hers \nfree. Think about that. Think about what this is going to mean to the \nelderly out there when they see: Wait a minute, my neighbor, my friend, \nthey get a few dollars more a year than I do. They pay. I get a few \ndollars less. I don't have to pay anything.\n  What is that going to lead to? Not only to confusion, it is going to \nlead to anger, and it is going to lead ultimately to seniors saying \nthat this whole system has to be changed. And that is the end result of \nwhat the Republicans want to do with this bill; that is, to strike a \ndagger to the heart of Medicare. Now they can't go after the heart \nright now, so you cut a few veins. You take a leg here and a leg there \nand an arm here and an arm there, and pretty soon Medicare is done for.\n  That is why this amendment by Senator Stabenow is so important. It \nfollows a simple and reasonable philosophy that says seniors who want \nto stay in traditional Medicare ought to have that choice. We are not \nforcing them. Senator Stabenow is not forcing any senior to stay in any \nplan. She is simply providing them the choice.\n  Again, as the chairman of the committee said earlier, as the \nPresident has said, they extoll the virtues of giving seniors more \nchoices. I say yes, let's give them more choices. This amendment does \nthat by doing two things. It gives seniors the option of staying in \ntraditional Medicare for all of their health care needs including \nprescription drugs. They have that choice. They don't have to if they \ndon't want to. And as Senator Stabenow has shown time and time again, \n11 percent of the seniors have said no, they don't want to stay in \nMedicare. Fine, if they want to go somewhere else, that is their \nprivilege. Her amendment would not change that whatsoever.\n  But the second thing the Stabenow amendment does is it guarantees our \nseniors, especially those who live in rural areas where private plans \nare less likely to participate, a reliable and consistent option that \nwill never leave them without coverage.\n  Throughout this debate, we have heard and will continue to hear our\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\nfriends on the other side, the Republicans, talk about how great \nprivate plans are, how they will control costs through competition. I \njust cited some statistics that show that historically this has not \nbeen true. The Stabenow amendment will make sure that every senior in \nevery State has access to a consistent benefit and the option of \nstaying in the Medicare Program.\n  I would think--maybe I am naive; I hope not--that if the chairman of \nthe committee and the Republicans really wanted to give choices to \nseniors, they would welcome this amendment. If you listen to our \nfriends on the Republican side and trust them, you will believe the \nprivate plans will provide a better benefit at a better price to \nseniors. If that is the case, what are they afraid of?\n  If the Republicans truly believe the private plans will provide a \nbetter benefit at a better price to seniors, why are they so afraid of \nletting seniors have Medicare as an option then? Because obviously they \nwould pick the private plan because it would be better than Medicare. \nSo what are they afraid of? Why would they not want this amendment? \nBecause, all rhetoric aside, the Republicans want to constrict choice. \nThey want to force seniors into private health care plans--force them--\nand only if there are not two plans available, then you get this \nfallback into Medicare. If it is good enough as a fallback, why not let \nit compete upfront?\n  I may have an amendment on this later in the week, but if these \nprivate plans are going to be so good and they are so good at \ncompetition and efficiency and so good at keeping prices down, why do \nwe have to give them $25 billion in subsidies? Let them go out there on \ntheir own. That is the private market. I don't think they need the \nsubsidies if they are truly going to provide this kind of a benefit. \nAgain, I am not arguing it now. I am saying that may come along later.\n  The Stabenow amendment provides seniors with three choices. The bill \nprovides them with two choices. So this amendment offers them more \nchoices than the underlying bill does. If what the Republicans want are \nmore choices, this is it. They should support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, on behalf of the leadership, I ask \nunanimous consent that following my remarks, Senator Graham of Florida \nbe recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes on the Stabenow amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                TENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS DECISION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank Senator Graham for allowing me \nto speak on a matter of utmost importance to my State. That accounts \nfor the consent that he would follow me. He was supposed to speak next.\n  I come to the floor to discuss a situation of grave concern in my \nState of New Mexico. On June 12, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals \nissued an opinion that puts the fate of a small endangered fish called \nthe silvery minnow ahead of the interests of the people of New Mexico. \nThis ruling has far-reaching implications for all Americans. It \nessentially favors fish over people.\n  This ruling requires that the Bureau of Reclamation reassess its \ncontractual obligations to provide water to the cities of Albuquerque, \nSanta Fe, and others--even water resulting from interbasin transfers. \nThe two judges issuing the majority opinion conclude that under the \nEndangered Species Act, the water needs of the silvery minnow come \nbefore the water needs of the people of my State.\n  This far-reaching opinion essentially says that the Endangered \nSpecies Act can be used to artificially create a drought. That is \nprecisely what is going to happen if the Bureau of Reclamation deprives \ncities, farms, and Indian reservations in my State of the water they \ndesperately need. The ruling says the Endangered Species Act can \npreempt anything and everything, essentially.\n  This opinion creates a new Federal right for endangered species. It \neffectively invalidates preexisting contracts and orders the \nimportation of water from another basin in violation of New Mexico law \nthat allows only for municipal use. In essence, it says even that water \nmust be used for the fish. The water resulting from the interbasin \ntransfer was never part of the ecosystem or the stream basin. It was \nbrought in for other purposes. Under the court's theory, no city, \ncounty, State, or agricultural community can reasonably expect a \npermanent water supply.\n  This is not what Congress intended when we passed the Endangered \nSpecies Act. This is not what I intended when I voted for the law. The \nconcurring opinion of Judge Porfilio says that the Endangered Species \nAct can undermine any contract with the Federal Government for the \nsupply of water resources if bureaucrats determine that an endangered \nfish or threatened species needs the water. As we saw with Klamath \nFalls 2 years ago, bureaucrats are often wrong in these affairs. But no \nmatter, according to the court, what Federal bureaucrats mandate in the \nname of ESA must be so, regardless of the devastating consequences.\n  Did any of us who voted for the Endangered Species Act believe we \nwere amending all Federal laws and contracts at the time of its \npassage? I certainly did not. Has anyone who has contracted with the \nFederal Government for a timber lease, mineral lease, for water, or for \nuse of Federal facilities included a clause that says such contract \nwill not be amended by action under the ESA? Because, according to this \nruling, if one didn't, the contract won't stand if a bureaucrat somehow \nor somewhere decides that a fly, a fish, or rodent needs that resource.\n  This decision cannot be allowed to stand. It threatens all Federal \ncontracts. It undermines the financial integrity of the United States \nof America and all of those with whom she contracts.\n  This opinion will be devastating for western water users at a time of \ngrowing crisis in the West. Currently, after years of drought, \nagriculture, States, cities, and counties are struggling to meet their \nwater needs now and in the future. There simply isn't enough water to \ngo around. Members of Congress have been deeply involved in trying to \nresolve this growing crisis. Now comes the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals with its announcement that the ESA preempts 75 years of \nexisting water law, all existing contracts, and the needs of the \nburgeoning western population. This ruling hobbles us in our efforts to \naddress the western water crisis.\n  Judge Kelly, in his dissent, rightly characterizes the ESA as a \nFrankenstein. Despite good intentions, this law has become a monster.\n  Congress never meant for this to happen. Yet, for years, we have \nstood by as our own law has wreaked havoc--oftentimes needlessly--in \nthe cooperative relationship of man and nature.\n  I believe there is a better way. I believe we can amend this law to \nbetter protect struggling species, while still respecting the authority \nof this Government, States, localities, and Indian tribes. I believe we \ncan amend this law to better protect struggling species, while still \nallowing people access to the resources we need to survive.\n  Critics have rightly pointed out that since the passage of the ESA, \nthe number of threatened and endangered species has increased \nexponentially. There are now more than 1,100 species on that list. Only \na handful have recovered since the passage of the ESA. Most of them, \nlike the bald eagle, recovered because we banned the use of DDT. I have \nnot seen evidence of any species that recovered because of abrogated \nwater rights, which is the principal issue discussed by this Senator \nregarding this opinion.\n  As this law is now written and interpreted by the courts, we are \nfailing our struggling species. We are also failing our citizens who \nlook to us, State, and local leaders, for access to the resources they \nneed to live.\n  This ruling says we cannot even guarantee them the very water they \nneed for survival, sanitation, and food. In fact, it says we cannot do \nthat by importing water into a river basin in which the fish lived \nbefore the importation. This decision says that even imported water for \nlocal use can and must be allocated for these fish. Government cannot \nfunction under such prescribed chaos.\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\n  Madam President, we must amend this law. I don't know when it will \nhappen, but I will ask this Senate to address this law and the far-\nreaching implications of this decision. I will have that ready soon so \nthat the first bill that goes through here can carry it along to \nfruition.\n  Certainty is the bedrock of western water law. That certainty is \ncritical for our people and our country and our economy and, yes, our \nenvironment, including the endangered species. Certainty is a must for \nendangered species also. The court, however, chose to abandon \ncollaborative efforts and the 2003 biological opinion and directly \nthreaten every interstate compact in America, established adjudication, \nand the intent of Congress.\n  These rights are all out the window by virtue of this 2-to-1 opinion. \nA request for a rehearing en banc will be made to the Tenth Circuit \nand, obviously, the State of New Mexico must take it to the Supreme \nCourt, if necessary. But I am going to look to the Senate--at least for \nNew Mexico and what I have described here today--for a way to fix it by \nstatutory prescription. I will be looking for the help of Senators \nwithin the next month or two on one of the bills that moves its way \nthrough here.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 931\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, if I am not mistaken, the pending \namendment is the one offered by the Senator from Michigan. I see the \nSenator from Florida, Senator Graham, who would like to address the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, I rise in strong support of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Michigan. We are about to \nundertake a massive social experiment. We are about to do it with the \n39 million older Americans, including some of the most vulnerable and \nfrail of our fellow citizens. Why do I say this is a massive social \nexperiment? Because there is no example in America of a freestanding \ndrug-only insurance policy as the means to gain access to prescription \ndrugs.\n  There are some very fundamental reasons why we don't do that in the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program, and why even the \npharmaceutical industry doesn't do it in distributing drugs to its \nemployees. There are two basic reasons why this is a first-of-a-kind \nsocial experiment. One is this is not an insurable risk. The example \nthat has been frequently used is the one of fire insurance. If you are \ngoing to purchase fire insurance, you buy it on the whole house, from \nthe bedroom to the living room, to the garage, to the kitchen. If you \nwere to go to your insurance company and say I don't want to insure the \nwhole house, I only want to insure the kitchen, the answer would be we \nwon't sell you such a policy because the kitchen is the most vulnerable \npart of the house to actually have a fire.\n  This is a similar proposition. Prescription drugs are the fastest \ngrowing part of the health care budget. Insurance companies don't want \nto sell a prescription-drug-only freestanding policy. That is seen in \nthe structure of this bill. Essentially, although the statement is made \nthat we are going to get better prices because of competition and the \nwillingness of insurance agencies to assume the risk, the Federal \nGovernment is assuming virtually all the risk under this plan. \nTherefore, all of the expectations and representations that we are \ngoing to have competition through that lower cost is a mirage.\n  The second reason is the fact that within health care, there are \ntradeoffs. As an example, just a few years ago the standard way of \ndealing with ulcers was surgery. Today there is almost no ulcer \nsurgery; the standard treatment is through prescription drugs.\n  What is the relevance of that? If you are only providing prescription \ndrugs, if you had a freestanding prescription drug only policy, all you \nwould have is the additional cost of prescription drugs. If you are \ninsuring the whole body, you get the savings of avoiding surgery while \nyou get the additional cost of providing the prescription drugs.\n  Those are just two of the reasons there is no other example of what \nwe are about to impose on 39 million old, many very sick, many very \nfrail, Americans as a social experiment. If we were going to do this, I \nthink what we ought to do is say we are going to change the Federal \nhealth insurance policy starting now and let us all be the experiment \nto find out whether such a freestanding prescription drug policy will \nwork.\n  We represent a much more diverse population--Federal employees. Many \nof us are younger, healthier than the Medicare population. We would be \na more appropriate guinea pig for this experimentation than to focus \nthis on the oldest and, in many cases, the most vulnerable of our \npeople.\n  A second concern I have about this approach is that it denies choice. \nUnder the structure of this bill, once the elderly have made two \nchoices, then they will not have any choice at all as it relates to \nprescription drugs.\n  The first choice they make is the choice that they are making today \nand have made for many years in the past: Will I get my total health \ncare coverage through traditional Medicare, the fee-for-service plan, \nor will I get it through some form of a managed care plan?\n  The jury has come in and rendered its verdict on that issue. Over 85 \npercent of America's elderly have decided they want to get their health \ncare through the traditional fee for service. The basic reason they \nwant fee for service is that is the true access to choice. Under fee \nfor service, they can decide what doctor, what hospital they wish to \nuse. Under the various managed care plans, they frequently are \nrestricted in their choice, and they have to use a gatekeeper in order \nto get to what choices are available.\n  We have had a big debate in this Chamber, a debate I anticipate we \nwill return to, and that is over the standards of managed care. That \ndebate was sparked because so many people have had a negative \nexperience with managed care, where services were denied or where they \ndid not have access to the physician they wanted for their particular \nneeds.\n  This whole debate about whether there should be some Federal \nstandards for HMOs is because of the actual real-life human experience \nof many Americans, including older Americans, as to how these managed \ncare systems work.\n  After the Americans have made the judgment as to which plan they wish \nto be in, then they will make a second judgment, and that is, under \nthis prescription drug plan, do they want to take advantage of it? It \nis yes or no as to whether they will participate in the prescription \ndrug plan.\n  Once they have decided, yes, I wish to participate, then they lose \ntheir choices. If they are in the traditional care plan and if there \nare not two or more standalone prescription drug plans, then they will \nbe forced to get their prescription drugs through the social experiment \nwith a freestanding prescription drug plan. If there is only one plan \nwhere they live, they will be denied access to that single plan and \nthey will have to get their drugs through traditional Medicare. I think \nthat is a denial of the fundamental option and choice which has been a \nkey part of the success of Medicare.\n\n  I also think denial of choice could well be the torpedo which will \nsink prescription drugs. We learned a lesson about 15 years ago when we \npassed something called catastrophic care which the Congress thought \nwould be received by the elderly with roses and flowers and applause. \nIn fact, it ended up being received by the chairman of the House Ways \nand Means Committee having his car turned upside down, there was so \nmuch objection to that plan.\n  I think we had better keep our cars in the garage after we pass this \nbecause we may experience the same thing, and this issue will be one of \nthe reasons, in my judgment, that there will be less elderly \nparticipation in the prescription drugs and an increased likelihood \nthat there will be a sufficient revolt that we will be forced, as were \nour predecessors, to repeal what we thought was going to be a very \npopular plan.\n  This prescription drug architecture only works if a very high \npercentage of the elderly sign up to participate. If the only ones who \nsign up are those who are already sick and using high levels of \nprescription drugs, this plan will crater as being actuarially \nunsustainable. If it is to attract\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\nenough of the elderly who are not sick and do not have high drug bills, \nwho will see this as a true insurance policy--that is, that they are \npurchasing this plan not just based on their current prescription drug \ncosts but because they believe they may someday become ill, sicker than \nthey are today, and get into this category of high cost--we must be \nable to attract that group of the elderly in order to make this plan \nsustainable.\n  I think one of the reasons the relatively healthy elderly will resist \njoining this is precisely this issue of the denial of choice. If I am \nan elderly person and I live in a rural area of Florida where only one \nprescription drug plan is available, why shouldn't I be able to elect \nthat one prescription drug plan or traditional Medicare? If, on the \nother hand, I am in an urban area where there are 20 freestanding \nplans, although I think this is a highly unlikely prospect, why \nshouldn't I be allowed to elect one of the prescription drug plans or \ntraditional Medicare?\n  Why? What is the rationale of us denying the elderly that important \nchoice when there is no evidence that the standalone plans are going to \nactually save money? This bill itself is the best evidence of its \nunlikelihood of doing so since the Federal Government is picking up \nmost of the risk that the standalone plans will, of their necessity, \nentail and while we are denying choice to elderly as to which of the \nvarious options they want to utilize.\n  I cannot conceive of why we are saying to America's elderly that they \nwill be denied the choice how they want to get their prescription \ndrugs, particularly when they have spoken so overwhelmingly of their \ndesire to stay in traditional fee-for-service Medicare for the rest of \ntheir benefits.\n  So for those who favor the approach we are taking, they ought to be \nthe strongest voices for the Stabenow amendment because it is one of \nthe key steps in assuring that this plan will be positively received by \nMedicare beneficiaries and will actually work once it is in place.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, those who favor the basic principles of \nthis plan and those who have reservations, to vote for this amendment \nbecause it is fundamental to achieving the results that are being \nsought, a broadly participated in prescription drug plan which is \nsufficiently attractive, including attractive through choice, for \nAmerica's older citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. Is there any consent now in effect \ndealing with who speaks next on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is none.\n  Mr. REID. The two managers asked if Senator Reed from Rhode Island \ncould speak for up to 5 minutes--is that right?\n  Mr. REED. Ten.\n  Mr. REID. Ten minutes. The Senator from Georgia only has 5 minutes to \nspeak generally on the bill. So I am wondering if the Senator from \nRhode Island would allow him to speak for 5 minutes?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. Is that right?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Georgia be \nrecognized for 5 minutes to speak on the bill generally and following \nthat the Senator from Rhode Island be recognized for 10 minutes to \nspeak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada and my \nfriend Senator Reed for being gracious enough to let me speak on this \nbill.\n  All of us who have served in this body over the past several years, \nwhether it is during our campaigns, going back home for town halls, or \nvisiting home over the weekends, have talked about the need for a \nprescription drug benefit within Medicare. We all agree on that. I am \nvery pleased that this week, as well as all of next week, we will be \ndebating this issue regarding the inclusion of a prescription drug \nbenefit within Medicare and the overall improvement of Medicare.\n  I am also very pleased that the particular bill that came out of the \ncommittee has certain options available for seniors in it. The one \nthing we tend to do from a legislative perspective is to put mandates \nand dictates on people, particularly when dealing with health care. \nThis particular bill does not do that. There are significant options in \nthis bill that Medicare beneficiaries are going to have with respect to \na prescription drug benefit. I think having these options in place is \ngoing to put competition in place within Medicare and allow the \nmarketplace to work.\n  There are senior citizens today that we all refer to, and now I would \nlike to concentrate on. I am talking about those low-income senior \ncitizens who have high drug costs that need to be taken care of. While \nI remain positive that we are developing a bill--and there are a lot of \npositive things within this bill--I am very concerned that we are \nreaching beyond what most of us in this body have talked about over the \nlast several years with respect to a prescription drug benefit; We are \ngoing way above and beyond providing that benefit just for those low-\nincome, high-monthly-drug-cost individuals who so desperately need this \nbenefit.\n  The reason I am so concerned is that from a fiscally responsible \nstandpoint, it is incumbent on us, as Members of this body and as \nmembers of the House, that we do not overreach and put a burden on the \nyoung people in this country. I don't want them coming back to us one \nday and saying, ``What in the world did you folks do to us in 2003 by \nimposing such a heavy financial burden on Medicare? Because of this \nprescription drug benefit, Medicare cannot remain solvent without \nincreasing payments going into Medicare.''\n  I have strong concerns that we are overreaching with this bill. That \nis why I am so pleased the Senator from Nebraska, the Presiding Officer \ntoday, and the Senator from Nevada, Senator Ensign, who have studied \nthis issue and have developed a substitute which may be offered as an \namendment. I look forward to having a healthy debate working with their \nlanguage in addition to the base bill coming out of committee. It is my \nsincere hope that we can find the right answers, and at the same time, \ncontinue to serve and provide a benefit to those people who so \ndesperately need it.\n  There is another issue that I want to make sure we are very \ndeliberate about and that we cover, and that is the issue regarding the \nability of our pharmacists, particularly in rural areas, to participate \nin this program. We cannot afford to have a one-size-fits-all benefit \nthat allows individuals to go straight to the manufacturing source for \ntheir benefits under this plan. These pharmacists, particularly in \nrural areas, deal with individual patients and customers on a daily \nbasis. They provide a service that not only benefits the patient and \nthe customer but benefits Medicare. Pharmacists give advice and counsel \nregarding the drugs that have been prescribed for them, and I think \nwithout question will save millions of dollars in future years in this \nprogram within Medicare.\n  Lastly, I could not stand up and talk about a prescription drug \nbenefit without recognizing that our drug companies over the years--and \nI happened to be sitting in the chair yesterday when Senator Dorgan was \ntalking about this, and Senator Dorgan is exactly right--have stepped \nup to serve seniors by providing significant amounts of drugs to low-\nincome individuals who simply could not afford to buy those drugs. \nThese companies offer monetary discounts on large quantities of drugs \nto seniors involved in their plans. One of those companies, Pfizer, \nhappened to be in my office today reiterated exactly what they have \ndone. This is a very positive thing we should all remember when we are \ntalking about our drug companies.\n  As we move forward with this bill for the next 2 weeks, I remain very \ncautious about where we are going to be at the end of the day. We do \nhave to make sure that we have a healthy debate in light of the fact \nthat we do have to provide a prescription drug benefit. We know a bill \nis going to pass, but we certainly need to send the right bill into \nconference with the House, so that when it comes out of conference it \nbenefits those folks who need it most, those low-income individuals \nwith enormous monthly drug bills. We should be able to look these young\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\npages in the eye and say we did not saddle them with a burden that will \nbe unaffordable years from now.\n  So I thank the Senator from Nevada for letting me interrupt and the \nSenator from Rhode Island for letting me come in and give my speech \nnow. I look forward to the debate over the next 10 days as we conclude \nthis at the end of next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 931\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Stabenow \namendment. I believe the Senator from Michigan has done exactly what is \nright, proper, and wise to do, which is to provide for a permanent \nfallback prescription drug benefit for our seniors in the context of \nthis new Part D drug program. Indeed, out of the 650-plus page of this \nbill, the proposal by the Senator from Michigan is the one that most \nclosely resembles what is familiar to seniors with regard to the \ncurrent Medicare Program. It is an important issue.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, roughly 32 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries enrolled in the proposed new Part D program \nwould receive their drug coverage through the fallback plan, at least \nduring the initial implementation of the program, so a significant \nnumber of seniors we already know will participate in these fallback \nplans.\n  The reason is because under the existing language of the bill, if two \nprivate companies are not prepared to offer pharmaceutical benefits in \na particular region, Medicare must have a fallback program for seniors. \nThat makes entirely good sense. The problem is, if and when there are \ntwo companies, this fallback provision evaporates. It goes away. What \nthis will lead to is instability and a circumscribed choice for \nseniors.\n  We can just imagine a senior who enters the fallback program may \nspend 1, 2, 3, or 4 years there, is happy with the program, satisfied \nwith the benefits, and suddenly they are told, no, this program is \ngoing away because there are now two competitors in the marketplace. It \ndoes not make sense. It circumscribes choice and it creates instability \nand uncertainty in a program that should be full of stability, \ncertainty, and choice. I hope we can adopt this amendment to ensure \nthat the Medicare fallback program is a permanent part of the Part D \nprogram.\n\n  Let me suggest something else. When we think of the dynamics of this \nproposed program, two pharmaceutical beneficiary management companies \ncome into a particular region knowing full well if one decides to go, \nthen Medicare would have to reconstitute this fallback program--\nexpensive--probably on short notice. That is tremendous leverage for \nother PBMs in the market to go back to the Medicare program and say, \nwait a second, we are leaving unless you provide additional incentives, \nadditional compensation, additional risk sharing.\n  That is a leverage point that I think will be exploited by \nbusinesses. It is a fair point to exploit. They can vote with their \nfeet. They can leave the region. That is tremendous power to put in the \nhands of any one plan--it is not the two; anyone could decide to go--\nand suddenly you have to constitute the standby.\n  If there is a permanent fallback program, that leverage does not \nexist. Automatically, the senior would choose or not choose to get \ntheir benefits from the fallback program. That is another important \naspect.\n  We also understand these managed care programs and pharmaceutical \nbenefit managers operate, obviously, to make a profit. They are \nprepared and capable of leaving on short notice if, in fact, they \nbelieve they are not realizing a profit.\n  We have seen this in my home State of Rhode Island, a state with a \nsignificant penetration of Medicare managed care. Thirty percent of \nbeneficiaries in Medicare in my State are enrolled in a managed care \nplan. There used to be several managed care plans, but most have left \nthe market, leaving essentially one insurance company providing these \nmanaged care benefits. When the other plans departed, we saw increases \nin costs to seniors and less generous terms offered by the surviving \ncompanies. Why? Simple. Competition slacked off; they did not have to \nbe as aggressive competing for seniors. That likelihood could happen in \nthis case.\n  Again, that is a strong argument for the Stabenow amendment, to have \nat least one plan that will be there, with permanent, defined benefits \nthat are not likely to change as other competitors drop out of the \nmarket. That is another selling point, a strong selling point, for the \nStabenow plan.\n  I believe this amendment is very important. It will go a long way to \nassuring seniors they are not part of some arbitrary experiment in the \nmarketplace, that there will be at least one plan that is always there, \nthat the benefits are well defined, and that plan will be an important \naspect of making sure there is market discipline as well as consumer \nchoice for seniors.\n  Some people might say: We cannot do this because we have a cap of \n$400 billion over 10 years that limits us. That is an arbitrary limit, \nobviously. In fact, it seems to me it is a limit that is not justified, \ngiven the generous tax cuts we have already provided to so many wealthy \nAmericans as opposed to those likely recipients of this package. This \narbitrary cap should not limit us from creating a program that we hope \nwill not only endure for a long time but will be efficient, effective, \nand attractive to seniors.\n  I believe if we pass the Stabenow amendment, we are going to make \nthis program much more attractive to seniors, give them confidence they \nhave at least one choice through the standby plan, that will not leave \nthe marketplace, that will not change benefits as competitive forces \nchange, that will be something they can count on. As well as receiving \npharmaceutical benefits, I think seniors are asking for something else, \nand that is confidence that their benefits will endure and not be \nephemeral.\n  As a result, I urge my colleagues to support the Stabenow amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues coming to the \nfloor in support of my amendment. I take a moment to reiterate what we \nare doing in this amendment.\n  We are indicating in this amendment we want to make sure every senior \nhas the choice of traditional Medicare for prescription drugs as well \nas a choice of HMOs or PPOs or other private sector plans. We are \ntalking about seniors wanting to have choice or the desire to give \nseniors choice.\n  The majority of seniors, as a matter of fact, like traditional \nMedicare. It is very clear. They either have chosen traditional \nMedicare or do not have any private options, and 89 percent of our \nseniors fall in that category. The majority have chosen Medicare or may \nlive in a rural area where they do not have the choice of a private \nplan but they are in Medicare and they have their coverage, they can \nchoose their doctor, they can live anywhere within their State or \nanywhere in the country and know the cost will be the same. It is \ndependable; it is available it them.\n  That is what we are trying to do, guarantee seniors will be able to \ncontinue to have that choice along with new options for those who live \nin an area where there is a managed care plan and they choose to go \ninto an HMO or PPO, that would be absolutely available to them. If they \nchoose another private insurance plan, assuming there are those \navailable to them, fine, that is certainly an option that we all agree \nshould be available to our seniors.\n  The question is whether we will shut off the choice the majority of \nseniors have already selected, the one they say they want. With all of \nthe talk about choices, what I hear from folks is not: Please give me \nmore insurance plans to wade through or to figure out how to get health \ncare; please give me more insurance bureaucracy to wade through each \nday. Seniors say: Update Medicare and cover prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\n  It is simple. They want their traditional Medicare, choose their own \ndoctor, choose their own pharmacy, to be able to make their own choices \nand to have them available regardless of where they are in the country, \nbut they want to make sure they have prescription drugs as well.\n  We know if health care in 1965 were like it is now, prescription \ndrugs would have automatically been covered. We know that. We also know \nin 1965, as I indicated earlier, Medicare came into being essentially \nbecause of a failure in the private market. That is not a criticism; it \nis a reality that covering older Americans certainly is more costly as \nwe use more health care. As we get up in age, we find we use more \nhealth care, we use more prescription drugs. There are fewer carriers \nwanting to cover. Certainly, way back in 1965, that was the case when \nhalf the seniors in the country could not find a private insurance plan \nor could not afford a private insurance plan available.\n  Medicare came into being in order to make sure that health care was \navailable for older Americans and for the disabled in our country. It \nwas a value statement about who we are and what we think is important. \nIt was an important value statement just as Social Security coming into \nbeing was a value statement about the fact we wanted to make sure there \nwas a basic amount of money for everyone to know there is a certain \namount of financial support available to them as they get older, as \nthey retire. It is a value statement. Medicare and Social Security have \nboth been great American success stories.\n\n  We are now at a point where medicine has changed, the delivery \nsystem, the way we provide care. Most of us go to the doctor's office \nand walk out with at least one prescription. We have the opportunity to \ntake medicine to keep us well, to manage our high blood pressure, \ncholesterol, or other issues that allow us to remain healthy and remain \nout of the hospital. These are all very positive. We also have the \nopportunity to avoid heart surgery by taking a pill or have other \noptions by taking medications that cause us not to have to go into \ninpatient care in the hospital.\n  A lot of good has happened. We are now at a point where it makes \nsense to update Medicare. The question is how to do that. We really \nhave two different views on how to do that.\n  One that I share says we should take a system that has worked and we \nshould make sure it is fully funded so our physicians and hospitals and \nhome health care and nursing homes have what they need to provide \nservices. That is another critical issue--the resources being pulled \nout of Medicare and the underfunding of Medicare which has caused \nproblems. We should provide full funding, and we should make sure it is \nmodernized to cover preventive efforts and that we cover prescription \ndrugs as a part of an integrated, modern health care system under \nMedicare. We should use more technology so there is less paperwork and \nmore streamlining, which I know is of great concern to health care \nproviders. We can do all that within the framework of Medicare, which \nhas worked so well. Why is that important? Because it is dependable, \nreliable, affordable, and it is a value statement about who we are as \nAmericans. That is one view.\n  Another view is we should move back to the model before Medicare came \ninto existence, and that is more of a reliance on private health \ninsurance plans. We hear from many insurance carriers that they are not \ninterested in prescription-only policies. They are not interested. It \nis different. Insurance usually means you provide insurance to a large \nnumber of people assuming only some of them will get sick or some will \nhave automobile crashes or some will have their homes burn down--not \neverybody.\n  In the area of prescription drugs for seniors, from an insurance \nmodel it is very different. In fact, when you cover people, you can be \nassured almost all of them, if not all of them, will in fact need your \ninsurance. They will need your coverage. So it is a very different kind \nof model than traditional insurance, where only some people use the \ninsurance but everybody is paying into a system and spreading the risk.\n  That is one of the difficulties we have had, trying to fit this model \nof private insurance into the fact that we are talking about private \ninsurance for health care, prescription drug care, where everyone who \nis buying the product will be using it. There are a number of questions \nabout how to fit that model in and make it work.\n  Then there are questions about why. Why do we do that? Why do we \npropose something that is complicated, that on the one hand provides \nchoice, which is good, from the private sector, but on the other hand \nis convoluted and complicated for those who want to stay in traditional \nMedicare and not make them make that choice. That is one of the \nquestions, Why is this happening?\n  From the pharmaceuticals' standpoint, they are very much opposed to \nseniors being under one plan, 40 million people in one place, to be \nable to negotiate large discounts in price. As a result of that, they \ncertainly have lobbied very heavily for a plan that divides seniors \ninto a lot of different places so they have less leverage to be able to \nlower prices and negotiate discounts. That is also a concern of mine.\n  We know also that under traditional Medicare, we actually save money. \nWe hear all the talk about market forces and lowering prices. In \nreality, facts show the opposite. In fact, commonsense I think shows \nthe opposite when we look at what is happening in the private sector \ntoday. The average small business has seen its insurance premiums \ndouble in the last 5 years. Certainly in Michigan, major high-tech \nmanufacturing in the State has seen 15 or 20 percent or more increases \nin the cost of private health insurance every year. Yet under Medicare \nwe see the costs going up about 5 percent a year.\n  We look at this and say: Wait a minute, we are talking about a plan \nthat costs more, not less. How does that make sense?\n  We also know, when we look at administrative costs, we are told by \nthose who have analyzed it that administrative costs for Medicare to \nadminister the program are about 2 percent. In the private HMOs in \nplace right now under Medicare, their costs are 15 percent for \nadministration. We are told that in the private sector they actually go \nhigher, that in some private plans it has been as high as 31 percent \nfor administrative costs.\n  We look at that and say, How does this make sense? We don't want 15 \npercent going into administration when it can be 2 percent so more of \nthose precious dollars that we have can then go into buying medicine. \nThat would seem to make sense.\n  There are a number of different reasons I believe it makes sense to \nmake sure the real choice seniors want to have, which is traditional \nMedicare, is one of the choices available to them. I personally believe \nit will save dollars. It will allow the money we have to be used more \nfor purchasing medicine and for health care rather than for \nadministration or other kinds of costs.\n  Medicare is a nonprofit system by design. I know there are \ndifferences in philosophy about a for-profit system under health care \nversus a nonprofit system. But the majority of hospitals in this \ncountry are nonprofit. The Medicare system itself is set up so that \nevery dollar possible goes into care. I believe that is a model we \nshould continue. I believe it is a model, although it can always be \nimproved--and I would be the first to say we can improve and streamline \nthe Medicare system--fundamentally it has worked for people. It has \nbeen there. It has been a system that has held down costs. It has been \ndependable and reliable for every single person who is an older \nAmerican, or for a disabled person in our country. I wish we would \nembrace it rather than talk about dismantling it.\n  I ask colleagues to come today, as we vote on this amendment, and \njoin together to provide real choice for our seniors, the choice they \nare asking for as well as every other choice. Let's make sure every \nchoice they might want to have they could have, including traditional \nMedicare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to respond to the Senator from \nMichigan. I think she makes a number of points that are worth our \nconsideration. I think this can be done through the Government route. \nBut the grand experiment here is predicated on a belief that the \nmarketplace can actually work.\n  If we were to adopt the Stabenow amendment, it would clearly \nundermine the private sector from forming plans and offering prices \nwhich have the potential of very real savings for our seniors and \nproviding us with some very real reforms which seniors are counting on; \nthat is, that we provide this benefit without undermining the financial \nintegrity of Medicare.\n  We need to make up our minds. We can either go the Government route \nor we can go the market route. The Government route can work but it \ncomes at a cost that is, frankly, hard to calculate.\n  Even as we speak, right now on Part B Medicare, the Government is \nlooking at gross overpayments already on prescription drugs and is \nhaving to make reimbursements because of that.\n  Imagine all of the inefficiencies that would be infused into the \nsystem if we relied upon the Federal Government to manage every \nprescription drug for every senior in this country. If they are \noverpaying on one and wasting money at the same time, I hate to think \nof the bill the Federal Government would have to foot if we did this \nfor every senior on the basis that the Senator is describing.\n  Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office has just announced an \ninitial estimate of what the Stabenow amendment would cost, which is an \nadditional $50 billion over 10 years. Without a doubt, with the budget \nthat provides $400 billion over 10 years, this would exceed that by $50 \nbillion. I am sure at some point a manager of the bill will make a \nbudget point of order. It has come at a significant additional cost of \n$50 billion.\n  Again, I return to the point that we can either let the marketplace \nwork or we can let the Government do it. But if you have a permanent \nGovernment backup as opposed to a fallback provision until the \nmarketplace develops, you will retard, if not destroy, the marketplace \nfrom ever developing. It is that simple.\n  The predicate of the compromise between Republicans and Democrats \nthat has been a result of the prescription drug benefit coming to our \nseniors is that we are going to have a fallback. But we are going to \ngive the marketplace a chance. We are going to see which one works. As \nfor me and my money, I am placing my bet on the marketplace, if we \nprovide an economic structure for it to develop. If it develops, it \nwill give real hope and a real renewed life to Medicare, and it will \ngive our seniors the benefit they need of a prescription drug \nimmediately. I think that is the better vote. I think it is the better \nway.\n  I think we know how Government works. When it is necessary for a \nGovernment bureaucrat to be between you and your medicine cabinet, I \nshutter, frankly, at the inefficiencies that can come from that; \nwhereas, if you allow the marketplace to work--as with PPOs which the \nPresiding Officer and I have as Federal employees--frankly, they can \ntake a holistic approach to your health by including prescription \ndrugs. It gives us a very real chance to give our seniors a program \nthat includes prescription drugs, which includes holistic health care, \nand which doesn't rely on a Government formulary and Government price \nsetting to determine what drugs you can have and what they are going to \ncost.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Stabenow amendment because it \nundermines entirely the bipartisan agreement that has been arrived at \nin the Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, my friend from Oregon was speaking about \nmedicine cabinets. On the question of whether you want a for-profit \ninsurance company or a bureaucrat between you and your medicine \ncabinet, or whether you want Medicare, which we have known and relied \nupon since 1965, I appreciate that there is a different view and \nphilosophy. I think there is a fundamental difference in ideology that \nis working here.\n  It is interesting. I had a chance to go back to the debates when \nMedicare was first developed. The same kind of differences occurred at \nthat time and the same debate about whether or not we should provide \ncare under one plan under Medicare that is stable and reliable or use \nthe private market private insurance company. The very same kind of \ndebate was going on then that is going on now.\n  I believe the right choice in 1965 was Medicare. I believe it \ncontinues to be one of the choices that makes sense to offer to \nseniors.\n  I wish to respond to the Congressional Budget Office estimate. It is \ndisappointing to me to find that they have chosen to score it at $50 \nbillion above the $400 billion. We have worked with them. In fact, we \nmade it clear that the intent of this amendment was not to add $1 to \nthe budget resolution. It is to use the $400 billion and within that to \nhave a carve-out or choice of Medicare. In fact, so as to guarantee \nthat, we included at the end of the bill an authority to prevent \nincreased costs. If the administrator--in this case we are talking \nabout HHS--determines that Federal payments made with respect to \neligible beneficiaries enrolled in a contract under this section exceed \non average the Federal payments made with respect to eligible \nbeneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug plan or \nMedicareAdvantage, the administrator may adjust the requirement or \npayment under such a contract to eliminate such excess.\n  The reason we have included that is to guarantee that it is within \nthe $400 billion parameter. If, in fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has not looked at that, it is unfortunate. I would disagree with \ntheir analysis.\n  I indicate again that this is not about changing the budget \nresolution or the amount of dollars. It is about creating the best \nchoice or one more choice. It may not be the best for an individual. \nThey may decide that going through a PPO or an HMO or some other part \nof the alphabet might be a better choice for them. The question is \nwhether people will have a full range of choices including the choice \nthat the overwhelming number of seniors have told us they want.\n  The intent of this amendment is in fact not to add anything to the \ncost of this particular bill.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator from Michigan \ndescribe her amendment. I have to say I would be concerned about a \nGovernment-run prescription drug benefit because of what it would do to \nour free enterprise system and our capability to have competition which \nI think is very important. I think the underlying bill provides the \ncompetitiveness that will be so important for a balanced system, and it \nis also one that will give seniors the best prices and the best \nchoices.\n  I would like to make a statement in general about the bill we have \nbefore us. I have to say that we have been talking about reform of \nMedicare for years--maybe for the 10 years I have been here. But today \nwe are now talking about a real bill and maybe a real chance to reform \nthis very important program.\n  I think it is clear that any time there is reform we must include a \nprescription drug component. We must have a choice which is similar to \nthat in the private sector, and we must admit that Medicare has not \nkept pace with the rapid changes in our health care system.\n  As our research community pushes the envelope and develops lifesaving \nmedicines and procedures, our Nation's health care system must take \nthat innovation into account or it will not be the greatest health care \nsystem in the world.\n  Pharmaceuticals have revolutionized medical care. Increasingly, \nailments are treated with medication as opposed to invasive surgeries. \nIt is imperative that those who rely on Medicare have access to \naffordable prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\nWhen Medicare won't pay for medicine to treat diabetes but will pay for \nthe amputation of a limb caused by complications of diabetes, I think \nwe can admit that we have a problem.\n  A prescription drug benefit alone is not the answer. True reform must \nprovide our Nation's seniors the freedom to choose physicians and \nbenefits based on their individual needs. If a beneficiary is satisfied \nwith existing coverage, the beneficiary should have the option to stay \nput. But if she chooses to enroll in a private insurance PPO or HMO, \nshe should be allowed that choice. This choice is incorporated in the \nunderlying bill.\n  Also, I have an amendment, cosponsored by Senators Kennedy, Durbin, \nSpecter, and Talent, to restore cuts in Medicare reimbursement to \nteaching hospitals. Texas hospitals are facing the loss of $26 million \nin 2003 due to Medicare reimbursement cuts. Nationwide, teaching \nhospitals will lose $794 million this year and $4.2 billion over the \nnext 5 years. Every State will be similarly affected.\n  Teaching hospitals are experiencing a terrible financial crisis. My \namendment restores the fiscal year 2002 level of reimbursement for \nindirect medical education--they are called IME payments--to teaching \nhospitals. This allowance has been cut incrementally since the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 from 7.7 percent to 5.5 percent in fiscal year 2003.\n  Teaching hospitals have higher costs due to their critical role in \neducating tomorrow's physicians. They run more tests, they have newer \ntechnology, and they require more staff because they are training our \nfuture health professionals. The additional payment is vital to \ncontinuing this training. A disproportionate percentage of the most \nseriously ill and injured patients recover and convalesce in teaching \nhospitals. These hospitals have 78 percent of all trauma centers and 92 \npercent of all burn beds.\n  Although only 21 percent of all hospitals are teaching hospitals, \nthey deliver over two-thirds of charity care. They conduct \ngroundbreaking research. The University of Texas Medical Branch in \nGalveston--as one example in my State--will lose $1.9 million in these \npayments this year if the amendment is not adopted. UTMB leads research \non anthrax, smallpox, and plague. We cannot afford to have teaching \nhospitals cut back on research that benefits every individual.\n  In the budget we passed earlier this year, $400 billion was set aside \nfor Medicare reform. It is our responsibility to use that $400 billion \nwisely and to bring this incredible program into the 21st century so \nthat America's seniors will have the medical coverage they need and \ndeserve.\n  I think the bill before us needs work. We all agree that it is not a \nperfect bill and we want to make it better. We want to make sure it \ndoes two basic things: that it increases the quality of health care for \nour seniors, and, secondly, that it does so at a reasonable price for \nour future generations. We do not want another huge commitment that is \ngoing to turn into an entitlement that is unbearable in the future. But \nwhen Medicare will cover the cost of a hospital stay for 5 days for the \namputation of a limb but it will not allow you to pay for the medicine \nthat will keep you from having to amputate that limb, something is \nwrong in the system, and we must fix it. This time we can do it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate and \nlistening to the distinguished Senator from Michigan. If you love the \nFederal Government and the Federal Government's control over all of our \nlives, boy, this is the program for you, because it certainly would fly \nin the face of everything we have been trying to do to create a program \nwhere you have some options, some choices, and where people can make \ntheir own decisions as to what type of health care they want, seniors \nin particular.\n  So I rise in opposition to the Stabenow amendment. The way I \nunderstand the amendment, it would require a permanent fallback to be \noffered to beneficiaries in addition to the private stand-alone drug \nplans. Making the fallback plan a permanent option will completely \nundermine the very structure upon which this bill is built.\n  First and foremost, including a permanent fallback plan creates an \nuneven playing field. Frankly, we hope the Government fallback plan is \nnever needed. The only reason it is in this bill is to take care of \nthose situations where there are no bidding competitors to provide the \nhealth care. We believe there would be bidding competitors, and there \nis no real reason to have a fallback other than in those rural areas or \ntough areas where it is uneconomical for business to compete for the \nbusiness, where you are going to need a no-risk, Government sponsored \nand subsidized, and completely controlled fallback plan.\n  So first and foremost, including a permanent fallback plan creates an \nuneven playing field. The Government fallback is a non-risk-bearing \nentity. The fallback plan will operate in regions without any risk for \ngains or losses. The Government pays for the fallback plan's \nadministrative costs associated with delivering the drug benefit. If we \nmake the fallback plan permanent, as the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan would do, we are basically requiring privately delivered drug \nplans, which are at least partially responsible for bearing the risk of \ndelivering this benefit, to enter this same market and compete with \nthese Government fallback plans.\n  This would not only be unfair, but it also sets up our drug plan for \nfailure. There isn't a private health plan out there that will enter \nsuch a lopsided market where we give their competitors such a large \nfinancial advantage. Simply put, this amendment would discourage the \ninitial entry of private plans, dooming the effort to provide \nbeneficiaries the drug benefit through competing private plans with all \nof the cost savings and benefits that would come from competition.\n  In addition, including a permanent fallback plan would add billions \nof dollars to the cost of this bill. CBO estimates that the cost of \nthis fallback plan would be at least $50 billion over 10 years. So, \nliterally, by including a permanent fallback plan that will cost $50 \nbillion-plus over 10 years to the cost of this bill, we would be \nrelying, at least partially, on an inefficient, more costly, \nGovernment-controlled, Government-style delivery system to provide \nbeneficiaries with drug coverage.\n  When the Senate was debating the Medicare prescription drug issue \nlast year, this was one of the biggest criticisms against the Graham \ndrug benefit. The Graham drug benefit plan created a one-size-fits-all \ndrug benefit delivered by the Federal Government. This is not what \nMedicare beneficiaries want.\n  Beneficiaries want choice in drug coverage. They do not want to be \nforced into a Government-run plan and offered a one-size-fits-all \nbenefit. The Stabenow amendment would place the drug benefit right back \nin the hands of Government-run health care, Government micromanagement, \nand, worst of all, price controls. Government bureaucrats would \nultimately put the Government in charge of setting drug prices. We \nsimply do not want Government bureaucrats in charge of setting drug \nprices. We want the private market to make these decisions, not the \nFederal Government.\n  My colleague from Florida was just reminiscing about the 1988 \ncatastrophic law. I was here. I argued against it. We all saw the \npeople jumping up and down on Danny Rostenkowski's car when they \nrealized they had to pay for their drug expenses. Well, you can imagine \nwhat is going to happen if we have Government take over this program.\n  If this amendment passes, we will be creating another Medicare \ncatastrophe. In fact, we already know the Federal Government does not \ndo the best job of reimbursing for prescription drugs due to years of \noverpayments for the drugs already covered under Part B of Medicare.\n  Medicare has been overpaying for Part B drugs for years because of \nits inability to keep up with the marketplace. The intent of S. 1 is to \nintroduce a new model to deliver care to Medicare beneficiaries. We \nwant to offer Medicare beneficiaries a meaningful drug benefit. This \ndrug benefit will include multiple choices but it only works when all \noptions are expected to participate under the same rules. You\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\ndon't set it up so that all the options that have a chance of working \nfail because you have a government-run, government-subsidized, \ngovernment-controlled, government-bureaucratized program, which is \nexactly what the Stabenow amendment would establish.\n  Those who are extremely liberal will love that program, because it \njust means Government controls every aspect of our lives in health \ncare. In S. 1, we included the Government fallback as a safety net to \nensure that every senior has access to pharmaceutical drug coverage. \nBut it is a fallback of last resort. We hope we will never have to have \na fallback plan for any region or any area. But it is a last resort, if \nwe need it. That is because even the Congressional Budget Office \nconcludes that the permanent fallback plan is a more costly, less \nefficient model to deliver pharmaceutical benefits.\n  Again, let me remind everybody that the CBO says the Stabenow \namendment will cost at least $50 billion over the next 10 years. \nKnowing the Government as I do, I say at least $50 billion. It will \nprobably be a lot more than that. It will take all the incentives to \nkeep costs down out of the program, as we take away risk, which is what \nthe competing companies have to meet. They have to meet risk factors.\n  In conclusion, the Stabenow amendment would deny Medicare \nbeneficiaries the opportunity to enroll in the plan that best fits \ntheir needs. They would be denied that opportunity. The Stabenow plan \nwould force all our seniors into a government-run, government-\ncontrolled, government-bureaucratized drug benefit. It would basically \nundermine every possible competitive aspect that might possibly hold \ncosts in line and bring them down.\n  This amendment by the distinguished Senator from Michigan would \neffectively deny beneficiaries a private plan option thus denying \nbeneficiaries a choice in drug coverage, one of the fundamental \nprinciples of this bill--choice, the right to pick the coverage you \nwant. That is what our prescription drug program would give \nbeneficiaries.\n  There are those who believe that socialism is the answer to \neverything. Let government do it. Government can do it more \nefficiently. If you believe that, you haven't watched the last 50 \nyears. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment because it will \ntake away important drug coverage choices for Medicare beneficiaries. \nIt will lead us into a situation where Government is going to control \neverything, and, as a result, Medicare beneficiaries will be left with \nno choices in drug coverage. I don't want to go back to those days when \nthey were jumping up and down on Danny Rostenkowski's car because the \nsenior citizens realized they had to pay for it. I want to give \nMedicare beneficiaries choices and make sure there is some competition \nin the marketplace so that the choices will be good ones. I don't want \nto go to just a one-size-fits-all government program which literally \nwill not work except at a tremendously costly expense to U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Stabenow \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want a medicare prescription drug plan \nthat benefits seniors--not a plan that benefits insurance companies. \nThat is why I am a cosponsor of the Stabenow amendment.\n  This amendment gives seniors a choice: to get their prescription \ndrugs through traditional Medicare or through a private insurance \ncompany\n  Why is this important? Because it lets seniors choose the program \nthat fits their needs. Seniors trust Medicare. It has provided a safety \nnet for seniors for almost 40 years. Medicare hasn't let them down.\n  We can't say the same about insurance companies. We have been down \nthat road in Maryland with Medicare+Choice. The insurance companies \ncame in. They enticed seniors with promises of better care and \nprescription drugs. They took the money from our seniors and left town \nleaving over 100,000 Maryland seniors without coverage.\n  Seniors in my State were gouged and abandoned. So I don't trust \ninsurance companies to be there for seniors. I trust seniors to make \ntheir own decision to decide which prescription drug plan is best for \nthem.\n  Seniors trust Medicare. When given an opportunity, I think seniors \nwill choose Medicare. In the mid-1990s, when Medicare HMOs offered \nprescription drug benefits. Only about 15 percent of beneficiaries \nsigned up.\n  Yet year after year, Senate Democrats have fought off efforts to \nprivatize Medicare--to force seniors to leave their family doctors and \njoin HMOs and other private plans. We heard Newt Gingrich talk about \nmaking Medicare ``wither on the vine.'' Then this year, the President's \nprescription drug proposal would have forced seniors to leave the \nMedicare they trust to get the drugs they need.\n  I believe honor thy mother and father is not just a good commandment \nto live by. It is good public policy to govern by. That is why I feel \nso strongly about Medicare.\n  Medicare is not the problem. It is the solution. That is why Congress \nmust now provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors. To benefit \nseniors--not to benefit insurance companies. We must do it now--to help \nseniors, to help families, top help American business and to help our \neconomy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Stabenow amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelationship to the pending amendment No. 931 occur at 3:15 today with \nno amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote and 5 minutes \nfor debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today the amendment be \nset aside and Senator Enzi then be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the senior Senator from \nIllinois is on the floor. I am wondering how long the Senator wishes to \nspeak on the Stabenow amendment. If the Senator from Oregon would allow \nthe Senator from Illinois to speak until 2:15 on the Stabenow \namendment.\n  Mr. SMITH. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask for a modification; that we be recognized for \n10 minutes; following that, Senator Enzi be recognized after the \nStabenow amendment is set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Is there objection to the \nmodified request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Pursuant to the unanimous consent request, it is my \nunderstanding I am recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at about 3:15 we will have a chance to \nvote on an amendment. It is an important amendment to the prescription \ndrug plan, an amendment offered by my colleague and friend Senator \nStabenow of Michigan, who has been our leader in the Democratic caucus \non the prescription drug issue. There is no one who has put more time \nin it. Senator Stabenow is going to give the Senate a very basic choice \nto make.\n  Under the Grassley-Baucus bill, a senior citizen, once this goes in \neffect after the Presidential election, will take a look at the area \nthey live in and if they can find two private providers for \nprescription drugs, they have to choose between the two of them. If \nthey can't find two that will provide that protection, that service, \nthen there will be a Medicare plan known as a fallback plan which the \nsenior can turn to, but it is not a plan that will be administered by \nMedicare. It is a plan that will be administered by a private provider \nunder Medicare. So no matter where you turn as a senior under this \nplan, you are always going to find a private provider, a private \ninsurance company.\n  The Republicans, many who support the bill, argue that is real \ncompetition. Senator Stabenow takes it to another level and says, if \nyou want real competition, one of the options that should always be \navailable to the senior is to go to a prescription drug plan \nadministered by Medicare itself.\n  Why would you want a Federal agency to administer this plan? I will \ngive you two reasons. First, there is no profit motive. Medicare is \nbasically going to be involved in this to try to provide\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\nthe service, and we know that the services they provide are at a lower \nadministrative cost than any private insurance company. No. 2--and this \nis where the rubber meets the road--Medicare can say to the drug \ncompanies, we want you to be part of the Medicare alternative; \ntherefore, tell us what you will do to contain the cost of your \nprescription drugs. So they have bargaining power on behalf of seniors \nto reduce the overall cost of drugs that are offered to seniors, a win/\nwin situation.\n  Does it work? Go to the Veterans' Administration hospitals. Look what \nthey have accomplished. They said to the drug companies, you want to \nsell drugs to veterans, great. But tell us the best price you will give \nus, and the best price offered at veterans' hospitals to the men and \nwomen in uniform is 40 to 50 percent below what seniors are paying over \nthe counter for their prescription drugs across America today. So if \nyou go to the Stabenow alternative, a Medicare-administered plan, no \nprofit motive, low administrative cost and a formulary, a group of \ndrugs that has been discounted for seniors, it is an absolute win \nsituation for seniors and for the Government and for the cost of the \nprogram.\n  Those who are arguing for competition on the other side say, just let \nthese private providers get at it. Boy, they will really show you how \nthey can bring prices down. They live in fear that if Medicare is \ninvolved in it, Medicare will show them how prices can really come \ndown. That is what this is all about.\n  I hear these arguments on the floor from people who I respect saying \nthe Stabenow amendment is going to limit choices. The heck it will. The \nStabenow amendment gives to seniors the real choice, the Medicare \nchoice, the choice that they want.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Michigan if she will respond to \na question. She has a chart that shows the interests of senior citizens \non this issue. If this is any indication, how would the senior citizens \nvote on the Stabenow amendment?\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, I thank my colleague for his eloquence. It is \ntrue that 89 percent of the seniors in this country are in traditional \nMedicare. Only 11 percent are currently in managed HMO plans. Since \n1997, seniors have been given a choice between what has been called \nMedicare+Choice and traditional Medicare. Overwhelmingly, they have \nstayed in Medicare.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator's amendment limit the choices for \nseniors--\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely not.\n  Mr. DURBIN.--when you compare it to the underlying bill?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely not. What we are doing is saying, instead of \ntwo private insurance plans, we add a third, so instead of two choices, \nyou have at least three.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Again, let me ask, through the Chair, if I might, is it \nnot true that if Medicare then can offer this plan on behalf of tens of \nmillions of seniors, Medicare can go to the drug companies and say: All \nright, you want to sell us Celebrex or Zoloft or whatever; what is the \nbest price you will offer Medicare?\n  Isn't that more of an assurance that the prices seniors will pay \nunder that alternative will be lower?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. The Senator from Illinois has hit what I \nthink is the most critical point, and the reason there is such \nopposition, certainly from the pharmaceutical industry, to what we are \ntrying to do through Medicare. They don't want the majority of seniors \nin one insurance plan together in Medicare where they can force a group \ndiscount. They would like to divide seniors up in lots of different \ninsurance plans and not give them the leverage to bring prices down.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Also, I ask, under the underlying Grassley-Baucus bill, \nwhat force is there for cost containment? What kinds of elements are in \nthat bill that will help bring down the cost of prescription drugs for \nAmerica's families and America's seniors if we don't put Medicare into \nthe process bargaining on their behalf?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I don't see anything in here that brings it down. In \nfact, what we are doing in the underlying bill is adding the profit. We \nare putting for-profit business into this process, so you are actually \nadding to the cost of this system. I don't see anything in here that \nwill bring prices down. I think that is why the pharmaceutical industry \nis very supportive of this plan because, unfortunately, the average \nretail price of an advertised brand is going up three times the rate of \ninflation. This does nothing to address that and bring the prices down.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  While I still have a minute or two, I will just say this. Time and \nagain, our friends on the Republican side of the aisle say we should \ncontract out Government services, privatize them, to save the taxpayers \nmoney. They say, if you will just get it away from the Government \nbureaucracy and put it into the private sector, we will show you how to \nreally provide a service at a low cost. Sadly, many times that doesn't \nhappen. The costs go up, the quality is not good, and we are stuck with \nprivate-side contractors when we contract out.\n  Now we have an interesting turn of events. We hear from the \nRepublicans and conservative side that we don't want a Government \nagency to be able to compete with the private sector. We don't think \nthat is going to be fair. There is no real choice there.\n  There is a choice. I think the choice is obvious. If Medicare--\nspeaking for the vast majority of senior citizens--can bargain for \nlower prescription drug prices, the winners will be not only the \nseniors who will pay less but the taxpayers who will pay less. The $400 \nbillion in this bill will go a lot further if we can have lower cost \nprescription drugs.\n  I say to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, don't be \nafraid of competition, and don't be afraid if one of the competitors is \nMedicare. The seniors who you represent have already voted on this \nissue by a 9-to-1 margin. They prefer traditional Medicare. We should \nnot be afraid of it.\n  The Stabenow amendment is a step in the right direction. It says if \nwe are going to have a prescription drug plan that Americans can afford \nand that the taxpayers can afford to pay for, yes, we need to have cost \ncontainment. This bill has little or none. The Stabenow amendment \nbrings in real competition and, unless that competition is there, let \nme tell you what we have done; we have said we will subsidize \nprescription drug costs no matter how high they go. Mark my words, as \nhistory has proven, they will continue to increase to a point where it \nbankrupts the current bill before us.\n  The Stabenow amendment is, I think, not only a stand for common sense \nbut a guarantee that competition will really be there to protect \nseniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time. I am not sure \nwhat the allocation of time is right now.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Michigan and the Senator \nfrom Illinois for their work on this particular amendment. I think I \ncan say for most, if not all, of our caucus members, this is the most \nimportant amendment as it relates to this bill, in large measure \nbecause it goes to the essence of what it is we believe we need to do.\n  What we have said from the very beginning is let's build on what we \nhave achieved in the Medicare system now for the last 38 years. \nObviously, we know there are ways in which the program needs to be \nupdated and reformed. I think there is common agreement among \nRepublicans and Democrats that if we are to reform Medicare, the single \nmost important priority is to ensure that we recognize that health care \ndelivery has changed dramatically in the last 40 years.\n  Health care delivery now is largely outpatient. Far more people get \ntheir health care in an outpatient setting than they do inpatient. With \nthat recognition, we made a decision in the 1960s that was wrong. We \nsaid we would reimburse drug costs in a hospital but we would not \nreimburse drug costs outside of a hospital or doctor's office. Well, \nhad we decided back then that we would reimburse drug costs regardless, \nwe would not be here today. So we made a decision based on, I am sure, \na lot of different factors--cost was probably important--that we wish \nnow we could have reversed a long time ago. But that, in essence, is \nwhat we are talking about with reform. It is a recognition that health \ncare delivery itself has changed.\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\n  The real question is, What will be the mechanism by which seniors \nacquire these prescription drugs? There are those who have suggested \nthat seniors ought to have choice. I have heard the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan say so eloquently that if you are in favor of \nchoice, you will be in favor of this amendment because that is \nbasically what we are proposing--choice. We are saying to seniors, if \nyou think you can find a better plan out there somewhere, offered \nwithin your region, take it. This is a voluntary program. We are not \nmandating that you do anything. But if you think Medicare has provided \na good service and if you think, in order to be consistent with the \nspirit and the concept of Medicare to begin with, that it ought to be \noffered through the Medicare system, you ought to have a right to \nchoose that as well.\n  Why in Heaven's name would we deny a senior the right to stay within \nMedicare when they get their doctor and hospital benefits through \nMedicare? They ought to get prescription drugs through Medicare. So \nthat is, in essence, what the Senator from Michigan is suggesting with \nher amendment. Let's allow choice; let's allow consistency.\n  But I think it goes beyond the choice of the senior citizens. The \nreason it ought to be our choice occurred again last night to me as I \nlistened to some of the debate in the House Committee. The question was \nasked last night: Can you tell us what the administrative costs will be \nfor the private sector systems providing this new prescription drug \nbenefit? On record last night during that debate the answer was given: \n25 percent.\n  The administrative costs for the private sector plans is anticipated \nto be 25 percent. That means out of the $400 billion we are committing \nto the drug program under this legislation, $100 billion could go to \npaperwork.\n  We have asked what is the administrative cost of the Medicare system, \nand we are told by CBO and others that the administrative cost today \nfor Medicare is between 3 and 4 percent. So we could save upwards of 20 \npercent if we had an opportunity for seniors to use the Medicare \nsystem. That is another reason that choice would make sense to us--to \nkeep administrative costs down.\n  We only have to look to the Veterans Administration to see how \neffectively they have controlled costs, not only administratively but \non drug acquisition costs. The drug acquisition cost through the \nVeterans Administration is dramatically lower, ranging anywhere from 15 \nto 30 percent below what is done in the private sector through private \ninsurance companies. We could save in Medicare as well.\n  From a cost containment point of view, an administrative point of \nview, and a choice point of view, this amendment ought to pass. I think \nit is key to sending the right signal not only to our seniors about \nwhat kind of services we want to provide, about what kind of \nconsistency, what kind of choice we want to offer, but it ought to be a \nmessage to the taxpayer. We are going to do it through the most \nefficient, most administratively simple concept to which we can \nsubscribe. Extending Medicare, providing drug benefits through \nMedicare, is the way to do it.\n  Again, I commend the distinguished Senator from Michigan for her \nefforts and for her amendment. I hope it will enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 932\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside until 5 \nminutes before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for himself and Mr. \n     Reed, proposes an amendment numbered 932.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To improve disclosure requirements and to increase \n                          beneficiary choices)\n\n       On page 57, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(3) Disclosure.--The eligible entity offering a Medicare \n     Prescription Drug plan and the MedicareAdvantage organization \n     offering a MedicareAdvantage plan shall disclose to the \n     Administrator (in a manner specified by the Administrator) \n     the extent to which discounts, direct or indirect subsidies, \n     rebates, or other price concessions or direct or indirect \n     remunerations made available to the entity or organization by \n     a manufacturer are passed through to enrollees through \n     pharmacies and other dispensers or otherwise.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that will \ncontribute to fair prices for consumers and fair treatment for \npharmacies under the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. I am \npleased that my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island, Senator \nReed, is joining me in offering this amendment. He serves with me on \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and has been a \nstalwart in helping with some of the small pharmacist issues. That is \nwhat a large area this bill seeks to take care of.\n  It is an issue across the entire country. It is not just an issue in \nWyoming or the West. We all have local pharmacists. Local pharmacists \nprovide a tremendous service to the people for whom they are providers. \nOne of those local services is to explain how the drugs are used, what \ntheir proper use is. They have an excellent knowledge of the drugs a \nperson is taking and recognize conflicts and iron those out with the \ndoctor. They work with the doctor to come up with some generic drugs, \nin some cases, to save costs. Largely, they are left out of any of the \npricing mechanisms. They do all of this on a very low margin.\n  This bill does not take care of that part of local pharmacists, but \nit allows them to still be in the market. This bill ensures fair prices \nfor consumers.\n  The amendment we are proposing would ensure that we hold Medicare \ndrug plans accountable for passing on to consumers a fair portion of \nthe rebates, the discounts, and the other incentives that the plan may \nreceive from drug manufacturers and other sources.\n  Specifically, the amendment would require Medicare prescription drug \nplans and Medicare Advantage organizations to disclose to the Federal \nGovernment the extent to which they pass those rebates and discounts on \nto Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The amendment would also clarify that the Federal Government may \naudit their financial statements and records to ensure compliance and \ndeter fraud and abuse in this area.\n  To ensure fair treatment for pharmacies, the amendment we are \noffering would prohibit Medicare drug plans from implementing \nrestrictions that would steer consumers to the mail order pharmacies. \nIt would require the Medicare drug plans to allow local community \npharmacists to fill long-term prescriptions--not just 30-day \nprescriptions, but 90-day prescriptions--and offer other services they \nare equipped and licensed to provide. It protects the rights of seniors \nto choose their trusted local pharmacist over a mail order house.\n  Our amendment would also prohibit Medicare prescription drug plans \nand Medicare Advantage organizations from requiring pharmacies to \naccept\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\ninsurance risk as a condition of participation in a plan. Pharmacists \nand pharmacies dispense medications and provide services; they are not \ninsurance companies.\n  This provision will ease the minds of the pharmacists who are \nconcerned that Medicare drug plans might force them to share the risk. \nThis has come to light, I am sure, to all of us in town meetings we \nhave held, town meetings where pharmacists have shown up, town meetings \nwhere the pharmacists either have their national publication or \npublications from their colleges that point out some of the \ndifficulties they are having operating in the local market, the local \nmarket where they have the actual contact with the consumer, the local \nmarket where they are the ones providing the advice, the care, and \nsometimes the protection of the patient. We want to make absolutely \nsure we do not leave them out of the mix.\n\n  This is a part of the solution that has been suggested in those \ncollege publications and those national pharmacist publications. These \nare local professionals who provide a local service. They do an \noutstanding job of helping out their customers. They understand who the \ncustomer is because they see them face to face; they are not just a \nvoice over the telephone taking an order.\n  They will play an important role in any drug benefit that is passed, \nwhether it is through a profitable situation for them--and we hope they \ncan stay in business so we have the help of this local pharmacist--or \nwhether it is forced on them in a nonprofitable way. They have been \ndoing that.\n  It would be nice if we watched out for the small businesses in the \ntowns across America. Small businesses are the heart of America. They \nare the ones that provide the community help and community services. \nThey are the ones that participate in all kinds of community events.\n  We have to be careful this bill does not take them out of the loop \nand put them out of business so that kind of service disappears from \nthe face of America. It is part of America. The drug stores have been \nthe heart of downtown for years and now the heart of the health care \nsystem. They are often the main source of health care service and \nadvice, particularly in the rural and frontier areas. In the bigger \ncities, there may be more contact with people who can provide \ninformation. Some of that comes through the HMOs, and some of it comes \nthrough the prescription drug managers who are often tied in with those \nHMOs. But they are not the ones who really do the contact with the \ncustomer, particularly in the rural and frontier areas.\n  I sponsored a bill to remedy our pharmacist shortage, and I am hoping \nthat bill will come to the floor. It is a bill that helps with the \nforgiveness of the loans it takes to get through the process of \nbecoming a pharmacist. We have to make sure these people are available \nand continue to be available in smalltown America and in the big \ncities. We also have to make sure there are faculty to teach these \npeople properly to interact with the customers.\n  Half of the money would go to providing loan forgiveness for \npharmacists who become faculty and half to forgiveness for people who \nactually become pharmacists in underserved areas, and underserved areas \nare sometimes urban areas as well. This bill does not address this. \nThat is another bill we need to fill in the pharmacist piece. It \nunanimously came through the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, and it recognizes the need for local pharmacists and that \nlocal interface we are all used to having. Seniors and pharmacists are \nboth concerned with how the interaction will happen. Seniors do trust \ntheir hometown pharmacist.\n  Senator Reed and I believe this amendment will go a long way toward \nanswering the concerns of seniors and pharmacists about how this new \nMedicare drug benefit will impact the trusted relationship that \npharmacists and their senior patients share.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to take a closer look at this \namendment and help me get it adopted. As I mentioned, it has bipartisan \nsupport. If we had a little more time, I am sure we would have had a \nlot more cosponsors. We recognize this is an appropriate place for this \namendment to appear and an appropriate service to provide under the \nprescription drug benefit of Medicare.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to vote for it. I thank them for their \nconsideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank my colleague for his amendment. I think the Enzi-\nReed amendment will clearly improve beneficiaries' access to long-term \nprescriptions at their local pharmacies, as well as to increased \ndisclosure requirements for participating plans. Community pharmacists \nplay an integral and active role in health care delivery by providing \nprograms that help patients manage their disease, prevent dangerous \ndrug interactions and educate and counsel on the proper use of their \nmedications. Any prescription drug program will rely heavily on \ncommunity pharmacists.\n  Under S. 1, the underlying bill, entities eligible to offer a \nMedicare prescription drug plan would be required to ensure that \nbeneficiaries have convenient access to community pharmacies in both \nrural and urban areas. Additionally, no eligible plan would be allowed \nto offer prescription drug coverage solely through mail order \npharmacies.\n  The Enzi amendment builds on the provisions already included in S. 1 \nand would ensure that beneficiaries who enroll in prescription drug \nplans and Medicare Advantage plans that offer mail order benefits would \nalso have the option to fill long-term prescriptions in community \npharmacies. This amendment also would provide beneficiaries \nflexibility, convenience, and increased corporate reporting \nrequirements for Medicare prescription drug plans. This should promote, \nnot stifle, competition and improve choice.\n  So let's be clear. There are efficiencies inherent in mail order \npharmacies and beneficiaries would continue to benefit financially by \npurchasing drugs through the mail, but this amendment would provide \nthem with yet another choice, another option, as well.\n  It is certainly my intention to vote for the Enzi-Reed amendment. I \nam not in a position to say that the chairman is saying that yet, but I \nsuspect he will.\n  I understand Senator Enzi will speak for a few more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his comments. He has \nvery concisely laid it out, has a tremendous understanding of this \namendment and the need for it, and made a fair assumption that it could \ncost slightly more by going through the local pharmacist. But one of \nthe things we want to do is make sure that local pharmacist is an \noption.\n  If beneficiaries getting the prescription drugs order it through the \nlocal pharmacy and the cost comes to more than it would be through a \nmail order firm, then the person receiving the prescription drugs does \nhave to make up that difference in cost.\n  These four provisions in the amendment will make a tremendous \ndifference to both consumers and to pharmacists. The aim is twofold. It \nis to have fair prices for consumers and then fair treatment for the \nlocal pharmacies. As was mentioned, the two provisions that require \nfair prices would require the Medicare prescription drug plans and \nMedicare Advantage organizations to disclose, to the extent that they \npass Medicare beneficiaries, any rebates or discounts that they \nnegotiate from drug manufacturers. In other words, if they get a break, \nthe consumer is supposed to get a break. It permits the Government to \naudit the plans and the organizations' financial statements and \nrecords--and it is primarily the records that are important--to ensure \ncompliance to make sure there is not fraud and abuse and to make sure, \nagain, that those reductions get passed through to the consumer. So we \nwant fair prices for consumers.\n  The consumers and pharmacies do support the first two provisions \naimed at ensuring this transparency and accountability on the part of \npharmacy benefit managers, PBMs, the companies that will probably win \ncontracts or bids to manage the new drug benefit.\n  Pharmacies argue that the pharmacy benefit managers, the PBMs, are\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\nsqueezing their margins while consumers argue that the PBMs have \nfinancial incentives to steer patients to the drugs that make the most \nprofits for the PBMs, even when they may not be the most appropriate \ndrugs for the patients. So that is another reason that not only the \nfair price but the transparency has to be there.\n  What are these PBMs, pharmacy benefit managers? PBMs administer \nprescription drug benefits through contracts with employers, managed \nhealth care organizations, and insurance carriers. Today, the top 20 \nfirms manage more than 90 percent of retail prescription drug \npurchases, and three firms, AdvancePCS, Express Scripts, and Merck-\nMedco Managed Care, dominate the market.\n  Large self-insured employers turned to PBMs during the 1990s to \nadminister the popular drug benefit, to manage the costs and \nutilization trends to ensure appropriate use of drugs and improved \nquality care. However, the employer frustration over rising costs and \nquestions about appropriateness of drug use are stimulating interest in \nPBM contractual relationships, especially financial arrangements with \ndrug manufacturers, and the bearing those relationships have on the PBM \nperformance.\n  PBMs once earned the bulk of their revenue by holding down drug costs \nfor health plans. They now earn a large portion of their revenue from \ndrug companies that pay them undisclosed rebates and other financial \nincentives for promoting certain medications. For nearly 4 years, \nthe U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia has been looking into how \nPBMs negotiate discounts, rebates, and payments from pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers and how the resulting revenues are shared with PBM \nclients.\n\n  So what does the amendment do to answer the concerns? The amendment \nwould give the Government the ability to ensure that the Medicare drug \nplans administered by PBMs are passing through the fair share of their \nrebates and discounts on to consumers. It would also clarify the \nGovernment's authority to audit the drug plans to confirm the accuracy \nof the disclosure of the rebates and discounts.\n  The main thrust of it is to make sure the local pharmacist has a fair \nshot for the service they provide. I hope everybody remembers when they \ngo to a pharmacist the time he spends explaining how often they take \nthe drugs and what they cannot take before or after, and what they can \nhave with them. They also have an understanding of the other \nmedications that people are taking so that if there is a possibility \nthat there will be an interaction between two medications, they can \nsolve that problem.\n  Of course, the only way that happens is if a person is working with \none pharmacist. If people are calling a whole bunch of different \npharmacists, because of privacy laws they do not have access to the \ninteraction of the other drugs that a person is taking.\n  So that local pharmacist provides a tremendous service, and it is \nonly fair that we include those professionals in the ability to compete \nin this market, and people can continue to place their trust in the \nlocal person that they can see face to face and from whom they can pick \nup their prescriptions. It is a relatively short amendment, but again \nit is one that has very strong bipartisan support and one that will \nfulfill a need. So far as we know, there is very little opposition. So \nI look forward to having my colleagues support it.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his comments and this \nopportunity to present the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in support of the Enzi-Reed \npharmacy access amendment.\n  I compliment my colleague and friend, Senator Enzi from Wyoming. We \nhave worked on several issues with respect to the pharmacy benefits. It \nhas been a pleasure and it has been productive, not only for ourselves \nbut for the professional pharmacy community. Pharmacists are the third \nlargest health care profession in the country in terms of numbers of \npractitioners, and they are becoming increasingly more central to our \nhealth care system.\n  This amendment is designed to accomplish two very important \nobjectives with respect to the proposed Medicare pharmacy benefit for \nseniors. First, its aim is to assure transparency and accountability in \nthe collection and dissemination of negotiated savings by Medicare \nprescription drug benefit plans and Medicare Advantage plans. Second, \nit is designed to guarantee Medicare beneficiaries access to community \npharmacies when filling prescriptions of 90 days or longer. Without the \nEnzi-Reed amendment, these protections, these safeguards, these \nessential elements would not be present in the bill we are considering \ntoday.\n  This language is very similar to proposed language included in the \ncounterpart legislation being deliberated in the other body. If we are \nto rely upon private companies to negotiate and administer a benefit on \nbehalf of the Federal Government as well as on behalf of tens of \nmillions of elderly and disabled beneficiaries, we need to be sure \nthese entities operate with the best interests of these parties in mind \nand not simply and exclusively their bottom line. Through this \namendment, plans will be required to disclose to the Government the \nextent to which they pass on to Medicare beneficiaries rebates, \ndiscounts, and any other savings negotiated from the drug \nmanufacturers.\n  We all recognize one of the essential elements of this legislation is \nthe notion that private pharmacy benefit management companies will \nnegotiate with pharmacies and manufacturers to get the best possible \nprice. We hope that best possible price is passed on almost entirely to \nthe beneficiaries and to the payers, which include the Federal \nGovernment. It would be ironic, indeed, if we establish a system in \nwhich the intermediaries gained huge profits, while the Government and \nbeneficiaries continue to pay substantial sums for the pharmaceutical \nbenefits.\n\n  By requiring disclosure of negotiated savings by drug plan \nadministrators, we guarantee a greater degree of transparency and make \nsure beneficiaries are getting the best possible savings on their \nprescription drugs. The essence of the Enzi-Reed amendment is let the \nmarkets operate, but make sure everyone has complete information about \nwho is reaping the benefits of these negotiated transactions between \npurchasers and suppliers of these pharmaceuticals.\n  Since beneficiaries are expected to pay anywhere between 50 percent \nand 100 percent of the cost of drugs--those individuals in the gap \nwould be paying 100 percent of the cost of drugs--we have to make sure \nthey are getting the best possible deal. This amendment will go a long \nway towards ensuring that actually happens.\n  If the PBMs do not pass these benefits and negotiated savings along \nto the public and the Federal Government, then we all should know. This \namendment will ensure that level of accountability.\n  Second, the Enzi-Reed amendment allows beneficiaries to receive 90-\nday prescriptions and other related benefits through community \npharmacies. Senator Enzi represents the great State of Wyoming in which \na pharmacy--I am sure in some of the smaller communities--might be the \nonly source of pharmaceutical supplies and medical advice and many \nother things. Pharmacies are an important part of the fabric of a \ncommunity. To deny seniors the right to get their pharmaceutical \nsupplies from these pharmacies would not only be wrong but inefficient. \nIf that is where they would like to get their prescriptions, they would \nbe assured they can get the benefit through the local pharmacy under \nthis amendment.\n  Rhode Island is a little different from Wyoming, but pharmacies in \nRhode Island have the same role in the lives of seniors, particularly \nin terms of getting their benefits and other important health care \nservices. This amendment would allow beneficiaries to obtain 90-day \nsupplies through the community pharmacist, wherever they are.\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\n  This does not exclude mail order, but it simply makes sure it is not \nthe only option that seniors have; that they can continue to rely upon \nthe local pharmacy for their benefits.\n  I should say something else. Not only is the local pharmacy a source \nof pharmaceuticals, it is usually an excellent source of advice and \nassistance by trained pharmacists. Increasingly, these pharmacists are \ntaking on a very important role in advising seniors, within the limits \nof their practice, as to the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals and are \nalso a source of advice on many other health care issues. So I hope my \ncolleagues would agree that we should encourage the use of local \npharmacies. This amendment will help do that.\n  I again commend Senator Enzi for his work and leadership on this \nissue. We share a common belief that professional pharmacy is a \ncritical part of our health care system. If we allow pharmacists to \noperate, we will get the benefit of their expertise, and it will \nredound to the health needs of our seniors and to the financial \nresponsibilities that we face in enacting this legislation.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nReed, for his efforts on this bill and the efforts on all the other \nones we worked on together over the years. We came to the Senate at the \nsame time and served on the Health, Education, Pensions and Labor \nCommittee since that time. I think we have been able to reach some \nreasonable solutions before, and we will have yet another one here. I \nappreciate his comments and his work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there are 5 minutes evenly divided before \nthe vote on the Stabenow amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I appreciate those who are \ncosponsoring my amendment and have joined with me. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Lieberman's name be added as a cosponsor to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. This amendment is very simple and very straightforward. \nWhat we are saying is, seniors ought to have every possible choice for \ntheir prescription drugs, and one of those choices should be under \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Today, 89 percent of seniors and those with disabilities in our \ncountry are under the traditional Medicare insurance plan; only 11 \npercent are not. We want to make sure, in this amendment, those seniors \nwho are under traditional Medicare--choosing their own doctor, having \nthe confidence to know that regardless of where they live they will \nhave the same premium, the same cost, the same benefit, the \ndependability of Medicare--that they, in fact, will be able to choose \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Under every cost estimate we have looked at, in terms of \nadministrative costs, the growth in programs, other kinds of costs, \nMedicare has always come out less expensive than the private plans that \nhave been compared to it. So, in fact, this does not cost more money, \nit costs less.\n  In our proposal, we stay within the $400 billion parameters by \nallowing the Secretary of HHS to actually modify the plan to stay \nwithin the $400 billion in the budget resolution. This is no additional \ncost. This is a question of choice and making sure seniors who, \noverwhelmingly, choose to stay in traditional Medicare have the \nopportunity to do so. I ask my colleagues to join with us in creating \ntrue choice for our seniors.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, it is my understanding that CBO has \nevaluated the information just provided them by the Senator from \nMichigan, and they are standing by their opinion that her amendment \nwill cost an additional $50 billion over 10 years. So while the \nStabenow amendment does violate the budget, which allocates $400 \nbillion, it is my understanding the leadership on this side does not \nwant to raise a point of order and would like to take this vote just \nstraight up on its merits.\n  The provisions of this bill offer Senators a choice between a new way \nor the old way. I ask my colleagues: Do you want to go the way of \nGovernment price control in which you put a bureaucrat between you and \nyour medicine cabinet regardless of Medicare's terrible experience in \nevaluating market prices on prescription drugs? If you believe this is \nthe way Medicare's future is best provided, then you should vote for \nthe Stabenow amendment.\n  If you want to try a new way, if you want to see if the marketplace \nactually works to provide more choices, more cost control, and even \nbetter quality and innovation, then you should vote with the bipartisan \nagreement that has the support of, I believe, a majority of Senators.\n  This bill presents a choice between the past and the future, between \nGovernment, central planning, price controls, and a marketplace that \ncan evolve. But that marketplace will not evolve if Government comes in \nand says, on a permanent basis: we are going to be the other choice. I \ncan promise you capital will not follow, and there will be no \nmarketplace developed.\n  I think seniors of this country are due a prescription drugs package \nthat can pass and that the President will sign. The President is not \ngoing to sign a Medicare and Prescription Drugs bill that comprises the \nStabenow amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, prior to 1965, seniors had to go to \nprivate insurance companies to get their health care. Half could not \nfind or afford private health care. That is why we created Medicare.\n  Now we are looking at the opportunity to keep that choice for \nseniors, plus the opportunity to expand. If they want to be in an HMO, \nif they want to be in a PPO, they can find insurance in their \ncommunity. That is terrific. That is their choice. But those who have \nchosen Medicare deserve the right to pick that choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. SMITH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 931.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman), are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) is \nabsent attending a funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now on the Enzi amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Enzi amendment be temporarily set aside so \nthat at 4:20 the Senate can proceed to an amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I also ask that there be 30 minutes on that amendment \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I withdraw the second request. So the only \nrequest pending, which I think the Chair has ruled on favorably, is \nthat we go to the Bingaman amendment at 4:20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, pending 4:20, when the Senator from New Mexico will \noffer his amendment, I rise to speak about the rural provisions in the \nMedicare bill.\n  This bill has a lot of provisions to help rural America. I am very \nproud of these provisions. I also wish to compliment the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Grassley. Over the last year, he and I have \njointly co-authored legislation to address the imbalance in Medicare \npayments that exists between rural and urban areas of our country. For \nmany rural areas of our country, providing health care services is very \nchallenging given Medicare's current payment rates.\n  In rural America, Medicare often dominates. That is, most hospitals, \ndoctors and other health care providers receive the lion's share of \ntheir reimbursements from Medicare. I know that in many communities in \nMontana, particularly the smallest communities, Medicare accounts for \nover more than 50 percent of hospitals total reimbursements. This share \nis also as high in some larger towns, but certainly more the case in \nsmaller towns.\n  Rural hospitals are often the major employer in their communities. It \nis what makes the small town tick. If it were not for the rural \nhospital, the population in those towns would deteriorate. I have seen \nthat happen in a good number of communities in Montana, where the \nhospital--fewer than 20 beds in many cases--is the major employer in \nthe town.\n  Once Medicare payments start to decline significantly, as is the case \nin many areas, that smalltown hospital has to close up, or converts to \nwhat is called a critical access facility and is no longer the full \nservice hospital it was. So it is very important that rural America be \nadequately reimbursed under Medicare.\n  In addition to Medicare reimbursements, I believe we have also \nprovided assistance to rural areas with respect to our proposed drug \nbenefit. I believe that the drug benefit outlined in this bill will \nwork for rural America. For example, if private drug-only plans do not \nmaterialize, our bill provides for a hard and fast fallback, a \nGovernment guarantee for rural seniors. This guarantee is important \nbecause many rural States have had an unfortunate experience with \nMedicare+Choice, the program that currently allows private health plans \nto participate in Medicare. But because there are so few people in \nrural America, HMOs and other Medicare+Choice plans, have found it too \ndifficult to operate and have withdrawn.\n  I do not have the figures with me off the top of my head, but there \nare thousands of people in rural areas who once had access to a \nMedicare+Choice plan but no longer have that opportunity because the \nareas are just so sparsely populated for health plans to work. That is \na real concern with respect to the prescription drug benefit we are \nproviding in this bill; namely, will private drug plans, in addition to \nthe preferred provider organizations, want to offer prescription drug \nbenefits in rural America or not? It is a big question, and it is an \nunanswered question.\n  We hope they do want to come in and participate. We hope private \nplans that currently do not now exist will, under the provisions of \nthis bill, when it goes into effect in a few years, want to provide \nprescription drug benefits for seniors. We hope that many plans want to \ncome in and compete with each other to help reduce costs.\n  There is no great assurance that these private plans will reduce \ncosts. If one looks at the HMOs, they currently are paid at a higher \nrate than what Medicare pays for beneficaries in the fee-for-service \nprogram. Some can make a strong argument that these private plans are \ngoing to cost more. The theory is that competition will allow them to \nbring down costs and provide the same benefits for seniors. So it is an \nunanswered question. People just do not know the degree to which these \nprivate plans are going to work. Therein lies the question: What about \nthose parts of America where private plans do not participate? What \nabout those seniors? How can we assure that they are going to get \nprescription drug benefits? The bill before us tries to address that.\n  The bill addresses this question by providing for a guaranteed \nfallback plan. In those parts of the country where there are not two or \nmore competing private drug plans, government-backed fallback plan is \nguaranteed. Seniors will be able to get the prescription drug benefits \nunder pharmacy benefit manager (PMB), or similar organization that is \nnot required to bear insurance risk. It will only be required to bear \nperformance risk for the administrative costs of providing the benefit. \nThe fallback plan will not bear insurance risk as required of the \nprivate drug plans.\n  The purpose of the fallback plan is to make sure that rural America--\nin fact, any part of America where there are not two private plans--is \nserved fairly by this prescription drug program.\n  As I mentioned, the bill includes many provisions to address the \ncurrent imbalance in Medicare reimbursements between urban and rural \nAmerica. One provision would correct differences in the standardized \namount rate for inpatient hospitals. The standardized amount is higher \nfor urban hospitals than for rural hospitals. The provision says that \nMedicare should pay the same across the board. Clearly, there will be \nother adjustments that affect different circumstances and different \nparts of the country, but the standardized amount would be the same \nrate for both urban and rural hospitals. That is extremely important to \nmany hospitals in rural areas.\n  Last year's appropriations bill equalized the standardized amount for \na 6-month period. This bill makes that permanent. It is a change that \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, has recommended \nthat Congress make. This bill this and other MedPAC recommendations to \nheart by saying, You are the experts, you know better what is going on \nthan anyone else.\n  This bill contains a couple of other important MedPAC \nrecommendations. For example, it raises the Medicare disproportionate \nshare threshold for rural hospitals. The Medicare DSH program says if \nyou are a hospital and\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\nhave a disproportionate number of people under Medicare who are low \nincome, you should receive extra assistance under Medicare. Our bill \nraises that threshold for rural hospitals a little higher.\n  The bill also adjusts payments for hospitals with very low patient \nvolume. We know volume is a big component of whether a hospital is able \nto make ends meet.\n  The bill extends the rural home health add-on payment at a level of 5 \npercent. Home health care is extremely important in rural America.\n  This bill includes other provisions that not necessarily rural \nspecific. For example, the legislation increases payments to dialysis \nproviders, including those in urban areas, for a 2-year period.\n  The bill provides desperately needed assistance to urban hospitals \nthat provide a disproportionate share of services to low income \nindividuals. These hospitals are struggling with growing pressures of \nmore uninsured and low income patients. It is not fair for those \nhospitals that have to bear these costs. They have to provide charity \ncare. In fact, in many respects under the law they are required to. \nThis gives them a bit of a break with these burdens and their nursing \nshortages\n  The bill provides much-needed regulatory relief for both rural and \nurban hospitals. We have heard from doctors and hospitals that say the \ncarriers and fiscal intermediaries are too heavy-handed; they assume \nphysicians and providers are guilty when they question reimbursement, \ninstead of assuming we are innocent. The regulatory relief measures in \nthis bill address this concern. These provisions are significant and go \na long way to assure providers spend less time on paperwork burdens and \nmore time with their patients.\n\n  Some may say that this bill does not go far enough to relieve these \nburdens. A lot of doctors and hospitals administrators will say: Gee, \nwhy all this Medicare paperwork? We want to spend time with our \npatients. Nevertheless, the regulatory provisions of this bill will \nreduce paperwork and unnecessary regulation.\n  I realize there are a number of provider provisions--with respect to \ndoctors and hospitals and other providers--that are not addressed in \nthis bill. These provisions include payments under the Medicare \nphysician fee schedule, which will be cut in 2004 through 2007 unless \nfurther congressional action despite an additional $54 billion in the \nbill we passed earlier this year. We recognize the need to address \nthese impending cuts in the future. Physician's fees are projected to \ndrop significantly. We cannot address that in this bill. We do not have \nthe money. That is a problem we will have to face in 2004. I alert \nSenators, that will be expensive. We will have to deal with it.\n  There are also Senators who want to address what is called IME, or \nindirect medical education. This is the special payment adjustor under \nMedicare for teaching hospitals. It is now currently reduced to its \nlowest level ever. That is, teaching hospitals are receiving less to \nhelp train physicians across the country. That is a concern many have. \nWe are going to try to deal with that as best we can as this bill \nprogresses.\n  Nursing home payments are not addressed. Many Senators have talked \nabout addressing some of the problems facing nursing homes. They, too, \nexperienced a sharp reduction in payments over in 2003. This list of \npayment provisions is not limited. There are several other provider \nprovisions about which many Senators have raised concerns.\n  Our ability to deal with these additional issues is limited. Why? \nBecause this is a $400 billion Medicare package. The fact remains, this \nis a package of relatively sparse drug benefits. Yes, $400 billion \nsounds like a lot of money, and it is. But $400 billion extended over \n10 years, means that we have to carefully consider what the amounts \nshould be for the deductible, copayments, and the premiums. The numbers \nare OK, but they are not great.\n  I don't want to oversell this bill or over promise. This legislation \nis a step in the right direction. This is a good first chapter. It is a \nstart in providing prescription drug benefits for seniors. We only have \n$400 billion so we have not been able to address these other \nprovisions. We would like to. We would like to find a way to deal with \nthem. But at this time, the dollars are simply not there.\n\n  I might add, we will do what we can in future days, weeks, and months \nto try to address these concerns.\n  I know the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, wants to work \nwith our colleagues to address these provisions and also provide a fair \ndeal for rural, as well as urban, folks in America. We want to address \nfuture geographic inequities with respect to the drug benefit. The fact \nis, rural States are very concerned if we enact this prescription drug \nbenefit, are going to come out on the short end of the stick. More \nfederal money will end up going to go to urban seniors. That will cause \na great problem.\n  At the same time, seniors in urban areas are afraid the money will go \nto the rural areas, that the urban cities will end up on short end of \nthe stick. The fact is, we do not know how it will work. We just don't \nknow. Senator Snowe offered an amendment in the Finance Committee for a \nstudy to address possible geographic inequities in drug spending across \nthe country. She later amended it, made it a little stronger, to say \nthat HHS will have the discretion to address any geographic inequities. \nThere may be an amendment on the floor to require the HHS Secretary to \naddress the inequities.\n  It is a point about which we are all very sensitive. We are trying to \nfind a way to make this geographic adjustment process work. Geographic \nadjustment for drug spending has never been tried before. It is \nuncharted territory. We just don't know. It probably makes sense the \nSecretary have discretion.\n  That is a short summary of some of the rural provisions in the bill. \nI see the Senator from Texas is on the Senate floor. Does the Senator \nfrom Texas wish to speak at this point?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Montana \ngiving me a chance to say just a few words.\n  May I inquire, my understanding was Senator Bingaman was going to be \ncoming at 4:20 under a previous agreement to speak, but there also was \na possibility I might be allowed to continue a while longer, perhaps 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \nagreement?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to the request of \nthe Senator from Texas who asked if he could be allowed to speak for 15 \nor 20 minutes before we begin my amendment. If that is not a problem \nfor the manager of the bill, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I express my appreciation to the managers of the bill and \nSenator Bingaman for his courtesy.\n  This is obviously a critical issue that confronts the Senate, one \nthis body has talked about for a long time. It appears we are on the \nprecipice of actually delivering what many of us have campaigned on, on \nboth sides of the aisle, in previous elections.\n  Medicare has been a successful program for the last 30 years, and it \nhas served our seniors well. But it faces major challenges. Obviously, \nwe are all interested in strengthening Medicare so it will continue to \nbe a program that will serve our children and grandchildren as it has \nour parents and grandparents. Medicare was created in 1965 and reflects \nthe state of health care in that year. While the world has changed and \nmedicine has changed, Medicare has not changed. It is time to improve \nand strengthen Medicare so it can serve the needs of Americans of this \ngeneration and the next, and can also be within our fiscal constraints.\n\n  Medicare is stuck in 1965, and so are its beneficiaries. Medicare's \npromise falls far short when its recipients suffer from outdated and \ninadequate benefits, limited protection against rising medical costs, \nor a stodgy Government plan that cannot deliver responsive medical \nservices or ensure high-quality health care.\n  While health insurance has followed the demands of the free market, \nMedicare still lacks catastrophic protection or full coverage of many \npreventive benefits in a comprehensive outpatient prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  One of the critical improvements included in this bill is immediate \nassistance, in the form of prescription drug\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\ncoverage, for those seniors who cannot currently obtain it or who do so \nonly at great economic hardship and great personal hardship. I have \nsupported the principle of a prescription drug benefit from day 1 for \nthe seniors who need it. I am proud to reiterate my support here today.\n  Having said that, I have significant concerns about the legislation \nthat is before this body--some aspects of it, significant aspects of \nit. While a prescription drug benefit and expanded treatment choices \nwill help America's seniors, this bill falls substantially short of \nPresident Bush's framework for reform. If we endorse this legislation \nwithout real and meaningful reform, we rush to satisfy political \ninterests rather than take the time to form sound policy, and we do a \ngreat disservice to the Medicare beneficiaries who depend on this \ncoverage, to our constituencies, and to the future generations who will \nhave the financial burden to pay for it. Ultimately, if we do not take \ncare, we could do more harm than good.\n  According to estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, this plan \nwill have unintended ramifications for Americans. It will force nearly \n40 percent of retired Americans who currently have prescription drug \nbenefits under private plans onto taxpayer-paid plans that would be \nprovided under this bill. The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, \npredicts that only 2 percent of seniors will actually choose the only \nvehicle for reform provided for under this bill, that of the preferred \nprovider organizations, the PPOs, while the rest will remain in \nMedicare basically as it currently exists with a prescription drug \nbenefit added, hardly what we could call true reform.\n  We should not fool ourselves. What we are actually providing seniors \nunder Medicare, and through this bill, is actually very different from \nwhat Members of Congress receive. Under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan, all of us in this body, along with 10 million Federal \nemployees, can enroll in a number of flexible preferred provider \norganizations. The plans we can choose as Federal employees do not have \nrestrictive price caps, and they provide for more choice. As a result, \nthose of us who work for the Federal Government can obtain better \ncoverage and treatment than the vast majority of our constituents. This \ndisparity, I believe, should not be tolerated under this plan, \nespecially one that charges under the banner of reform.\n\n  Price controls are a recipe for long-term disaster. The best \ndeterminer of price in a product is the free market, not government \nbureaucrats sitting in darkened cubicles wearing green eyeshades. My \nother concern is that this purports to be a universal entitlement, \nbased on nothing like what we have talked about in many of our \ncampaigns, which is actually need. It will provide a prescription drug \nbenefit to millionaires, including Members of this body who just do not \nneed it. I question the morality of any proposal that would take the \nhard-earned money out of the pockets of truck drivers, schoolteachers, \npolice officers, small business men and women and single moms, to \nsubsidize a prescription drug benefit for people who are well to do.\n  When it comes to health care, I believe the proper role of government \nis to protect the freedom of all people to act as they see fit to \nmaintain and improve their health care. Today, millions of Americans \nsuffer from chronic diseases that are for the most part preventable. \nOur Nation spends about $1.4 trillion a year on health care--more than \nany other country in the world--and chronic diseases account for \nroughly 75 percent of those health care costs. Preventing disease \nbefore it happens is better, more humane, and less expensive than \ncuring disease after it manifests itself, and prevention can lead to a \nfar better quality of life. If Medicare is to adapt to the demands of a \nnew populace, it must become a system refocused on the importance of \npreventive care.\n  I strongly believe that real positive change in our Medicare system \nmust begin with the foundation of individual responsibility and the \nchoices that can only be provided by the free market--not by a \ngovernment mandate.\n  We must not offer up a short-term legislative answer that plays \npolitics with people's health and the needs of future beneficiaries. We \nshould not tinker only around the edges and call it reform.\n  As we work over this week and next to produce a solution to this \nchallenge that lies before us, we cannot allow ourselves to believe our \nstriving will fail, and we must not convince ourselves we have already \nsucceeded.\n  In conclusion, let me say it is my most ardent hope that this bill, \nwhich I know was produced by great effort of the staff and on a \nbipartisan basis by the Senate Finance Committee, can be improved and \nthat the improvement will allow us to make sure the benefit is targeted \nto those seniors who actually need the help and not millionaires, \nthereby having the wealth transferred out of the pockets of hard-\nworking Americans to pay for a prescription drug benefit for \nmillionaires and others who are well to do.\n  Second, let us make sure we don't crowd out private dollars that are \ncurrently paying for prescription drug benefits for many retired \npersons which they have negotiated under the terms of their retirement \nor pension plan. Right now up to 40 percent of those dollars will be \nchased off and the Federal Government--in other words, the taxpayer--\nwill step forward and fill that gap. That is something we should not \nallow.\n  Third, if this is truly going to be reform, it has to be something \nmore than business as usual.\n  What concerns me quite a bit is on the one hand the OMB estimates \nthat some 40 percent of seniors will opt for the true vehicle for \nreform--the PPOs, the preferred provider organizations--but, on the \nother hand, another agency of the Federal Government, the Congressional \nBudget Office, says No, it won't be 43 percent. It won't be 40 percent. \nIt will be 2 percent.\n  In other words, if the Congressional Budget Office is right, we will \nnot have accomplished what the President has asked us to do and what \nmany in this institution believe is so important; that is, true reform.\n  It is my hope and prayer we will be able to make the necessary \nadjustments to this very good start. But there are some very grave \nconcerns that I and others have about the bill as it currently exists.\n  In a tight budget, I hope we do not vote for what is by most \nconservative estimates a $400 billion new entitlement on top of $2.2 \ntrillion the Federal Government commits to nondiscretionary entitlement \nspending each year, unless we make sure it is absolutely necessary and \ntargeted to those who need it most, and that it does not supplant other \nprivate insurance and other measures designed to provide prescription \ndrug coverage for our seniors.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 933\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 933.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To eliminate the application of an asset test for purposes of \n   eligibility for premium and cost-sharing subsidies for low-income \n                             beneficiaries)\n\n       On page 120, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       ``(I) Elimination of application of asset test.--With \n     respect to eligibility determinations for premium and cost-\n     sharing subsidies under this section made on or after October \n     1, 2008, such determinations shall be made without regard to \n     subparagraph (C) of section 1905(p)(1) (to the extent a \n     State, as of such date, has not already eliminated the \n     application of such subparagraph).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward, simple \namendment that deals with a problem that is buried in this legislation \nand\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\nwhich really needs to be dealt with. That is the so-called assets test. \nMy amendment would eliminate the assets test beginning in the year \n2009.\n  The first obvious question everyone should be asking is, What is the \nassets test? The assets test is as follows: The bill provides a more \ngenerous set of benefits for low-income individuals and low-income \ncouples. That is as we intend.\n  I think all Members of the Senate recognize that those who have the \nleast in the way of income really need the most help in paying for \ntheir prescription drugs, particularly when you are dealing with \nseniors who are not, in most cases, out in the workplace able to \nincrease their income. We believe the proper, the humane, and the \ncompassionate thing is to provide this greater level of subsidy for \nlow-income individuals.\n  In particular, we look at those individuals with incomes up to 160 \npercent of poverty. That is the figure we have in this legislation. \nThat translates into, I believe, what we are talking about. A couple \nwith an income of perhaps $17,000 or $18,000 a year would qualify, and \nif they had any more income than that they would not qualify for this \nhigher level of subsidy.\n  The bill also provides that if a low-income individual has as much as \n$4,000 in assets, that individual is not entitled to that subsidy in \nthe same way others would be.\n  For example, if you have a 70 or 75-year-old widow who is receiving \n$5,000 a year in income or $6,000 a year or $8,000 in income and that \nwidow also has $1,000 in U.S. savings bonds, and a car that has a blue \nbook value of $3,100, then that widow is not entitled to the full \nbenefit unless and until she goes out and either sells the savings \nbonds or sells the car or somehow or other impoverishes herself to be \nable to demonstrate she does not have assets worth $4,000.`\n  This is a test that was put in the law many years ago. It is one that \nadds great complexity to the law. In fact, a major effect of this \nassets test is to discourage a great many low-income individuals from \neven applying for the increased benefit that is provided for in this \nlegislation because the requirements for reporting, filling out forms, \ngetting blue book values on your automobile--these are complicated \nrequirements that discourage people from applying across the board.\n  I also point out that under this assets test, not only is it $4,000 \nfor an individual--so if you have $4,000 worth of income, of assets, as \na widow, you fail the assets test--but if you are married, it is then \n$6,000. A lot of the Members of this Senate and the Congress have given \nspeeches about what a terrible thing the marriage penalty is. Here is \nanother marriage penalty that is in the law we are dealing with today. \nThis is a penalty which says, if you get married, your ability to hold \non to assets and still get this full benefit is reduced. You cannot \nhold on to as many assets. You can only hold on to $6,000 as a couple \nwhereas you could hold on to $4,000 as an individual.\n  In my view, the justification for this assets test has long since \ngone away. The reality is, if people are unable to work, as most \nseniors are, unable to increase their income, if they are low-income \nindividuals, and if they have very substantial prescription drug costs, \nthey need the assistance we are providing in this legislation--or \ntrying to provide in this legislation--and we should not take that away \nfrom them by virtue of their having $4,000 worth of assets as an \nindividual or $6,000 worth of assets as a couple.\n  Let me elaborate on this a little bit more. There are about 40 \nmillion seniors and people with disabilities who depend on Medicare who \ncould benefit from this prescription drug coverage we are talking about \nin this bill, and this assistance is particularly critical for those \nlow-income individuals. Here we are talking about 14 million \nbeneficiaries who have incomes less than 160 percent of poverty. Many \nof those individuals are in the State the Presiding Officer represents. \nMany of those individuals are in my State of New Mexico.\n  The bill provides a significant benefit to those low-income seniors \nand individuals with disabilities, but it does so only if they do not \nfail the assets test. I do not know the exact figures, but the \nCongressional Budget Office estimate is that 21 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who would otherwise qualify for this low-income benefit \nin fact will be denied that full benefit because they fail the assets \ntest.\n  In fact, for those below 100 percent of poverty, if they fail the \nassets test, their cost sharing is increased, under this bill, by 400 \npercent. For those between 100 and 135 percent of poverty, the assets \ntest causes their cost sharing to increase by 200 percent.\n  I believe strongly that in the year 2009--which is what I have in my \namendment--we should eliminate the assets test. I would propose we do \nit earlier, frankly, but I am informed that the Budget Committee has \ncalculated the cost of the bill in such a way that there is no funding \navailable for us to do anything such as eliminate the assets test \nbefore the year 2009. So I have crafted the amendment so that it would \nbecome effective in the year 2009.\n  In addition to protecting low-income beneficiaries below 135 percent \nof poverty from much higher costs, much higher copays due to this \nassets test, it should also be noted that the assets test significantly \nincreases the paperwork burden on seniors and on individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  While the underlying bill provides physicians and other health \nproviders with regulatory relief--and that is one of the things we keep \ntalking about when we try to describe the benefits in this bill--I fear \nthe bill will significantly complicate the ability of Medicare \nbeneficiaries to receive prescription drug coverage, particularly low-\nincome individuals. They may need--I said this in the committee during \nour markup, and I believe it is not a totally facetious statement--they \nmay need an accountant or a lawyer just to figure out the paperwork \nhaving to do with this assets test and how they can access these \nbenefits.\n  We should not be putting people to the choice of selling their car or \nliquidating their U.S. savings bonds in order to get the benefits of \nthis bill. There are a great many low-income individuals who have very \nhigh prescription drug costs. That is a very unfortunate fact but one \nwe are trying to come to grips with here.\n  Under the bill, if they fail the assets test, their copay requirement \nis 10 percent up until they hit the so-called doughnut portion of the \nbill, which means essentially $4,000 of prescription drug expense in \nany given year; and then for the next $1,500 or $1,800 beyond that, \nthey pay a 20-percent copay. If you have high prescription drug costs, \na 20-percent copay is substantial. If you have high prescription drug \ncosts, even a 10-percent copay can be substantial if your income is \nextremely low. And that is the group we are talking about here.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the amendment. \nIt is done in a responsible way. It is not drafted in such a way that \nit would take effect immediately. It takes effect in the year 2009, \nwhen we are advised by the Budget Committee funds will be available to \npay to eliminate this assets test. It clearly is the right thing to do. \nIt is the humane thing to do if, in fact, we are serious about helping \nlow-income seniors deal with this very substantial burden. We should \nadopt this amendment and eliminate the assets test as soon as we can \nafford to do so. And the Budget Committee tells me that is in fiscal \nyear 2009.\n  So I hope very much colleagues will support the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my \nsupport for increased funding for rural hospitals. Pennsylvania is a \ngeographically and demographically diverse State, and the health care \nneeds of the communities across the Commonwealth differ significantly. \nBut there is one constant--access to appropriate health care is \ncritical, and if we are not prudent in making wise health care policy \ndecisions now, we may jeopardize our citizens' ability to get the right \ncare, in the right setting, at the right time.\n  We must be aware of the pressures and challenges that constantly \nweaken the foundation of the health care system--the medical liability \ninsurance crisis, inadequate State and Federal reimbursements, \nworkforce shortages, growing uncompensated care costs, rising costs of \ntechnology and pharmaceuticals, bioterrorism planning and\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\ntraining, and a growing elderly population. As we look at restructuring \na segment of the Medicare Program, we have the opportunity to \nstrengthen that foundation. Improving our prescription drug benefits \nwill not help the senior citizens of this country if health care \nproviders cannot meet their needs.\n  We must also remember that our actions here in the Senate and by our \ncolleagues in the House have implications not only for the quality and \nstability of our health care system but for our economic health as \nwell. A recent study completed by the Penn State Cooperative Extension \nand the Pennsylvania Office of Rural Health shows that the State's \nhospitals are the largest component of the health services sector, \ngenerating more than $33.9 billion to the State's economy. This \nincludes 260,000 full- and part-time jobs, a payroll exceeding $9.3 \nbillion, and a ripple effect that provides another 179,400 jobs and \n$5.4 billion in additional employee compensation. In many counties, the \nhospital is the No. 1 employer. Furthermore, the State's research \nhospitals have been identified as an integral component of \nbiotechnology clusters, serving as an engine of growth in the new \neconomy.\n  Given all of these dynamics, we must support a legislative plan that \nadequately funds hospital and health systems. This plan must recognize \nthat our rural communities face a unique set of challenges because they \nare often the only provider of health care in a vast geographic region \nand they have greater difficulty recruiting health care workers and \nphysicians in today's health care climate. Such a plan should also \ninclude two major rural provisions dealing with the standardized rate \namount and a change in the labor component to 62 percent. The \nstandardized rate amount will allow rural hospitals to receive a \nMedicare standardized payment rate equal to the higher rate paid to \nurban areas. The adjustment of the labor component from 71 percent to \n62 percent for rural hospitals will allow rural hospitals, which \ntraditionally have low labor costs, to base a larger portion of their \nMedicare reimbursement on nonlabor provisions, thereby receiving a \nhigher reimbursement from Medicare.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in making sound health care policy \ndecisions to ensure we are strengthening the foundation of our health \ncare delivery system in those areas in which it is most vulnerable.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to address the \nPrescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003 in a very basic \nway, and that is to answer some of the questions I have received over \nthe last several days since we have captured much of the attention both \nof the media as well as constituents around the country who realize we \nreally are going to pass very significant, very important legislation \nthat will affect their lives, that will affect the lives of seniors, \nindividuals with disabilities, and that will affect the lives of future \ngenerations. And this will happen in the next 12 to 13 days.\n  It goes back to the question of, Do we really need to change? Are \nthings really that different that they demand the sort of response we \nare putting forward where we talk about strengthening and improving the \nMedicare Program overall and at the same time providing prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors and individuals with disabilities that is not \nbeing provided today, and do it in a way that can be sustained over \ntime, recognizing that we will have a huge demographic shift of seniors \nover the next 30 years as a product of the baby boom following World \nWar II. That fertility curve, that baby boom moving through the system \nbegins to hit about 2007, 2008. That is when the curve moves through.\n  For the next 25 years after that, we will see this huge explosive \ngrowth in the number of seniors with fewer and fewer workers actually \npaying into the system.\n  We have now been on the bill Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, after \nhaving over 30 hearings on Medicare over the last several years and \nseveral hearings this year specifically on prescription drugs and \nMedicare modernization in the Finance Committee. We have done it in a \nvery systematic way, in a bipartisan way that I think captures the very \nbest of what this institution is all about, recognizing that we do not \nknow all of the answers, we cannot cure all of the problems.\n  We have to be very careful not to overpromise because everybody wants \nas much health care resources as possible, so we cannot overpromise. As \nI say, we need to reform the system in a way that does not just respond \nto the needs of today but responds to the next year, 5 years from now \nand 10 years from now. Since we cannot do it perfectly now, we have to \ndo it in a way so that the system is flexible and allows us to adapt \nappropriately.\n  Working on a bipartisan basis, the goal is to deliver a secure \nMedicare Program that is comprehensive and, at the same time, offers \nmaximum choice with that increased flexibility and that much-needed \nprescription drug coverage which seniors do not have today through the \nMedicare Program.\n  I look forward to the continued debate over the next 10, 11 days on \nhow we collectively determine how best to accomplish those goals. I am \nconfident we will be able to cull the very best ideas from both sides \nof the aisle to pass a responsible and effective plan.\n  As I mentioned, I want to limit my comments today to about how \nmedicine, science, and health care delivery has evolved and, indeed, \nhow that evolution, which has been very rapid in terms of breakthroughs \nin science, which I have been privileged to watch and participate in as \nI was in the field of medicine for 20 years before coming to the \nSenate--it has been miraculous in so many ways. When I close my eyes, I \nsee my patients with artificial hearts I had the privilege of \nimplanting, and with the heart transplants I was blessed to do on a \nweekly basis or even more often. I was involved in not the whole period \nsince 1965 when Medicare began, but shortly thereafter, I was in the \nactive practice of clinical medicine over that period of time.\n  If we just look at the last 10 years, life expectancy has increased \nby around 2 to 3 years, and if we look at the last 40 years, going back \nto about 1960, life expectancy increased 10 years in that period of \ntime since Medicare was begun.\n  Death rates from heart disease have been cut in about half over the \nperiod since Medicare began. Heart disease happens to be the field in \nwhich I specialized.\n  If we look at the field of cancer, whether it is prostate cancer, \nbreast cancer, or colon cancer, because of new treatments, new \nmedicines, and new diagnostic tools, we have seen markedly increased \npatient survival rates. At the same time, we have seen these great \nmedical breakthroughs in the health care delivery system, the private \nhealth care delivery system--not Medicare--but the private health care \ndelivery system has evolved and has responded.\n  The problem is that the underlying Medicare system itself has not \nevolved. In fact, there has been very little change in the Medicare \nsystem since 1965. So we have all these great medical advances and \nadvances in health care delivery over time which has skyrocketed, with \nimproved advances throughout, but we have a Medicare system that has \nchanged very little. It is this gap, this difference between the great \nbreakthroughs in medicine, science, and health care delivery and the \npretty much nonchanging Medicare system. That gap is what we are \nattempting to fill, to respond to as we go forward.\n\n  Medicare was designed to respond to an acute illness. Let's say you \nare healthy and all of a sudden you have a heart attack and you have a \ngood response to that heart attack in hospital treatment, and it worked \npretty well as long as that was what health care delivery was.\n  Today, the situation has changed markedly. Preventive medicine today \nis exponentially more important than in 1965. Why? Because we \nunderstand how to prevent disease, how to maintain health. In 1965, we \ndid not fully understand the nature of the science of preventive \nmedicine. It simply was not\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\ndeveloped in 1965 to the degree it is today. Yet we have a Medicare \nsystem which has--I came close to saying almost no preventive care is \nprovided in Medicare today. That is a little bit of an overexaggeration \nbecause we have to legislate that, yes, Medicare does cover \nmammography. Almost every one of these procedures has to be legislated, \nand with so many advances coming through quickly, we cannot keep up.\n  There is very little preventive care in Medicare today. Yet we all \nknow how important it is if we look at managing one's health today, \nmaximizing one's health.\n  In the 1970s, health care responded to acute episodic illnesses. \nToday it is preventive health care, maintaining wellness, management of \nchronic disease on an outpatient basis, using medicines, but Medicare \nhas not changed very much.\n  I will give a couple of examples. Again, the goal is health care \nsecurity for seniors. If you see a senior, you want to be able to say: \nThe Government is helping you with health care security, and health \ncare security means we have to include prescription drugs.\n  I mentioned Medicare lacks good preventive coverage. It also lacks \nthe wellness care in chronic disease management. For example, Medicare \ndoes not cover cholesterol screening. If we look at heart disease, \ncholesterol is important. Yet Medicare does not cover cholesterol \nscreening.\n  Medicare does not cover an annual physical examination today. I do \nnot know if it has to be every year or every 18 months, but the point \nis, systematic regular examinations, if you are going to pick up that \ncancer when it is small or that heart disease before it becomes a \nmassive heart attack, you can do it through annual physical exams, but \nthey are not covered under Medicare.\n  Medicare does not protect at the extreme end, what we call \ncatastrophic. That means if you are sick enough, if you have a lot of \nout-of-pocket expenditures, Medicare has no limit to that. Today if you \nhave a catastrophic illness, there is no upper limit. A lot of people \ndo not realize that.\n  The one issue we talk a lot about, because it is probably most \ndramatic, is that Medicare does not at all cover outpatient \nprescription drugs.\n  Thus, we have gaps in coverage for seniors. We are promising them \nhealth care security which they deserve, and yet we have these huge \ngaps in coverage which have been created since 1965. It is our \nobligation, our responsibility to respond, and, thus, over the next 12 \ndays we will be putting together a bipartisan plan--though we do not \nknow all the answers--we will be putting together the very best of what \nwe do know to respond to these needs.\n  Today, on average--and a lot of people do not understand, or they \nwere not aware of this, so it is important for us to keep saying it--\nMedicare covers right at about half of what a senior's medical care \nexpenses are. Most think it covers 80 or 90 percent. If one is not yet \na senior, it is important for them to know what their Government is \ndoing for them now is to cover only about half of the expenses. Again, \nmost people are not aware of that.\n  The response to that is that seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities try to fill those gaps on their own, sometimes \nsuccessfully, and many times not. They try to do it through Medicaid. \nThey try to do it through private supplemental insurance programs, only \nto find that they are hit with these skyrocketing premiums that are \ngrowing 10, 15, 20 percent a year at this point. Or they find that \ntheir employer on whom they were depending is scaling back on the \nbenefits that they once had when they were working full time.\n  I say all of this because it is important for people to understand \nwhy we are aggressively moving ahead in the way we are to develop a \nstrengthened and improved Medicare plan.\n  I mentioned the lack of prescription drugs. If we look at aging, our \npopulation over the age of 65, we know prescription drugs become even \nmore important than they are under 65 years of age or under 50 years of \nage or under 45 years of age, and that is new. It is really within the \nlast 30 years that these medicines have become so important. Thus, it \nis our obligation to strengthen and improve access to prescription \ndrugs.\n  I have had the privilege to observe a lot of this as a physician, and \nI will give a couple of examples. Over the past 3 decades--remember, \nMedicare started in 1965--the death rate from hardening of the \narteries, or atherosclerosis, the underlying pathology within the \nheart, has declined by 74 percent. Deaths from ischemic heart disease--\nischemic is low blood flow where the heart is not getting enough oxygen \nand blood, and that is what causes a heart attack, hardening of the \narteries, myocardial infarction, heart attack--death rates have fallen \nover the last 30 years by 60 percent.\n  People ask why. There are lots of reasons, but I would say one of the \nmajor reasons is medicines today, that we are treating high blood \npressure earlier; we are treating congestive heart failure earlier \nbefore these deaths from ischemic and other heart disease occur. \nMedicines that were not around 30 years ago are the beta blockers. It \nactually makes the heart so it does not beat so hard. If it is not \nbeating so hard, it does not consume as much energy and does not need \nas much oxygen. Therefore, low blood flow to the heart does okay. Other \ndrugs called ACE, A-C-E, inhibitors, the medicines, in large part, have \nexplained this increasing survival fall in mortality.\n  Over the last 30 years since Medicare began, death rates from \nemphysema, or lung disease--a type of lung disease called chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, is one of those two types--\nhave fallen by 60 percent in large part because of the use of anti-\ninflammatory medications--they decrease the inflammation in the lungs--\nand also a group of drugs call bronchodilators, which dilate those \nlittle bronchial air waves in the lung. The point is, it is these \nmedicines that in large part explain this improved health and the \nimproved treatment of emphysema.\n  I have a couple of books with which I wanted to illustrate my point. \nNearly 400 lifesaving drugs have been produced in the last 10 years. \nMeanwhile, there are over 600 medicines under development right now by \nthe Nation's pharmaceutical research companies to treat diabetes, heart \ndisease, cancer, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.\n\n  I mentioned these books. This is called the PDR, the Physicians' Desk \nReference, for pharmaceutical specialities and biologicals for the \nphysician's desk. Every physician in the country uses this on a regular \nbasis because it allows them to look up individual medicines. It gives \nthe descriptions, the side effects, and the contraindications. No \nmatter how smart one is or how much time one spends with it, there is \nno way to remember all of these drugs or everything in the book, \nalthough some people may be able to.\n  The point is, this book was printed in 1965. This is the year \nMedicare was actually passed and then implemented. That was over 30 \nyears ago. Again, this book has 1,060 pages in it. The type is pretty \nsmall. It is just medicine after medicine. When I see this, I am kind \nof glad I do not have to know all of that right now because there is so \nmuch in it.\n  This PDR is the 57th edition, and this one is from 2003. It is pretty \ninteresting to me because this first book is when Medicare started, and \nthis other book is where we are today. Today's book is a little bigger \nbut is a lot thicker, and instead of having 1,060 pages in it--these \nare not all lifesaving drugs but all drugs which have a real importance \nin terms of treating and quality of life--this book has 3,500 pages in \nit. I wish I could show this to the Chair, but the type in this new \nbook is about half the size of the type in the old book. So the truth \nis, it is about 6,000 pages.\n  The point is, medicines make a difference. They made a difference in \n1965. They really make a difference today. Seniors do not have access \nto these through our Medicare system in either case. Great advances, \nand our Medicare system has not changed. It does not recognize that as \nwe go forward. That is why we are here. I want to make this case of why \nwe are here and why this is so important today that the health care \nsystem, the delivery system, has markedly improved with great \nscientific advances, and Medicare is not capturing it today. Our \nseniors deserve for those to be captured.\n  Next month does mark the 38th anniversary of the launch of Medicare. \nOn July 30, 1965, President Johnson traveled to Independence, MO, to \nsign the\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\nbill into law. President Truman, who had initiated the drive for health \ncare security for seniors about 20 years earlier, was on hand to \nreceive that first Medicare card. President Johnson, upon signing that \nhistoric legislation, told the assembled lawmakers in 1965:\n\n       The benefits under the law are as varied and broad as the \n     marvelous modern medicine itself. No longer will older \n     Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine. \n     No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that \n     they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they \n     might enjoy dignity in their later years. No longer will \n     young families see their own incomes, and their own hopes, \n     eaten away simply because they are carrying out their deep \n     moral obligations to their parents . . .\n\n  Nearly 40 years later, we have an opportunity to realize this noble \nvision. Before the end of next week, the Senate will have the \nopportunity to pass legislation that does provide prescription drug \ncoverage for our seniors, that does protect seniors and gives them \nhealth care security by giving them greater choices so that they can \nchoose the health care coverage that best meets their individual needs.\n  I believe future generations will judge us by the choices we make \nover the next several days and at the end of next week, whether we \nchose to act responsibly, recognizing our obligations to strengthen and \nimprove the system, or whether we chose just to talk about it, the same \nrhetoric, something that we should do. My position is clear; now is the \ntime to act. I am delighted we are acting in a bipartisan way. Now is \nthe time not just to tinker and play around the edges, but it is time \nto truly transform the system.\n  We have a responsibility to provide our seniors with a system that \nworks, that indeed gives them health care security, and now is our \nopportunity to deliver it. It will require us to focus on the big \npicture. It will require us to focus on the future. It will require us \nto focus on our fellow citizens, whom we are so privileged to \nrepresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished majority \nleader for his excellent set of remarks today. The comparison between \nthe two PDR books is startling. Anyone who looks at it has to admit we \nhave come a long way since 1965.\n  This bill was a great addition to the health care for our people. It \ncould not have happened without the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, our leader, plus the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, and the distinguished leader from Montana, Senator \nBaucus. I appreciate having a doctor in the Senate. As a former medical \nliability defense lawyer, I have to say I have always respected Senator \nFrist very greatly, but nothing comes close to how much I respect him \nas a physician, as somebody who cares for people and has given so much \nof his life to healing people.\n  I am very grateful to have heard these remarks today.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 933\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I will only take a few minutes, but I \nrise in opposition to the Bingaman amendment.\n  First, let me make one thing clear, and perfectly clear:\n  The assets test in S. 1 is the same assets test used for determining \neligibility for the qualified Medicare beneficiaries, QMBs, specified \nlow-income Medicare beneficiaries, SLMBs, and qualified individuals, \nQI-1s.\n  S. 1 provides a generous low-income subsidy for those who are below \n160 percent of the Federal poverty level. Currently, in order for some \nindividuals under 160 percent of poverty to receive limited Medicaid \nprotections, they must meet both an income limit and an assets test.\n  In S. 1, we simply follow these same rules in order for low-income \nbeneficiaries to receive assistance with their prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  By including the Medicaid assets test for Medicare prescription drug \nsubsidies, we are providing beneficiaries with seamless health \ncoverage. We are not confusing beneficiaries and we are not adding \nadditional administrative burdens to States.\n  Let me give you some background on the current assets test included \nin the Medicaid program.\n  Qualified Medicare beneficiaries are individuals below 100 percent of \npoverty. In 2006, the annual income limit is $9,670 for individuals and \n$13,051 for couples. QMBs are allowed to have assets below $4,000 for \nindividuals and $6,000 for couples.\n  Specified low-income Medicare beneficiaries and QI-1s are those with \nincomes between 100 percent of poverty and 135 percent of poverty. In \n2006, the annual income limit is $13,054 for individuals and $17,618 \nfor couples. SLMBs and QI-1s are allowed to have assets below $4,000 \nfor individuals and $6,000 for couples.\n  Beneficiaries between 136 percent and 159 percent of poverty will \nhave annual income limits of $15,472 for individuals and $20,881 for \ncouples in 2006. Beneficiaries between 136 and 159 percent of poverty \nwould not be subjected to assets tests.\n  Current law establishes resource limits for low-income elderly or \ndisabled individuals. Let met emphasize, this is not a newly added \nrestriction on certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries. However, \ncurrent law also provides States with the flexibility to choose to \ndisregard all or part of these resources.\n  The Bingaman amendment, which eliminates the Medicaid assets test \nlimits would add significantly to the number of eligible beneficiaries.\n  A study prepared for the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that as \nmany as 11 million individuals would be newly eligible for low-income \nassistance if the assets test were eliminated. I have no idea how much \nthat will cost but it will be expensive.\n  In addition to increasing the Federal cost of the bill, this \namendment would impose a significant, new, unfunded mandate on States, \nwhich must pay a share of Medicaid benefits by paying for the dual \neligible beneficiary's liability for premiums, deductibles, and \ncoinsurance.\n  Also, some States may experience an additional administrative or \nfinancial impact from potential program redesigns because, in some \ncases, States link eligibility for their state-only programs with the \neligibility requirements for these special categories of the dually \neligible.\n  S. 1 includes a provision to require the GAO to conduct a study and \nmake recommendations to Congress by 2007 regarding the extent to which \ndrug utilization and access to covered drugs differs between qualifying \ndual eligibles who receive subsidies and individuals who do not qualify \nsolely because of the application of an assets test.\n  This amendment will not only cost money, it will cause confusion. I \nurge my colleagues to defeat the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the underlying bill, the bill from the \nSenate Finance Committee to provide prescription drugs for the \nimprovement and strengthening of Medicare, provides a very generous \nlow-income subsidy for those who are below 160 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. For some of the seniors below 160 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, there is no asset test.\n  Currently, in order for some of the individuals below 160 percent of \npoverty to receive the most generous low-income subsidies, there is an \nasset test and there ought to be. The crafting of this bill provided \neveryone a conscientious effort and decision to make possible this \nlegislation and to make it well balanced. There were extra dollars and \nthe decision was made to fill in the coverage gap rather than eliminate \nthe assets test. There is no limitless amount of funds for this \nprescription drug benefit.\n  We are in a position of zero sum gain. We have $400 billion under the \nbudget to work with. This bill works to do the most for all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Seniors with incomes below 160 percent and who do not \npass the established asset test still receive a very generous low-\nincome subsidy. These beneficiaries will not have a gap in coverage.\n  This amendment by the Senator from New Mexico will add unknown costs \nto the current bill. It will change the structure of the bill and \naffect the current Medicaid Program by adding costs that are very \nsubstantial in the outyears. Therefore, when we vote tomorrow on the \nBingaman amendment I hope we will have a strong vote against it. Not \nthat I denigrate in any way the intentions of the Senator from New \nMexico. I know him to be a very conscientious Senator, to do well, and \nto\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nbe very thoughtful in his approach. Obviously, on this point he has \nsome disagreement with the product of our committee that was voted out \n16 to 5 last Thursday.\n  But, here again, we have to do the most we can within the $400 \nbillion that the Budget Committee has given us to work with for \nproviding a prescription drug benefit to our seniors as part of \nimproving and strengthening the Medicare Program overall. We could have \nput more money into the asset test as he indicates he wants to do now \nwith this amendment. We chose, as I indicated before, to help more \npeople with the same amount of money by filling in the gap or, as some \npeople would say, the donut hole.\n  We believe we should put as much effort as we can into taking care of \nthat problem because, to help the very same people Senator Bingaman \nwants to help, we have put a lot of resources into the effort of \nprescription drugs for seniors, for those below 160 percent of poverty.\n  So, once again, I urge the amendment be defeated when we vote on it \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8116-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Madam President, the Council on Foreign Relations \nIndependent Task Force on Burma today released a report entitled: \n``Burma: A Time for Change''. I am pleased to have had an opportunity \nto serve as a member of the Task Force along with my colleagues, \nSenators Lugar and Feinstein, and Representative Lantos.\n  The report describes the State Peace and Development Council's \nrepressive rule in Burma, and makes a number of recommendations \nincluding: increased humanitarian assistance for the people of Burma \nthrough NGOS, and in consultation with the NLD and other groups \nrepresentative of a multiethnic Burma; an import ban on goods produced \nin Burma, visa denials to leaders of the military regime and its \npolitical arms, and the freezing of assets abroad; U.S. leadership in \nurging the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution that \ndemands the immediate release of Suu Kyi and all other political \nprisoners, and to hold an emergency session to impose other sanctions \non Burma; U.S. leadership in working with our allies and Burma's \nregional neighbors to bolster support for the struggle for freedom and \nthe rule of law in Burma; no certification for Burma on narcotics \ncooperation as it has ``failed demonstrably'' to curtail drug \nproduction, drug trafficking and money laundering; and increased \nassistance to refugees fleeing Burma in Thailand, India, Bangladesh, \nand China.\n  I thank the council for the timeliness of the task force, and all the \nmembers for their participation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the executive \nsummary of the report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Burma: A Time For Change\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       On May 30, 2003, the Burmese military regime orchestrated \n     violent attacks by pro-government militia on Aung san Suu \n     Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD) \n     and her supporters as they traveled outside Mandalay. At \n     least four of her bodyguards were killed as well as a \n     significant number of others. She has been held in custody \n     since then. Following the attacks, the regime arrested more \n     than 100 democracy activists, imprisoned at least a dozen, \n     shut down NLD offices across the country, and closed schools \n     and universities. This is the bloodiest confrontation between \n     Burma's military rulers and democracy supporters since 1988, \n     when the government suppressed a popular uprising against the \n     regime and thousands were killed.\n       Burma has been ruled for more than 40 years by a succession \n     of military regimes that have systematically impoverished a \n     country once known for its high literacy rate, excellent \n     universities, and abundant natural resources. Today, Burma is \n     one of the most tightly controlled dictatorships in the \n     world, lacking any freedom of speech, assembly, or the press; \n     denying any due process of law; and perpetuating human rights \n     abuses, such as forced labor, military rape of civilians, \n     political imprisonment, torture, trafficking in persons, and \n     use of child soldiers. Burma is also facing what the United \n     Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) has called a ``silent \n     emergency,'' a health crisis of epidemic proportions. HIV/\n     AIDS is spreading rapidly, and malaria, tuberculosis, \n     leprosy, maternal mortality, and malnutrition are pervasive. \n     Government spending on health and education is miniscule.\n       Burma is a leading producer of opium and methamphetamine \n     for the illegal drug trade, which is a major source of \n     corruption within Burma. Four decades of military operations \n     against insurgent ethnic nationalities as well as mass forced \n     relocations have created one of the largest refugee \n     populations in Asia. As many as two million people have fled \n     Burma for political and economic reasons; inside Burma, \n     hundred of thousands have been internally displaced. They \n     lack access to food, health care, schools, and even clean \n     water.\n       In August 1988, a popular uprising against the military \n     regime was brutally suppressed and thousands were killed. In \n     1990, the regime held elections for a multi-party parliament \n     in which the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung \n     San Suu Kyi who was then under house arrest, won 82 percent \n     of the seats. However, the elections were ignored by the \n     junta and the elected parliamentary representatives never \n     took office. The regime imprisoned hundreds of pro-democracy \n     supporters, including elected members of parliament. \n     Thousands more fled the country.\n       After the 1988 uprising, the United States imposed \n     graduated sanctions on Burma, initially terminating economic \n     aid, withdrawing trade preferences, imposing an arms embargo, \n     and blocking loans the grants from international financial \n     institutions. In 1997, based on a presidential finding that \n     the Burmese government had committed large-scale repression \n     and violence against the democratic opposition, the United \n     States banned any new American investments in Burma.\n       In 2000, the United Nations, mandated by UN General \n     Assembly resolutions, sent Special Envoy Razali Ismail to \n     Rangoon to promote substantive political dialogue on \n     transition to democratic government between Burmese \n     government and the democratic opposition. Since then, \n     Ambassador Razali has visited Rangoon nine times with no \n     apparent progress toward establishing this dialogue. He is \n     returning to Rangoon in early June.\n       In order to strengthen international efforts to install \n     democratic government and end repression in Burma, the Task \n     Force recommends that the United States take specific \n     initiatives in four key areas:\n\n        Humanitarian assistance to address Burma's health crisis\n\n       In view of Burma's massive public health crisis, the United \n     States should increase humanitarian assistance to Burma, \n     provided that funds are given to international nongovermental \n     organizations (NGOs) for basic human needs through a process \n     that requires transparency, accountability, and consultation \n     with the NLD and other groups representatives of a \n     multiethnic Burma.\n       Although the United States should not generally provide \n     humanitarian assistance directly to the Burmese government, \n     the United States could provide technical assistance to the \n     Ministry of Health if the Burmese government agrees to meet \n     the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) standard that \n     HIV/AIDS testing be voluntary and confidential.\n       The United States should work together with other donor \n     governments, UN agencies, and if possible, the Burmese \n     government State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to \n     establish certain minimal standards of independence for \n     international NGOs operating in Burma, including clear \n     guidelines for administrative operations, reporting, and \n     other regulations involving duty-free entry privileges, \n     memoranda of understanding and residency permits.\n\n         Promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law\n\n       In view of the recent government-sponsored attacks on \n     members of the democratic opposition, resulting in a number \n     of deaths, and the Burmese government's detention of Aung San \n     Suu Kyi, the United States should urge the United Nations \n     Security Council to adopt a resolution that demands the \n     immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political \n     prisoners and condemns the Burmese government's egregious \n     human rights abuses as well as its refusal to engage in \n     substantive political dialogue with the democratic \n     opposition. In addition, the United States should urge the \n     Security Council to hold an emergency session on Burma to \n     discuss imposing targeted sanctions, which could include \n     denying visas to leaders of the military regime, the Union \n     Solidarity Development Association (USDA) and their families, \n     freezing their assets and imposing bans\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\n     both on new investment in Burma and on importing goods \n     produced in Burma.\n       Because the Burmese military government has failed to \n     address human rights abuses, including the unconditional \n     release of all political prisoners, and to move forward in \n     talks with the NLD and other pro-democracy groups toward \n     establishing a democratic government, the United States \n     should increase well-targeted sanctions, including an import \n     ban on goods produced in Burma, and encourage the United \n     Nations and other countries to join with the United States in \n     adopting similar sanctions.\n       The United States should redouble its efforts with the \n     governments of China, Japan and the Association of Southeast \n     Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, particularly Thailand, \n     Singapore and Malaysia, to press the SPDC to work with the \n     NLD and ethnic nationalities toward political transition in \n     Burma. The United States, as a member of the SEAN Regional \n     Forum, should urge ASEAN to consider seriously the cross-\n     border effects of internal problems including \n     illegal migration, health, trafficking, narcotics and \n     other issues connected with the internal situation in \n     Burma. The United States should also continue to \n     coordinate closely with the European Union on policies \n     toward Burma.\n       Until the SPDC makes substantial progress in improving \n     human rights and engaging in substantive political dialogue \n     with the democratic opposition, the United States should \n     strongly discourage the government of Japan from forgiving \n     outstanding debt from bilateral grants and loans except those \n     that directly address basic human needs. Such aid should \n     exclude infrastructure projects, such as dams and airport \n     renovations, and also be limited to basic human needs. \n     Moreover, the United States should encourage Japan to use its \n     influence with ASEAN governments to urge them to become pro-\n     active in support of democracy and human rights in Burma.\n       While maintaining its own sanctions on Burma, the United \n     States, as one of the largest donors to the international \n     financial institutions, should urge Asian investors to press \n     the Burmese government to begin implementing the economic \n     measures recommended by the World Bank, International \n     Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank as one of the \n     prerequisites for further investment. The United States \n     should also urge China to use its influence to press the \n     Burmese government to reform its economy and move towards \n     democratic governance in order to promote stability in the \n     region.\n       In order to develop capacity for future democratic \n     governance and to rebuild technical competence in Burma, the \n     United States should promote cultural, media and educational \n     exchanges with the Burmese, provided that these opportunities \n     are readily accessible to qualified candidates, including \n     representatives of the political opposition. The selection \n     process should include widespread publicity of exchange and \n     fellowship opportunities, a joint selection committee \n     comprised of Burmese civilian authorities (academics, \n     intellectuals) and representatives of the U.S. Embassy in \n     Rangoon who, after consulting broadly, make their selections \n     based on the quality of candidates and their potential to \n     contribute to Burma's future. In addition, the United States \n     should provide increased funding for the American Center in \n     Rangoon as well as for English language training and \n     scholarship opportunities.\n\n               U.S. narcotics control policy toward Burma\n\n       The United States should not certify Burma at this time \n     because it has ``failed demonstrably'' to curtail drug \n     production, drug trafficking and money laundering. In \n     addition, the United States should not provide any counter-\n     narcotics assistance to the Burmese government. Increased \n     counter-narcotics cooperation should depend, at minimum, on \n     significant steps by the Burmese government to curb \n     methamphetamine production, to arrest leading traffickers, \n     and to stop channeling drug money into the illicit economy.\n\n        IV. Refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons\n\n       The United States should strongly urge the Thai government \n     to halt deportations of Burmese and protect the security of \n     Burmese living in Thailand, regardless of their status. In \n     addition, the United States should coordinate U.S. policy \n     towards Thailand with donors, such as the governments of \n     Norway, Denmark, Japan, and Canada.\n       The United States should provide increased humanitarian \n     assistance, including cross-border assistance, for displaced \n     Burmese along both sides of the Thai-Burma border as well as \n     on Burmese's borders with India, Bangladesh, and China, as \n     well as inside Burma. Support should be provided for clean \n     water, sanitation services, primary health care, reproductive \n     health, and health education for refugees and undocumented \n     migrants living in refugee-like circumstances. Support of \n     education, especially for women and children, is also \n     critical.\n       The United States should urge greater access by \n     international NGOs and UN agencies to northern Rakhine State \n     provide humanitarian assistance and monitor abuses committed \n     against Muslim communities and returned refugees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8117-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8117-S8118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SAVING FREEDOM OF SPEECH\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, we are in trouble. The Federal \nCommunications Commission, by a three to two vote, is prepared to bring \nabout monopolistic control of the news, monopolistic control of the \nmedia, monopolistic control of entertainment. Public interest rules for \ncross ownership and market control are being abolished and no one \npoints this out more cogently than Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Editor in \nChief, in the June 23, 2003 edition of the U.S. News and World Report. \nThe Congress will be compelled to act if we are to save freedom of \nspeech in this country. To understand the issues I ask unanimous \nconsent that the article be printed in the Record. I also commend to my \ncolleagues the Columbia Journalism Review--www.cjr.org--of who owns \nwhat, listing the holdings of the five behemoths Viacom, News \nCorporation, AOL-Time Warner, Walt Disney Company and General Electric \ntoo much under the present rulings.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, June 23, 2001]\n\n                     A Sure-fire Recipe for Trouble\n\n                       (By Mortimer B. Zuckerman)\n\n       Three anonymous political appointees to the Federal \n     Communications Commission have just delivered a body blow to \n     American democracy. Large media companies are to be allowed \n     to buy up more TV stations and newspapers, becoming more \n     powerful and reaping a financial bonanza. Astonishingly, the \n     FCC has done this without public review, without analyzing \n     its consequences, and without the American people getting a \n     dime in return for their public airwaves. Under the FCC deal, \n     big media companies must make no commitment to provide better \n     news, or even unbiased news. Ditto with local news coverage \n     and children's programming. In fact, the new rules \n     dramatically worsen opportunities for local news coverage, \n     for diversity of views, and for competition. ``The public be \n     damned!'' was a robber baron's slogan from the Gilded Age. \n     Seems to be just what the FCC is saying.\n       Consider the enormity of the changes. The commissioners \n     removed the ban on broadcasting and newspaper cross-\n     ownership. They raised the national cap on audience reach by \n     station-group owners to 45 percent. They allowed ownership of \n     two stations in more markets, and even three in a handful of \n     markets. There's more, but you get the idea.\n       Monopolies. These FCC rules allow new merger possibilities \n     without any public-interest review. The details are \n     complicated, but basically, thanks to the FCC, one company \n     now can own UHF TV stations in 199 of the nation's 210 TV \n     markets, which is pretty much the equivalent of owning \n     stations in every TV market in every state except California. \n     That means a single company could influence the elections for \n     98 U.S. senators, 382 members of the House of \n     Representatives, 49 governors, 49 state legislatures, and \n     countless local races. Employing another strategy now allowed \n     by the FCC, that same company could own VHF stations in every \n     TV market in 38 states, with the power to influence elections \n     in 76 U.S. senate races, 182 House races, 38 gubernatorial \n     races, and 38 state legislatures, along with countless local \n     races. There are other scenarios. But again, you get the \n     idea.\n       Easing the rules on cross-ownership means that in many \n     local markets one company could own its leading daily \n     newspaper--and, often, its only newspaper--its top-rated TV \n     station, the local cable company, and, as a bonus, five to \n     eight radio stations. Previously, no TV and newspaper mergers \n     were allowed in the same market, except when a firm was \n     failing. Now the merger of the dominant newspaper and TV \n     station could create local news monopolies in 200 markets \n     serving 98 percent of all Americans.\n       What's going on? Several years ago, the FCC allowed one \n     company to own as many radio stations as it wanted. The \n     unintended result is the monopolization of many local markets \n     and three national companies owning half the stations in \n     America, delivering a homogenized product that neglects local \n     news coverage. Small to midsize firms know that major \n     networks will gobble up affiliates, cut local programming \n     costs, and program centrally from their own stations. \n     Independents will be squeezed out. ``For Sale'' signs are \n     already going up. More consolidation, more news sharing, and \n     fewer journalists add up to an enhanced danger of media \n     corporations abusing market power to slant coverage in ways \n     that fit their political and financial interests--and \n     suppressing coverage that doesn't. One defense of this \n     outrage that big media companies offer is the diversity of \n     the Web. Well, yes. But does anyone really think the Internet \n     is anything like an organized political or media power, much \n     less a counterweight to a claque of billion-dollar media \n     behemoths?\n       The good news is that the nation, finally, is waking up. \n     The FCC has received hundreds of thousands of protests. \n     Congressmen, both Democrats and Republicans, are alarmed. So \n     are groups as diverse as Common Cause, the National Rifle \n     Association, and the Screen Actors Guild. One of our more \n     thoughtful conservative columnists, William Safire of\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\n     the New York Times, writes that ``the concentration of \n     power--political, corporate, media, cultural--should be \n     anathema to conservatives.'' John Roberts in the Chicago \n     Tribune deplores the ``blatantly disingenuous, if not \n     dishonest, explanations being given by FCC Chairman Michael \n     Powell and his supporters for their actions.''\n       No prizes for guessing who supports the commission: the \n     major media conglomerates who have coincidentally spent more \n     than $80 million on lobbying, plus over $25 million in \n     political contributions, in the past three years and stand to \n     gain enormously from this.\n       Regardless of their political ideology, we cannot risk \n     nonelected media bosses having inappropriate local, regional, \n     or national power. The FCC was created to ensure that the \n     public interest is served by the media companies that use our \n     airwaves. Everyone is entitled to a mistake sometime, but the \n     FCC is abusing the privilege. Congress must act now and \n     reverse the FCC's irresponsible new rules.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8118-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CHANGES TO H.

Madam President, I rise today to speak to an issue that we \nneed to promptly address. As part of the Protect Act of 2003, we \nauthorized a pilot program to study the feasibility of instituting a \nnational background check for those who volunteer in children's \nactivities. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will \nprovide its expertise to assist volunteer organizations in evaluating \nthe criminal records of volunteers to determine if the volunteers are \nfit to interact and provide care for children.\n  Currently, the Protect Act tasks the National Center with operating \nthe cyber tip line in addition to its participation in the pilot \nprogram. The Protect Act presently immunizes the National Center for \noperating the cyber tip line as long as it does so consistent with the \npurpose of the tip line. However, no similar protection was provided \nwith respect to the National Center's activities related to the pilot \nprogram. The bill I have offered will extend the immunity to the \nNational Center for its participation in the pilot program.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this technical fix so \nthat the worthy goals of the pilot program can commence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8118-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Madam President, each year fifth graders across the \nUnited States compete in a writing contest on immigration sponsored by \nthe American Immigrant Law Foundation and the American Immigration \nLayers Association. Thousands of students participated in this year's \ncompetition, responding to the question, ``Why I'm Glad America is a \nNation of Immigrants.''\n  In 1958, President Kennedy, who was then completing his first term as \na Senator, published a book with the title, ``A Nation of Immigrants,'' \nand I had the privilege of serving as one of the judges for this year's \ncontest. It was impressive to see how the students responded. Their \nessays illustrate the wealth of diverse cultures that immigrants share \nwith our Nation. The students' writings radiate with pride for our \ndiversity and our immigrant heritage. Many students told personal \nstories of their families and friends and their immigration to the \nUnited States.\n  The winner of this year's contest is Miranda Santucci of Pittsburgh. \nIn her essay, ``An American Patchwork Quilt,'' Miranda explores the \nvalue of her friends' cultures and how their diversity has enhanced her \nlife. She compares the United States to a colorful patchwork quilt \nwhere ``every fabric piece tells an immigrant's story about overcoming \nhardship, seeking opportunities, and reaching for dreams,'' and where \n``threads of different languages, customs, foods, cultures, religions \nand skills hold these pieces together.'' Miranda's eloquent essay \nreaches to the heart of what makes us all uniquely American.\n  Other students honored for their exceptional writing were Rachel \nAdams of Houston, Melissa Cheng of Atlanta, Jessica Du of Alameda, and \nElias Reisman of Indianapolis. I congratulate these students on their \noutstanding achievement, and I know my brother would be proud of them \ntoo.\n  These award-winning essays will be of interest to all of us in the \nSenate, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Each quilt \n     square is made up of different colors and textures with a \n     unique design and pattern.

Madam President, on June 11, 2003, I had the honor and \nprivilege of attending the retirement ceremony at Fort Myer, VA, for \nGEN Eric Shinseki, who served with distinction during his 4 years as \nArmy Chief of Staff. A native of Hawaii who rose through the ranks \nwhile devoting 38 years of his life to defending our Nation, General \nShinseki ended his career as the highest ranking Asian-American in the \nhistory of the United States military.\n  His farewell speech was a message of thanks, a reminder of the need \nfor shared values, and an underscoring of the importance of inspired \nleadership and the dangers of arrogance.\n  I ask that General Shinseki's speech, as well as the remarks that \nActing Secretary of the Army Les Brownlee made during General \nShinseki's retirement ceremony, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n  Speech by General Eric K.

Grandma Shinseki, who turns 92 this \n     year, has chosen not to travel, and my sister, Yvonne, has \n     remained at home with her. But just about everyone else is \n     here--my older brother, Paul, and his family, then Patty and \n     our children--Lori, Ken, and their spouses who have made \n     Patty and me grandparents five times over. Many others from \n     Patty's and my wonderful family are gathered in strength--\n     uncles, aunts, sisters, brothers, cousins, nephews and \n     nieces--wonderful people who live simple lives in proud and \n     vocal support of this Chief. God bless you all.\n       So many other dear friends and associates--too numerous to \n     name but whose journeys have brought them miles, years, and \n     memories to be here today. Kauai High School classmates, \n     classmates from Hunterdon Central High School, where I spend \n     a defining year of my life as an exchange student in New \n     Jersey; the men and women of the distinguished West Point \n     Class of 1965, representatives from industry and the \n     nonprofits who have done so much for the Army and soldiers, \n     especially Frances Hesselbein of the Leader to Leader \n     Institute, members of our superb, professional media--Joe \n     Galloway, Thom Shanker, Dick Cooper, Dave Moniz, Greg Jaffe, \n     Ann Roosevelt, Joe Burlas, and others--who have helped to \n     tell our soldiers' stories, the international representatives \n     of the attache corps, our wonderful Army Arlington Ladies, \n     who represent the Chief of Staff at each and every Army \n     funeral in Arlington to honor our soldiers when they are laid \n     to rest, thank you.\n       Youngsters from my front office and the Quarters 1 staffs, \n     John Gingrich and members of my staff group; my XOs, Joe \n     Riojas and Tom Bostick; and Lil Cowell, the steady hand in \n     the office of the CSA for four Chiefs, who quietly retired \n     last week; CW5 Dan Logan; SGM Bruce Cline and Team CSA; SFC \n     John Turk and the Admin Section; Major Pedro Almeida, the \n     last in a series of world-class aides; Linda Jacobs and the \n     heroes of protocol, all kept the office of the Chief well-\n     represented through sheer hard work and dedication, making my \n     life and Patty's most rewarding. Thank you all.\n       Teri and Karen Maude and the Brian Birdwells, survivors of \n     11 September 2001, among the many hurt and scarred that day; \n     spouses of the generals who ran the ground war in Iraqi \n     Freedom; Carmen McKiernan, Kimberly Webster, Dee Thurman, and \n     Bea Christianson, thank you for coming today and for your \n     generosity, grace, and courage. Other distinguished guests, \n     ladies and gentlemen.\n       My name is Shinseki, and I am a soldier--an American \n     soldier, who was born in the midst of World War II, began his \n     service in Vietnam 37 years ago, and retires today in the \n     midst of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. The strategic \n     environment remains dangerous and we, in the military, serve \n     our nation by providing the very best capabilities to restore \n     order in a troubled world. Soldiering is an honorable \n     profession, and I am privileged to have served every day for \n     the past 38 years as a soldier.\n       The Good Book tells us, to everything there is a season and \n     a time to every purpose. Today is a time for thank yous, and \n     our purpose is to say farewell. As we speak, more than \n     370,000 soldiers are deployed and forward stationed in 120 \n     countries. Their missions range from combat to peacekeeping \n     to rebuilding nations to humanitarian assistance to disaster \n     relief--and a host of other missions in between. And as busy \n     as they are, there have been no dropped balls--none, on any \n     mission. They are trained, disciplined, focused, and well-\n     led. The soldiers arrayed before us represent the \n     magnificence of that Army. Their parade formation stretches \n     not only from left to right across this field, but also \n     backwards in history to a time before the republic was \n     formed. Precision counts in this profession, and no one does \n     it any better than the Old Guard and Pershing's Own. Please \n     join me in thanking the soldiers on parade today and on duty \n     here, behind the stars and around the world.\n       Thanks also to former bosses, mentors, friends, and fellow \n     soldiers who trained me as a soldier, and grew me as a \n     leader--some of them are here today. General Fred Franks, who \n     more than anyone else has been coach and mentor in all the \n     years I served as a general officer. Generals Butch Saint, Ed \n     Burba, Rich Cardillo, Tom Tait, who fought to keep me on \n     active duty after a service-disqualifying injury, Dick Davis, \n     Colonel Greynolds, my hospital bunkmate Bill Hale, and \n     Sergeant Ernie Kingcade, noncommissioned officer, who, while \n     under way by ship to Vietnam, provided me the only officer \n     basic course I would receive before going into battle--and I \n     could not have had a better education. Ernie, it has been a \n     long journey, and the example you set has been with me for 38 \n     years. Thanks for that early model of what noncommissioned \n     officers were supposed to be. I have never expected less, and \n     it has made all the difference.\n       To the men of '65--strength and drive. Thirty-Eight years \n     since we stepped off together as soldiers. You have been role \n     models, friends, associates, and fellow soldiers for these \n     many years. Your notes in the days following 11 September \n     and during the height of Iraqi Freedom were of great \n     comfort--wonderful reminders of all that we had been \n     through together. Thanks for standing my last formation \n     with me. It's been my distinct honor to have been \n     associated with you and with what we've accomplished as a \n     class. Your presence is most appreciated.\n       To Patty, my wife of 38 years, you taught me the meaning of \n     selflessness, of elegance, of courage, and of a bright spirit \n     undiminished by time or adversity. You have seen me at my \n     worst and stuck with me--and you've seen me at my best and \n     chuckled in disbelief. Throughout it all, your patience, your \n     balance, your encouragement, and your love and support have \n     sustained me. You stood beside my hospital bed for days. \n     Helped me learn to walk a second time, enabled me to regain \n     confidence and a sense of direction, helped me reestablish a \n     professional career, moved our children and our household 31 \n     times, and always, always provided great strength when it was \n     needed most. You could have been and done anything you chose; \n     yet you chose to be a soldier's wife. The profound grace of \n     that decision has blessed me immeasurably. Thank you for 38 \n     wonderful years in a profession I loved nearly as much as \n     you.\n       Lastly, I want to thank the men who have served in this \n     position, those who saw the Army through some dark days \n     following Vietnam. It was a daunting and enormous task, but \n     they, with others who are present today, did it. They gave us \n     back an NCO Corps, and they gave us back an Army that fights: \n     Generals Creighton Abrams, Fred Weyand, Bernie Rogers, Shy \n     Meyer, John Wickham, Carl Vuono, Gordon Sullivan, and Denny \n     Reimer.\n       These leaders rose to their enormous task because they \n     understood the important distinction between command and \n     effective leadership. They taught us that command is about \n     authority, about an appointment to position--a set of orders \n     granting title. Effective leadership is different. It must be \n     learned and practiced in order for it to rise to the level of \n     art. It has to do with values internalized and the \n     willingness to sacrifice or subordinate all other concerns--\n     advancement, personal well-being, safety--for others. So \n     these men of iron invested tremendous time, energy, and \n     intellect in leader development--to ensure that those who are \n     privileged to be selected for command approach their duties \n     with a sense of reverence, trust, and the willingness to \n     sacrifice all, if necessary, for those they lead. You must \n     love those you lead before you can be an effective leader. \n     You can certainly command without that sense of commitment, \n     but you cannot lead without it; and without leadership, \n     command is a hollow experience--a vacuum often filled with \n     mistrust and arrogance.\n       Our mentors understood that mistrust and arrogance are \n     antithetical to inspired and inspiring leadership, breeding \n     discontent, fostering malcontents, and confusing intent \n     within the force. And so our mentors worked to reestablish \n     that most important of virtues in our army--trust--the \n     foundation upon which we have built our reputation as an \n     army. We owe them all a tremendous debt of gratitude for the \n     magnificent Army we have today, and the legacy of trust and \n     honor they sustained.\n       This week, we celebrate the Army's 228th birthday--228 \n     years. The Army's long history is, in so many ways, also the \n     history of our nation, a history including 10 wars and all \n     the years of restless peace in between. In those years, \n     soldiers have been both servant and savior to the nation. \n     Today, our nation is once again at war. The current war \n     brings me full circle to where I began my journey as a \n     soldier--the lessons I learned in Vietnam are always with me. \n     They involve changes in the way many of my generation learned \n     to train, to lead, to fight, and to always offer our best \n     military judgment to our superiors. These were hard-learned \n     lessons. Lessons about loyalty, about taking care of the \n     people who sacrifice the most for the good of the nation, \n     about uncompromising readiness that is achieved only through \n     tough, realistic training, about the necessity for inspired \n     and inspiring leadership, about the agility and versatility \n     demanded by a dynamic, strategic environment, and most \n     importantly that the Army must do two things well each and \n     every day--train soldiers and\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\n     grow them into leaders, leaders who can unequivocally and \n     without hesitation answer the critical question asked of any \n     war fighter. ``Can you fight? Can you fight?''\n       That question and those lessons are enduring ones for the \n     profession of arms. Four years ago, with these lessons in \n     mind, with the results of our comprehensive Army transition \n     assessment in hand, and with our eyes always on the dynamic \n     strategic environment, we decided to undertake fundamental \n     and comprehensive change. Those initiatives informed the Army \n     vision, a vision that consists of three imperatives. People. \n     Readiness. Transformation.\n       Secretary Brownlee, thank you for so well capturing the \n     Army's progress toward achieving that vision, a result of \n     hard work by so many people. I'll only reinforce that \n     transformation has never been about just one thing--the \n     future combat system or the objective force--and the Army \n     vision has never been about one person. The Army vision and \n     transformation are about comprehensive change at the very \n     heart of our institution, of our culture: doctrine, \n     organization, training, leader development, materiel, and \n     soldiers. This is the message we have consistently reiterated \n     to all who are listening.\n       In these last months, the performance of soldiers and Army \n     families has spoken loudly, clearly, and eloquently--since 11 \n     September, we have been enormously successful operationally. \n     In Afghanistan, as members of a combined, joint team, \n     soldiers banished the Taliban and Al Qaeda in weeks. In Iraq, \n     they fought with speed and agility to As-Samawah, An-Najaf, \n     Al-Hillah, Karbala, and Baghdad, unseating a dictator, \n     freeing an oppressed people, defeating a persistent enemy \n     in spite of the harsh, unforgiving environment. Our \n     soldiers demonstrated unprecedented agility and \n     flexibility: JSOTF West--special operators fighting with \n     armor and conventional artillery, JSOTF North--the 173rd \n     ABN BDE--1,000 paratroopers make a night jump and fight \n     alongside TF 1-63 Armor--1st ID, and TF 2-14 INF and a \n     field artillery battery from the 10th Mountain; the 82nd \n     ABN DIV Task organized with 2nd ACR(-), TF 1-41 (MECH) \n     from Fort Riley, and a brigade of the 101st Air Assault \n     Division; the 101st(-) fighting with TF 2-70 Armor of the \n     1st AD. With the greatest of agility, versatility, and \n     courage, they fought to victory, demonstrating once again \n     that all our magnificent moments as an Army are delivered \n     by our people. They won the fights, and they are now \n     facing and overcoming tremendous challenges to ensure the \n     Afghan and Iraqi people have the opportunity to rebuild \n     their societies and create governments characterized by \n     democracy, prosperity, peace, and hope rather than \n     barbarity, instability, and pervasive fear. Just as \n     impressively, soldiers have simultaneously allowed our \n     nation to fulfill commitments in other important regions--\n     the Sinai, the Balkans, the Philippines, and Korea to name \n     but a few. And had the situation in Korea gone hot, we'd \n     have been there, too. With deeds, not words, they have \n     unequivocally answered the question, ``Can you fight?'' \n     They do not flinch. They do not waiver. Our Army fights \n     and wins.\n       Those successes are enabled by our great young leaders--\n     noncommissioned officers, lieutenants and captains, battalion \n     and brigade commanders--who understand both what a privilege \n     it is to lead soldiers, and the tremendous responsibility \n     that accompanies that privilege. They love their units and \n     the soldiers who fill them--that is the essence of \n     leadership.\n       Leadership is essential in any profession, but effective \n     leadership is paramount in the profession of arms--for those \n     who wear the uniform and those who do not. We, in the Army, \n     have been blessed with tremendous civilian leadership, most \n     notably in the service of Secretary Tom White, who we \n     farewelled last month. We understand that leadership is not \n     an exclusive function of uniformed service. So when some \n     suggest that we, in the Army, don't understand the importance \n     of civilian control of the military, well, that's just not \n     helpful. And it isn't true. The Army has always understood \n     the primacy of civilian control. We reinforce that principle \n     to those with whom we train all around the world. So to muddy \n     the waters when important issues are at stake, issues of life \n     and death, is a disservice to all of those in and out of \n     uniform who serve and lead so well.\n       Our Army's soldiers and leaders have earned our country's \n     highest admiration and our citizens' broad support. But even \n     as we congratulate our soldiers when we welcome them home \n     from battle, we must beware of the tendency some may have to \n     draw the wrong conclusions, the wrong lessons from recent \n     operations, remembering all the while that no lesson is \n     learned until it changes behavior. We must always maintain \n     our focus on readiness. We must ensure that the Army has the \n     capabilities to match the strategic environment in which we \n     operate, a force sized correctly to meet the strategy set \n     forth in the documents that guide us--our national security \n     and national military strategies. Beware the 12-division \n     strategy for a 10-division army. Our soldiers and families \n     bear the risk and the hardship of carrying a mission load \n     that exceeds what force capabilities we can sustain, so we \n     must alleviate risk and hardship by our willingness to \n     resource the mission requirement. And we must remember that \n     decisive victory often has less to do with the plan than it \n     does with years invested in the training of soldiers and the \n     growing of leaders. Our nation has seen war too many times to \n     believe that victory on the battlefield is due primarily to \n     the brilliance of a plan--as opposed to leadership, tactical \n     and technical proficiency, sheer grit and determination of \n     the men and women who do the fighting and the bleeding.\n       Throughout my career, it has been an honor to serve with \n     leaders who understand and are committed to uphold those \n     obligations and duties to soldiers. Today, we find that kind \n     of dedicated and caring leadership at every level in our \n     Army. We are an institution that lives our values. Loyalty. \n     Duty. Respect. Selfless service. Honor. Integrity. Personal \n     courage. Army values--the bedrock on which our institution is \n     built.\n       Those values are demonstrated outside our ranks as well as \n     within, shared by Army families, as well as soldiers. In \n     these last months, at the toughest times of greatest sadness \n     and hardship, I have again and again been reminded that Army \n     families and spouses are the most generous people I know.\n       As I was on the first day of my tenure four years ago, I am \n     humbled to stand here on my last day as the 34th Chief of \n     Staff of the United States Army. I thank the President for \n     his confidence and trust in allowing me the opportunity to \n     serve the nation, and this Army that has been my family for \n     38 years. To soldiers past and present with whom I have \n     served, you have my deep and abiding respect and my profound \n     thanks.\n       There is a magnificent Army out there--full of pride, \n     discipline, spirit, values, commitment, and passion. General \n     Creighton Abrams reminded us that ``soldiering is an affair \n     of the heart,'' and it's never been better to be a soldier. \n     We are a magnificent Army, and the nation knows it, and \n     honors our profession. Soldiers represent what's best about \n     our Army and our nation. Noble by sacrifice, magnificent by \n     performance, and respected by all, they make us better than \n     we ever expected to be. And for 38 years now, soldiers have \n     never allowed me to have a bad day.\n       My name is Shinseki, and I'm a soldier. God bless all of \n     you and your families. God bless our soldiers and our \n     magnificent Army, and God bless our great nation. Thank you, \n     and goodbye.\n                                  ____\n\n\nSpeech by the Honorable Les Brownlee, Acting Secretary of the Army, at \nthe Retirement Ceremony for General Eric K. Shinseki at Fort Myer, VA, \n                            on June 11, 2003\n\n       Welcome everyone, and thanks for joining the Army family \n     for this special retirement ceremony in which we are honoring \n     a great American soldier, General Ric Shinseki, and his wife, \n     Patty.\n       Secretary and Mrs. Mineta, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, \n     Senator Reed, Senator Cleland, Congressman Skelton, \n     Congressman Lewis, Congressman Faleomavaega, Congressman Gene \n     Taylor, Congressman Abercrombie, Congressman Charles Taylor, \n     Congressman Frelinghuysen, and Congressman Reyes.\n       Secretary Gordon England, General Alexander Haig, former \n     Secretary of the Army Togo West, General and Mrs. Barry \n     McCaffrey, Secretary of the Air Force and Mrs. Roche, Jim and \n     Diane, former Secretary of the Army and Mrs. White, Tom and \n     Susan.\n       The members of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, beginning with \n     our Chairman, General Dick Meyers, and his wife, Mary Jo; the \n     wife of our Vice Chairman, Mrs. Lynne Pace; Chief of Naval \n     Operations, Admiral Vern Clark, and Mrs. Clark; Commandant of \n     the Marine Corps, General Mike Hagee, and Mrs. Hagee; the \n     Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Thomas Collins, and \n     Mrs. Collins; our distinguished former Chiefs of Staff, \n     General Vuono, General Sullivan, and General Reimer; the Vice \n     Chief of Staff, General Jack Keane, and his wife Terry.\n       Our distinguished counterpart Chiefs of Staff from Canada, \n     Germany, Croatia, Poland, and Russia. And our great Sergeant \n     Major of the Army, the master of the one-armed pushup, Jack \n     Tilley, and his wife, Gloria.\n       Senior Army leaders from the Secretariat and the Army \n     Staff, our civilian aides to the Secretary of the Army, other \n     distinguished general officers. Three generations of the \n     Shinseki family. Soldiers, family members, and friends of the \n     Army.\n       Welcome.\n       To Colonel Laufenberg and the Old Guard, and to Colonel \n     Lamb and the Army Band, ``Pershing's Own,'' you are \n     tremendous representatives of all of our soldiers defending \n     freedom around the globe.\n       Thank you for your professionalism, and your willingness to \n     serve your country. Let's give them a round of applause.\n       It has been my distinct privilege to serve with and around \n     Ric Shinseki for the last four decades--from the jungles of \n     Vietnam, through the Cold War, on Capitol Hill, and more \n     recently, in the halls of the Pentagon.\n       In all of those environments, he has epitomized the quiet \n     professional. And, being the genuinely humble and modest man \n     that he is, Ric Shinseki will never take personal credit for \n     the enormous impact that he has had on our Army.\n       In organizing these comments for today, I thought back to \n     remarks General Shinseki made in July 2000 at the Hall of \n     Heroes induction ceremony for 22 Medal of Honor recipients of \n     Asian and Pacific Island heritage. He said then:\n       ``Whenever I attend a function of one of these units . . . \n     I am always struck by this\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n     same kind of reticence, this unwillingness ever to bring \n     attention upon oneself. In fact, it usually takes a friend to \n     tell the story of another friend, which is why sometimes even \n     family members of those veterans have never heard those \n     stories. They are unaware of the fact that someone they've \n     known only as a father or husband or uncle or a brother is, \n     to many others, a hero of magnificent proportions.''\n       Well, I think he has summed up how all of us feel about Ric \n     Shinseki. He is that quiet warrior, reluctant to speak for \n     himself, always deflecting the spotlight to those around him \n     and, most importantly, to the soldiers he has served so well \n     and so faithfully.\n       General Shinseki has always said that the Army vision \n     cannot be linked to one man, that it must be embraced by the \n     entire Army.\n       But on this day of his retirement after 38 years of \n     faithful and honorable service, it is fitting that we \n     recognize his personal contributions to our nation and our \n     Army.\n       Ric Shinseki saw a need to transform the Army and he had \n     the courage, perseverance and intelligence to make it happen.\n       When war came, as he knew and predicted it would, he \n     ensured that our great soldiers could fight--and that they \n     had what they needed to guarantee victory for our nation.\n       Simply stated, the Chief looked to the future, and \n     conceived a vision for what our Army must be able to do to \n     protect our nation in the 21st century.\n       He translated that vision into an ambitious, yet doable, \n     plan of action--revolving around people, readiness, and \n     transformation.\n       He went out and got the resources and implemented his plan \n     with tremendous intellect, courage, and sheer force of will, \n     irrevocably changing our Army for the better.\n       All of this took tremendous courage on the Chief's part, at \n     a time when the word ``transformation'' was relatively \n     unknown.\n       There are some leaders who might have been able to \n     accomplish one or maybe two of the above, but I know of no \n     one else who could have accomplished it all.\n       While his strategic leadership skills were essential to the \n     Army's successes, equally important have been the Chief's \n     strength of character and love of our soldiers.\n       Many of you already know the story of the formative years \n     of General Ric Shinseki's life.\n       He was born during World War II, when many Americans of \n     Japanese ancestry were interned and labeled ``enemy aliens,'' \n     even as their young men etched a legacy of heroism that \n     remains unrivaled in the annuals of our Army's history.\n       He grew up among these heroes, indeed was appointed to West \n     Point by one of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team's Medal of \n     Honor recipients, Senator Daniel Inouye, who we are honored \n     to have with us here today.\n       After graduation from the academy in 1965, Ric served twice \n     in Vietnam, both times seriously wounded. His second wound \n     was so severe, and his recovery so difficult, that the \n     doctors wanted to put him out of the military.\n       He could have easily accepted the honor and accolades \n     justly due a wounded warrior forced from service before his \n     time, but he did not.\n       His love of soldiers--soldiers who had carried him out of \n     combat on their backs--twice--and his love of our Army--was \n     so deep that he persevered.\n       The iron will and depth of character that the Chief \n     developed through the long, painful months of recovery \n     steeled an already proven warrior. His willingness to fight \n     on behalf of the Army has had as much to do with our \n     Army's accomplishments as his skills as a strategic \n     leader.\n       As we all know, transformation has grabbed many headlines, \n     but the Chief's contributions to the warfighting readiness of \n     the entire Army set the conditions for the successes our \n     soldiers have delivered in Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere \n     around the globe.\n       As he said in 1999, he didn't know when or where it would \n     occur, but he knew the Army would fight during his tenure as \n     the Chief. This motivated his focus on preparing for that \n     moment. Nothing escaped his scrutiny, from filling combat \n     units to 100-percent ensuring we had sufficient spare tank \n     engines. The victories in Kabul and Baghdad were accomplished \n     by our soldiers, but those soldiers were supported by an \n     institution that had been keenly focused by the Chief on \n     preparing them for battle. And one thing is certain: No army \n     in history was equal to the Army that this Chief of Staff \n     prepared for battle in Iraq. No Army was ever better \n     equipped, trained, or motivated. All of us are proud of that \n     Army, and about what they accomplished, and continue to \n     accomplish today.\n       But, Ric, you will always enjoy a special pride--because \n     this was truly your Army--molded and sculpted as a reflection \n     of your leadership and your character.\n       As an Army, we also owe an enormous debt of gratitude to \n     Patty Shinseki, who epitomizes all that is good and wonderful \n     about Army spouses. Her genuine concern for others, her \n     energy, and her grace under fire are remarkable.\n       She has known the fear of a wife whose husband goes to \n     combat and returns wounded--twice.\n       She has moved over 30 times in 38 years, raised a wonderful \n     family in the process, and has served as the senior \n     leadership's greatest ambassador to Army families and so many \n     other constituencies.\n       Patty and Ric Shinseki are a remarkable team. When Ric set \n     his sights on improving the well-being of our Army, Patty \n     turned a laser-like focus on these issues. The result was: \n     spouse orientation and leadership programs, Army Family Team \n     Building, and the Army Spouse Employment Summit, to name but \n     a few.\n       In an Army in which over half of our soldiers are married, \n     these measures enable us to retain soldiers and their \n     families despite the many sacrifices they make on behalf of \n     the nation.\n       Patty, thank you so much for all you have done for our \n     soldiers, their families, for our communities, and the Army. \n     We will deeply miss you.\n       Once again, I'd like to paraphrase from General Shinseki's \n     own words: ``It has been said, `Poor is the nation that has \n     no heroes, but beggared is the nation that has and forgets \n     them.' The man we honor today answered his nation's call to \n     duty, and in doing so, honored his heritage and his \n     country.''\n       In short, he is a soldier.\n       Ric, thank you for a lifetime of service and sacrifice, for \n     your vision, your courage, your steadfastness, and for all \n     you have done for our soldiers who are the Army. We will be \n     forever in your debt.\n       May God always bless you and Patty and your family, our \n     magnificent soldiers, our Army and this great nation. Thank \n     you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8122-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        FOSTER'S DAILY DEMOCRAT\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today on the 130th \nanniversary of the first printing of New Hampshire's Foster's Daily \nDemocrat to highlight the outstanding contribution that this family-\nowned newspaper has made to residents of the Granite State.\n  On June 18, 1873, Joshua L. Foster printed the paper's premiere \nedition in Dover, NH, using the motto: ``We shall devote these columns \nmainly to the material and vital interests of Dover and vicinity. \nWhatever may tend to benefit this people and enhance their prosperity, \nwill receive our warm and enthusiastic support.''\n  Since that day, the paper's pages have remained under direct \nownership of the Foster family, whose members have diligently guided it \nto today's milestone in publishing history.\n  Today, under the direction of Robert and Therese Foster, the paper's \nmotto holds true, its staff continuing to bring readers--more than \n30,000 per day--the most accurate and detailed local news, sports, and \ncommentary.\n  Such an effort takes teamwork, which has existed through more than a \ncentury of local news production. Readers have known they could turn to \nthe columns of this paper for the information they wanted, whether it \nbe a birth announcement, a wedding notice, a school board vote, the \nLittle League team photo, or the school bus route.\n  And, always an organization to stay ahead of the curve, Foster's has \nmoved its pages online, taking the time to provide some of the most up-\nto-date news and information available in New Hampshire.\n  I have no doubt that Foster's will continue to demonstrate the \npositive results of working hard every day toward a common goal. It is \na New Hampshire tradition, and one that deserves our recognition \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8122-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8122-S8123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. RALPH NURNBERGER\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am honored today to pay tribute \nto a truly remarkable American, Dr. Ralph Nurnberger. As some of my \ncolleagues may already know, Dr. Nurnberger was recently presented with \nthe 2003 Excellence in Teaching Faculty Award from Georgetown \nUniversity. I can think of no one more deserving of this award than \nRalph Nurnberger. I have known Ralph for many years and I have long \nadmired his dedication to Georgetown's students and his fellow faculty \nmembers. Anyone who has the privilege of knowing this fine man will \nagree that Georgetown University continues to be held in such high \nesteem because of professors like Ralph Nurnberger. He is a good friend \nand I extend my most sincere congratulations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the citation honoring Dr. \nNurnberger be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Excellence in Teaching Faculty Award, Georgetown University, May 17, \n                                  2003\n\n       In 1977, just three years after the Liberal Studies Program \n     started and two years after\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\n     receiving his Ph.D. in Diplomatic History at Georgetown \n     University, Ralph Nurnberger began teaching in the Liberal \n     Studies Degree Program. Over more than two decades he has \n     taught courses in the Liberal Studies Program that focused on \n     American foreign relations, the American national character \n     and international relations, ideals and American foreign \n     policy, Congressional relations and American foreign policy. \n     Most recently he has been teaching a course on the aftermath \n     of 9/11, considering the domestic and international aftermath \n     for the United States.\n       Dr. Nurnberger's teaching has been accomplished with \n     extensive experience in the field of domestic and \n     international affairs and their interaction. His Capitol Hill \n     experience included serving as foreign policy legislative \n     assistant to Senator James Person (R-Kansas) and as a \n     professional staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee. He has been a senior Fellow and director of \n     Congressional Relations for the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies (CSIS). He spent over eight years as a \n     lobbyist for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee \n     (AIPAC). In the wake of the Rabin-Arafat signing of the Oslo \n     Accords he was appointed the Executive Director of an \n     organization, ``Builders for Peace,'' set up with the \n     guidance of then Vice-President Al Gore to help the Arab-\n     Israeli peace process. His current position is that of \n     Counsel with Preston Gates Ellis and Rouvelas Meeds law and \n     lobbying firm and he also heads a government relations firm, \n     Nurnberger and Associates, While teaching and filling these \n     positions he has published extensively in major newspapers \n     and journals. His most recent book deals with lobbying in \n     America; his others have dealt with foreign policy and the \n     political process.\n       Student evaluations applaud the examples and insights he \n     can offer from real life experiences which are tempered and \n     refined by his intellectual understanding and historical \n     perspective. Students are particularly impressed with Dr. \n     Nurnberger's ability to decipher complicated and contentious \n     issues and make them understandable. His courses are engaging \n     and insightful. In addition, students value the skillful \n     balance he offers on these subjects, which in turn leads to \n     thoughtful conversation and debate in class. He has become an \n     example for the students in how to conduct civil discourse \n     regardless of the intensity of emotion generated by a subject \n     or the individual's own principles and convictions.\n       Over the years Ralph Nurnberger has patiently and \n     meticulously directed numerous student theses, often against \n     great odds but with sincere concern and unforgiving academic \n     precision. When extraordinary demands were made on his time \n     and attention his steady, generous commitment to the \n     student's project made successful completion possible.\n       Today, we honor Ralph Nurnberger for his academic \n     excellence which he transmits to and requires from his \n     students; for his intellectual integrity whatever the issue; \n     for his generous guidance of students' research; for his \n     loyalty and enthusiasm for teaching Liberal Studies students \n     these many years; for his ability to make sense of a so often \n     chaotic world and America's role in that world. We are please \n     to present him with the Excellence in Teaching Faculty Award \n     for the year 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8123-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FATHER WILLIAM SHERMAN\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, for almost a half century a \nCatholic priest in North Dakota has lived a remarkable double life. In \none guise, Father Bill Sherman is a holy man, the kind of warm and \nperfect parish priest who would have once been played by Spencer Tracy. \nBut in his other role, he is the talented scholar and painstakingly \ndiligent chronicler who, like no other authority, commands the ethnic \nhistory of North Dakota.\n  Because Father Sherman is retiring this month from the religious \nvineyards, I want to take note of his remarkable alter ego--that of the \nState's most eminent ethnic historian.\n  He has been a key player over the last 20 years in producing four \nimpressive volumes on the subject--``Plain Folks: North Dakota's Ethnic \nHistory,'' ``Prairie Mosaic: An Ethnic Atlas of Rural North Dakota,'' \n``African Americans in North Dakota,'' and the most recent book, \n``Prairie Peddlers: Syrian-Lebanese in North Dakota,'' which is now \ncoming off the presses. In addition, he was also one of the authors of \n``Scattered Steeples, The Fargo Diocese, A Written Celebration of Its \nCentennial.''\n  His volumes on the State's ethnic heritage are extraordinary works--\npainstakingly researched, rich with thoughtful analysis, brightly \nwritten, and handsomely designed. They are works of careful scholarship \nof a high order and a real treasure for anyone intrigued with the \nmarvelous ethnic diversity of America.\n  Born in Detroit in 1927, Father Sherman grew up in North Carolina and \nOregon before his family moved to Lidgerwood, ND. After high school, he \njoined the Army, serving in the Philippines and Japan at the end of \nWorld War II. He graduated from St. John's University in Collegeville, \nMN, got a bachelor's degree from North Dakota State University and a \nmaster's degree from the University of North Dakota and became a priest \nin 1955.\n  He has served the parishes of the Cathedral of St. Mary in Fargo from \n1955 to 1962, the Newman Center at the University of North Dakota from \n1962 to 1964, St. Raphael's in Verona from 1964 to 1965, the Newman \nCenter at NDSU from 1965 to 1975, St. Patrick's in Enderlin from 1975 \nto 1976 and finally the diocese's largest parish, the 5,000-member \nstrong St. Michael's of Grand Forks for 27 years.\n  At UND, he taught religion and, at NDSU, where he is now professor \nemeritus, he taught sociology of religion and sociology of the Great \nPlains. He has received numerous awards, most recently an honorary \ndoctorate of leadership degree from the University of Maryland.\n  In a profile of Father Sherman this month, the Grand Forks Herald \nsaid, ``Sherman's style, of being a sometimes gruff, no-nonsense \ndefender of old-fashioned, blue-collar Catholicism, while being genial \ngood company to anyone, and wearing his academic accomplishments \nlightly, attracted many to the parish. It's difficult, if not \nimpossible, to find a discouraging word said about Sherman, a fairly \nremarkable fact about any member of the clergy who stays in one spot a \nlong time.''\n  And a few days later, the editor of the newspaper called Father \nSherman ``a remarkable man--a priest first and foremost, a man of old-\nfashioned faith, but also a scholar, a witty conversationalist, a \npolished orator, an able administrator, a distinguished patriot, a \ncommunity builder, a cool head in a crisis, a giver and an excellent \nfriend to many thousands of people both within and outside his \nchurch.''\n  Father Sherman is also a survivor. During the disastrous Red River \nflood of 1997, one of the worst to ever strike an American community, \nhis parish was completed flooded and his church, school and rectory \nsuffered heavy damage. Among the most painful losses was Father \nSherman's collection of North Dakota history, a singular treasury of \nvolumes on the State's heritage. But the indomitable cleric is now busy \nrebuilding that library and at work writing several more books, one on \nthe transfer of Eastern European architecture to the Great Plains at \nthe time of settlement and a second on another remarkable North Dakota \npriest who served during World War II with the Polish resistance.\n  It is clear that retirement to Father Sherman means something \ndifferent than it does to the rest of us. Not only will he still \nminister on a part-time basis to Roman Catholics, but he will continue \nto energetically research and write about intriguing aspects of North \nDakota's ethic legacy.\n  Although he has already provided a valuable and outstanding body of \nwork on ethnic heritage, North Dakotans are grateful for his continued \ninterest in the field. He is a scholar of the first order, a priest of \nthe classic and finest model, and an exemplary citizen indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8123-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8123-S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING DONOVAN RILEY CLARKSON\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I have the privilege and honor \nof rising today to recognize Mr. Donovan Riley Clarkson of Paducah, KY. \nDonovan was recently recognized for his accomplishments in dance.\n  This 10-year-old gentleman copes daily with the effects of central \nauditory processing disorder. In a person who suffers from this \ndisorder, information is not correctly processed from the ear to the \nbrain. This makes daily activities, from hearing conversations to hand-\neye coordination, difficult to complete. Nevertheless, Donovan has not \nallowed this disorder to interfere with his dreams and accomplishments.\n  Donovan performs with a dance troupe at the Beverly Rogers Dance \nAcademy. His family enrolled him in dance four years ago after a \nmedical professional suggested that the movement could help his \ncondition. Everyday after school, Donovan practices the assigned dance \nroutine. He must practice twice as hard as his teammates in\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\norder to execute these moves. This dedication paid off; he earned a \nspot on a local dance troupe. In fact, Donovan is the youngest member \nof this group. His big smile and smooth dance moves helped the group \nplace first in many regional competitions and earn an almost perfect \nscore, securing the troupe a spot in the national Odyssey Dance \nCompetition held in Lakeside, FL.\n  Currently, Donovan attends the fourth grade at Reidland Elementary \nSchool in Paducah. His favorite subject is reading, which other \nindividuals with his condition find difficult. In his free time, \nDonovan enjoys constructing toy models and Lego figures. However, \nspending time with his brother and sister is always on the top of his \nlist.\n  What sets Donovan apart from other children is not his disorder or \nhis remarkable dance skills, but his determination. He has overcome \nevery single obstacle placed before him, making his life a testament to \nhard work. Please join me in congratulating Mr. Donovan Riley Clarkson \nand wishing him the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8124-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8124-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/18/senate-section/article/S8124-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the House of \nRepresentatives to the bill (S. 342) to amend the Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act to make improvements to and reauthorize \nprograms under that Act, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 to provide standards and procedures to guide \nboth State and local law enforcement agencies and law enforcement \nofficers during internal investigations, interrogation of law \nenforcement officers, and administrative disciplinary hearings, to \nensure accountability of law enforcement officers, to guarantee the due \nprocess rights of law enforcement discipline, accountability, and due \nprocess laws; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Law Enforcement \nDiscipline, Accountability, and Due Process Act of 2003, along with the \nChairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Corrections and \nVictims' Rights Senator Graham, Senator McConnell and Senator Bunning.\n  These are trying times for the men and women on our front lines \nproviding domestic security, our Nation's law enforcement personnel. \nState and local fiscal problems are forcing many communities to cut \ntheir police budgets. Each change in the Nation's homeland security \nalert level results in increased overtime and other costs for local law \nenforcement. Just yesterday, the FBI reported that the number of \nmurders and rapes was up across the country in 2002. And this \nAdministration is determined to dramatically scale back Federal crime-\nfighting initiatives like the COPS program, a proven initiative that \nhas been hailed as one of the keys to the crime-drop of the nineties.\n  At the same time, the men and women of law enforcement work in \nextremely dangerous environments. An average of 165 police officers are \nkilled in the line of duty every year. And at times, internal police \ninvestigations and administrative hearings do not provide officers with \nbasic protections. According to the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, ``[i]n roughly half of the states in this country, \nofficers enjoy some legal protections against false accusations and \nabusive conduct, but hundreds of thousands of officers have very \nlimited due process rights and confront limitations on their exercise \nof other rights, such as the right to engage in political activities.'' \nThe Fraternal Order of Police notes that, ``[i]n a startling number of \njurisdictions throughout this country, law enforcement officers have no \nprocedural or administrative protections whatsoever; in fact, they can \nbe, and frequently are, summarily dismissed from their jobs without \nexplanation. Officers who lose their careers due to administrative or \npolitical expediency almost always find it impossible to find new \nemployment in public safety. An officer's reputation, once tarnished by \naccusation, is almost impossible to restore.''\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\n  This legislation we introduce today seeks to provide officers with \ncertain basic protections in those jurisdictions where such workplace \nprotections are not currently provided. This bill allows law \nenforcement officials to engage in political activities. It provides \nstandards and procedures to guide State and local law enforcement \nagencies during internal investigations, interrogations, and \nadministrative disciplinary hearings of law enforcement officers, and \nit calls upon States to develop and enforce these disciplinary \nprocedures. The bill would preempt State laws which confer fewer rights \nthan those provided for in the legislation, but it would not preempt \nany State or local laws that confer rights or protections that are \nequal to or exceed the rights and protections afforded in the bill. My \nown State of Delaware has its own law enforcement officers' bill of \nrights, and as such Delaware would not be impacted by the provisions of \nthis bill. I am pleased that the bill has earned the endorsement of the \nFraternal Order of Police and of the National Association of Police \nOrganizations.\n  Beyond benefiting those on the front lines of local law enforcement, \nthis bill would enhance the ability of our citizens to hold their local \npolice accountable if they do transgress while on the job. The \nlegislation includes provisions that will ensure citizen complaints \nagainst police officers are investigated, and that citizens are \ninformed of the outcome of these investigations. The bill balances the \nrights of police officers with the rights of citizens to raise valid \nconcerns about the conduct of some of these officers. In addition, I \nhave consulted with constitutional experts who have opined that the \nbill is consistent with Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause and \nthat it does not run afoul of the Supreme Court's Tenth Amendment \njurisprudence.\n  While I believe that the bill we introduce today takes the right \napproach, I want to note the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice's opposition to this measure. In April of this year I met with \nRichmond, California Chief of Police Joseph Samuels, the president of \nthe IACP. Chief Samuels and I acknowledged that we disagreed on this \nbill, but I pledged to him that their concerns would be heard and taken \ninto consideration as the bill we introduce today is debated in \nCongress. It is my view that without a meeting of the minds between \npolice management and union officials on this issue, enactment of a \nmeaningful law enforcement officers' bill of rights will be difficult. \nIt is my hope that the newly-constituted Subcommittee on Crime, \nCorrections and Victims' Rights, on which I serve as ranking member, \nwill hold a hearing on this measure. That subcommittee is the proper \nforum in which to debate the merits of our approach to guaranteeing \nbasic procedural safeguards to the men and women of law enforcement.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Graham, McConnell, Bunning and \nme in providing all of the Nation's law enforcement officers with the \nbasic rights they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the Bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1277\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State and Local Law \n     Enforcement Discipline, Accountability, and Due Process Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the rights of law enforcement officers to engage in \n     political activity or to refrain from engaging in political \n     activity, except when on duty, or to run as candidates for \n     public office, unless such service is found to be in conflict \n     with their service as officers, are activities protected by \n     the first amendment of the United States Constitution, as \n     applied to the States through the 14th amendment of the \n     United States Constitution, but these rights are often \n     violated by the management of State and local law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       (2) a significant lack of due process rights of law \n     enforcement officers during internal investigations and \n     disciplinary proceedings has resulted in a loss of confidence \n     in these processes by many law enforcement officers, \n     including those unfairly targeted for their labor \n     organization activities or for their aggressive enforcement \n     of the laws, demoralizing many rank and file officers in \n     communities and States;\n       (3) unfair treatment of officers has potentially serious \n     long-term consequences for law enforcement by potentially \n     deterring or otherwise preventing officers from carrying out \n     their duties and responsibilities effectively and fairly;\n       (4) the lack of labor-management cooperation in \n     disciplinary matters and either the perception or the \n     actuality that officers are not treated fairly detrimentally \n     impacts the recruitment of and retention of effective \n     officers, as potential officers and experienced officers seek \n     other careers which has serious implications and \n     repercussions for officer morale, public safety, and labor-\n     management relations and strife and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce, interfering with the normal flow of \n     commerce;\n       (5) there are serious implications for the public safety of \n     the citizens and residents of the United States which \n     threatens the domestic tranquility of the United States \n     because of a lack of statutory protections to ensure--\n       (i) the due process and political rights of law enforcement \n     officers;\n       (ii) fair and thorough internal investigations and \n     interrogations of and disciplinary proceedings against law \n     enforcement officers; and\n       (iii) effective procedures for receipt, review, and \n     investigation of complaints against officers, fair to both \n     officers and complainants; and\n       (6) resolving these disputes and problems and preventing \n     the disruption of vital police services is essential to the \n     well-being of the United States and the domestic tranquility \n     of the Nation.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that it is \n     the purpose of this Act and the policy of the United States \n     to--\n       (1) protect the due process and political rights of State \n     and local law enforcement officers and ensure equality and \n     fairness of treatment among such officers;\n       (2) provide continued police protection to the general \n     public;\n       (3) provide for the general welfare and ensure domestic \n     tranquility; and\n       (4) prevent any impediments to the free flow of commerce, \n     under the rights guaranteed under the United States \n     Constitution and Congress' authority thereunder.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 38, United Stated Code, to presume \nadditional diseases of former prisoners of war to be service-connected \nfor compensation purposes, to enhance the Dose Reconstruction Program \nof the Department of Defense, to enhance and fund certain other \nepidemiological studies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, today I introduce legislation \nthat would take one more step toward finding answers for veterans who \nmay have been exposed to radiation, Agent Orange, or other hazards \nduring their military service.\n  The last century saw the nature of war change forever. When mustard \ngas drifted across the trenches of World War I, troops learned that \ndangers less tangible, but no less deadly, than bullets might fill the \nair. Since then, many veterans have questioned whether health effects \nof the environmental hazards that they faced on and off the battlefield \nmight appear years or even decades later.\n  Congress, VA, the military, and scores of independent researchers \nhave struggled to answer those questions. Many veterans still wait for \nscientific evidence to fill the gaps. However, research in some areas \nhas linked specific exposures to a risk of later disease, and we must \nrespond to those new findings and encourage further investigation.\n  Peer-reviewed studies published in recent years suggest that veterans \nheld prisoner during World War II, the Korean War, and in Vietnam \nsuffer from some chronic diseases at a higher rate than expected. \nScientists now report that the toll taken by malnutrition, long periods \nof forced confinement, and untreated infections appears to pose a \nlifelong risk. Based on these findings, I have introduced legislation \nthat would add heart disease, strokes, and chronic liver diseases to \nthe list of diseases that can be presumptively connected to service for \ncertain former prisoners of war. This would allow eligible veterans \nwith these conditions to seek VA benefits without having to prove that \ntheir illnesses resulted from deprivations suffered during captivity.\n  Other veterans who were exposed to large doses of ionizing radiation \nin post-war Japan or during nuclear tests, and who suffer from \nillnesses thought to be caused by radiation, can currently claim \neligibility for VA benefits. However, some veterans who believe they \nreceived high doses of radiation have been frustrated to find that \ntheir military records do not reflect the same assumptions. Congress \nmandated nearly 20 years ago that veterans who suffer from diseases \nthat they suspect might be linked to radiation exposure during service \ncould request a dose reconstruction, or a scientific estimate of past \nexposure levels, to remedy this.\n  Many veterans felt that this method fell short of expectations, and \nCongress responded in 1998 by requiring an independent review of the \nDose Reconstruction Program conducted by the Department of Defense. A \npanel of experts convened by the National Academy of Sciences reported \nrecently that this contractor-operated program suffered from a \nshockingly cavalier approach to quality assurance, resulting in data \nthat failed to meet the standards assumed by VA and veterans. This is \nnot acceptable. Provisions introduced here would require the \nSecretaries of VA and Defense to establish permanent independent \noversight of the Dose Reconstruction Program, and to create an advisory \nboard to improve the program as necessary.\n  Our understanding of the consequences of exposure to the herbicides \nand dioxin in Agent Orange remains far from complete. It has been \nalmost 25 years since Congress required the Air Force to conduct an \nepidemiologic study of the veterans of Operation Ranch Hand, the unit \nresponsible for aerial spraying of herbicides during the Vietnam War. \nThe last scheduled round of physical examinations took place just last \nmonth, and the fate of the millions of medical records and specimens \nremains undecided. Experts agree that both samples and data should be \npreserved for further research, but do not share an opinion on the best \nway to do so. The bill that I have introduced would task the National \nAcademy of Sciences to develop research recommendations for extending \nthe Air Force Health Study, or for preserving the samples and making \nthem accessible to independent researchers as requested by many \nveterans' organizations.\n  Finally, the legislation that I have introduced would ensure that the \nscientific body charged with tracking veterans' and military health can \ncontinue its mission. The Medical Follow-Up Agency, MFUA, a board of \nthe Institute of Medicine--the health agency of the National Academy of \nSciences--was created at the end of World War II at the urging of the \nArmy Surgeon General. For many years, it received funding only \nsporadically. In 1988, the now-defunct Office of Technology Assessment \nreported that MFUA's critical contribution to understanding military \nhealth issues was limited by a lack of consistent funding, which caused \nhigh staff turnover, incohesiveness in the research portfolio, and \nfailure to maintain records.\n  Congress responded with Public Law 102-585, which required that VA \nand the military each contribute $250,000 in annual core funding to \nMFUA for 10 years. MFUA's staff uses this funding to update, maintain, \nand improve long-term epidemiological studies of military and veterans \npopulations. Congress, VA, the military, and independent scientists \nhave relied on these studies to evaluate whether specific exposures \nmight have long-term health effects that suggest a need for benefits, \nnew treatments, or further research. The legislation that I have \nintroduced would extend MFUA's core funding for 10 more years.\n  This legislation would demonstrate to those who serve their nation \nnow\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\nthat our commitment to them will not end with the wars that they fight. \nWe must continue to seek remedies for the sometimes invisible wounds of \nthe new battlefield, and ensure that those who have borne them receive \nthe support that they need. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join \nme in supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1281\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish national cemeteries for geographically underserved \npopulations of veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will ensure that America's veterans and their families \nhave access to the funeral honors they have earned. The brave men and \nwomen who fought for our Nation are a population that is aging rapidly. \nIn 2002, America\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\nlost 646,264 veterans. Projections show that this rate will continue to \nclimb through the year 2008, when the annual death of the World War II \nand Korea-era veterans will peak at 700,000.\n  By the end of 2004, only 64 of the 124 veterans national cemeteries \nwill be available for both casketed and cremated remains. As cemetery \nservice capabilities decrease, veterans in areas near those cemeteries \nthat are at capacity may lose access to burial options located within a \nreasonable distance of their homes. In order to ensure that burial \noptions are provided for veterans and their family members, we must \ndevelop new cemeteries and expand existing cemeteries. This process \nmust start as soon as possible because the construction of a new \ncemetery takes an average of 7 years.\n  That is why I offer this bill today, which would authorize the \nconstruction of ten new national cemeteries and ensure that the burial \nneeds of veterans and their family members will be met in the future.\n  In anticipation of veterans' future needs, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs conducted a study that identifies veteran population centers \nnot served by an open national or state veterans cemetery. The report, \n``Future Burial Needs,'' was initially released in May 2002 and has \nbeen recently revised using veteran population estimates from the 2000 \ncensus. My legislation would direct the Department of Veterans Affairs \nto establish ten new national veterans cemeteries in the top ten areas \nidentified to be in the greatest need. These areas would include \nSarasota, FL, Salem, OR, Birmingham, AL, St. Louis, MO, San Antonio, \nTX, Chesapeake, VA, Sumter, FL, Bakersfield, CA, Jacksonville, FL, and \nPhiladelphia, PA.\n  We can not afford to wait any longer if we are to fulfill this \ncommitment to our nation's veterans. Mr. President, I am proud to \nsponsor this important bill, and look forward to the support of my \ncolleagues as we provide for our veterans who have given so much for \nour country. Thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1281\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require advance notification of Congress regarding \nany action proposed to be taken by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in \nthe implementation of the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced \nServices initiative of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, is in the midst of determining how best to serve the \nmillions of veterans who turn to the VA health care system for their \ncare. This process--known as CARES or Capital Asset Realignment for \nEnhanced Services--will likely bring significant change to the VA \nsystem. Recommendations stemming from this process could lead to \nbillions of dollars in new facilities construction, on the one hand, \nand possible closure of facilities and thousands of beds, on the other. \nDespite the magnitude of these possible changes, Congress has virtually \nno formal role in the process.\n  I introduce legislation today that would allow for Congressional \nreview of the CARES recommendations that the Secretary of VA will begin \nto implement at the end of this year.\n  The CARES initiative has been ongoing since the Fall of 2002, tasking \nVA facilities with developing recommendations based on a review of \npopulation data; the conduct of market analyses of veterans' health \ncare needs; the identification of planning initiatives for each market \narea; and most important, the significant involvement of stakeholders, \nincluding myriad public meetings. These so-called planning initiatives \nare ultimately slated to be passed on to the Secretary, who will then \nmake the final decisions.\n  While an independent review led by a national CARES Commission is \nalready planned, in addition to public hearings--which I fully \nsupport--I must reiterate that Congress has little, if any, role in the \nCARES effort outside of construction authorization and appropriation \nactivities. Yet, all states and most health care facilities will be \naffected by the results. The legislation I introduce today would give \nCongress a 60-day period to review the CARES recommendations submitted \nby the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. During that time, VA would be \nprohibited from moving forward with any bed or facility closures.\n  This oversight is absolutely essential--particularly in light of \nrecent events. Just last month, all VA health care networks submitted \ntheir plans to VA headquarters. These plans were developed following \nsubstantial analysis and thorough stakeholder involvement. While \nabiding by the criteria and process set forth by VA, facilities made \ntheir recommendations to the Under Secretary for Health. In a surprise \nmove and an apparent manipulation of the process, VA instructed the \nnetwork directors to re-evaluate the plans they had already submitted \nfor 20 different VA facilities. They were told to ``evaluate a strategy \nto convert from a 24-hour operation to an 8 hour a day operation. This \nincludes any inpatient care, including long term care.''\n  One of these hospitals is in Lake City, in my home State of Florida. \nNetwork 8, which has responsibility for Lake City, had previously \nrecommended that no long-term care beds be deactivated at this \nfacility, yet they were told to go back to the drawing board to develop \na strategy to close nursing home beds there.\n  Another facility tasked with re-examining their plan is Bedford, \nMassachusetts. In their network's plan, submitted to the Under \nSecretary, officials stated that they had in fact considered \n``alternatives to consolidate Long Term Care, LTC, including the \nAlzheimer's and SCI Units, and Psychiatry inpatient beds from the \nBedford to Brockton facilities'' yet, ``as final projections are not \navailable for LTC inpatient beds and earlier projections indicated a \nsubstantial increase in LTC beds, it was determined to utilize current \ncapacities.'' Despite these assessments to the contrary, VA has asked\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\nthat they instead plan to convert these facilities to outpatient \noperations only.\n  Yet one more example of this apparent manipulation involves another \nfacility now slated for bed closures, the Leavenworth VA Medical Center \nin Kansas. The network plan concluded that ``[r]ealignment of workload \nfrom Leavenworth to Kansas City would exceed current capacity. . . . \nElimination of inpatient and outpatient primary care capabilities at \nLeavenworth would seriously undermine continuity of care for the \nremaining long-term care patients, reduce timely access to care, hinder \nits ability to provide ongoing support to the DoD facility located at \nFt. Leavenworth . . . '' . Again, analysis conducted at the regional \nlevel resulted in a recommendation that VA is now directing be \nreconsidered.\n  The VA facility in Knoxville, IA, is being targeted for significant \nchanges as well. The current proposal is to move all of the beds from \nKnoxville to Des Moines. The Knoxville facility has more than 226 long-\nterm care beds, 40 domiciliary beds, and 34 inpatient psychiatric beds. \nWe need to take a look at this proposal and the many others that will \naffect veterans all across the country.\n  Other facilities asked to re-evaluate are: Batavia, Lyons, St. \nAlbans, Montrose, Pittsburgh at Highland Drive, Augusta, Dublin, \nLexington, Brecksville, Gulfport, Marlin/Waco, Vancouver, Livermore, \nand Hot Springs.\n  While VA intends to present a five-year capital plan to Congress, \nthere is nothing that requires VA to inform Members about possible \nreductions, closures, and other decisions that would have a deleterious \neffect on VA health care services and our veterans. This is \nunacceptable. Congress' role should not be limited to merely funding \nthe implementation of these decisions; rather, we should be involved in \na process that could result in the significant loss of inpatient, long-\nterm care, and domiciliary capacity at VA health care facilities \nnationwide. We can rectify this problem very easily, however, by \nenacting the legislation I propose today.\n  In an internal VA memo, Secretary Principi stated that ``the CARES \nprocess may be one of the most important activities undertaken by VA \nthis decade. The outcome of this process will construct the foundation \nfor, and set the course of, our health care system for the first half \nof the 21st century.'' In light of the great impact of this initiative \non VA health care services, as well as recent actions that threaten the \nintegrity of the process, it is imperative that Congress be granted a \nmere 60 days to review VA's proposals. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin this effort to secure the future of health care for our nation's \nveterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1283\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF A DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS CAPITAL ASSET REALIGNMENT INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Advance Notification.--Before taking \n     any action proposed under the Capital Asset Realignment for \n     Enhanced Services initiative of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to \n     Congress a written notification of the intent to take such \n     action.\n       (b) Limitation.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may not \n     take any proposed action described in subsection (a) until \n     the later of--\n       (1) the expiration of the 60-day period beginning on the \n     date on which the Secretary submits to Congress the \n     notification of the proposed action required under subsection \n     (a); or\n       (2) the expiration of a period of 30 days of continuous \n     session of Congress beginning on such date of notification \n     or, if either House of Congress is not in session on such \n     date, the first day after such date that both Houses of \n     Congress are in session.\n       (c) Continuous Session of Congress.--For the purposes of \n     subsection (b)--\n       (1) the continuity of session of Congress is broken only by \n     an adjournment of Congress sine die; and\n       (2) the days on which either House is not in session \n     because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day \n     certain are excluded in the computation of any period of time \n     in which Congress is in continuous session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER:\n  S. 1285. A bill to reform the postal laws of the United States; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Postal \nAccountability and Enhancement Act of 2003, legislation that makes the \nreforms necessary for the Postal Service to thrive in the 21st Century \nand to better serve the American people.\n  The Postal Service has, for the most part, operated in the same \nmanner for more than thirty years. In the early 1970s, Senator Stevens \nand others led the effort in the Senate to create the Postal Service \nout of the failing Post Office Department. At the time, the Post Office \nDepartment received about 20 percent of its revenue from taxpayer \nsubsidies. The service it provided was suffering and there was little \nmoney available to expand. By all accounts, the product of Senator \nStevens' labors, the Postal Reorganization Act signed into law by \nPresident Nixon in 1971, has been a phenomenal success. The Postal \nService today receives virtually no taxpayer support and the service \nits hundreds of thousands of employees provide to every American, every \nday is second to none. More than thirty years later, the Postal Service \nnow delivers to 141 million addresses each day and is the anchor of a \n$900 billion mailing industry.\n  All that said, the Postal Service is clearly in need of modernization \nonce again. When it started out in 1971, nobody had access to fax \nmachines, cell phones and pagers and nobody imagined that we would ever \nenjoy conveniences like e-mail and electronic bill pay. After decades \nof success, electronic diversion of mail volume coupled with economic \nrecession and terrorism have made for some rough going at the Postal \nService in recent years. In 2001, as Postmaster General Potter assumed \nhis position, the Postal Service was projecting its third consecutive \nyear of deficits. They lost $199 million in fiscal year 2000 and $1.68 \nbillion in fiscal year 2001. They were projecting losses of up to $4 \nbillion in fiscal year 2002. Mail volume was falling, revenues were \nbelow projections and the Postal Service was estimating that it needed \nto spend $4 billion on security enhancements in order to prevent a \nrepeat of the tragic anthrax attacks that took several lives. The \nPostal Service was also perilously close to its $15 billion debt \nceiling and had been forced to raise rates three times in less than two \nyears in order to pay for its operations, further eroding mail volume.\n  In recent months, however, the Postal Service's short-term financial \noutlook has improved. Under General Potter's strong leadership, Postal \nService management cut a total of $2.9 billion in costs fiscal year \n2002. They did this mostly by eliminating 23,000 positions, mostly \nthrough attrition. This included 800 management positions at postal \nheadquarters in Washington and 2,000 administrative positions in \nregional offices. They also continued their drive to further automate \ntheir processing operations, most notably in the area of flats \nprocessing. They have continued their construction freeze and ended \ntheir self-imposed ban on post office closings, resulting in the \nclosing of dozens of post offices across the country.\n  Most dramatically, the Postal Service learned in 2002 that an \nunfunded pension liability they once believed was as high as $32 \nbillion was actually $5 billion. My friend from Maine, Ms. Collins, and \nI responded with legislation, the Postal Civil Service Retirement \nSystem Funding Reform Act, signed into law by President Bush last \nmonth, which cuts the amount the Postal Service must pay into the Civil \nService Retirement System each year by nearly $3 billion. This will \nfree up money for debt reduction and prevent the need for another rate \nincrease until at least 2006.\n  Aggressive cost cutting and the lower pension payment, then, have put \noff the emergency that would have come if the Postal Service had \nreached their debt limit. Cost cutting can only go so far, however, and \nwill not solve the Postal Service's long-term problems. It could \nactually hurt service. The Postal Service continues to add about 1.7 \nmillion new delivery points each year, creating the need for thousands \nof new routes and thousands of new letter carriers to work them. In \naddition, faster-\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\ngrowing parts of the country will need new or expanded postal \nfacilities in the coming years. Even if the economy recovers soon and \nthe Postal Service begins to see volume and revenues improve, we will \nstill need to make the fundamental reforms necessary to make the Postal \nService as successful in the 21st Century as it was in the 20th \nCentury.\n  As more and more customers turn to electronic forms of communication, \nletter carriers are bringing fewer and fewer pieces of mail to each \naddress they serve. The rate increases that will be needed to maintain \nthe Postal Service's current infrastructure, finance retirement \nobligations to its current employees, pay for new letter carriers and \nbuild facilities in growing parts of the country will only further \nerode mail volume. The Postal Service has been trying to improve on its \nown. They are making progress, but there is only so much they can do on \ntheir own.\n  That is where my bill comes in. First, the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act begins the process of developing a modern rate system \nfor pricing Postal Service products. The new rate system, to be \ndeveloped by a strengthened Postal Rate Commission, re-named the Postal \nRegulatory Commission, would allow retained earnings, provide the \nPostal Service more flexibility in setting prices and streamline \ntoday's burdensome ratemaking process. It would also allow rates to be \nincreased on an expedited basis during crises like a sharp spike in \nfuel prices and require that the Regulatory Commission develop a \n``phased rate'' schedule whereby rate increases would be phased in \ngradually over a period of time.\n\n  In addition, the new rate system authorized through my bill will \nallow the Postal Service to negotiate service agreements with \nindividual mailers. The Postal Rate Commission recently approved a \nservice agreement the Postal Service negotiated with Capital One, but \nthe process for considering the agreement took almost a year and the \nPostal Service's authority to enter into agreements is not clearly \nspelled out in law. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act \nallows the Postal Service to enter into agreements if the revenue \ngenerated from them covers all costs attributable to the Postal Service \nand results in a greater contribution to the Postal Service's \ninstitutional costs. No agreement would be permitted if it resulted in \nhigher rates for any other mailer or prohibited any similarly situated \nmailer from negotiating a similar agreement.\n  Second, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act requires the \nPostal Regulatory Commission to set strong service standards for the \nPostal Service's Market Dominant products, a category made up mostly of \nthose products, like First Class Mail, that are part of the postal \nmonopoly. The Postal Service currently sets its own service standards, \nwhich allows them to pursue efforts like the elimination of Saturday \ndelivery, a proposal floated two years ago. The new standards set by \nthe Commission will aim to improve service and will be used by the \nPostal Service to establish performance goals and to rationalize their \nphysical infrastructure. Once the standards are established, the Postal \nService will recommend a list of facilities that can be closed or \nconsolidated without hindering their ability to meet the standards. A \nnew commission, called the Postal Network Modernization Commission, \nwould then study the Postal Service's recommendations. The closings and \nconsolidations recommended by this commission would be carried out, \nsubject to approval by the President, unless Congress passed a \nresolution disapproving them.\n  Third, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act ensures that the \nPostal Service competes fairly. The bill prohibits the Postal Service \nfrom issuing anti-competitive regulations and makes the State \nDepartment, instead of the Postal Service, responsible for setting U.S. \nforeign policy on mailing issues. It also subjects the Postal Service \nto State zoning, planning and land use laws, requires them to pay an \nassumed Federal income tax on products like packages and Express Mail \nthat private firms also offer and requires that these products as a \nwhole pay their share of the Postal Service's institutional costs.\n  Fourth, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act improves Postal \nService accountability, mostly by strengthening oversight. \nQualifications for membership on the Regulatory Commission would be \nstronger than those for the Rate Commission so that Commissioners would \nhave a background in finance or economics. Commissioners would also \nhave the power to demand information from the Postal Service, including \nby subpoena, and have the power to punish them for violating rate and \nservice regulations. In addition, the Commission will make an annual \ndetermination as to whether the Postal Service is in compliance with \nrate law and meeting service standards and will have the power to \npunish them for any transgressions.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the Postal Accountability and \nEnhancement Act preserves universal service and forces the Postal \nService to concentrate solely on what they do best--processing and \ndelivering the mail to all Americans. The bill for the first time \nlimits the Postal Service to providing ``postal services,'' meaning \nthey would be prohibited from engaging in other lines of business, such \nas e-commerce, that draw time and resources away from letter and \npackage delivery. It also explicitly preserves the requirement that the \nPostal Service ``bind the Nation together through the mail'' and serve \nall parts of the country, urban, suburban and rural, in a non-\ndiscriminatory fashion. Any service standards established by the Postal \nRegulatory Commission will continue to ensure delivery to every \naddress, every day. In addition, the bill maintains the prohibition on \nclosing post offices solely because they operate at a deficit, ensuring \nthat rural and urban customers continue to enjoy full access to retail \npostal services.\n  One thing the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act does not do, \nis blame postal employees for the Postal Service's problems. The bill \npreserves collective bargaining and does nothing that would harm postal \nemployees' pay or benefits.\n\n  Another thing the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act does not \ndo is privatize or downsize the Postal Service. The bill preserves the \nPostal Service's monopoly along with its sole access to the mailbox. \nWhile it could result in the closing of some postal facilities, the \nprocess I have laid out in the bill is completely driven by the service \nstandards established by the Postal Regulatory Commission. Nothing will \nbe closed for the sake of being closed. Instead, the bill encourages \nthe Postal Service to find ways to improve customer access to retail \nservices through things like vending machines or post offices located \nin grocery stores or pharmacies.\n  As my colleagues are aware, President Bush last year announced the \ncreation of the President's Commission on the United States Postal \nService, which is expected to release a set of postal reform proposals \nthis summer that I hope will offer some fair, balanced recommendations. \nIt is also my hope, however, that the President's Commission look to \nthe Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act as a touchstone as they \ncomplete their work. The bill is the product of nearly a decade's worth \nof work on postal reform in the House of Representatives led by \nCongressman John McHugh from New York and is based in large part on \nlegislation Congressman McHugh introduced towards the end of the 107th \nCongress. While I cannot claim that the McHugh bill had unanimous \nsupport, it did draw the support of most postal employees, much of the \nmailing industry and the Postal Service's Board of Governors.\n  When Treasury Department Under Secretary Peter Fisher addressed the \nPresident's Commission at its first meeting, he stated that everything \nwas on the table and that the Commission's findings were not \npredetermined. I know there is some concern that the Commission will \nrecommend privatization, and that this was the idea from the beginning. \nI will admit that I initially shared these feelings but, based on what \nI have heard about the Commission's deliberations, they appear on track \nto develop a reasonable set of recommendations. That said, I urge them \nto take careful consideration of the work Congress has done on postal \nreform in the past. Radical reforms undertaken at a number of foreign \nposts in recent years should teach us a lesson\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\nabout going too far. When the British deregulated Royal Mail, service \nbegan to suffer dramatically. When the New Zealand Post Office was \nprivatized, universal service was eliminated and customers in rural \nareas were forced to pay for delivery. When Argentina privatized its \nPostal Authority, the new private entity went bankrupt even before the \ncountry's economic crisis began. We cannot afford to gamble with \nsimilar reforms at the Postal Service.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Collins, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and all of my colleagues in passing comprehensive \npostal reform this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to combat nursing home fraud and abuse, increase \nprotections for victims of telemarketing fraud, enhance safeguards for \npension plans and health care benefit programs, and enhance penalties \nfor crimes against seniors, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today I am introducing the Seniors Safety \nAct of 2003, a bill to protect older Americans from crime. I am pleased \nto have Senators Daschle, Kennedy, Feingold, and Bingaman as cosponsors \nfor this anti-crime bill.\n  The Seniors Safety Act is a comprehensive bill that addresses the \nmost prevalent crimes perpetrated against seniors, including health \ncare fraud, nursing home abuse, telemarketing fraud--and bribery, graft \nand fraud in pension and employee benefit plans. In addition, this \nlegislation would help seniors obtain restitution if their pension \nplans are defrauded.\n  Older Americans are the most rapidly growing population group in our \nsociety, making them an even more attractive target for criminals. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has predicted that the number \nof older Americans will grow from 13 percent of the U.S. population in \n2000 to 20 percent by 2030. In Vermont, seniors comprise about 12 \npercent of the population, a number that is expected to increase to 20 \npercent by 2025.\n  Crime against seniors has remained stubbornly resistant over the last \ndecade. According to a 2000 Justice Department study, more than 90 \npercent of crimes committed against older Americans were property \ncrimes, with theft the most common. As our Nation addressed our violent \ncrime problem, we did not take a comprehensive approach to deterring \nthe crimes that so affect the elderly, like telemarketing fraud, health \ncare fraud, and pension fraud. The Seniors Safety Act provides such a \ncomprehensive approach, and I urge the Senate to pass it.\n  The Seniors Safety Act instructs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \nreview current sentencing guidelines and, if appropriate, amend the \nguidelines to include the age of a crime victim as a criteria for \ndetermining whether a sentencing enhancement is proper. The bill also \nrequires the Commission to review sentencing guidelines for health care \nbenefit fraud, increases statutory penalties both for fraud resulting \nin serious injury or death and for bribery\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\nand graft in connection with employee benefit plans, and increases \ncriminal and civil penalties for defrauding pension plans.\n  Telemarketing fraud is one crime that disproportionately harms \nAmericans over age 50. The Seniors Safety Act seeks to fight the \nperpetrators of fraud--schemes that often succeed in swindling seniors \nof their life savings. Some of these schemes are directed from outside \nthe United States, making criminal prosecution more difficult.\n  The Act would provide the Attorney General with a new and substantial \ntool to prevent telemarketing fraud the power to block or terminate \nservice to telephone facilities that are being used to defraud innocent \npeople. The Justice Department could use this authority to disrupt \ntelemarketing fraud schemes directed from foreign sources by cutting \noff the swindlers' telephone service. Even if the criminals acquire a \nnew telephone number, temporary interruptions will prevent some seniors \nfrom being victimized.\n  The bill also establishes a ``Better Business Bureau''-style \nclearinghouse at the Federal Trade Commission to provide seniors, their \nfamilies, and others who may be concerned about a telemarketer with \ninformation about prior law enforcement actions against the particular \ncompany. In addition, the FTC would refer seniors and other consumers \nwho believe they have been swindled to the appropriate law enforcement \nauthorities.\n  Criminal activity that undermines the safety and integrity of pension \nplans and health benefit programs threatens all Americans, but most \nespecially those seniors who have relied on promised benefits in \nplanning their retirements. Seniors who have worked faithfully and \nhonestly for years should not reach their retirement years only to find \nthat the funds they relied upon were stolen.\n  The Seniors Safety Act would add to the arsenal that federal \nprosecutors can draw upon to prevent and punish fraud against \nretirement plans. Specifically, the Act would create new criminal and \ncivil penalties for defrauding pension plans or obtaining money or \nproperty from such plans by means of false or fraudulent pretenses. In \naddition, the Act would enhance penalties for bribery and graft in \nconnection with employee benefit plans. The only people enjoying the \nbenefits of pension plans should be the people who have worked hard to \nfund those plans, not crooks who get the money by fraud.\n  Health care spending consists of about 15 percent of the gross \nnational product, or more than $1 trillion each year. Estimated losses \ndue to fraud and abuse are astronomical. A December 1998 report by the \nNational Institute of Justice, NIJ, states that these losses ``may \nexceed 10 percent of annual health care spending, or $100 billion per \nyear.''\n  As more health care claims are processed electronically, more \nsophisticated computer-generated fraud schemes are surfacing. Some of \nthese schemes generate thousands of false claims designed to pass \nthrough automated claims processing to payment, and result in the theft \nof millions of dollars from federal and private health care programs. \nFraud against Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans increases the \nfinancial burden on taxpayers and beneficiaries alike. In addition, \nsome forms of fraud may result in inadequate medical care, harming \npatients' health as well. Unfortunately, the NIJ reports that many \nhealth care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, \nsuch as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or \nable to complain or alert law enforcement.''\n  We saw a dramatic increase in criminal convictions for health care \nfraud cases during the 1990s. These cases included convictions for \nsubmitting false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance \nplans; fraudulent billings by foreign doctors; and needless \nprescriptions for durable medical equipment by doctors in exchange for \nkickbacks from manufacturers.\n  We can and must do more. The Seniors Safety Act would allow the \nAttorney General to bring injunctive actions to stop false claims and \nillegal kickback schemes involving federal health care programs. The \nbill would also provide law enforcement authorities with additional \ninvestigatory tools to uncover, investigate, and prosecute health care \noffenses in both criminal and civil proceedings.\n  In addition, whistle-blowers who tip off law enforcement officers \nabout health care fraud would be authorized under the Seniors Safety \nAct to seek court permission to review information obtained by the \ngovernment to enhance their assistance in False Claims Act lawsuits. \nSuch qui tam, or whistle-blower, suits have dramatically enhanced the \ngovernment's ability to uncover health care fraud. The Act would allow \nwhistle-blowers and their qui tam suits to become even more effective.\n  Finally, the Act would extend anti-fraud and anti-kickback safeguards \nto the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. These are all \nimportant steps that will help cut down on the enormous health care \nfraud losses.\n  As life expectancies continue to increase, long-term care planning \nspecialists estimate that over 40 percent of those turning 65 \neventually will need nursing home care, and that 20 percent of those \nseniors will spend five years or more in homes. Indeed, many of us \nalready have experienced having our parents, family members or other \nloved ones spend time in a nursing home. We owe it to them and to \nourselves to give the residents of nursing homes the best and safest \ncare they can get.\n  The Justice Department has cited egregious examples of nursing homes \nthat pocketed Medicare funds instead of providing residents with \nadequate care. In one case, five patients died as a result of the \ninadequate provision of nutrition, wound care and diabetes management \nby three Pennsylvania nursing homes. Yet another death occurred when a \npatient, who was unable to speak, was placed in a scalding tub of 138-\ndegree water.\n  This Act provides additional peace of mind to nursing home residents \nand their families by providing federal law enforcement with the \nauthority to investigate and prosecute operators of nursing homes for \nwillfully engaging in patterns of health and safety violations in the \ncare of nursing home residents. The Act also protects whistle-blowers \nfrom retaliation for reporting such violations.\n  This title of the Seniors Safety Act would authorize the Attorney \nGeneral to use forfeited funds to pay restitution to victims of \nfraudulent activity, and authorize the courts to require the forfeiture \nof proceeds from retirement-related offenses. In addition, it would \nexempt false claims actions from being stayed in bankruptcy proceedings \nand ensure that debts due to the United States from false claims \nactions are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  We all deserve to age with dignity and free of the threat of abuse or \nfraud. No one can guarantee that this will happen, but the Senior \nSafety Act can be a powerful new tool to help crack down on those who \nprey upon older Americans. This effort is about all of us and our \nfamilies.\n  These are problems that have persisted too long. It is past the time \nfor the Senate to act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1286\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of older Americans is rapidly growing in the \n     United States. According to the 2000 census, 21 percent of \n     the United States population is 55 years of age or older.\n       (2) In 1997, 7 percent of victims of serious violent crime \n     were 50 years of age or older.\n       (3) In 1997, 17.7 percent of murder victims were 55 years \n     of age or older.\n       (4) According to the Department of Justice, persons 65 \n     years of age and older experienced approximately 2,700,000 \n     crimes a year between 1992 and 1997.\n       (5) Older victims of violent crime are almost twice as \n     likely as younger victims to be raped, robbed, or assaulted \n     at or in their own homes.\n       (6) Approximately half of all Americans who are 50 years of \n     age or older are afraid to walk alone at night in their own \n     neighborhoods.\n       (7) Seniors over 50 years of age reportedly account for 37 \n     percent of the estimated $40,000,000,000 in losses each year \n     due to telemarketing fraud.\n       (8) A 1996 American Association of Retired Persons survey \n     of people 50 years of age and older showed that 57 percent \n     were likely to receive calls from telemarketers at least once \n     a week.\n       (9) In 1998, Congress enacted legislation to provide for \n     increased penalties for telemarketing fraud that targets \n     seniors.\n       (10) It has been estimated that--\n       (A) approximately 43 percent of persons turning 65 years of \n     age can expect to spend some time in a long-term care \n     facility; and\n       (B) approximately 20 percent can expect to spend 5 years or \n     more in a such a facility.\n       (11) In 1997, approximately $82,800,000,000 was spent on \n     nursing home care in the United States and over half of this \n     amount was spent by the Medicaid and Medicare programs.\n       (12) Losses to fraud and abuse in health care reportedly \n     cost the United States an estimated $100,000,000,000 in 1996.\n       (13) The Inspector General for the Department of Health and \n     Human Services has estimated that about $12,600,000,000 in \n     improper Medicare benefit payments, due to inadvertent \n     mistake, fraud, and abuse were made during fiscal year 1998.\n       (14) Incidents of health care fraud and abuse remain common \n     despite awareness of the problem.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) combat nursing home fraud and abuse;\n       (2) enhance safeguards for pension plans and health care \n     programs;\n       (3) develop strategies for preventing and punishing crimes \n     that target or otherwise disproportionately affect seniors by \n     collecting appropriate data--\n       (A) to measure the extent of crimes committed against \n     seniors; and\n       (B) to determine the extent of domestic and elder abuse of \n     seniors; and\n       (4) prevent and deter criminal activity, such as \n     telemarketing fraud, that results in economic and physical \n     harm against seniors, and ensure appropriate restitution.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend section 502(a)(5) of the Higher Education \nAct of 1965 regarding the definition of a Hispanic-serving institution; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill amend Title V of the Higher Education Act. Specifically, this bill \nwill eliminate the ``50 percent'' low-income assurance constraint \ncurrently required for Hispanic Serving Institutions to be eligible for \ngrants under Title V of the Higher Education Act.\n  Title V of the Higher Education Act is the primary vehicle used to \ntarget urgently needed funds to Hispanic Serving Institutions so that \nthey can strengthen and expand their institutional capacity. Grants \nunder this section can be used by higher education institutions to \nimprove academic quality, institutional management, and financial \nstability. These grants are essential to institutions that provide and \nincrease the number of educational opportunities available to Hispanic \nstudents.\n  Under current guidelines, in order to qualify for a grant under Title \nV, an institution must have at least 25 percent full time, Hispanic \nundergraduate student enrollment, and not less than 50 percent of its \nHispanic student population must be low income. Title V grants are \nawarded for 5 years, with a minimum two year wait out period after the \ntermination of a grant period before eligibility to apply for another \ngrant. During fiscal year 2002, 191 institutions were awarded grants.\n  Title V's current ``50 percent'' low-income assurance requirement is \nan unnecessary bureaucratic regulation that constrains Hispanic Serving \nInstitutions abilities to implement programs designed to provide long \nrange solutions to Hispanic higher education challenges. Currently, \nthere are no government authorized means to collect student financial \ndata, and, although some information can be extrapolated from student \nfinancial aid forms, it is not enough information to complete the Title \nV forms.\n  The bill I am introducing today will improve the HSI eligibility \nrequirements by allowing applicants for Title V funding to satisfy the \n50 percent low-income Hispanic student population criterion with \nappropriate evidence of student eligibility for Title IV, need-based, \naid. The revised Title V section will retain the requirement that to be \neligible for title V funds, an institution must have an enrollment of \nneedy students. However, rather than conditioning grant qualification \nupon the cumbersome requirement that institutions prove 50 percent of \ntheir Hispanic students are low income, it will allow institutions to \nqualify for Title V money if 50 percent of the students are receiving \nneed-based assistance under title IV or a substantial percentage of the \nstudents are receiving Pell Grants.\n  The Higher Education Act of 1965 was signed into law for the purpose \nof increasing access to higher education for all citizens of the United \nStates and of strengthening the capacity of higher education \ninstitutions to better serve their communities. The reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act during the 108th Congress presents a powerful \nopportunity for the nation to address the higher education needs of the \nnation's Hispanic-Serving Institutions, which serve the largest \nconcentrations of Hispanic higher education students in the United \nStates.\n  Hispanic Serving Institutions provide the quality education essential \nto full participation in today's society. Many students in my home \nstate of New Mexico have benefited from the academic excellence that \nHispanic Serving Institutions seek to provide. Title V grants are \nintended to provide assistance to these less advantaged, developing \ninstitutions. However, by convoluting the application process, Congress \nis preventing these institutions from applying for grants and \nobstructing their development.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\n                                S. 1287\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexclude brachytherapy devices from the prospective payment system for \noutpatient hospital services under the medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation, along with my colleague Senator Miller of Georgia, that \nwould amend the Medicare portion of the Social Security Act to exclude \nbrachytherapy devices from the prospective payment system for \noutpatient hospital services under the Medicare Program. Currently, the \nnumber of devices reimbursed by Medicare is one set number and non-\nspecific to the prostate cancer patient.\n  Prostate cancer accounts for 43 percent of all cancers found in men--\nmore than triple the rate of lung cancer. The American Cancer Society \nestimates that nearly 221,000 men in the United States will be \ndiagnosed with prostate cancer in 2003 and approximately 27,000 of \nthese men will die as a result. The American Cancer Society also \nestimates that about 5,700 men diagnosed will be from Georgia and \nnearly 700 of them may die. This legislation will help some of these \nmen fight and survive this indiscriminate killer. Over 130,000 men and \ntheir sons nationwide have been treated with brachytherapy Theraseeds \nto date.\n  Brachytherapy is an important form of radiation treatment for \nprostate cancer in which radioactive ``seeds'' are implanted into the \npatient. While there are several ways to treat prostate cancer, \npatients need the freedom to choose the treatment that best suits them \nand their situation. Tremendous variations exist that may effect the \nclinical requirements for cancer patients using brachytherapy \ntheraseeds, including variations in the types of radioactive isotopes, \nas well as the number and radioactive intensity of the seeds. The \nbrachytherapy community indicates that these variations result in \nconsiderable differences in total brachytherapy costs among patients, \nvarying from several hundred dollars to over $10,000 per patient. \nProstate brachytherapy is different from many other clinical \ninterventions because of the dramatic variability in the type, number \nand radioactivity of brachytherapy seeds needed to treat each patient. \nThis variability is due to differences in the clinical presentation \nfrom patient to patient, including the type, staging, and size of a \npatient's cancer. This variability also results in a broad range of \ncosts per patient.

Madam President, in regard to S. 1276, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate immediately proceed to this bill, which was \nintroduced earlier today and is being held at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1276) to improve the manner in which the \n     Corporation for National and Community Service approves, and \n     records obligations relating to, national service positions.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to support legislation that \nwill strengthen the Corporation for National and Community Service's \nAmeriCorps program. The Strengthen AmeriCorps Program Act of 2003 is a \nbipartisan bill that I introduce with my colleague and good friend, \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, and a number of my other colleagues. As the \nranking member and chair of the Corporation's appropriations committee \nand members of the authorizing committee, Senator Mikulski and I \nbelieve that this bill will not only address the Corporation's \naccounting problems, but more importantly, it will protect and expand \nvolunteer service opportunities across our Nation.\n  Many of my colleagues have heard from their constituents and the \nmedia in recent weeks about the potential cuts to the AmeriCorps \nprogram. This bill addresses those concerns and the long-standing \nconcerns about the management and financial problems of the Corporation \nby creating a budgeting mechanism that ensures the Corporation has the \nfunds needed to pay educational awards. Under our bill, the Corporation \nwould be able to enroll about 50,000 AmeriCorps members, without the \nneed for additional funds.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the President has asked every American \nto volunteer in their communities and has made the AmeriCorps program a \ncentral vehicle in meeting volunteer needs. I support the President's \ncall to service and if harnessed in the right fashion, the AmeriCorps \nprogram can play an important and effective role in improving the lives \nof many Americans and communities it serves.\n  The Corporation, unfortunately, has been plagued by significant and \nlong-standing management problems that have been neglected for several \nyears. One notable result of this neglect has been the inappropriate \nand illegal practice of enrolling more AmeriCorps members than the \nCorporation had budgeted. According to the Corporation's Inspector \nGeneral, the number of approved AmeriCorps volunteer positions for \nprogram years 2000, 2001, and 2002, were approximately 59,000, 61,000, \nand 67,000, respectively, even though its budget estimates were based \non enrollment levels that were around 50,000. Last year, the \nCorporation over-enrolled the AmeriCorps program by more than 20,000. \nFortunately, the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittees were able to provide $43 million more than requested in \nthe fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill to meet the needs of these \nmembers and more. Because of continued poor budgeting practices, the \nVA-HUD Subcommittee also approved another $64 million in a deficiency \nappropriation in the fiscal year 2003 supplemental appropriations to \ncover additional shortfalls.\n  When the over-enrollment problem first surfaced, I immediately asked \nthe General Accounting Office and the Corporation's Inspector General \nto review the accounting practices of the Corporation and its internal \ncontrols to determine the causes of this problem. Further, I asked the \nGAO's Comptroller General to review the Corporation's underlying \nstatute to determine whether the Corporation's practices complied with \nthis law and other fiscal laws such as the Antideficiency Act.\n  Both the GAO and the IG found that the Corporation did not comply \nwith the law by incorrectly recording its funding obligations. In a \nstatement for the record for the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee hearing on April 10, 2003, GAO identified \nseveral factors that led to the Corporation's incorrect accounting \npractice. The factors included inappropriate obligation practices, \nlittle or no communication among key Corporation executives, too much \nflexibility given to grantees regarding enrollments, and unreliable \ndata on the number of AmeriCorps participants.\n  The GAO also found that the Corporation was not following the law in \nrecording its legal liabilities. The GAO's finding is described in the \nComptroller General's two legal opinions that were issued on April 9, \n2003--B-300480, and June 6, 2003--B-300480.2. The first opinion \nconcluded that the Corporation incurs a legal liability for the award \nof educational benefits of AmeriCorps participants when it enters into \na grant agreement. At the time it enters a grant agreement, the \nCorporation approves a specified number of new participants in the \nAmeriCorps program. By this action:\n\n       the Corporation incurs a legal duty that once fully \n     matured, by action of the grantee and participants outside \n     the Corporation's control, will require the Corporation to \n     pay education benefits to qualified participants from the \n     National Service Trust.\n\n  The Comptroller General opinion further states that as:\n\n       the Corporation incurs an obligation for education \n     benefits, it must record the obligation against the budget \n     authority available in the Trust.\n\n  In other words, to ensure compliance with the law, the Corporation \nmust record and track its obligations based on the value of the \neducational award multiplied by all approved positions.\n  We understand that recording obligations based on the approved level \nof AmeriCorps members in the program does not reflect the true \nperformance of the program. We know from historical data that not all \nAmeriCorps volunteers successfully complete service. We also know that \nnot all AmeriCorps members who successfully complete service use their \neducational award benefit. Accordingly, this bill recognizes the \nrealities of the AmeriCorps program and allows the Corporation to \nmaximize the number of AmeriCorps that can participate in the program.\n  In short, the bill allows the Corporation to fund AmeriCorps grants \nbased on estimates of the number of members who will likely complete \nand use their education award. Further, the bill requires an annual \nactuarial audit of the National Service Trust to ensure that the \nFederal Government is able to\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\nmeet its liabilities. The bill also requires the chief executive \nofficer to certify that the Corporation has properly recorded and \ntracked its obligations.\n  To ensure that the AmeriCorps program is accountable to the taxpayer \nand its volunteers, it is our expectation that the Corporation will use \nconservative assumptions in developing its funding formula. This \nespecially is important since the Corporation has repeatedly failed to \nmeet funding obligations resulting in actions by the Congress to \nprovide additional funding, including a deficiency appropriation. While \nthe program has been in place for about 10 years, there is little data \non the performance of the program. Until there is reliable data, I \nstrongly believe that the Corporation should assume a 100 percent \nenrollment rate for every volunteer slot approved in the grant \nagreements. I also believe that the Corporation should assume at least \nan 80 percent earnings rate for the program and at least an 80 percent \neducation award usage rate. Further, because of poor data, the bill \nrequires a central reserve fund to give the Corporation an extra \ncushion in case the actual usage rate exceeds the assumptions used in \nthe formula.\n  It is my hope that we can pass this legislation as quickly as \npossible. This legislation provides clarification for the Corporation \nin determining grant award allocations to its grantees and the states. \nWithout this legislation, uncertainty and disagreement will delay and \nlimit the enrollment of AmeriCorps volunteers. Considering the demand \nand the need for this program, we cannot afford to wait.\n  We designed this legislation with input from the administration. I \nthink it is a reasonable and fair approach to address this issue. It \nmitigates harm to AmeriCorps programs in a manner that will ensure \naccountability and fiscal integrity in the programs. Keeping in mind \nthe problems identified by the auditors, which led to the enrollment \nfreeze last November, we designed this legislation to ensure that we do \nnot repeat those past mistakes. The enrollment freeze was an \nunfortunate but avoidable mistake if the Corporation had properly \nmanaged and monitored its programs.\n  Finally, we need to put these enrollment issues behind us. This \nprogram has had a difficult and star-crossed history, and it is \nunfortunate that we are here in June revisiting the implementation of \nthe program to ensure both accountability and credibility. We need to \nensure that the State and local programs are meeting both program \nrequirements and community needs.\n  Before closing, I want to raise a technical issue regarding the \nenrollment cap of 50,000 AmeriCorps members. The Corporation enrolls \nmembers based on full-time equivalent or FTE levels since some \nAmeriCorps members serve part-time and others serve full-time. The cap \nshould be based on FTE levels so that it is consistent with normal \nAmeriCorps business practices.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and pass it as \nquickly as possible. Senator Mikulski and I have tried to construct \nthis bill in a thoughtful and fair manner to address the concerns about \nthe program. This bill ensures that volunteers across this Nation and \nthe taxpayers will have confidence in the AmeriCorps program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Bond on this legislation to head off the \ncuts in AmeriCorps announced this week that will be so devastating to \nso many Americorps programs in so many States.\n  Our bill directs the Corporation for National Service to calculate \nmembership by a reasonable formula, and ensure that every person who \ncommits to a year of service to their community in AmeriCorps will \nreceive the education award.\n  The fiscal mismanagement at the Corporation is a serious continuing \nproblem, but State and local programs should not have to pay for those \nmistakes by slashing their programs. Today, we take the first step in \npreserving service opportunities for this year and the future. We will \ncontinue to do all we can to increase the funds available, so that \nprograms do not suffer because the Corporation over-enrolled 20,000 \nmembers last year. That over-enrollment is a clear signal that \nAmericorps is reviving the spirit of volunteerism in our country and we \nshould make these opportunities available for people of all ages to \nserve their communities. In this struggling economy, too many after-\nschool and summer school programs are being cut back, and health \nclinics and food kitchens are serving more people than ever. AmeriCorps \nhelps these programs help others.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond for their impressive \nbipartisan leadership on this issue, and I urge the Senate to join us \nin maintaining these successful programs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
