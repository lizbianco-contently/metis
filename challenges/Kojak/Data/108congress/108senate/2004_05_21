Mr. President, this morning we will return to \nconsideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. Senators \nWarner and Levin are here to consider cleared amendments from both \nsides of the aisle. Also, some Members will wish to speak on the \npending amendment which was offered by Senator Graham of South \nCarolina. That amendment was offered yesterday morning. Unfortunately, \nwe were unable to vote on that amendment during yesterday's session. I \nhad hoped we would be able to vote on that amendment and move forward \nwith the bill. However, that appears unlikely. Therefore, no rollcall \nvotes will occur during today's session.\n  Once again, I hope we could limit amendments to the overall bill. I \nknow the chairman has a list of Republican amendments he will begin to \nwork through. It would be helpful if we could lock in the list on both \nsides of the aisle, to give managers an idea of what to anticipate, \nboth in terms of making progress and ultimately finishing the very, \nvery important bill.\n  We did make good, reasonable progress on the bill this week. I hope \nMembers will alert their respective chairman or ranking members about \ntheir amendments so we can continue to move ahead on this bill.\n  When we return from our recess, I do still plan to go to class \naction. As I have stated on numerous occasions, starting actually a \ncouple of months ago, I will be talking to the Democratic leadership \nabout proceeding to that bill. We will say more at the close of \nbusiness today, after we see what progress can be made on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill in the course of today.\n  This week I was pleased we were able to reach an understanding on \njudicial nominations, I think a very fair and balanced approach to 25 \nof these nominees. We will vote on these pending nominations and we \nwill continue to press on for votes for all of the judicial nominees in \naddition to those 25.\n  We also need--and I mentioned it last week and the week before--we \nneed to\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\npress on for nonjudicial nominations as well. There are approximately \n60 nonjudicial nominations, including very critical Ambassadors, that \nremain pending on the calendar. I know there have been a lot of \ndiscussions back and forth about how best to proceed on these \nnominations. We must find a way to schedule consideration of these \nindividuals. We need to continue to work to do that. There are 60 of \nthem on the calendar. We need to proceed in good faith.\n  The fact that we made such good progress on the judicial nominations \nthis week leaves the door open to a good way of addressing many of \nthese nominations that are on the calendar. We need to allow the Senate \nto begin a process to confirm these people. When you look at the \ncalendar itself, these nominations are page after page--14 pages of \nthese nominations that are awaiting our action.\n  I look forward to bringing them to the floor at the appropriate time, \nwith discussion with the Democratic leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6052-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Before the distinguished majority leader leaves, I would \nlike to say a couple of things. We worked hard. You and Senator Daschle \nwere able to work your way through an agreement on judges. I agree with \nthe majority leader, I think it is fair. We will have processed within \nthe next few weeks, I think, 198 judges. I think that is the number we \nwill have processed.\n  I also say as far as the nominations for other posts that are on the \ncalendar, we, of course, are waiting for you and Senator Daschle to \nwork something out on those also. We need to move forward on some of \nthe Democrats submitted by Senator Daschle to the President and which \nare either languishing down there or haven't moved for other reasons. \nWe hope that can be done before we move too much further in this \nlegislative session, when things get jammed up.\n  I also say while the distinguished chairman of the committee is on \nthe floor, and the majority leader, we believe we can work through \nthese amendments on the Defense authorization bill. Between both \nDemocrats and Republicans at this stage there are about 100 amendments, \na fairly equal number on each side we have been given at this stage. A \nlot of these amendments, as always happens, are not going to be \noffered. A lot can be accepted by the two managers of the bill.\n  I would say this. I think yesterday we could have made more progress \nthan we did. We made an offer that, on the Graham amendment, we would \nlike that put over until after the recess. That is what has happened, \nanyway.\n  If that had been the case, Senator Cantwell and Senator Hollings \nwould agree to a 2-hour time limit to dispose of those two amendments.\n  We have a number of amendments. Senator Daschle wants to offer his \nTRICARE amendment, Senator Kennedy wants to offer an amendment that has \nalready been seen by the majority, by the managers. It may take a \nlittle bit of time. There are some reporting requirements. But my point \nis we can move through this.\n  I know there is tremendous pressure on the majority leader to move to \nclass action. My personal feeling is it would be more of a class act to \nfinish the Defense authorization bill first. I think even now we have \nsome amendments the two managers are going to clear, 12 or 15 \namendments this morning.\n  We will work here today to lay down amendments on our side and have \nthe pending amendments, including the Graham amendment.\n  We want to indicate that we are fully cooperative, and we want to \nmove this bill. We understand the importance of it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know the chairman is here and will \nrespond in terms of particulars of the underlying bill. We made good \nprogress. It is an important bill and a bill which we will finish.\n  My intentions are to in all likelihood move to the class action bill \nthe week we return and address that. Then if we can come up with a \nreasonable way of finishing this bill--which I am confident we can--I \nthink ultimately when people sit down and say what is important to have \non this bill, we will be able to put together amendments on our side \nand the other side and pull those together and have an orderly way of \ndealing with those.\n  I will say that in the big picture the last 2 weeks have been very \npositive weeks in terms of governing in very difficult times, many of \nwhich have been overseen by the chairman of this particular bill, \nSenator Warner. It is very tough oversight in terms of what is going on \nboth in Iraq and indeed around the world in the war on terror. At the \nsame time that has been conducted in a very professional way. This \ninstitution can be quite proud; we have done some very good things in \nterms of national security. Three days ago, we passed bioshield \nlegislation. That is a national security issue, one we have worked on \nfor 14 months. A few days ago, we passed the important education bill, \nthe Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, which affects 6.5 \nmillion children with disabilities.\n  If you look at the field on jobs and taxation, 2 weeks ago we passed \na bill that will impact hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers \ncalled the JOBS bill, a Euro tax that is placed on this country which \nwe have in the Senate effectively eliminated once the House acts. And 2 \nweeks ago, we passed an international tax relief bill to make sure \nbroadband knowledge can proliferate in this country. All of that is \npart of governing which has taken place in 2 weeks of very difficult \ntimes. I have been very pleased over the last 2 weeks. It shows we can \nwork together and govern--plus the judges on top of that. I think we \nwill see that on this bill and we will see it on the class action bill. \nI am very optimistic about where we are going.\n  I am also pleased about what we have done in the last couple of \nweeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6052-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 2400, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2400) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2005 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for each fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n  Pending:\n\n       Graham (SC) Amendment No. 3170, to provide for the \n     treatment by the Department of Energy of waste material.\n       Crapo Amendment No. 3226 (to Amendment No. 3170), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague, the senior \nSenator from Michigan, and I will momentarily address some of the \npending amendments which have been cleared on both sides. I do, \nhowever, note the presence on the floor of two other colleagues. I \nwould suggest to my ranking member that perhaps we could accommodate \nthem, since he and I will be here throughout much of the morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to do that, of course.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the two managers are on the floor, \ncould I ask a question before I depart?\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course,\n  Mr. REID. We have a number of amendments we would like to lay down \ntoday and not have those amendments take precedence over the pending \namendment, which is the Graham amendment. We want to be able to show \nthe managers of the bill and leadership on the majority side that we \nwant to move this bill. My personal feeling, as I expressed to the \nmajority leader while he was here, is I think it is not the right thing \nto do to move off this bill and go to something else. I think with some \ndetermination we\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\ncould start on Tuesday--which is going to be a very short day--work \nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and I think we could finish this bill. \nIf we work some long days, I think we could finish it. If we go to \nclass action legislation, that is going to take up a lot of time. \nCloture motions need to be filed. I do not know that. I assume so.\n  My point is if there is anything the two managers of the bill can do \nto exert their significant influence on the majority to see if we can \nfinish this bill, I think everyone would be well served. The House \npassed the bill last night by a wide bipartisan margin. I hope we can \nwhittle down some amendments. We could do it, if we work some long \ndays. But I predict if we go off this bill we will never finish it.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I hear very clearly the spoken words of my \ngood friend and colleague. I think of years past when Senator Levin and \nI have greatly benefited by the individual leadership of the Senator \nfrom Nevada on the floor when our defense bills have sort of gotten \ninto a rut here and there.\n  But I encourage my distinguished colleague from Nevada, who heard the \nwords of the majority leader moments ago. Those are decisions that have \nto rest with the majority and minority leaders. Consequently, I entrust \nthem with those decisions. I hope that pattern of sequencing \nlegislation on the floor will be done in such a way as to meet the \nrequirements of all Senators and proceed. I am confident it will be \ndone. We must, because there is no alternative but to get a bill. This \nNation is at war. The men and women of the Armed Forces are deserving \nof further recognition, which this bill has, together with their \nfamilies. We send a strong signal throughout the world of America's \nresolve in its war on terrorism--joined by many other nations--and its \nresolve to keep our military strong.\n  I am hopeful the honest difference of views can be reconciled, but it \nis a matter that is left to the distinguished majority leader in \nconsultation with the distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. If I could, Mr. President, I think the distinguished \nchairman of the committee has made the argument about why we shouldn't \nget off this bill.\n  I want everyone to understand the distinguished senior Senator from \nSouth Dakota, the Democratic leader, has had nothing to do with moving \noff this bill. He wants to finish this bill. He feels that is most \nappropriate.\n  This class action bill is important legislation, but it pales in \ncomparison to the needs we authorize for these programs for our \nfighting men and women around the world.\n  The House bill includes a number of provisions. The $25 billion \nrequested by the administration, as I understand, also legislates the \nnumber of troops we would have. If we don't authorize that along with \nthe House, it won't happen. We will wind up going through the \nappropriations process and appropriating money that has not been \nauthorized in the past.\n  We need this bill. I repeat, as important as the class action is, it \nis insignificant compared to what we are doing here. I say to everyone \nwithin the sound of my voice, we should do everything we can to finish \nthis bill; otherwise, I think we will not have a Defense authorization \nbill this year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I readily acknowledge that yesterday the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota was right where I am standing \nuntil the closing minutes of yesterday's deliberation. He was trying to \nmove certain matters. But I bring to the attention of the Senator that \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina had an amendment and was \non the floor. I will leave it to the record. But other Senators said no \nway; we are going to sit here through the night and debate and debate \nand debate.\n  Therefore, I think leadership--myself, Senator Levin, and the \nmajority leader--felt there was no purpose in trying to press on. I \nthink we have pretty well covered it. I think we understand our \npositions.\n\n  Unless the Senator has further observations----\n  Mr. REID. If I could say one more thing--and I will say no more--as I \nsaid in my remarks this morning through the Chair, to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee, the majority leader, we felt the best thing to \ndo yesterday was to move off the bill, and Senator Hollings and Senator \nCantwell said when we got back we would finish this phase of the \nlegislation within 2 hours. We agreed to do that.\n  For reasons that are in the minds of the managers of the bill, there \nwas a decision not to accept it. We want to move forward. I think the \nLindsey Graham amendment has been a hiccup here in the process but \nslowed us down all day yesterday. We think it can be completed very \nquickly when we get back.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from--the committee \nchairman would yield for one minute.\n  I was kind of surprised when I walked in a few minutes late on the \nfloor to hear we are going off this bill. I don't quite understand the \nlogic. I missed the majority leader's statement and I apologize for \nthat. But we have to pick up this bill at some point. I don't know why \nit is assumed we are going to have any more or less trouble when we get \nback on this bill than we do right now continuing this bill. We are \ngoing to have to resolve the Graham issue and we will. It can be done \nin a few hours. To just set this bill aside, I am not sure I understand \nwhat the reasoning is. It is unusual in the middle of the Defense bill \nto set it aside for some other less important bill. I missed the \nexplanation of the majority leader. I am surprised.\n\n  We have troops in the field. There are many important issues. The \nchairman knows better than any Member in the Senate. He is the \nchairman, an incredibly effective chairman of this committee, and he \nknows what the provisions of this bill are. They include provisions not \njust on all of the quality of life issues, pay issues, and family \nissues, but they also include a very important issue on troop strength \nand the signal we send on that matter. At this moment it seems to me it \nis one of the most important issues to resolve. We are going to resolve \nthat issue. We will figure out a way to resolve it. The chairman is \nfully on board with the direction in which this Congress is going. He \nis certainly aware and understands the importance of dealing with this.\n  I am really surprised. I will express that surprise. This means we \nare derailed for at least a week. I cannot imagine the urgency of the \nbill on class action suits.\n  I will ask our deputy minority leader as to what the estimate is for \nthat bill. It will take, I assume, the whole week, will it not?\n  Mr. REID. I doubt very seriously we can finish the class action bill \nthe week we get back. It would be a rare occasion in the annals of \nlegislation that we could finish this very contentious bill. It may \npass, but it will pass by a slim margin. I am sure there will have to \nbe a cloture vote on it at some time. It is a bill that need not be \ndone now.\n  If class action law does not change this whole year, it will be \nuncomfortable for some people, but it is not a life- or-death matter, \nas is this bill of the two managers. This class action is a convenience \nfor businesses and lawyers.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for our colloquy this morning.\n  I see members of our committee on either side. I suggest, following \nthe distinguished Senator from Colorado, the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii be recognized. I make that not as a unanimous consent but as a \ncourtesy, and the Senator from Michigan and I can proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Hawaii wishes to speak this \nmorning and whether it would be all right if we sequenced Senator Akaka \nimmediately after Senator Allard, and we will put that in the Record. I \nsuggest we make that a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. I make that in the form of a unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank both the chairman and the ranking \nmember on the Armed Services Committee for their courtesy this morning.\n  I will take a few moments to clear up some of the debate last \nevening. I would very much have liked to have had a vote on the Lindsey \namendment, but I understand how those things happen. I hope we can move \nforward.\n  I will address three main issues we left hanging last night. No. 1 is \nthe\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nproper classification of the wastesites in Hanford in Washington, the \nIdaho site, and also Savannah River in South Carolina. This program \nthat has been put in place is a waste and incidental reprocessing \ncommonly referred to as WIR in this debate.\n  First of all, I compliment Jesse Roberson with the Department of \nEnergy. She was instrumental in getting Rocky Flats cleared up ahead of \ntime. We are a little bit ahead of schedule. We are under budget. We \nhave a huge savings in Rocky Flats because of a plan she put in place \nto accelerate cleanup, as much as $10 billion savings over time because \nof her plan she helped put in place, consulting with a lot of people in \nRocky Flats. She had the capability of working with local elected \nofficials, the employees, and with the congressional delegation to get \nthings like that to happen.\n  Obviously, everyone--the employees, the local leaders from those \ncommunities around Rocky Flats--played a role, but she was the focal \npoint that made all that come together. She is the one who has been \nworking on this issue to enhance and speed up cleanup on these \nparticular nuclear sites. They create some very special problems, very \ndifficult problems. I commend her for being willing to think outside \nthe box and for the tremendous leadership she has shown in that regard.\n  I will talk a little bit about the classification of waste, then \nabout the fact that we did have hearings, then also about how we have \nreached out. The proper disposal plan is to leave things in place there \nat Hanford and Idaho, for example.\n\n  Here is the issue as I see it, regarding proper classification. We \ncan get all tied up in terminology, but the point is, what happens to \nthe level of radiation? All these wastes are based on the amount of \nnuclear radiation. The fact is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission rating \nis as low-level waste. This is based on good, scientific evidence.\n  DOE is relying on three key points in classifying the residue as low-\nlevel waste. The first point is DOE has removed the vast bulk of the \nmobile radionuclides that were originally in the tanks; No. 2, that it \nhas solidified and stabilized the remaining radionuclides by using a \ngrout that chemically binds them so as to further limit their mobility; \nand No. 3, that the stabilized residues meet performance standards \nspecified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for disposal of low-\nlevel waste.\n  DOE performance assessment shows the residue will produce an annual \ndose of radioactivity below the Environmental Protection Agency \ndrinking water standard and well below what a person gets from a \nstandard X-ray machine when you go into the doctor's office and get an \nX-ray, and that the radioactive dose to an inadvertent intruder will be \nminimal. Therefore, the residues meet the NRC's low-level waste \nstandards.\n  None of this relies on dilution of the residues but, rather, it \nrelies on classifying the stabilized residues in accordance with the \nrisks they present in a manner consistent with the NRC performance \nstandards which the NRC has specifically identified as the key \nconsideration in classifying this waste.\n  The Department of Energy has been very responsible in what they have \nbeen doing. I am very disappointed the court decision has upset this. \nPrior to the court decision, it has been my understanding, the State of \nWashington, the State of Idaho, and the State of North Carolina all \nagreed on a plan with the DOE for the waste and incidental reprocessing \nplan. The court case gets filed, they file a friend-of-the-court brief, \nand everything begins to fall apart.\n  Initially, the State of Washington, the State of Idaho, under RCRA, \nwere working with the Department of Energy, and nationally under the \nClean Water Act, the State of South Carolina was working with DOE. Now \nthe State of South Carolina is ready to move forward. The other two \nStates feel they cannot move forward on this issue. I think it is \nterrible we would tie up their plans because of problems we have in the \nother two States. We have to work out something that is fair. We do \nneed to work out something that is fair to all the States.\n\n  The Senator from Washington wants to completely demolish these tanks \nand move them out. What she did not talk about is the risk of going \ndown into those tanks and cleaning them out before you demolish them. \nAs a worker, I am not sure I want to go down there. I think that is a \nsafety hazard beyond comprehension. I do not think anybody is thinking \nabout these aspects of it.\n  I think what the Department of Energy has come out with, with the \ngrout, is going to immediately seal the leaking tanks so we are not \ngoing to have any more pollution. If things don't continue, they are \ngoing to continue to pour into the Columbia River in Washington. So I \nthink they have come up with a commonsense solution.\n  We have had two public hearings in the committee. I have the \ntranscript here. We had one public hearing on February, 25, 2004, and \nwe had the other public hearing on March 23, 2004. We talked about the \nWIR issue and how to best resolve it.\n  I would also point out for my colleagues, there has been built at \nHanford a low-level waste disposal area. So this is not new, leaving \nlow-level waste in Hanford. I think we need to move forward in a very \npractical way.\n  I will have more to say about this when we get back into debate on \nthe armed services bill and we have the Lindsey Graham amendment before \nus again. These are a few things I wanted to begin to address this \nmorning.\n  Mr. President, I yield floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka and Mr. Durbin pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2475 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                  Dedication of World War II Memorial\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before my distinguished colleague departs, \na little later this morning I am going to talk about the agenda of the \nforthcoming ceremonies regarding the dedication of the World War II \nMemorial. The distinguished Senator from Hawaii, both Senators in fact, \nserved in our military during World War II. My recollection is one \nSenator went to the European theater; that is, Senator Inouye, and this \ndistinguished Senator went to the Pacific theater. I thank him for his \nparticipation in this memorial. It was first legislated in the Congress \nand then through the years, when Senator Dole and others were involved \nin raising non-Federal funds, close to $100 million, to erect the \nmagnificent memorial which will be dedicated a week from tomorrow. I \nwanted to thank him first for his service on the Armed Services \nCommittee, his enormous interest in the men and women in the Armed \nForces, and in our national security.\n  I have great recollections of when he and I went down with Senator \nDole the other day to the memorial.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. He has \nbeen a great leader in our country for our Armed Forces. He has served \nour country well. He has been a Secretary of the Navy, now chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee. I tell him, as one member of that \ncommittee, that I respect what he is doing. He is doing a great job for \nthe country. He has been up with the sensitive issues that our country \nfaces and has called these hearings that have been very important in \nclarifying what is happening with our armed services in Iraq and around \nthe world. I commend him highly for what he is doing. I thank him for \nall of that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. The hearings, yes, they were \nimportant. We had 100-percent attendance at the three hearings; perhaps \none Senator here and there for a while had to depart. It showed \nbipartisan, tremendous interest, assuming responsibility on behalf of \nthe institution of the United States, our committee developing the \nfacts. It is extremely important because it displayed to the world, \nparticularly the Muslim and Arab world, how America works openly to \naddress its problems to hold those responsible accountable. It is a \nprocess that has been begun by the Department of Defense, specifically \nthe Department of the Army. I thank Senator Akaka for his participation \nin those hearings.\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\n  I rose primarily to say that a week from Saturday will be an \nimportant day to both of us. My service in World War II was very modest \ncompared to those of the others. I was simply in a training command, \nready to go into the Pacific theater where the Senator from Hawaii was \nalready present. Who knows, I might have been his replacement so he \ncould come on home. Fortunately, the war ended for both of us. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  My distinguished colleague from Michigan is on other matters. \nTherefore, until he joins me, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Supporting The Bush Administration\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \nremarkable record of leadership and achievement we have seen from this \nadministration over the past 3 years in keeping America prosperous, \nsafe, and secure. During this time our Nation and our President have \nconfronted a series of crises and challenges that I believe are \nunmatched during any administration in recent history. Whether the \nchallenge has been to our economic, social, or national security, \nPresident Bush has demonstrated courage, vision, and decisiveness in \naddressing these threats and challenges.\n  At the outset of his term in office the President faced a significant \nthreat to our economic security requiring immediate action. On January \n20, 2001, the day President Bush was sworn into office, our economy was \nseveral months into a recession, what I call the ``Clinton recession.'' \nLater, over the next few months, America faced extraordinary adversity \nfrom the terrorist attacks of 9/11. This devastating event, combined \nwith the unprecedented crises in corporate governance and \naccountability, demanded action on numerous levels. The President acted \nswiftly and decisively by securing from the Congress a series of tax \ncuts to stimulate business investment, preserve consumer confidence, \nand expand today's economic recovery into lasting prosperity for all \nAmericans.\n  The President's actions averted disaster. We experienced one of the \nshortest and shallowest recessions of modern American history. By all \naccounts, the economy is on very solid footing now because of the \nPresident's actions.\n  For example, today we see 10 consecutive quarters of strong economic \ngrowth relative to gross domestic product. In fact, our economy \naveraged an annualized 5.5 percent growth over the last 3 quarters, the \nstrongest three-quarter performance in 20 years. Manufacturing activity \nis rebounding. Since this time last year, the United States has led all \nmajor economies of the world with the highest manufacturing output \nexpansion. This is in addition to our service economy, which also \ncontinues to outperform every other service economy around the globe. \nRecent corporate earnings reports are bullish, and investor confidence \nis rebounding, reflected by the 35 to 50 percent gains in major market \nindices since the fall of 2002. This includes a $4 trillion increase in \nthe total market capitalization of the New York Stock Exchange. \nInflation remains low by historical standards, at or below a very \nmanageable 3 percent annual rate. Business investment is rising \nsteadily, fueled largely by double-digit growth in equipment and \nsoftware spending, and by growing inventory investment. Consumer \nspending growth is accelerating due to real gains in wages, salaries, \nand in disposable personal income, boosted largely by lower taxes. And, \nresidential construction spending remains strong, and as of March 2004, \nboth existing and new home sales accelerated to record levels. This \ntranslates into the highest national homeownership rate in our Nation's \nhistory, a record 69 percent.\n  Moreover, looking at the lagging indicator of job creation, recent \ndata from the Bureau of Labor Statistics now confirm the recovery. The \npayroll survey shows over a million jobs created over the past 8 \nmonths.\n  More importantly, the household survey, which is not often cited in \nthe public media, shows that over 2 million new jobs have been created \nsince November 2001, when the ``Clinton'' recession was finally \nreversed. Just in the last 2 months, more than 600,000 new jobs have \nbeen created.\n  The President now faces new economic challenges, this time from many \nMembers on the other side of the aisle who believe we need to undo \nPresident Bush's tax cuts. As we move closer to the November \nPresidential election, the political rhetoric from the other side is \ntrying to convince us that the economy is much worse off than the facts \ndemonstrate. Reversing the Bush tax cuts, as the Democrats propose, \nwill only serve to reverse the economic growth we are now experiencing \nand that we project through the decade. We must all support the \nPresident in fending off increased ``tax-and-spend'' proposals.\n  This President has also recognized and acted decisively to turn back \nsignificant threats to our families and our values. I believe the \nprevious administration neglected several major challenges to the \nsecurity of our seniors, our families, and our children. President \nBush, on the other hand, is moving aggressively and decisively to \ndefeat these challenges and make our families more secure.\n  Our senior citizens are threatened by increasing health care costs \nand limited access to affordable medicines they need. The President \ndeveloped and enacted historic Medicare modernization and prescription \ndrug reforms. These initiatives enable seniors to get the medicines \nthey need at discounted prices, and expand freedom for Americans to \nchoose among healthcare providers and plans based on their individual \nneeds. Further, the President's action makes sure low-income seniors \nreceive additional financial assistance so they will not have to pay \nmore to receive better benefits than they currently do under Medicare.\n  Our families, more specifically the parents, are under assault by \nactivist courts around the country undermining the sanctity of \nmarriage. Not only are these courts overstepping their constitutional \nauthority, but also they are trampling fundamental values and \ninstitutions held dear by the vast majority of Americans. The President \nstepped forward and joined several of us from the Congress to put down \nthis assault decisively. While I do not take the amending of the \nconstitution lightly, the proposed Constitutional amendment is our only \nrecourse in preserving marriage in the United States as the union of \nonly a man and a woman.\n  Dumbed-down educational standards and sub-par learning institutions \nthreaten the well-being and development of our children. The President \nbrought forward another major reform with his No Child Left Behind \ninitiative to instill higher, modern standards for performance in \nreading and math. The President has increased education spending nearly \n25 percent over his predecessor--an $11 billion increase. This includes \nan increase of more than 30 percent for disadvantaged student programs, \nas well as tripling resources for effective reading programs for our \nyouth.\n  Moreover, the President's leadership restores to local officials the \npower and resources to establish programs and practices that work in \ntheir respective communities.\n  Again, another example of extraordinary leadership backed by \nresources, compassion, and commitment. The President has been nothing \nbut visionary and steadfast in protecting our families and our way of \nlife.\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\n  Today, the President is leading our Nation through another major \ncrisis in the fight against Muslim extremists seeking to destroy our \npeople, our livelihoods, and our liberties at home and abroad. We are a \nNation at war--a global war on terror. This is not a war we started, \nbut a war we will finish.\n  Unlike his predecessor, President Bush has demonstrated to this \nNation, indeed to the world, that he has the vision, the courage, and \nthe fortitude to lead a global coalition to fight this enemy whenever \nand wherever is needed. The President will not shirk his duties to \nguarantee the safety and security of Americans or freedom-loving \npeoples around the globe.\n  The enemy in this war did not mysteriously appear for the first time \non September 11, 2001. Rather, this enemy has been consistently \nattacking the United States for over two decades. Unfortunately, over \nthis period of time, our country's response to this growing threat was \nentirely inadequate, inconsistent, and inexcusable. Let me describe for \nyou the evolution of our enemy in this global war on terror.\n  In 1979, a band of Islamic fundamentalists, led by the Ayatollah \nKhomeini, successfully overthrew the Shah's government of Iran as \nAmerica stood by and watched. Nearly a year later, these \nfundamentalists stormed the U.S. Embassy and took the American staff \nhostage for 444 days. President Carter's response at the time: cancel \nIranian travel visas and seek UN diplomatic assistance.\n  In 1982, Muslim extremists bombed our Embassy in Beirut. The U.S. did \nnot respond against the extremists. Six months later, the extremists \nbombed the U.S. marines' barracks and 241 U.S. servicemen were killed \nand another 80 were seriously wounded. This time, the U.S. response \ncame from the Democratic-controlled Congress in the form of a \nresolution to withdraw all troops from the area. Unfortunately, as the \n1983 presidential election drew near, President Reagan acquiesced. \nThere was, and remains, an important lesson to be learned here for all \nMembers of this body: our enemy perceives vulnerability during U.S. \npresidential election years. During this time we must redouble our \nvigilance and resist the internal sniping for mere political \nexpediency.\n  In 1985, Muslim extremists hijacked an Italian cruise ship, the \nAchille Lauro. In a specific act of defiance toward the United States, \nthe terrorists murdered 69-year-old Leon Klinghoffer, tossing his dead \nbody and wheelchair overboard into the sea. The terrorists were offered \na deal by ``our allies'' for safe passage by ending the hijacking. When \nthe hijackers were traveling to their new destination, President Reagan \nlaunched our military fighters to intercept and redirect their airliner \nto Sicily, Italy. After a few years in prison, the Italians set them \nfree. The Muslim extremists then took up sanctuary with Saddam Hussein \nin Iraq.\n  In 1986, Muslim extremists affiliated with Libya's Colonel Qadhafi \nbombed a West Berlin nightclub frequented by American servicemen. Two \nAmerican soldiers were killed. Ten days later, President Reagan \nauthorized an air strike in Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya, from bases in \nEngland. The mission was somewhat complicated by the French denying us \nuse of their airspace during the mission.\n  In 1988, Muslim extremists, again sanctioned by the Libyan \ngovernment, destroyed Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. No \ndirect action was taken by either the U.S. or British governments.\n  In 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded oil-rich Kuwait. President George \nHerbert Walker Bush moved U.S. forces quickly to block further Iraqi \nadvances while mobilizing a large international coalition force that \nultimately expelled a decimated Iraqi military from Kuwait. Most \nDemocrats in Congress voted against this use of force. Now, many of the \nsame are saying that we did not go far enough at that time.\n  One of our key allies during the 1991 Gulf War was the Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia. Following hostilities, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia forged \ncloser military, economic, and political relations. One wealthy Saudi \nextremist took exception to this relationship and vowed to ``wage war \nagainst the American crusaders.'' This Saudi's name was Osama bin \nLaden.\n  From that point forward, we have been victimized by a string of \ndirect attacks by bin Laden's al-Qaida network--both at home and \nabroad.\n  In 1993, al-Qaida exploded bombs in the garage of the World Trade \nCenter towers, killing 5 Americans and injuring hundreds. President \nClinton, at this time being advised by national security staff official \nRichard Clarke, did nothing in response.\n  Later in 1993, 18 American soldiers were killed in Somalia, and the \nbody of one soldier was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu before \na cheering band of Somalis and al-Qaida. President Clinton's immediate \nresponse was the withdrawal of all troops from Somalia. No action was \ntaken against those responsible. ABC News reported Osama bin Laden \nsaying that al-Qaida soldiers:\n\n     realized more than before that the American soldier was a \n     paper tiger and after a few blows ran in shame and disgrace.\n\n  In 1995, in Saudi Arabia, al-Qaida killed 5 and injured 30 Americans \nin a homicide bomb attack. A few months later, homicide car-bombers \nattacked U.S. military facilities at the Khobar Towers, killing 19 and \ninjuring nearly 500 Americans. The perpetrators of these cowardly \nattacks all escaped. The U.S. did not respond.\n  In 1998, al-Qaida bombed the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, \nkilling 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injuring over 5,400 in \nall. The U.S. did not respond.\n  In 2000, al-Qaida bombed the USS Cole, killing 17 and wounding \nanother couple dozen of American sailors. The U.S. did not respond.\n  Over the course of these 7 years, al-Qaida carried out multiple \nattacks against the United States. As the current National Security \nAdvisor recently testified, it was clear that ``the enemy was at war \nwith the United States.'' However, President Clinton, and his top \ncounter-terrorist advisor Richard Clarke, did not go to war with the \nenemy.\n  It is reasonable to conclude that our failed history to deal promptly \nand decisively with al-Qaida, at any point during this period, only \nserved to embolden Bin Laden and his criminal band of extremists.\n  Perhaps our failure emboldened others in the same way. During the \nlatter part of the 1990s, Saddam Hussein began a campaign of actions \nincreasingly more defiant of U.S. and UN imposed sanctions.\n  In 1996, Saddam unleashed his forces on the Kurdish city of Erbil \ndestroying U.S.-sponsored resistance organizations and executing U.S.-\nbacked resistance fighters. In 1997, Hussein bullied UN inspectors, \npreventing them from performing their mission. He also threatened to \nshoot down American surveillance planes aiding the inspection program.\n  In 1998, President Clinton threatened to bomb Iraq, but he did not \nfollow through after the United Nations urged restraint. Later that \nyear, Hussein kicked the UN inspectors out of Iraq all together. Over \nthe next several years, Iraqi air defense units repeatedly shot at our \nmilitary aircraft enforcing the UN sanctioned ``no fly'' zones.\n  On more than one occasion, President Clinton launched limited, and \narguably ineffective, aircraft and cruise missile strikes in Iraq to no \navail.\n  By the time President Bush took office in 2001, the determination and \nsophistication of our enemies were already well established. \nUnfortunately, our reputation of standing up to these criminal terror \norganizations and despots had decayed to a dangerous level.\n  President Bush immediately set forth new policy and strategies, \nscrapping the ``containment'' policy in favor of a more comprehensive \nand decisive course of action to eliminate the al-Qaida enemy \ncompletely. The horrendous events of 9/11, barely seven months into his \nadministration, demanded urgent and unambiguous action from the \nPresident. Without hesitation, President Bush directed his cabinet to \nprepare a decisive response against the murderous al-Qaida \norganization, including terrorist affiliates, and those foreign \ngovernments that sponsor and shelter the terrorists.\n  As I said earlier, we didn't start this war--the global war on terror \nbut we are going to finish it. Under President Bush's leadership over \nthe past two-plus years, the United States has dealt a crippling blow \nto world terror organizations. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld summarized \nit best for us earlier this year when he reported that our armed forces \nhave overthrown two terrorist regimes, rescued two nations, and \nliberated some 50 million people; captured\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\nor killed close to two-thirds of known senior al-Qaida operatives; \ncaptured or killed 45 of the 55 most wanted in Iraq, including Iraq's \ndeposed dictator, Saddam Hussein; hunted down thousands of terrorists \nand regime remnants in Afghanistan and Iraq; disrupted terrorist cells \non most continents; and likely prevented a number of planned attacks. \nThis is an astounding record of accomplishment for our commander-in-\nchief, his national security staff, and the phenomenal men and women of \nour military services.\n  I believe we are already seeing huge dividends from our actions in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. We have demonstrated to the Middle East \nregion, and indeed to the world, that the U.S. is willing to go to war \nover weapons of mass destruction, even at the risk of significant loss \nof life. This action sent an extraordinarily powerful message to all--\nthere will be significant consequences of possessing, or attempting to \nacquire, weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. This \nincreased risk perception among potential adversaries, or threat of \nU.S. action, is now opening the door to diplomatic action to roll back \nillicit weapons and ballistic missile development programs.\n  This is evident in Libya, where Colonel Qadhafi is now voluntarily \nturning over his weapons and secrets to the United Kingdom and United \nStates intelligence officers. It turns out that Egypt was a major \nsupplier to Libya, so now Egypt is getting out of the ballistic missile \ntrade as well. This is evident in Syria, which is now engaged with U.S. \nDefense and State Department officials in divesting its ballistic \nmissile enhancement programs while secretly trying to relocate their \nballistic missile inventory in neighboring countries. Further, this is \nevident in Iran, which has now ``come clean'' in reporting its military \nnuclear programs and is opening up to more stringent inspections.\n  We are seeing encouraging results with the decline of trans-national \nterrorism as well. Recently, the U.S. State Department released its \nannual report on Patterns of Global Terrorism, prepared by the Office \nof the Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism. The findings and conclusions \nare promising and further evidence that President Bush's vision and \ndecisiveness are bringing about positive change.\n  For example, in 2001, during the President's first year in office, \nthere were 346 terrorist attacks world-wide. In 2003, that number was \ndown to 190--a 45% reduction in just two years. In 2001, there were 219 \nanti-U.S. attacks worldwide. In 2003, there were 82--a 62% reduction in \njust two years.\n  I believe these dramatic results are a direct result of George Bush's \ndecision to declare war--not declare a police action or declare a \nnegotiating strategy--but a global war against terrorists and those who \nharbor them. U.S.-led efforts are successfully attacking terrorists' \ntraining facilities, hideouts, weapons centers, financial institutions, \nand travel and logistics routes. Of course, this is in addition to our \nrecent destruction of the two largest terrorist-sponsoring regimes in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  However, we cannot rest on our laurels. The war continues. We must \ncapture or destroy Osama bin Laden and his comrades-in-hiding. We must \ndefeat the terror and criminal elements that continue to kill \nindiscriminately in Iraq. We must finish the reconstruction of the \npolitical and municipal infrastructure for both the Afghani and Iraqi \npeople. We are on the verge of seeing new democracies take root, \noffering the promise of lasting peace and stability for this region \nthat has grown accustomed to tyranny after decades of oppression and \nterror.\n  Equally important, we must continue the offensive against other \nMuslim extremist organizations around the globe, denying these \npotential killers the opportunity to plan, prepare, or execute further \nacts of terror. President Bush is the visionary, the proven leader, and \nthe commander-in-chief who will see this through and keep America safe \nand secure.\n  The facts are in. The results are conclusive. We are winning the war \nagainst terror with persistence and will. We are keeping America \nprosperous with pro-growth tax and business policies. We are enriching \nour families with commonsense social and educational reforms. I believe \nmost Americans recognize this record of extraordinary accomplishment. \nAnd I believe that Americans are extremely proud of the leadership, \ncourage, commitment, and results of President George W. Bush.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the pending business is the Defense \nbill, but to accommodate Senators for matters that are not directly \nrelated, Senator Levin and I are perfectly willing to have other \nspeakers.\n  I see my distinguished colleague, the Senator from North Dakota. How \nmuch time does the Senator desire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me request 10 minutes in morning \nbusiness. If I see the Senator from Virginia desiring the floor, I \ncertainly will not continue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Go right ahead for 10 minutes.\n  Whatever flexibility the Senator may desire, Senator Levin and I are \npleased to accommodate the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                               Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this week the Congress and the White \nHouse have spent a fair amount of time talking about the subject of \ngasoline prices. Gas prices are now averaging over $2 a gallon across \nthe country. It is a serious problem for American families, for \nAmerican businesses, and for industries such as the airlines. I will \ntalk a bit about that.\n  Elbows and wrists and hands are nearly out of joint from every side \nof the political spectrum pointing fingers during the last week about \nwho is responsible for this or that or the other thing, who is \nresponsible for high oil prices. That is counterproductive.\n  However, we cannot, all of us, decide that this is not happening on \nour watch. It is. We cannot decide that it is not of consequence. It \ncertainly is of great consequence to our country, to our economy, and \nto American families.\n  I pulled up behind an old Chevrolet one day at a 40A stop in North \nDakota some while ago. This 15- or 20-year-old Chevrolet had a bumper \nsticker on the back bumper, half of which was sort of tilted downward \nfrom previous beatings. The bumper sticker said ``I fought the gas war \nand gas won.''\n  I thought to myself, that is a prophetic bumper sticker. It is hard \nto fight a gas war and win when we have all of these events conspired \nagainst us. We have OPEC countries that control a substantial amount of \nproduct which have formed a cartel and they decide what they are \npumping and what they will send to the oil pipelines around the world.\n  In addition to that, the oil companies themselves have gotten bigger \nand bigger and bigger, behemoth companies that control substantial \namounts of product.\n  Then we have the consumer at the end of the line. They take the gas \nhose out of the socket at the gas station, they put it in the gas tank \nand start pumping, and there is not a thing they can do except pay the \nprice, whatever the price is.\n  Why is this important, especially for rural States? I come from a \nrural State in this country. In rural States, we drive a lot more. We \nuse a lot more fuel. I come from a State that is 10 times the size of \nMassachusetts in landmass. North Dakota is 10 Massachusetts in \nlandmass. Yet we have 642,000 people spread out in that big old \nlandmass. It is not much of anything to drive 50 miles or 100 miles or \n200 miles to do a piece of business or to see relatives. Do that on the \neast coast, and they want to pack a tent in case they have trouble \ndriving 50 miles.\n\n  But in our State we drive a lot, and we have a farming industry that \nuses a lot of fuel. So in the State of North Dakota, for example, per \ncapita, we use twice as much gasoline as they would in New York per \ncapita. That means\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nthe burden of these increased gas prices is double in a rural State \nsuch as ours what it is on other drivers in some of the more populous \nStates where they use less and drive less.\n  I am not saying all Americans are not having problems pulling up to \nthe gas pump and paying $2 a gallon, but I am saying this especially \nhurts rural States whose consumers per person pay a much higher amount \nof the gas tax because they use more gasoline.\n  So what do we do about all this? Well, we can do as we have done for \nthe last week or two, and keep pointing back and forth, or we can \ndecide to take some action. A couple obvious things we ought to do are: \nOne, we are putting nearly 150,000 barrels of oil a day underground in \nLouisiana in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that is 96-percent full. I \nsupport what is called SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We ought \nto have that in case of an international problem, a national emergency. \nThat is why we are putting that oil away. But in times of tight \nsupplies, when the price of gasoline has gone to $2 a gallon, it makes \nno sense to take 150,000 barrels off the supply and put it underground \nin Louisiana.\n  Step one, I think the President ought to immediately--right now, \ntoday--stop that. That will add to supply, take some of the pressure \noff increasing prices. That ought to happen now--right now.\n  Second, there is a meeting this week in Amsterdam. The Secretary of \nEnergy is going to Amsterdam. We need to jawbone--really jawbone--the \nOPEC countries and say to them: You need to increase production during \nthis intermittent period. During this summer period, you need to \nincrease production, get more oil into that pipeline.\n  The Saudis have called for that. But I must say, the Saudis have also \nbeen part of the problem in the past. When you have the amount of oil \nthat is controlled by a few countries, which control a substantial \namount of the oil in this world, and they make decisions about supply, \nit can have a profound impact on this country.\n  We ought to have, immediately, the President jawboning these OPEC \ncountries. The Secretary of Energy ought to apply diplomatic pressure \nto these countries to say we need additional oil in that pipeline now.\n  Let me also say this. This is about the tenth wake-up call we have \nhad on this issue of being held hostage to the OPEC countries. We get \nmuch of our oil to fuel the American economy from very troubled parts \nof the world. God forbid some morning we wake up and terrorists have \nsevered the oil pipelines that send a substantial amount of oil to our \ncountry and our economy becomes flat on its back.\n  We need to understand this cannot work. Sixty percent of the oil we \nneed to run this country's economy comes from off our shores, and much \nof it from very troubled parts of the world.\n  We need a project--I don't care; I call it an ``Apollo'' project, \nsome call it a ``Manhattan'' project--we need a project that says: In \nthe coming years we need to find a way to stop running gasoline through \nAmerican carburetors. We have been driving cars for 100 years, and 100 \nyears ago, you pulled up to a gas pump and put gasoline in your car the \nsame way you do with a 2004 Ford or a 2002 Chevy. Nothing has changed. \nNew cars are fueled the same way old cars were fueled. Nothing has \nchanged in a century.\n\n  Everything about us has changed except we are still dependent, we \nstill have this addiction to oil that comes from the OPEC countries. \nWhy? Because we need to run it through a carburetor someplace in order \nto make our car go.\n  Well, look, hydrogen fuel cells are in our future. Do you know what \nyou put out the tailpipe of a hydrogen fuel-cell car? Water vapor. You \ndon't pollute the air. You put water vapor out the tailpipe. You have \ntwice the effective power going to the wheels with hydrogen fuel cells. \nWhy aren't we doing it? Because this country has not ratcheted up the \nenergy and the decision to say, on a ``Manhattan'' project basis or an \n``Apollo'' project basis: We are going to do this.\n  This ought to be equivalent to saying we are going to send a person \nto the moon. But somehow we are not there. So we need to take short-\nterm steps and longer term steps, but we need to understand this is \nurgent, this is an emergency.\n  There are few things as important to this country as an energy policy \nthat works, one that incentivizes production, one that provides for \nconservation, one that provides for renewable forms of energy, greater \nefficiency of all the things we use in our daily lives.\n  While I do not want to point the finger here today, I do want to say \nthat which I have heard all week is a little disturbing. The White \nHouse spokesman comes out every day and says: Well, the problem is down \nthere. They did not pass an energy bill. Well, everyone knows why we \ndid not pass an energy bill. It failed by 2 votes in the Senate. We did \nnot pass an energy bill because of a pernicious provision put in that \nbill, put in by the majority leader of the House, which he knew would \nderail that bill in the Senate, providing a retroactive waiver of \nliability for MTBE.\n  That provision was put in in a manner that he knew would cause the \nEnergy bill to fail in the Senate. So that yoke of responsibility ought \nto lay where it is appropriate, in my judgment.\n\n\n                              Partisanship\n\n  Madam President, I have been talking about gasoline and gasoline \nprices. We have a lot of challenges in our lives at the moment. We have \na war in Iraq. We have a continuing war in Afghanistan. We have a range \nof both domestic and international issues that require our attention.\n  I was distressed yesterday to read in a newspaper a little piece that \nkind of describes the dilemma we have. We have this problem, and the \nproblem is an incessant amount of partisanship around here. We have \npeople who come to this town and say: We are going to bring people \ntogether. I see no evidence of it. The suggestion is the only way we \ncan do business is to have one party do it, and exclude the other \nparty.\n  We made some progress this week. It is interesting, the highway bill \nis a very important piece of legislation for our country. It should \nhave been done last year. It was not. It is going to be done this year, \nI hope. Only yesterday we appointed conferees.\n\n  I want to show you what bothered me yesterday about all of that. \nQuoting the article, it says:\n\n     . . . conservative leaders said the White House and the \n     Senate leadership committed a tactical error by compromising \n     with Daschle, which they say has undermined what had been \n     their strategy on judges. . . .\n\n  The spokesperson, Connie Mackey, is the vice president of government \naffairs at the Family Research Council.\n\n       ``We don't see the point,'' said Mackey, who declined to \n     discuss the specifics of the meeting. ``The strategy all \n     along has been to show the obstructionist tactics of the \n     Democrats. [Now] we've lost that tactic.''\n\n  What are we going to do? Our goal has been to be able to call \nsomebody obstructionist, but all of a sudden we have this cooperation \ngoing on, and we have lost this ability. What are we going to do?\n  This describes the rancid partisanship that exists around here, and I \nhope it will stop.\n  My colleague, Senator Warner from Virginia--I don't know that I have \never heard anyone ever call him partisan. He and my colleague from \nMichigan, who bring this bill to the floor of the Senate to manage, are \nmodels of what we ought to do in this Congress, in this Senate.\n  The Senate is almost evenly divided. So is the House. This President \nwon by a whisker in 2000. So we have a divided Government, almost right \ndown the middle. And those who suggest that what we ought to do, in \nterms of the way we run things around here, is to have the majority \nparty decide what happens, and then say to the minority party, you do \nnot count, you are excluded, get lost--which is what happened all of \nlast year, by the way, in these conferences; we appoint conferees, and \nthen we are told the Democrats are not welcome to participate in the \nconferences, despite the fact they were a conferee--the fact is, we \nneed to do better than that. This country deserves the best of what all \nof us have to offer, the best of what both parties can offer, instead \nof the worst of what each will offer.\n  There is a lot to be gained, it seems to me, by bipartisanship, by \nworking together, by deciding that good ideas are not the exclusive \nproperty of whatever party is in the majority at the moment. There is a \nlot to be gained by that. My hope is what happened yesterday is the \nfirst step of a long trail of\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\nbipartisanship and the first step in developing consensus on issues, in \nwhich we all understand we are serving the same interests.\n  We want what is best for our country. But there are some--there are \nsome--who have no interest in trying to find ways to work together. \nThey want open, partisan warfare.\n  I brought to the floor last week a couple of charts that showed the \norigin of that, charts an organization put together that said: Oh, by \nthe way, here is the way you do this. If you have an opponent, here is \nwhat you should say about your opponent because we have tested these \nwords. This organization, called GOPAC, said: Use words like ``liar,'' \n``sick,'' ``pathetic,'' ``traitor,'' ``treason,'' ``antichild,'' \n``antifamily,'' ``antiflag,'' when you describe your opponent. Be sure \nand use those words because we have tested them, and they work. That \nwas the kind of rancid partisan ignorance that represented the \nfoundation of what has been built for too long.\n\n  My hope is that perhaps we can reject all of that. Understanding that \nwhen a country is at war, when a country has energy problems, when a \ncountry has fiscal policy problems, that it makes good sense to get the \nbest of what Republicans have to offer and the best of what Democrats \nhave to offer and form a consensus to govern and achieve the goals that \nall of us aspire to. That is what the American people expect. I don't \nthink aggressive debate at all hinders or hurts this country. In fact, \nI think it strengthens us. But aggressive partisanship, having as a \ngoal not just winning but making sure the other side is destined to \nlose, that does hurt this country.\n  My hope is that yesterday, as we created a conference for a highway \nbill which is very important--it is important in the context of jobs \nand progress for the economy--I hope that was the first step in moving \ntowards this consensus. Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, so many others \nwant to play a constructive role in good public policy. That has always \nbeen our goal. I believe this country deserves better than we have seen \nin recent months, especially in the last several years. I hope what \nhappened yesterday might put us on that road.\n  I will come back at another time and talk about the specific bill we \nare considering, the Defense authorization bill. It is very important. \nWe tried this week, Senator Lott and myself, to alter some of the base-\nclosing provisions so that we could force a responsible result in what \nwe are going to do with overseas bases first and then make a judgment \nabout domestic bases. We came up two votes short on that. But while we \nwere two votes short, there were four votes missing that we expect \nwould have voted for us. So I think there is a majority in the Senate \nwho actually support that position.\n  There are some provisions in this bill that we must have an \naggressive and full debate on. They have to do with the authorization \nof the spending of money to begin producing a new category of nuclear \nweapons, low-yield, bunker-buster, earth-penetrator nuclear weapons. A \nseries of discussions need to be held, aggressive discussions around \nthat subject. Should we begin developing new nuclear weapons with the \nunderstanding that they are just like other weapons and perfectly \nusable tactically? I don't believe that is the case, but some in this \nChamber do believe that we just ought to have nuclear weapons available \nso we can drop one of them on a cave someplace, and if Osama bin Laden \nis holed up in the cave, we can deal with him with a nuclear weapon.\n  Our goal as a nuclear power needs to be to try to make certain that \nnever again is a nuclear weapon used in anger, and our job as a leader \nis to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries that don't \nnow have them and try to find a way to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons that exist. Some 30,000 nuclear weapons now exist. The absence \nof one of them, the stealing of one nuclear weapon or the access to one \nnuclear weapon by a terrorist would make 9/11 seem small by comparison \nin terms of what a nuclear weapon could do in the hands of a terrorist.\n  This is a provision about which I speak more. It is an important \nprovision, one I would like to see removed in support of an amendment \nto be offered by one of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not. We are on the bill.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Memorial Day\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, as we approach Memorial Day, it touches \nus all as an important moment. This is the first Memorial Day for \nhundreds of American families who have recently lost loved ones in the \nMiddle East. For others, it is the first such day for families of \nveterans of World War II and other conflicts who have passed away \nduring the last year.\n  My father-in-law Bob Casserly passed away a few weeks ago. He was one \nof four brothers. They all signed up, served in World War II, four \nboys. Bob was the youngest. They all made it home. He is the first of \nthat family and that generation to pass away. How deeply significant \nand necessary it is for us to pause here and honor their precious gift \nof sacrifice for the lives we get to enjoy and they don't.\n  One of the poet's wrote that ``God gave us memory that we might have \nroses in December.'' We remember the brave and strong young lives that \nwere lost to give strength and courage to our own lives.\n  As all of my colleagues do, I travel back and forth by air from this \ncity to my home State. I see the same sight on both ends of my trip. \nArlington National Cemetery spreads out across many acres on the \nPotomac River near the airport. In the Twin Cities, Fort Snelling \nCemetery sits near the bank of the Minnesota River. You can see it as \nyou fly into the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.\n  They are both beautiful places, but they carry a staggering message. \nWe have paid an enormous price for liberty around the world. Each cross \nor monument is a person and a family and a home town. And there are \nthousands upon thousands of them.\n  I have never been there, but I am told that there is a pilgrim \ngraveyard near Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts, where the remains of the \nfirst colonists lie. Somewhere in that cemetery there is a small sign \nwhich reads, ``That which our forefathers at such a great price \nsecured, let us not idly slip away.''\n  That is the message of this Memorial Day to me. Freedom is precious \nand constantly endangered. The world is such that, as Edmund Burke \nsaid, ``the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good \nmen to do nothing.''\n  What is mind-boggling is the constant supply of good men and women \nwilling to step forward to do something.\n  Addicted as most of us are to security and convenience, it is \nastonishing that regular folks in great numbers step forward to enter \ninto a hostile environment and risk their lives. For fame? No. For \nriches? No. For vengeance? No. They do it for their country and what \nAmerica stands for.\n  As has been said many times, America will remain the ``land of the \nfree'' only so long as it is the ``home of the brave.''\n  A hundred and forty one years ago this November, Abraham Lincoln \ndedicated the cemetery at Gettysburg, PA. A large number of soldiers \nfrom the Minnesota First Volunteer Infantry Division, who had played a \ndecisive role in the battle, were buried there.\n  Lincoln spoke the heart of the whole country, and speaks our heart \ntoday, when he concluded:\n\n       It is for us, the living, to be dedicated here to the \n     unfinished business which they who fought here have thus so \n     nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be dedicated to the \n     great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead \n     we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave \n     the last full measure of devotion: that we here highly \n     resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that \n     this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; \n     and that government\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\n     of the people, by the people and for the people shall not \n     perish from the earth.\n\n  We in Minnesota especially grieve with the families who have lost \nyoung men in the conflict in Iraq. They join a long, brave column of \npatriots who laid down their lives. We can never repay the debt we owe \nthem. But we dare not forget them, or fail to recognize their \nextraordinary service.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Patrick Dorff of Elk River, on the banks of the \nMississippi. He died in Iraq on January 25, 2003. He was 32 years old. \nHe died trying to rescue a fellow soldier from a patrol boat that had \ncapsized in the Tigris River.\n  He left behind a wife, a daughter, his parents and siblings in Elk \nRiver.\n  From an early age, he always wanted to fly. He brought his passion to \nhis military service. He called himself a ``sky cop'' over Iraq. Who \nknows how many lives he saved by providing air support.\n  He was a great man. Now he is a great hero.\n  SSG Brian Hellerman was from Freeport, MN, home of Charlie's Cafe. He \nwas 35 when he died on August 6, 2003, in Baghdad. He lost his own dad \nas a teenager and joined the military to honor his memory. He left \nbehind a wife and two kids, who have also lost their dad. He wrote in \nan e-mail, ``I am still in because I want to provide freedom for those \nI love and care about.'' He was a great man. Now he is a great hero.\n  PFC Edward Herrgott, age 20, was from Shakopee, MN on the Minnesota \nRiver. He died the day before Independence Day last year. He was killed \nby a sniper as he guarded the Iraqi National Museum from looters. He \njoined the military to prepare for a career in law enforcement. He was \ndedicated to a keeping others safe, even if it meant putting himself in \ndanger. He was a great man. Now he is a great hero.\n  SSG Dale Panchot, 26, was from Northome, in Minnesota's north woods. \nHe died on November 17, 2003 north of Baghdad in a grenade attack. He \nwanted to be a soldier as far back as his parents could remember. He \nidolized his World War II veteran grandfather, and joined the Minnesota \nNational Guard in high school. At his funeral, the whole town came \ntogether to honor his faithful service. He was a great man. Now he is a \ngreat hero.\n  LCpl Levi Angell, age 20, was from Cloquet of Minnesota's Northland \nnear Duluth. He was killed on April 8, 2004, in a rocket-propelled \ngrenade attack. He joined the Marines after graduating from high \nschool. He completed a tour in Kuwait and then volunteered to be \nredeployed to the region. He leaves behind his parents and eight \nbrothers and sisters. He was a great man. Now he is a great hero.\n  Cpl Tyler Fey, aged 22, was from Eden Prairie in the Southwest area \nof the Twin Cities. He died on April 4, 2004, in Anbar Province, west \nof Baghdad. He was a combat engineer and a proud soldier who served 2 \ntours in Iraq. He was remembered as a kind and loveable person by his \nfriends at Holy Angels High School in Richfield, MN. He was a great \nman. Now he is a great hero.\n  PFC Moises Langhorst, 19, of Moose Lake, died April 5 in Iraq. Moy, \nas he was called, aspired to a military career from a young age, \nwearing camo clothing and even driving a truck with a camouflage \npattern. A few weeks before he died, he wrote to his church, ``Between \nmy good training and my faith in God, I have noting to worry about.'' \nHe joined the Marines right out of high school with his buddy Matthew \nMilczark of Kettle River, just down the road. He was a great man. Now \nhe is a great American hero.\n  PFC Milczark, 18, died in Kuwait on March 8, six weeks before his \nfriend. He was the Moose Lake Homecoming King 2 years ago this month. \nHis grandfather and three uncles have also served in the U.S. military. \nHe was a great man. Now he is a great American hero.\n  SP James Holmes, of East Grand Forks, died in Germany on May 8 from \ninjuries he sustained in Iraq. He had suffered shrapnel wounds after an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his military vehicle while \nhe was on patrol in Baghdad. Holmes was 28. He grew up in Arizona. He \nhad been living in East Grand Forks, MN, and worked for Valley \nPetroleum across the border in Grand Forks, ND. His best friend, Howard \nMcDonald recalled, ``He felt he had a bigger part to play and answered \nthe call to duty without hesitation. He was doing exactly what he \nwanted to do, and he died with honor.'' He was a great man. Now he is a \ngreat American hero.\n  Those are 9 young men. Nine families. Nine home towns. How incredibly \nsad it is that the promise of their lives was snuffed out. But we take \ncomfort in the knowledge that they were doing what they wanted to do, \nmany of them from an early age.\n  ``Greater love has no man than this,'' the Scriptures tell us, ``than \nto lay down his life for his friends.'' Though we never knew them, they \nlaid down their lives for us. They laid down their lives for a free \nIraq and generations who will live free because of their sacrifice.\n  As we remember them and pray for them, together we hope for a new \nbirth of freedom and a time of peace in the Middle East. Thank God for \nthe memory of these and all our veterans. Thank God we live in a Nation \nof great American heroes such as these.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on behalf of the Senate leadership--both \nthe majority and minority--I am privileged to ask the Senate to act on \nresolutions relating to the World War II Memorial. It is coincidental \nthat the Presiding Officer at this time is the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina, whose husband has had an instrumental role in the \npreparation and planning of the memorial, which will be dedicated a \nweek from tomorrow, on May 29.\n  At this time, I ask that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. Res. 362 and H. Con. Res. 409, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolutions by title.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 362) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the dedication of the National World War II \n     Memorial on May 29, 2004, in recognition of the duty, \n     sacrifices, and valor of the members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States who served in World War II.\n       A resolution (H. Con. Res. 409) recognizing with humble \n     gratitude the more than 16,000,000 veterans who served in the \n     United States Armed Forces during World War II and the \n     Americans who supported the war effort on the home front and \n     celebrating the completion of the National World War II \n     Memorial on the National Mall in the District of Columbia.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolutions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the resolutions \nbe agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, en bloc, and that any statements relating to the \nresolutions be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions (S. Res. 362 and H. Con. Res. 409) were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 362), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 362\n\n       Whereas the National World War II Memorial is being \n     dedicated on Saturday, May 29, 2004, on the National Mall in \n     Washington, District of Columbia;\n       Whereas the National World War II Memorial, a monument of \n     granite and bronze, has\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\n     a fitting location on the National Mall situated between the \n     Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial and flanked by \n     memorials dedicated to the members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States who served and died in the Korean War and in \n     the Vietnam era;\n       Whereas the National World War II Memorial is dedicated to \n     the more than 16,000,000 individuals from the 48 States, the \n     District of Columbia, and the territories and possession of \n     the United States who served in the Army, Air Force, Navy, \n     Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine in World War \n     II;\n       Whereas on May 29, 2004, hundreds of thousands of veterans, \n     and their families and friends, from across the United States \n     will gather on the National Mall to join in the dedication of \n     the National World War II Memorial and to pay homage to the \n     memory of the more than 400,000 members of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States who died while serving during World War \n     II and the more than 10,000,000 veterans of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States in World War II who have died since the \n     end of World War II;\n       Whereas on May 29, 2004, the Nation will pay tribute to all \n     the members of the Armed Forces of the United States who \n     served in World War II;\n       Whereas on May 29, 2004, the Nation will remember the duty, \n     sacrifices, and valor of the members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States who served on land and sea and in the air \n     in the more than 89 campaigns conducted in the European and \n     Pacific theaters of operations in World War II;\n        Whereas on May 29, 2004, the Nation will acknowledge that \n     the men and women who served in the Armed Forces of the \n     United States in World War II came from all the States, the \n     District of Columbia, and all the territories and possessions \n     of the United States and represented men and women of all \n     races, religions, ethnic groups, professions, educational \n     attainments, and backgrounds, all united in the goal of \n     serving their Country and preserving freedom; and\n       Whereas construction of the National World War II Memorial \n     would not have been possible without the donations of \n     hundreds of thousands of individual Americans, as well as \n     corporations, foundations, veterans groups, professional and \n     fraternal organizations, communities, and schools, who all \n     acknowledged that a memorial should be constructed in the \n     National Capital to recognize and pay tribute to the duty, \n     sacrifices, and valor of all the members of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States who served in World War II: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to express the grateful thanks of the Nation to the \n     more than 16,000,000 individuals who served in the Army, Army \n     Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Merchant \n     Marine in World War II and to the millions of Americans on \n     the home front who contributed to the war effort during World \n     War II; and\n       (2) to recognize the dedication of the National World War \n     II Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, District of \n     Columbia, on May 29, 2004, as an occasion to acknowledge and \n     pay tribute to the duty, sacrifices, and valor of all the \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States who served \n     in World War II, a group known collectively as the ``Greatest \n     Generation''.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will address briefly these \nresolutions. I ask unanimous consent that I be made a cosponsor of H. \nCon. Res. 409.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. This particular resolution and preamble, in part, states \nas follows:\n\n       Recognizing with humble gratitude the more than 16,000,000 \n     veterans who served in the United States Armed Forces during \n     World War II and the Americans who supported the war effort \n     on the home front and celebrating the completion of the \n     National World War II Memorial on the National Mall in the \n     District of Columbia.\n       Whereas, the National World War II Memorial on the National \n     Mall in the District of Columbia will be the first national \n     memorial to both recognize the courage, bravery, and \n     unselfish dedication of the members of the United States \n     Armed Forces who served in World War II and those who served \n     on the home front and acknowledge the commitment and \n     achievement of the entire American people in that conflict;\n       Whereas, World War II veteran Roger Durbin of Kerkey, Ohio, \n     first proposed the construction of the National World War II \n     Memorial, and Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur of Ohio introduced \n     the legislation to establish the memorial in the District of \n     Columbia to honor members of the Armed Forces who served in \n     World War II and to commemorate the participation of the \n     United States in that war;\n       Whereas, in Public Law 103-32, approved May 25, 1993, \n     Congress authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission, \n     an independent Federal agency, to design and construct the \n     memorial.\n\n  The resolution goes on in great detail and lays out the legislative \nhistory of how this magnificent memorial came into being. Of course, it \nwill be in the Record. The last resolving clause is:\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That Congress recognizes with humble gratitude \n     the more than 16,000,000 veterans who served in the United \n     States Armed Forces during World War II and the Americans who \n     supported the war effort on the home front and celebrates the \n     completion of the National World War II Memorial on the \n     National Mall in the District of Columbia. And then action \nnow by the Senate.\n\n  I make these remarks on behalf of those Members of the Senate who \nserved in World War II--Senator Inouye, Senator Hollings, Senator \nStevens, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Akaka, and myself, all of whom \nwith humble pride have participated in this legislation through these \nmany years and joined with our former distinguished colleague, Senator \nDole, who showed absolute extraordinary leadership in this entire \nsequence of legislative steps, and particularly raising the needed \nfunds. I will address that momentarily.\n  Resolution 362 expresses the sense of the Senate on the dedication of \nthe National World War II Memorial, May 29, 2004, in recognition of the \nduty, sacrifices, and valor of members of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States who served in World War II. The resolution goes on to lay \nout, again, other aspects of the legislative history and the role of \nthe Congress and others in this magnificent memorial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6064-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6064-S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AUTHORIZING USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, lastly, the other matter that is before \nthe Senate is H. Con. Res. 423, a resolution authorizing the Capitol \nGrounds to be used for a public event providing additional space in \nconjunction with the dedication of the National World War II Memorial \non May 29, 2004, and such other dates that the Speaker of the House and \nrepresentatives of the Committee on Rules and Administration of the \nSenate may designate.\n  It is a very wise step to try to help in some way the extraordinary \nturnout in response of veterans who will be coming to the Nation's \nCapitol to be present at the memorial dedication, but for reasons of \nshortage of seats and other reasons, we are trying to accommodate them. \nI commend the Senate and the House for working on the means by which to \nmake the Capitol Grounds available.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 423, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 423) authorizing the \n     use of the Capitol Grounds for activities associated with the \n     dedication of the National World War II Memorial.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the concurrent resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 423) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent to print in \ntoday's Record some historic information about the memorial and a \npartial schedule of the many events that are occurring in connection \nwith the dedication. I hope this record, which will be printed today in \nthe proceedings of the Senate, will serve as a useful tool to Senators \nas they are working with their constituents on this matter.\n  I would like to conclude, again reflecting on Senator Dole's role. \nAgain, he is national chairman of the World War II Memorial campaign. I \nrecall when he undertook this assignment, working together with Fred \nSmith, the cochairman of the national campaign, Senator Dole said their \ngoal would be approximately $100 million and that they wanted to raise \nit from the people of the United States, individuals.\n  Over 600,000 individuals came forward. Also, 400 veterans groups, and \nover 1,400 schools took up contributions. All 50 States and Puerto Rico \ncontributed $1 for every citizen of that State who participated during \nWorld War II. The breadth of this campaign, envisioned by Senator Dole \nand others and the Battle Monuments Commission, and, of course, his \ncochairman,\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\nMr. Smith, was extraordinary, and the outpouring from all across \nAmerica was equally extraordinary. They set a goal of around $100 \nmillion, but it is my understanding they are approaching $200 million, \nshowing the depth and feeling and gratitude of all citizens of our \nNation.\n  With the greatest humility I compliment Senator Dole, Mr. Smith, and \nothers who undertook this task and achieved beyond all possible dreams. \nThe dedication is just shaping up to be one of the great moments in the \ncontemporary history of the United States of America.\n  Stop to think: It took 11 years to get the legislation through. \nHostilities ceased with the surrender of Japan. It is my recollection--\nI was but a young sailor then in training in the United States--it was \nin the summer of 1945, August, is my recollection, and the surrender of \nGermany, I think, occurred previously in that year, if my recollection \nis correct, May 8 or 9.\n  That extraordinary chapter and struggle of mankind to preserve \nfreedom came to a quiet and reverent conclusion with extraordinary \nlosses. Over 400,000 Americans alone gave their lives and probably in \nthe millions who were wounded, including our distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Dole and Senator Inouye.\n  I am at a loss for words to express the gratitude of this country. We \nare here today exercising the right of free speech because of those \nsacrifices and elsewhere in the world, exercising various levels of \ndemocracy and freedom of speech solely because of the enormity of the \nsacrifices of that generation referred to now as ``the greatest \ngeneration.''\n  Madam President, I, at this time, again acknowledge the participation \nof our former colleague, Senator Dole, and the participation of all \nMembers of the Chamber today and those who served in the 11 years \npreceding who participated in the legislative steps to bring about and \nfulfill the role of the Congress as it relates to this magnificent \nchapter in American history.\n  Madam President, I see another colleague, a very valuable member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, seeking recognition. Having spoken \nbriefly before, my understanding is that the Senator will be speaking \non the bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. DAYTON. That is right, matters related to the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator may speak for whatever time he wishes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Fifteen minutes, if I may.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Madam President, I ask at this time that we return to the \npending bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is the pending question.\n  Mr. WARNER. And that the distinguished Senator be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Warner, and I certainly want to join in his remarks commending \nthe husband of the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator Dole--\nboth distinguished Senators Dole--and also to recognize Chairman \nWarner, who has been superb in his quest for the truth of what has \nhappened in Iraq that has come to light in recent days.\n  I know it has been very difficult and there has been a high amount of \npressure on him, but he and our ranking member, Senator Levin, have led \nus well on that committee, as they have throughout my 3\\1/2\\ years of \nservice.\n  We are very fortunate that he has continued his distinguished \nleadership to our Senate and to our Nation throughout these years and \ncontinues to do so now.\n  This week we are debating the Defense Authorization Act for 2005 and \nwill return to it after the Memorial Day recess. I thank the majority \nleader, Senator Frist, for not trying to rush us through this important \nlegislation, because it is complex, and it is also very costly.\n  This bill authorizes $422 billion of taxpayer money and borrowed \nfunds for our national defense purposes in fiscal year 2005. That does \nnot count the $25 billion supplemental that the President has \nrequested, and it does not count the additional supplemental that we \nknow soon after the November election will also be requested for the \nwars in Afghanistan and Iraq during the rest of that fiscal year, \nprobably another $35 billion to $50 billion. That means a total of \nalmost $500 billion authorized for military operations in the year \n2005.\n  When I arrived 4 years ago, in fiscal year 2001, that comparable \nfigure was $309 billion. That is an increase of over 60 percent in just \n4 years.\n  Obviously, a lot has happened since then. There was 9/11, the war in \nAfghanistan, the war in Iraq, the war against terrorism, homeland \nsecurity, costs most of which are not included in this bill. I have \nsupported every defense, homeland security authorization, and \nappropriations bill during my 3\\1/2\\ years in the Senate, and I sit on \nboth authorizing committees. I will support this bill, as I did in \ncommittee. I will support the $25 billion supplemental appropriation, \nas I have all of the previous supplemental requests.\n  I want to ask for some answers from our Commander in Chief, President \nBush: In return for this $500 billion of taxpayers' money, what is your \nplan in Iraq? What must be accomplished, and by whom, before we declare \nvictory? How long will that take?\n  I spent 5 hours in the Senate Armed Services Committee hearings this \nweek, 1 hour yesterday with approximately 40 of my colleagues, with the \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and \nthe generals in charge of the war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. I \ndid not get answers to those basic questions. I heard generalities but \nnot answers.\n  General Abizaid, the excellent general in charge of that region of \nthe war, said it is vital that we ``stay the course.'' OK. But what \ncourse are we on? Where does it lead us? Where are you leading us, Mr. \nPresident?\n  I voted against the Iraq resolution in October of 2002 for three \nreasons. I thought it was unconstitutional for Congress to give up its \nconstitutional responsibility to declare war and give the President \nthat authority 6 months before he himself made his decision. Second, I \nwas not persuaded that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction that \nthreatened our national security. Third, I believed the invasion and \noccupation of an Arab nation would weaken, not strengthen, our national \nsecurity. I believe I was right on all three.\n\n  Now that we are there, I want us to succeed. We must succeed. The \nstakes are too high for failure or defeat. But what constitutes \nsuccess? We have already successfully achieved our stated objectives. \nOur Armed Forces smashed Saddam Hussein's army and toppled his regime \nin 3 weeks. We won that military victory overwhelmingly. We determined \nthat Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction to use against us or \nanyone else. None were used, thank God. None were found on the \nbattlefields or in caches or in sheds or caves or anywhere else. None \nwere even in production.\n  For the last year, our Armed Forces have heroically protected the \ncountry, helped to rebuild it, and trained and equipped some 200,000 \nIraqis as police and militia. On June 30, some measure of authority \nwill be transferred to an Iraqi government, selected by a \nrepresentative of the United Nations, along with a blueprint for \ndeveloping a national constitution and holding democratic elections. \nSuccess, success, success--a grand slam.\n  What else must we do? Madam President, 794 heroic Americans have \ngiven their lives to achieve that success, and I join with my \ncolleague, Senator Coleman, who cited each of those Minnesotans by \nname. They are truly, like their fallen comrades, American heroes. \nThousands more American heroes have been wounded. There are 134,000 \nAmerican heroes risking their lives every day and every night over in \nIraq for some indefinite period of time. And for what? For what, Mr. \nPresident?\n  We can do no more for the people of Iraq than give them back their \ncountry. What they decide to do with it is up to them. That is \ndemocracy. It is their country. They should administer it, patrol it, \npolice it, and defend it--not us. If we are doing any of that, we are \nstill running their country. We still get blamed for whatever is going\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\nwrong. Our men and women still do the fighting, the bleeding, and the \ndying. Yet growing numbers of Iraqi citizens and people in other Arab \ncountries hate us, want to drive us out of Iraq, want to retaliate \nagainst our troops or against our citizens. The longer we occupy Iraq, \nthe more that hatred will increase.\n  There is no such thing as a perfect war. War causes deaths and \ndestruction on intended targets and unintended victims. The \ndevastation, the killing and maiming is horrific on everybody--our \nsoldiers, their soldiers, their civilians, innocent men, women, and \nchildren who live there. Remember, it is their home. The stakes are \ninevitable and their ill effects are cumulative.\n  Last week, it was Abu Ghraib. This week it is a wedding attack. Next \nweek it will be something else. There is no subtraction. There is no \nbetter. There is either war or there is peace.\n  Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of \nGod.\n  Again, I call upon President Bush to explain to us, the American \npeople and to the world, for what purpose do we now remain in Iraq? \nWhat more must we accomplish, and how long will it take? How will the \nIraqis learn to run their country except by running their country? How \nwill they learn to police it except by policing it, to defend it except \nby defending it? It will not be easy for them. It will not be smooth. \nThey have not had those responsibilities for over a quarter century, \nbut it is time they started now, step by step, stage by stage. They \nshould do more, and we should do less.\n  If we must extinguish every pocket of resistance, we will be there a \nlong time, particularly when it is resistance to our being there.\n  The responsibility for 5,000 insurgents should be the Iraqis'--not \nours. Their police should patrol their streets, protect their property, \nkeep their peace--not our soldiers.\n  In Falluja, where Marine General Tim Conway turned those \nresponsibilities over to Iraqi command, an uprising of 2 weeks ago is \nreportedly quieting down. Insurgents battling against us switched sides \nand joined the local police force. Most of the people fighting against \nus there stopped fighting against their fellow Iraqis and the rest were \ntold to leave town by other Iraqis. Surely 200,000 Iraqi police and \nmilitia can contain 5,000 insurgents without us, without our bleeding \nand dying.\n  Our decision is, do we get out of Iraq in months or do we want to \nstay in Iraq for years? Right now the Bush administration's intention \nappears to be geared for years, with the assumption that our staying \nlonger will produce a better result, a result more to our liking, for \nwhatever those unstated reasons are.\n  But what if our staying longer will make things worse, for the Iraqis \nand for us? More violence, more casualties, more unrest, and more \ninstability? That is not success. The worse conditions become there, \nthe harder it becomes for us to leave because we cannot be considered \nweak or lacking will. In fact, the world doesn't think we are weak. \nThey don't question our will. They are wondering if we are wise.\n  Getting out of Iraq in months instead of years is wise. We do it on \nour stated terms, not on anyone else's. We phase ourselves out, we \nphase Iraqis in--quickly. First they are made to have responsibility \nfor their cities, for patrolling, policing, establishing law and \nkeeping order; then their highways and other infrastructure; then \noilfields and refineries; then their border security. During that \ntransition, up to one-half of our forces could depart, be stationed in \na neighboring country at the ready, and the other half could \ntransition, as this transfer occurs, to secure base camps in Iraq where \nwe will make it clear we will not tolerate anarchy or civil war or \nforeign intervention. The rest of it we allow the Iraqis to work out \nfor themselves, among themselves, by themselves. We enlist other Arab \nnations and the United Nations to assist with those resolutions while \nwe ensure against catastrophe, and we make clear our intention to leave \nas soon as Iraq's sovereignty is secure, as soon as Iraq's new \ngovernment has established law and order. That is their democracy. That \nis our success.\n  Paradoxically, in life the more you try to control events to get what \nyou want, the more you become controlled by those events and you don't \nget what you want. The administration picked their favorite Iraqi-in-\nexile and paid him reportedly millions of dollars to do their bidding. \nThis week, American troops raided his headquarters and arrested his \ncronies. We don't know who the right Iraqis are to lead their country. \nIraqis may not know yet themselves. But they will have better ideas \nthan we will.\n  Our challenge, and our opportunity, will be to befriend their chosen \nleaders rather than to make our chosen friends into their leaders, only \nto discover they are not friends at all.\n  Instead, we should focus our efforts on aiding Iraq's new leaders to \nsucceed, to rebuild and improve their country. That will make their \nleaders our friends. That will make their citizens our friends. That \nwill help make more people in the Arab world our friends. And that \nwould strengthen our national security much more than would more war.\n\n  To date, only $3.7 billion of the $15 billion Congress provided to \nhelp rebuild Iraq has been expended. Obviously, the lack of security \nhas limited those expenditures. But so has the lack of commitment by \nthe Bush administration because they have eschewed nation building. \nThey have spent even less than that for rebuilding Afghanistan, a \ncountry which has a credible leader, President Karzai, with whom I met \nin Kabul, Afghanistan in January of 2002. He was desperate for our help \nin rebuilding his destitute country. What an opportunity to show the \npeople of Afghanistan and the people of the Arab world what American \nknowledge, technology, capitalism, and compassion can do to make their \nlives better. It is an opportunity so far squandered by the Bush \nadministration which, as I said, scorns nation building.\n  Nation building is better than nation bombing--better for them, \nbetter for us, and better for the world. A better world is our best \nnational security. People whose lives we are helping to improve, who we \nare teaching and aiding to improve their own lives, become our friends, \nnot our enemies. They will not harbor our enemies or help them. They \nwill stand with us and the rest of the civilized world in rejecting \nterrorism and expelling terrorists from their own countries and their \nhavens in the world.\n  Paradoxically, every day we are fighting the war in Iraq we are \nweakening our defenses against terrorism. Every day we make peace in \nIraq, help rebuild Iraq, help rebuild Afghanistan, we are strengthening \nour defenses against terrorism.\n  The war against terrorism will be won by building a peaceful world, \nby building a prosperous world, for the multitudes, not just the \nmillionaires. Raising standards of living, social justice and the rule \nof law--all that will foster democracy; not military occupation or \nprovisional authorities, not prisoner abuses or more armored tanks.\n  So, tell us your plan, Mr. President, as we approach Memorial Day. \nTell us how you will bring our 134,000 troops in Iraq safely home, and \nwhen. And tell us what course we are on; military escalation or \npeaceful cooperation? Nation bombing or nation building? Financial \nbankruptcy or global prosperity?\n  You are asking your fellow citizens for 4 more years, Mr. President. \nTell us first what course we are on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 to expand the Mentor-Protege \nprogram to include service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and \nqualified HUBZone small business concerns as eligible participants. \nFour years ago I worked closely with Chairman Warner to extend the \nbenefits of this successful program to women-owned small businesses.\n  As chair of the Small Business Committee, it is my responsibility to \ncreate an environment where small businesses can flourish and apply \ntheir talents to the many pressing needs facing our government. The \nprimary issue for small business is access to the Federal marketplace \nand the opportunity to compete. When small businesses are denied the \nopportunity to participate in the Federal procurement process, the \nresult for our government is a dramatically reduced contractor base, \nand the mounting lost opportunity cost of choosing among fewer \ninnovative firms\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\nto deliver products and services at lower prices.\n  For the past several years, the Department of Defense has had a \nprogram in place to try to develop and maintain small disadvantaged- \nand women-owned vendors as a vital part of our Nation's defense \nindustrial base. This program has also been a principal source of \nopportunity for these firms by offsetting some of the other Federal \nprocurement practices, specifically contract bundling, that have \nsqueezed small business out of contracting.\n  Small businesses play a critical role in our Nation's economic and \nhomeland security. Small businesses are currently the leading job \ncreators in our Nation's economy and are responsible for more than 75 \npercent of net new jobs in America.\n  However, millions of Americans today continue to struggle to find \njobs. Hardest hit are the Nation's inner cities and depressed rural \nareas that face poverty year after year.\n  By locating in a historically underutilized business zone--HUBZone, \nmore than 10,000 small businesses have responded to the call to make a \ndifference in these underserved communities and to strengthen our \neconomic security. Congress needs to do its part by making the DoD a \nfrequent customer of these small businesses, so we can help them \ncompete effectively in the marketplace and create more jobs.\n  The Federal government, including the DoD, can and should also do \nmore to meet its commitment to small businesses owned by veterans, \nincluding service-disabled veterans. As committee chair, I am dedicated \nto ensuring that these individuals who have sacrificed so much to \ndefend free competitive enterprise are provided with increased \nopportunities to perform Federal contracts, especially contracts for \nweapons, equipment, and services for our warfighters.\n  In the fiscal year 1991 National Defense Authorization Act, the \nCongress adopted a provision to help small disadvantaged firms develop \nthe technical infrastructure necessary to perform Federal contracts \neffectively. This pilot program, the Mentor-Protege program, provided \nfor prime contractors to either be reimbursed for their added costs in \nproviding technical assistance to certain small firms, or to receive \ncredit for accomplishing their subcontracting plans in lieu of \nreimbursement. Four years ago, I sponsored legislation that now enables \nwomen-owned firms to participate in the program.\n  Experience under the Mentor-Protege pilot program has been positive. \nMentor firms have demonstrated that they can help train small \ndisadvantaged- and women-owned protege firms to develop the \ninfrastructure, necessary to be successful in large Federal contracts. \nAs these successful proteges graduate, mentors can open their doors to \nthe next generation of firms eager to contract with DoD as suppliers \nand subcontractors.\n  The program clearly has contributed to the success of bringing small \ndisadvantaged- and women-owned businesses into DoD contract work. Over \nthe last four years the DoD has increased the volume of dollars awarded \nto small disadvantaged businesses by more than 180 percent and the \ndollars awarded to women-owned firms by nearly 100 percent.\n  I ask that we expand participation to businesses owned by service-\ndisabled veterans and businesses that locate in severely economically \ndistressed areas. In so doing, we enhance the business competitiveness \nof these classes of firms and strengthen our defense industrial base by \ngenerating waves of small businesses prepared to supply goods and \nservices in defense of our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I also have an amendment to Section 833 of \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 providing \nfor improvements and accountability measures in the test program which \npermits large prime contractors to develop company- or unit-wide \nsubcontracting plans.\n  This amendment is designed to ensure that the test program undergoes \nappropriate evaluation and monitoring in order to enable accurate \nassessment of the effects of the test approach on subcontracting \nopportunities for small business.\n  Currently, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and customary \nprocurement practices require prime contractors to prepare \nsubcontracting plans with a particular contract or potential contract \nin mind. The test program, which operates as an exception to this rule, \nwas authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for FYs 1990 \nand 1991. The purpose of the test program was to explore whether \ncomprehensive subcontract planning could prove to be an adequate \nalternative for achieving meaningful small business subcontracting at \nlesser cost.\n  In April 2004, the General Accounting Office issued a report entitled \n``Contract Management: DoD Needs Measures for Small Business \nContracting and Better Data on Foreign Subcontracts,'' GAO-04-381, \nwhere it found the test program's results inconclusive and criticized \nthe Defense Department for failing to adopt measurement metrics to \nmeaningfully evaluate the test program. Despite this report, the Armed \nServices Committee approved a five-year extension of the test program \nin Section 833 of the Act.\n  As chair of the Small Business Committee, I am deeply concerned that \nthe program fails to live up to its purpose as a test, and I question \nthe prudence of extending this test program without proper standards \nand procedures to measure its success. My amendment provides a certain \ndeadline for the DoD to institute the needed measurement metrics and \nfreezes the expansion of the program until these metrics are in place. \nThe amendment also provides for oversight by the GAO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6067-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6067-S6072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PROCUREMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Lastly, Mr. President, I have an amendment to the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 to strike Section 811(b) \nof the act, which alters disclosure requirements for subcontracting \ninformation provided to small businesses through the Procurement \nTechnical Assistance Program of the Defense Logistics Agency.\n  This amendment will ensure that small businesses seeking federal \nsubcontracting opportunities through PTAP would continue to have \nadequate point-of-contact information for procurements up to $1 \nmillion.\n  The Procurement Technical Assistance Program assists small businesses \nby providing training and information about federal business \nopportunities, both prime and subcontracts. Under the terms of this \nprogram, the DLA joins forces with State, local, and tribal governments \nfor the purpose of delivering technical assistance services to \nbusinesses that are new to federal procurement.\n  Current law requires that experienced defense contractors with over \n$500,000 in contract awards disclose to assistance providers the \ncontact information for their executives with authority to enter into \nsubcontracts. These disclosures must be made only once a year. The cost \nof disclosures is practically non-existent. However, the disclosure \nrequirement materially advances the purpose of the program by allowing \nsmall businesses easy access to potential subcontracts.\n  Nevertheless, Section 811(b) of the act seeks to exempt experienced \ndefense contractors from these annual disclosures unless they receive \nover $1 million in government contracts. The need for this change is, \nat best, questionable. Providing a few names and phone numbers once a \nyear is hardly a significant burden. As chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, I am concerned that this change would needlessly obscure the \nprocurement process for small business. I urge the Senate to retain the \ncurrent PTAP disclosure requirements.\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish to clarify the intent of \nlegislation I introduced yesterday, S. 2457. Certainly, I would like to \nensure that the record reflects my intention in introducing this bill.\n  The provisions contained in S. 2457 mirror those contained in Section \n3116 of the fiscal year 2005 Department of Defense authorization bill, \nwhich pertain to the reclassification of high-level radioactive waste. \nLet me be clear: I oppose these provisions. I hope the majority of my \ncolleagues will oppose these provisions as well. I introduced this \nlegislation for the purpose of demonstrating to my colleagues that\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\nissues within the scope of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 do not \nbelong within the jurisdiction of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nThis was an issue of some debate on the floor yesterday, and I am \npleased that the parliamentarian has in fact referred this legislation \nto the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, of which I am \na member. I hope the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nwill take note of this fact when debate resumes on Sec. 3116 of his \nbill after the Memorial Day Recess. A policy shift this significant \nrequires substantial public debate within the committee of primary \njurisdiction.\n  I would also like to respond to a few of the comments made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, earlier today. First, \nhe noted that the Armed Services Committee discussed the issue of waste \nincidental to reprocessing at two hearings earlier this year. Again, \nthe Armed Services Committee is not the committee of jurisdiction for \nissues related to nuclear waste cleanup policy, as has now been \naffirmed by the Senate's parliamentarian. Second, a hearing at which \nthe concept of ``incidental'' waste is discussed is not at all the same \nas a legislative hearing on a specific proposal. To my knowledge, the \nlanguage to which I object in Sec. 3116 of the DoD authorization bill \nhas never previously been introduced as stand-alone legislation. And if \nit had, it would not have been referred to the Armed Services \nCommittee. Thus, we have had no legislative hearings on the Senator \nfrom South Carolina's proposal.\n  Lastly, the Senator from Colorado has misstated my position with \nregard to removal of Hanford's underground tanks, which contain 53 \nmillion gallons of high-level radioactive waste. As I stated clearly on \nthe floor last evening, the cleanup plan at Hanford, as outlined in the \nTriParty agreement, does not include removal of these tanks from the \nground. As I stated previously, I agree with the State of Washington's \ncurrent thinking on this matter. Digging up these tanks would pose a \nnumber of unnecessary risks, and that is not a concept now on the \ntable. I hope that the Senator from Colorado will take note of this \nfact.\n  I look forward resuming debate on these matters of such tremendous \nimportance when the Senate returns from the Memorial Day \nRecess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have enjoyed listening to my colleague \nhere today. I have been concerned with some of the things my good \nfriend has said.\n  First of all, you know, I don't think anybody doubts that what we \nhave done over there has put a tremendous dent in terrorism all over \nthe world. Because of the fortitude of this President and this \nadministration, we have stood up against terrorists all over the \nworld--in Afghanistan and in Iraq, but if the truth be known, in so \nmany other countries that are fraught with terrorism. I can't talk much \nabout that. But I can say one thing as a member of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, this administration is on top of this all \nover the world.\n  Probably the two greatest experiments right now against terrorism are \nin Afghanistan--where we are slowly moving that country forward, and \nshowing a commitment of the international community in a very real \nsense. But we are having a very difficult time locating al-Qaida, which \nslips across the border into the ungovernable part of Pakistan.\n  But probably the most important steps taken against terrorism in our \nworld today are being exhibited right in Iraq.\n  In the 20th century, Iraq has been a very difficult area, with all \nkinds of animosity, tribal difficulties, tribal conflicts. Many of the \ncurrent conflicts existed long before we had to get involved, and it is \neasy to understand why this is taking a bit of time to get done.\n  The one thing I am very concerned about--that is happening day in and \nday out with colleagues on the other side of the floor--is the \nundermining of morale, the undermining of efforts of our troops over \nthere. What happened to the unity that we need in America to support \nour troops?\n  War is never easy, and it is never something that is pleasant. \nAnybody who thinks you can just walk out of Iraq and turn it over to \nthe Iraqis at this point is not only whistling ``Dixie,'' but you have \nto wonder if the confidence is really there.\n  By the way, having said that, I feel badly that the minority leader \nin the House of Representatives has chosen to use such unwise language \nabout the President of the United States. She should be ashamed of \nherself. I know she is trying to do her job over there. I think having \ntwo parties is very important, and having a loyal opposition is \nimportant as well. But to call the President incompetent, and to call \nwhat he is doing incompetency undermines every soldier in Iraq and \nevery soldier around the world. It undermines our fight against \nterrorism. It undermines so many things that are important for our \ncountry, for our troops overseas, and for those who are here. It \nundermines our young people who might believe that bunk. If you hear it \nenough, and the media presents it enough, people start to think that \ntype of irresponsible talk is true. It is not only not true, it is \nirresponsible, mean, vindictive, and, I think, beneath the dignity of \nany leader in either of these bodies.\n  It is one thing to criticize the policies. That is what we are here \nto do. It is one thing to criticize a different philosophy and to try \nto have yours preeminent, but it is another thing to undermine the \nPresident of the United States at a time when we are in grave \ndifficulties in Iraq and when we are in a grand experiment of trying to \ninstitute a democracy in lands that have never seen democracy.\n  I think it undermines our whole process for anybody to come on this \nfloor and say we should leave now and let Iraq go to the Iraqis. What \ndo you think we are doing? On June 30 we are going to turn it over to \ntheir Governing Council.\n  By the way, Mr. Bremer will be gone. He has this incredibly difficult \njob of trying to bring peace and stability to Iraq. He has done a \nterrific job. But he is going to be gone, and we are presently in the \nprocess of installing John Negroponte--one of our top foreign service \nofficers, one of the top Ambassadors that this country has ever had, \nwho is a wonderful family man who has been all over the world, who has \nserved this country with distinction all over the world--to be our \nAmbassador in Iraq. This is evidence that Iraq is going to be turned \nover to the Iraqis. But the Iraqis should be the first to say we still \nneed the stability that only the United States of America and its \nallies--some 30 countries--can bring about.\n  I am getting a little tired of people saying this is just the United \nStates against the world. There are some 30-plus countries over there \nsupporting us.\n  I would like to ask, Where are the French, where are the Germans, \nwhere are the Russians, and where are the Chinese? Aren't they \nconcerned about stability in the Middle East? Of course not. They do \nnot share the vision of sacrifice to improve other parts of the world.\n  I also would like to make a few points on what we have done over \nthere and what we are in the process of doing, hopefully without being \nundermined by Members of this body or Members of the other body. This \nis not a grand experiment, but it is a grand approach to try to put a \ndent in terrorism and create at least a representative form of \ngovernment in the Middle East, for the first time in history in that \narea in Iraq.\n  The U.S., in coalition with allies, has overthrown two terrorist \nregimes. We have rescued two nations. We have liberated 50 million \npeople.\n  Some of these people who have been such big critics ought to \nacknowledge that.\n  This coalition has captured or killed almost two-thirds of these \nterrorist leaders around the world--two-thirds of the known senior \nadvisers and al-Qaida operatives.\n  We have captured or killed 46 of the 55 most wanted in Iraq. We have \ndisrupted terror cells on most continents. Mr. President, $200 million \nin terrorist assets have been seized or frozen.\n  Where are the compliments coming from the other side about some of \nthese things?\n  The coalition persuaded Libya to eliminate its chemical- and nuclear-\nrelated programs and to accept international inspection.\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\n  That could never have happened without the President of the United \nStates, George W. Bush; without his guts and without his ability and \nhis foresightedness.\n  We have put up with Libya all these years, with their \nirresponsibilities in the Middle East and all over the world, and their \nsponsorship of terrorism.\n  Had it not been for what President Bush has done, Libya would never \nhave agreed to start acting responsibly. Qadhafi would never agree, but \nhe has finally seen the handwriting on the wall that we have some \nfortitude.\n  Al-Qaida is taking credit for getting rid of that government in \nSpain. They are going to try to do that to us. We had better be \nprepared for it.\n  This President has had the guts to stand up to the terrorist threat. \nHe is certainly the leading person in the world who has had the guts to \nstand up against international terrorists for the first time in a long \ntime.\n  I want to give all of the counterparts from the other nations credit, \ntoo, especially Tony Blair in Great Britain.\n  If we eliminate tyranny in the Middle East by doing what is right in \nIraq, it is amazing what we can do throughout the rest of the world. It \nwould be a crucial setback for international terror.\n  Just some of the things that have been accomplished over there in \nIraq: The Transitional Administrative Law approved by the Iraqi \nGoverning Council is now considered the most liberal basic governance \nlaws in all of the Arab world. It assures freedom of religion, freedom \nof expression, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly. It also \nguarantees the fundamental rights of women for the first time.\n  That wouldn't have happened but for the courage of this coalition \nbuilt up by our President.\n  Iraq's new currency is the most heavily traded currency in the Middle \nEast now. A lot of people do not know that. Oil production and power \ngeneration are way beyond prewar levels now.\n  It is the United States that has done that and the coalition partners \nthat have done that. It is a tremendous advancement.\n  All 22 universities and 43 technical institutes and colleges are now \nopen in Iraq.\n  Can you imagine in that, in this short period of time, we have \naccomplished this?\n  The coalition forces have rehabilitated more than 2,200 schools, all \n240 hospitals and more than 1,200 health clinics are now open.\n\n  Health care spending in Iraq has increased 30 times over prewar \nlevels. There have been so many great changes over there that the Iraqi \npeople are now starting to feel they have a chance.\n  If we leave now, the old regime's gangsters can come right back in, \nthe instability can come back in. We have not finished the job of \nhelping the police be able to run the place.\n  There are now 170 newspapers being published in Iraq.\n  As of May 4, the estimated crude oil export revenue was over $5.6 \nbillion for this year alone. I could go on and on.\n  I am saying this: Why aren't we supportive of all the good things \nthat have been done and are going on in Iraq? Why are we openly \ncondemning this President, who had the guts to do what is right, and \ndoing it so the whole world can see, so our young men and women are \nundermined and demoralized over there? Is it political advantage that \nsome people are seeking? Some would say yes. Some might say no. Is it \nbecause it is an election year? I think many people would say yes. Is \nit because some people just hate George W. Bush? The answer to that is \nyes, too. Is it because of irresponsibility on the part of some in the \nCongress? Some might even say yes to that, although I personally would \nnot take that position. But some who are saying yes may be right. It is \ncertainly undermining our troops over there, certainly making it \ndifficult for any President to have the guts to do what has to be done \nagainst terrorism.\n  I have worked on terrorist problems from the beginning around here, \nall 28 of my years. I was the prime sponsor of the Antiterrorism \nEffective Death Penalty Act in 1996--by the way, we were trying to put \nsome of the provisions that are now in the PATRIOT Act in that bill. \nThat was stopped by these naysayers and the people who are always \ntalking about civil liberties. What about the civil liberties of the \n3,000 people who died on September 11 because we were not prepared \nbecause we did not give law enforcement the tools to be able to stop \nthat kind of terrible activity?\n  I get a little tired, to be honest with you. It is time to stand with \nthis President, as Democrats and as Republicans, and back our soldiers \nover there. Yes, what happened at Abu Ghraib is not right. We know \nthat. As far as I can see--and I went to Guantanamo Bay last week; I \nhave been in all of the intelligence meetings as a member of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence--as far as I can see, it is limited to a \nlimited number of people in Iraq who just plain got out of line and \nacted like goons. None of us can justify any of that. Now that we have \nmade that clear, why do we dwell on it every day, every night, all day \nlong, all evening long, on the news and everywhere else? We know it is \nwrong and we know darned well we will have to clean it up. And we will \nbecause this is a free Nation, and we believe in the rule of law.\n  I have said maybe more than I should have said, but I was \ndisappointed in the remarks of the minority leader in the House \nyesterday. Talk about remarks that undermine everything this President \nis trying to do--and coming from one of our leaders. I hope she thinks \nit through and does not make any more of these irresponsible comments \nin the future. I hope we on this side think it through, too, and are \nmore responsible in some of the things we do. It would be wonderful if \nwe could work together more than we are in this body. I have never seen \nit so partisan in the whole time I have been in the Senate.\n\n\n                             F/A-22 Raptor\n\n  I will change the subject to something that is very important to me.\n  I stand before you today as an ardent supporter of the F/A-22 Raptor. \nI urge that the Senate restore the President's budget by authorizing \nappropriations for 24 F/A-22 Raptors.\n  Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to travel to Tyndall Air Force \nBase to be briefed on the capabilities of this extraordinary aircraft. \nAs a result of these meetings and discussions with the pilots who are \ntraining to fly the aircraft and the ground personnel who are learning \nto maintain the Raptor, I have come to the conclusion that the Raptor \nis absolutely vital to our national security.\n  Over the past 30 years, the U.S. has been able to maintain air \nsuperiority in every conflict largely due to the F-15C. However, with \nthe great advancements in technology over the past several years, the \nF-15 has struggled to keep pace. For example, the F-15 is not a stealth \naircraft and its computer systems are based on obsolete technology. My \ncolleagues should remember that the F-15 first flew in the early 1970s. \nIt has been a magnificent plane but it is starting to age. During the \nensuing years, nations have been consistently developing new aircraft \nand missile systems to defeat this fighter.\n  Realizing that the F-15 would need a replacement, the Air Force \ndeveloped the F/A-22 Raptor. The result is a truly remarkable aircraft.\n  The F/A-22 has greater stealth capabilities than the F-117 Nighthawk. \nThis is a powerful attribute when one remembers that it was the \nNighthawk's stealth characteristics that enabled that aircraft to \npenetrate the integrated air defenses of Baghdad during the first night \nof the 1991 Gulf War.\n  The Raptor is also equipped with super-cruise engines. These engines \ndo not need to go to after-burner in order to achieve supersonic \nflight. This provides the F/A-22 with a strategic advantage by enabling \nsupersonic speeds to be maintained for a far greater length of time. By \ncomparison, all other fighters require their engines to go to after-\nburner to achieve supersonic speeds. This is not just our country but \nall the other countries fighters, as well. This consumes a tremendous \namount of fuel and greatly limits an aircraft's range.\n  The F/A-22 is also the most maneuverable fighter flying today. This \nis of particular importance when encountering newer Russian-made \naircraft which boast a highly impressive maneuver capability.\n\n  Yet a further advantage resides in the F/A-22s radar and avionics. \nWhen entering hostile airspace, one F/A-22 can energize its radar \nsystem, enabling it to detect and engage enemy fighters far before an \nenemy's system effective range.\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\n  However, one of the most important capabilities of Raptor is often \nthe most misunderstood. Many critics of the program state that, since \nmuch of the design work for this aircraft was performed during the Cold \nWar, it does not meet the requirements of the future. I believe that \nthis criticism is misplaced. The F/A-22 is more than just a fighter it \nis also a bomber. In its existing configuration it is able to carry two \n1,000 pound GPS-guided JDAM bombs. Shortly, it will be able to carry \nthe small diameter bomb and in 2008 the aircraft's radar system will be \nenhanced with a ``look-down'' mode enabling the Raptor to independently \nhunt for targets on the ground.\n  All of these capabilities are necessary to fight what is quickly \nemerging as the threat of the future--the anti-access integrated air \ndefense system. Integrated air defenses include both surface to air \nmissiles and fighters deployed in such a fashion as to leverage the \nstrengths of both systems. Such a system could pose a very real \npossibility of denying U.S. aircraft access to strategically important \nregions during future conflicts.\n  It should also be noted that for a comparably cheap price, an \nadversary can purchase the Russian SA-20 surface-to-air missile. This \nsystem has an effective range of approximately 120 nautical miles and \ncan engage targets at greater then 100,000 feet, much higher then the \nservice ceiling of any existing American fighter or bomber. The \nRussians have also developed a family of highly maneuverable fighters, \nthe SU-27/30/35, which have been sold to such nations as China. Of \nfurther import, 59 other nations have fourth generation fighters.\n  It has also been widely reported in the aviation media that the F-\n15C, our current air superiority fighter, it not as maneuverable as \nnewer Russian aircraft, especially the SU-35. However, the F/A-22 is \ndesigned to defeat an integrated air defense system. By utilizing its \nstealth capability, the F/A-22 can penetrate an enemy's airspace \nundetected and, when modified, independently hunt for mobile surface-\nto-air missile operational systems. Once detected, the F/A-22 would \nthen be able to drop bombs on those targets.\n\n  Some correctly state that the B-2 bomber and the F-117 could handle \nthose assignments. However, the F/A-22 offers the additional capacity \nof being able to engage an enemy's air superiority fighters, such as \nthe widely proficient SU-35. Therefore, the Raptor will be able to \ndefeat, almost simultaneously, two very different threats that until \nnow have been handled by two different types of aircraft.\n  Despite the obvious advantages of this aircraft, there has been \nresistance to this program in the halls of Congress. As with many \nmilitary procurement programs, the primary concern is, naturally, cost. \nThis, in part, led to the planned procurement of the aircraft to be \nreduced from over 600 to the current planned procurement of 277.\n  In response, the supporters of the \nF/A-22 devised a new procurement strategy called ``Buy to Budget.'' \nThis strategy capped the total cost for the procurement of the aircraft \nand forced the Air Force and the Raptor's primary contractor, Lockheed \nMartin, to cut the cost of the plane. These efforts, so far, have been \nsuccessful, and last year an additional F/A-22 was procured, solely \nbased on savings.\n  Unfortunately, as with any complicated aircraft, especially one whose \ncomputer power equals that of two supercomputers, schedule delays have \noccurred. However, these delays have also largely been resolved. \nLockheed Martin has placed the former head of its very successful F-16 \nproduction line in charge of F/A-22 production. As a result, it is \nbelieved that F/A-22 production will be back on schedule by early 2005.\n  Now, despite this progress, criticisms of the aircraft continue. As a \nresult, colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee have reduced \nthe number of aircraft to be purchased this year to 22. In contrast, \nthe President's budget requested 24 aircraft--2 more.\n  To be fair, it sounds reasonable to see this as a modest reduction in \norder to ensure existing production schedules are met and possibly \ndecrease the cost of the aircraft. However, production schedules will \nbe met. Due to the already drastic reduction in the number of aircraft \nto be procured, many have developed the very real concern that there \nwill not be enough aircraft to meet the operational needs of the Air \nForce, based on the proven Air Expeditionary Force model. Not having \nsufficient numbers of F/A-22 for some of these contingencies would be \nan abdication of our congressional responsibilities, especially now \nthat we are faced with war.\n  However, I wish to add one final point. I have talked about the \ncapabilities of this aircraft and how those capabilities are designed \nto defeat the threats of the future. But what impressed me most was the \nway the pilots and ground crews of Tyndall Air Force Base spoke about \nthe F/A-22. They are truly excited about its potential. They understand \nthat this aircraft will ensure American dominance of the skies for the \nnext half century. These young men and women stand ready to sacrifice \nso much for us. We owe them the best our country has to offer. \nTherefore, I respectfully urge the Senate to restore the President's \nbudget proposal on this remarkable aircraft.\n\n\n                    Preserving Traditional Marriage\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about preserving traditional \nmarriage--an institution which is under attack from so many directions \ntoday.\n  This past week, as everyone by now undoubtedly knows, the Goodridge \ndecision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court went into effect \nin Massachusetts. This 4-to-3 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage and prohibits \nthe State from defining marriage as between a man and a woman.\n  According to reports, more than 1,000 same-sex couples have been \n``married'' pursuant to the radical change handed down by the split \ncourt.\n  We all know that it is the legislative branch, and not the judiciary, \nthat makes the laws--or at least should make the laws. But there are \nsome courts, such as the one in Massachusetts, that want to take away \nthe public policy role that the legislatures and people have always \nhad. Senator Talent of Missouri and I wrote an opinion editorial on \nthis issue that was published in Monday's Washington Times. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 17, 2004]\n\n         The Bench vs. People; Can a Judge's Will Become a Law?\n\n                    (By Orrin Hatch and Jim Talent)\n\n       In the debate over traditional marriage, the cultural \n     dominoes are falling in the wrong direction. Activist judges, \n     who specialize in taking issues away from the people and \n     deciding those issues instead, intend to make traditional \n     marriage a thing of the past. Their decisions, like the one \n     that will allow Massachusetts clerks to begin issuing \n     marriage licenses to same-sex couples this week, and the \n     aggressive political and legal strategy driving them, make \n     clear that protecting traditional marriage will require \n     amending the Constitution.\n       America's founders believed, as James Madison put it, that \n     the legislative branch ``necessarily predominates'' in a \n     representative democracy. We all learned in civics class that \n     the legislative branch makes the law, which means the \n     judicial branch doesn't. Most state constitutions go beyond \n     separating the branches, and two-thirds explicitly prohibit \n     judges from legislating. With only the power to interpret the \n     law, the judiciary is supposed to be, in Alexander Hamilton's \n     words, the ``least dangerous'' branch.\n       Times have changed. Judges have become the most dangerous \n     branch by following former Chief Justice Evans Hughes' view \n     that the law is ``whatever the judges say it is.'' Judges \n     cannot change the literal words of the Constitution or a \n     statute, so they make law by changing the meaning of those \n     words. The obvious danger is that if the law means whatever \n     the judges say it means, judges control the law, run the \n     country and define the culture.\n       Since before the founding of the republic, legislatures \n     enshrined the traditional view that marriage is a union of a \n     man and a woman. Only in the last decade have judges \n     attempted to substitute their own views, effectively amending \n     state constitutions by judicial fiat and imposing new \n     marriage policies. Neither the people nor their \n     legislatures chose any such thing.\n       In addition to judges acting like legislatures, some rogue \n     public officials are acting like judges. Although California \n     law defines marriage as between a man and a woman, for \n     example, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom simply declared it \n     unconstitutional, and same-sex couples from at least 46 \n     states have obtained a marriage license there. Similarly, \n     same-sex residents of more than 30 states have obtained \n     marriage licenses in Multnomah County, Ore. Litigation is \n     inevitable as they challenge their home states to recognize \n     these same-sex unions.\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\n       This crisis requires a constitutional solution for at least \n     three reasons. First, amending the Constitution is the only \n     way of reining in the activist judges who will otherwise \n     undermine traditional marriage. Neither judicial self-\n     restraint nor the separation of judicial from legislative \n     power is enough. Nor, it appears, are explicit bans on \n     legislation by judges in state charters. The Massachusetts \n     Supreme Judicial Court's decision that same-sex couples may \n     wed, which goes into effect this week, is a legislative act \n     openly defying the Massachusetts Constitution's edict that \n     judges ``shall never exercise the legislative'' power.\n       Second, the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) will no \n     longer effectively protect traditional marriage. While the \n     Constitution requires that states give each other's judicial \n     proceedings ``full faith and credit,'' it also lets Congress \n     make exceptions. Supported by 79 percent of House members, 85 \n     percent of senators and signed by Bill Clinton, DOMA \n     guarantees that one state need not recognize another's non-\n     traditional union. Even so, federal and state court decisions \n     since DOMA have made legal analysts, enthusiastically or \n     grudgingly, concur that DOMA itself likely will not survive a \n     court challenge before activist judges.\n       Third, amending the Constitution of the United States is \n     the only way for the people of the United States to take this \n     issue back. ``We the people'' established the Constitution, \n     and only we can rightfully amend it by the single process \n     outlined in the charter, a process that excludes the judicial \n     branch. No amendment on any subject becomes part of the \n     Constitution unless supported by two-thirds of Congress and \n     three-fourths of the states. Amendments by judges, by \n     contrast, defy the people and lack their consent.\n       The first right of the people is to govern themselves. \n     Activist judges take away that right, sapping democracy's \n     legitimacy and vitality. When courts deny the people the \n     right to decide cultural issues for themselves, they \n     undermine both the freedom and the opportunity to form \n     consensus provided by self-government. Americans on both \n     sides of the marriage debate deserve to have their voice \n     heard and the potential to make it effective. Such civic \n     participation in elections, through legislatures, or in \n     amending the Constitution, is an antidote to judicial \n     activism. Defending the people's right to govern themselves \n     generally and protecting traditional marriage specifically \n     require responding to this judicial activism by amending the \n     U.S. Constitution.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will not read it, but I will say that \npeople have the right to govern themselves. When a court forces a \nradical decision on the people--well before the people have had the \nopportunity to oppose the change--it dramatically undermines \ndemocracy's vitality and legitimacy.\n  Some of the comments from the first same-sex couples to take \nadvantage of the Massachusetts court decision underscore what is wrong \nwith deviations from our culture of traditional marriage. According to \nthe Boston Herald, the first recipients of a Provincetown, MA, same-sex \nmarriage license said: ``the concept of forever is overrated.'' One \ngentleman in this couple added that he, as a bisexual, and his partner, \nwho is gay, ``think it's possible to love more than one person and have \nmore than one partner. In our case, it is, so we have an open \nmarriage.'' I am sorry, but this simply is not a marriage. I simply do \nnot understand why these two men felt they needed to be declared to be \nmarried by the State. There is not even a pretense of fidelity here.\n  The reason that maintaining traditional marriage is so important can \nbe summed up in one word, and that is ``children.'' Children are simply \nbetter off with a mother and a father than with two mothers or two \nfathers or any other alternative arrangement. Advocates for same-sex \nmarriage cite studies to the contrary, but, as Professor Steven Nock, a \nleading marriage scholar at the University of Virginia, points out, \n``not a single one was conducted according to generally accepted \nstandards of scientific research.'' Not a single one of those studies \nwas conducted according to generally accepted standards of scientific \nresearch.\n  Marriage is not about adult desires for affirmation and benefits; it \nis about the well-being of children. Two men being intimate are simply \nnot the same as a husband and a wife, and alternative family forms are \nnot just as good as traditional families. The fact is that fathers and \nmothers both matter to children. The science confirms this, but common \nsense tells us this as well.\n  Some advocates for same-sex marriage argue that traditional marriage \nwill continue the same as before. Unfortunately, this has not been the \nexperience of other countries. Some in Scandinavia, for example, \nwitnessed a dramatic drop in traditional marriages once same-sex \nmarriages were permitted or the equivalent thereof. The net effect was \nto diminish the importance of marriage altogether, and that is what \nwill happen here if we do not maintain the traditional definition of \nmarriage between a man and a woman.\n  It has become clear that we need a constitutional solution to this \nproblem. There is simply no other means of reining in activist judges \nwho seek to impose their will and not their judgment. Some say the \nDefense of Marriage Act is adequate enough, but based on decisions, \nsuch as Lawrence v. Texas, this statute will undoubtedly be struck \ndown. People across the political spectrum, including such liberal \nstalwarts as Professor Lawrence Tribe, agree that this is inevitable.\n  Without a constitutional amendment, we are headed for a resolution by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. We should not and cannot wait for this to \nhappen. We simply must protect traditional marriage now by passing a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Some suggest that it is not ``conservative'' to amend the \nConstitution over such an issue. Baloney. Traditional marriage is \nperhaps the most fundamental institution in our culture and history. It \ndates back over 5,000 years. If the only way to protect this \ninstitution is by amending the Constitution--and we know that to be the \ncase--then we have an obligation to do so.\n  What is worrisome to most constitutional scholars, including myself, \nis that if this supreme court case of one State--a 4-to-3 decision; \nhotly contested, not only by the court itself but in the State \nlegislature and among the people of Massachusetts themselves--if that \nis allowed to stand, then will we, under article IV of the \nConstitution, the original Constitution even before the Bill of Rights \nwas added to it, will we have to give in every other State full faith \nand credit under the full faith and credit clause to whatever is called \nmarriage done within the State of Massachusetts? There are many \nconstitutional scholars who say we will have to. That does not mean \nthat Utah will have to have same-sex marriages done within our State or \nany other State in the Union.\n  It does mean we will have to recognize as valid same-sex marriages \nperformed in Massachusetts. Now we have people coming from all over the \ncountry to Massachusetts to be married so that under the full faith and \ncredit clause that marriage will have to be recognized in their \nrespective States. I cannot begin to tell you the difficulties legally \nthat will come from that type of an approach.\n  We simply need to resolve this problem. We need to resolve it in \naccordance with the will of the vast majority of people in this \ncountry. Cultural decisions such as this that have existed for over \n5,000 years should not be thrown into the wastebasket by an activist \ncourt in one very activist liberal State. Nor should an activist court \nin an activist conservative State impose its will on us. We should, of \ncourse, allow the elected representatives of the people to make this \ndecision.\n  If you don't do that, then you have nothing but another huge, \nunnecessary, harmful to America culture battle, perhaps for decades. We \ncan name the decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court that have caused us to \nbe torn apart in America over a number of issues that, 5 to 4, 7 to 2, \nthe Supreme Court has culturally imposed upon everybody in America.\n  I don't believe in discrimination of any kind. But like a number of \nmy colleagues in this body, I draw the line when it comes to \ntraditional marriage. Traditional marriage is one of the most important \ncultural concepts in any country's history but certainly our country's \nhistory. This debate needs to occur. We need to think it through. We \nneed to have a constitutional amendment, and we need to support \nwhatever constitutional amendment we can get to resolve this matter.\n  Having said that, we need to be fair to those who have a different \npoint of view and to find some way of accommodation. Because it is a \ndisgrace that a gay partner cannot go into an intensive care unit to \ncare for or hold hands with or to be with his or her partner, just to \nmention one. We have to think this through. One way of thinking it \nthrough is to come to a conclusion that one liberal State's 4-to-3 \ndecision by a\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\nSupreme Court should not bind everybody in America to recognize \nsomething that I believe will be absolutely catastrophically disruptive \nto our culture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say, while the Senator from Utah is \nhere, how much I appreciate his wise words on so many subjects that are \nimportant to our country and to our culture and to American families. \nHe has spoken eloquently about the importance of persevering in Iraq, \nthe importance of traditional families as the bulwark of our culture \nand in the best interest of children, and the importance of making sure \nwe keep the American military the dominant force in the world by making \nsure we transform in particular our Air Force by the implementation of \nthe F-22 Raptor which, not coincidentally, is built in part in the \nState of Texas which is important both for our national security and in \nterms of the jobs it creates in my State.\n  I say to the Senator how much I appreciate him and his wisdom and his \ngreat leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I thank my \ncolleague for his kind remarks. My colleague from Texas served on the \nTexas Supreme Court. He understands these issues very well, serving in \na tremendous fashion on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I feel so \nblessed as chairman to have him and the other freshmen Senators on that \ncommittee, each one of whom is playing a significant role in this body \nand on that committee. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator for those kind comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6072-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6072-S6074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SYMBOLS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we all know, symbols are important. \nSymbols, even more than our words, are powerful communicators of \nintent, of value, and of commitment. We know, for example, what the \npictures that have recently come to light of the abuse of a few Iraqi \nprisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison have communicated in a way that mere \nwords could not. Indeed, out of all of the terrible consequences of \nthat criminal activity by a few, there has been a positive. I believe \nthat positive is, No. 1, the commitment of the Department of Defense, \nfrom the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, all the way down to the \ntroops in the prison themselves, to make sure we get to the facts, that \nwe hold those guilty accountable, and that we do so in a public way \nwhich demonstrates that in a democracy we do things in a way that \npeople can judge for themselves whether they are being handled \nappropriately.\n  I trust by the time we get through with these investigations--about \nsix of them in all--and by the time the prosecutions of the seven who \nhave been charged with criminal conduct, misconduct, and possibly \nothers who will be charged as well, by the time we get through, the \nworld will see our commitment to the rule of law and to minimum \nstandards of human decency.\n  When I think about symbols, I also think about, for example, what has \nhappened in Madrid with the attacks on the trains there which killed \nmany of that country and which, in the eyes of some, caused Spain, \nbecause of the election, to pull their troops out of Iraq. We know \nthere is very likely a different explanation for the outcome of that \nelection, but I am haunted by the words of GEN John Abizaid, commander \nof the central command, including Iraq and that whole troubled part of \nthe world, who said al-Qaida was emboldened as a result of the reaction \nthat they perceived occurred by that attack. That is another example of \nhow symbols are enormously powerful in ways that it is hard for us to \narticulate or explain in mere words.\n  I would like to also talk about another symbol that I think is very \nimportant for us, beyond the perseverance that we see, and that Senator \nHatch talked about so eloquently, of our troops in the battlefield who \nhave put themselves in harm's way to protect us and to liberate the \nIraqi people. I believe there is another important symbol that we can \nsend which will tell our enemies that we are absolutely committed to \ndefending ourselves against terrorism. That is the legislation that has \nbeen filed today by Senator Kyl of Arizona, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor.\n  This bill is one page in length. It is very short. I believe it is a \npowerful symbol. If we act, as I believe we should, to adopt this \nlegislation, that would send a powerful message to our enemies that we \nremain committed to defending ourselves in this new and dangerous world \nwe live in since 9/11 and that we have not lost our resolve in Iraq or \nAfghanistan or anywhere else where the war on terrorism rages.\n  This bill that has been filed would simply do this: It would take the \nUSA PATRIOT Act, which has a sunset provision that causes a number of \nelements of that bill to expire at the end of next year, and it simply \nrepeals that sunset provision, thus making the USA PATRIOT Act a \npermanent part of our laws.\n  Yesterday, we heard from FBI Director Robert Mueller, who voiced \nstrong support for renewing the PATRIOT Act, which this would do. He \nsaid, for 2\\1/2\\ years the PATRIOT Act has proved extraordinarily \nbeneficial in the war on terrorism and has changed the way the FBI does \nbusiness. Many of our counterterrorism successes, in fact, are the \ndirect result of provisions included in the act, a number of which are \nscheduled to sunset at the end of next year.\n  I strongly believe it is vital to our national security to keep each \nof these provisions intact. Indeed, Director Mueller is not alone. We \nheard bipartisan support in testimony before the 9/11 Commission, which \nis studying lessons learned from that terrible event in our history and \nthe aftermath, of what it is we can do to make our country stronger and \nto defend ourselves from the extremists who simply want to kill us and \neliminate our way of life.\n  One by one, from former FBI Director Louis Freeh to former Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno to Attorney General John Ashcroft--just to name a \nfew--they touted the impact of the PATRIOT Act in reducing the wall \nthat prevented information sharing between criminal investigators and \nour counterterrorism intelligence officials. They talked about how \nimportant the PATRIOT Act was in bringing down that wall that prevented \ninformation sharing at the Federal level.\n  As a former State law enforcement officer myself, I can tell you, \nsince 9/11, another thing that has made America safer is not just \ngreater information sharing at the Federal level, between Federal \nagencies, but indeed it has also been the information shared with State \nand local law enforcement officials.\n  Director Mueller made that point again yesterday about how important \nit is that we work collectively, using all of our resources at the \nState, Federal, and local levels to make sure we protect this country \nand keep our citizens safe.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts of quotations from a number of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, which I have reduced to one \nsheet, be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, with this background and context, you \nmight wonder who would possibly object to this legislation that would \nrepeal the sunset provision in the PATRIOT Act. Some might say, well, \nif the PATRIOT Act provisions are not set to expire until the end of \nnext year, why now? My response is, why not?\n  Indeed, if we want to send a powerful message that we have maintained \nour resolve and commitment to defend our country against the scourge of \nterrorism, this would be a powerful symbol, a powerful message that \nthis body could send that our commitment is strong, that we will \nmaintain our resolve, and we will fight the war on terrorism and defend \nourselves from those who would kill our innocent civilians in this \ncountry and elsewhere; that we will maintain that resolve and we will \nfight until the very end.\n\n  So I think it is very important that we pass this legislation. Let me \nalso mention, there is a bipartisan consensus which appears throughout \nWashington and throughout this country about how important the PATRIOT \nAct has been to protect American citizens; that there are those who \nwould\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\nuse the tactic of fear to try to convince the American people--or at \nleast some segment of the American people--that the PATRIOT Act \njeopardizes their civil liberties. I must say the debate about the \nproper balance between civil liberties and security is not a new one. \nIt is one that we have had since the beginning of this country, where \nwe have attempted to strike that balance, where the Founding Fathers, \nwhen they gathered in Philadelphia, debated long and hard about how to \nmaintain our civil liberties but at the same time provide the Federal \nGovernment enough power to do the things that only the Federal \nGovernment can do, such as protect our national security.\n  So it is not a new debate. I think, indeed, the debate is healthy. \nBut it bothers me when we begin to see those who would use scare \ntactics to mislead the American people about their civil liberties \nbeing in jeopardy because of the existence of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Indeed, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, with whom I serve on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, asked the American Civil Liberties \nUnion, ACLU, if they could document a single instance--just one--of the \ncivil liberties of the American people being in jeopardy or being \ntrampled upon because of the PATRIOT Act. She said it was reported back \nto her that they could come up with none. Zero. Zip.\n  That troubles me a great deal because of another thing I would like \nto mention, which is a solicitation I happened to receive in the \nmailbox at my residence from the American Civil Liberties Union, which \nattempted to use the PATRIOT Act as a fundraising tool by scaring the \nreader, saying that somehow the PATRIOT Act was jeopardizing their \ncivil liberties, and indeed the only way the American people could \nprotect themselves against the trampling of their civil liberties was \nto send money to the ACLU so they could fight against the PATRIOT Act \non behalf of our civil liberties.\n  That solicitation troubled me a great deal. I cannot honestly say \nthat it surprised me because we know that fear is a powerful motivator \nand, indeed, there are those who use fear to raise money for a variety \nof purposes. But I think it is important that the facts be known, and \nthe fact is what Senator Feinstein pointed out before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee; that when put to the test and asked to document a \nsingle instance of a violation of the civil liberties of any American \ncitizen as a result of the passage of the PATRIOT Act, the ACLU could \nnot come up with any.\n  So it is deeply disturbing but perhaps not surprising to see them \ntake a contrary position, one designed to help them raise money and \ngrow their membership in a mail solicitation sent to my home and, no \ndoubt, to many other people in this country.\n  We also know that there are those in the political arena who would \nuse the PATRIOT Act to scare the American people into believing that \nsomehow President Bush, the Republican leadership in this Congress, or \nperhaps even Attorney General John Ashcroft who has taken a solemn oath \nto defend the laws of the United States, including the Constitution, \nindeed including the PATRIOT Act, that they would use the PATRIOT Act \nto scare people and to cause them to question the commitment of the \nleadership of this Nation of providing for the security of the American \npeople, but at the same time question their commitment to protecting \nthe civil liberties of the American people.\n  It is discouraging to see that sort of rhetoric. Ultimately, I \nbelieve the American people--they get it. If given the facts, they will \nmake their own decision, and it will be a good decision based upon \nfactual information. The problem is when people misstate the facts or \nsimply mislead the American people and provide them false information, \nit is hard to reach the right conclusion if you do not have accurate \ninformation. That is why I sought to stand here today and talk about \nwhat the facts really are.\n  One last example I will give you, Mr. President, is about how much \nthis rhetoric of fear, the scare tactics have been successful. I \nbelieve at last count, there were 317 city councils across this \ncountry, the governing body of cities across this country, that have \npassed resolutions condemning the USA PATRIOT Act because they fear \nthat the existence of the act has somehow compromised the civil \nliberties of their constituents.\n  I say that because it is a grave concern when public officials use \nthe bully pulpit that we are provided by virtue of our office to \nprovide their constituents with false information, whether wittingly or \nunwittingly, and it would be my sincere hope that each of those 317 \ncity governments would reconsider their decisions in light of the \ninformation I have shared with you this afternoon and that others would \nbe glad to share with anyone.\n  The truth is, we are a diverse country. We have different \nexperiences. We come from different regions. We have different \ntraditions in many ways, but we are all Americans. We are all committed \nto our national security and the protection of our people, just as we \nare dedicated to the protection of the civil liberties of every \nAmerican. While we may have a variety of opinions about the wisdom of \nthis or any other legislation or any other course of action, everyone \nis entitled to their opinion, but no one is entitled to mislead the \nAmerican people about the facts.\n  In conclusion, if this body were to take up this legislation quickly, \nas I hope it will, and were to pass this legislation that would repeal \nthe sunset provision in the PATRIOT Act, which would otherwise cause \nportions of the act to cease to exist at the end of next year, if we \nwere to pass this legislation in a consensus, bipartisan fashion, it \nwould send a powerful message to our enemies that our determination \nremains strong, that we remain resolved to do whatever is necessary to \nprotect the American people, whether it is by defending them from the \nterrorists who would strike us at home by breaking up terrorist cells, \nby getting good intelligence and other information we need in order to \ndefeat the terrorists before they can attack, such as they did so \ntragically on 9/11, or whether the issue is our resolve to finish the \njob we have started in Iraq and to honor those who have sacrificed so \nmuch to protect our national security and to make sure that the \nblessings of liberty are exported beyond our borders to the people of \nIraq who have previously known only oppression and tyranny at the hands \nof a terrible tyrant such as Saddam Hussein.\n  I thank the Chair for the time I have been given to talk on this \nimportant subject.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Senator Baucus (D-MT): ``I believe the bill we passed today \n     balances the needs of protecting the country from terrorism \n     and protecting our rights as citizens of this great \n     country.'' (Senator Baucus, Press Release, October 25, 2001)\n       Senator Schumer (D-NY): ``If there is one key word that \n     underscores this bill, it is `balance.' ... The balance \n     between the need to update our laws given the new challenges \n     and the need to maintain our basic freedoms which distinguish \n     us from our enemies is real.'' (Senator Schumer, \n     Congressional Record, October 25, 2001)\n       Senator Schumer (D-NY): ``[T]he scourge of terrorism is \n     going to be with us for a while. Law enforcement has a lot of \n     catching up to do. There is no question about it. In this \n     bill, at least, we give them fair and adequate tools that do \n     not infringe on our freedoms but, at the same time, allow \n     them to catch up lot more quickly.'' (Senator Schumer, \n     Congressional Record, October 25, 2001)\n       Senator Levin (D-MI): `[T]he antiterrorism bill [Patriot \n     Act] which the Senate is about to pass reflects the \n     sentiments the American people have expressed since the \n     events of September 11--that we must act swiftly and strongly \n     to defend our country without sacrificing our most cherished \n     values. The Senate antiterrorism legislation meets that test. \n     It responds to these dangerous times by giving law \n     enforcement agencies important new tools to use in combating \n     terrorism without denigrating the principles of due process \n     and fairness embedded in our Constitution.'' (Senator Levin, \n     Congressional Record, October 25, 2001)\n       Senator Daschle (D-SD): ``This reflects the balance between \n     protection of civil liberties and privacy with the need for \n     greater law enforcement.'' (Leon Bruneau, ``U.S. Senate \n     Passes Anti-Terror Bill, Sends it to Bush for Signature,'' \n     Agence France-Press, October 25, 2001)\n       Senator Biden (D-DE): ``The agreement reached has satisfied \n     me that these provisions will not upset the balance between \n     strong law enforcement and protection of our valued civil \n     liberties.'' (Senator Biden, Congressional Record, October \n     25, 2001)\n       Senator Feinstein (D-CA): ``As we look back at this \n     massive, terrible incident on September 11, we try to \n     ascertain whether our Government had the tools necessary to \n     ferret out the intelligence that could have, perhaps avoided \n     those events. The only answer all of us could come up with, \n     after having briefing after briefing, is we did not have\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\n     those tools. This bill aims to change that. This bill is a \n     bill whose time has come. This bill is a necessary bill.

Mr. President, May 31 is Memorial Day, the day we set aside \neach year to remember and to honor those men and women who gave their \nlives in service to our Nation.\n  Memorial Day used to be called Decoration Day in the old South--the \nday that we reminisce in our memories of our past, our locking with \nhands or words our lives with others, our children, grandchildren, and \npeople whose voice is forever stilled.\n  This year, this day has even more meaning as we once again find our \nmen and women in uniform engaged in hostilities in Afghanistan and \nIraq.\n  Freedom does not come cheap. It is too often paid for not only in \ndollars but in the lives of America's best sons and daughters.\n  All across the Nation out there, all across the prairies, the plains, \nthe green valleys, the mountains, the rivers, the rust belt, the East, \nthe North, the South, and the West--all across the Nation, families \nwill be visiting the gravesites of their loved ones.\n  Long, long be our hearts of such memories filled like the vase in \nwhich roses have once been distilled. You may break, you may shatter, \nthe vase if you will, but the scent of the roses will hang round it \nstill.\n  Among rows of tombstones adorned with small American flags, they will \nlay wreathes and pay their respects to those who have served our \ncountry with honor and distinction in our Nation's wars.\n  This national tribute will provide the opportunity for mothers and \nfathers not only to tell their children about the sacrifices of their \nancestors and relatives but also to pass on valuable lessons about \nhistory and about humanity. But even when our world is beset with the \nworst of human nature, the best of human nature can rise above it all.\n  I am reminded today of the story of the ``Immortal Chaplains'' of \nWorld War II, Rev. George I. Fox, Rev. Clark V. Poling, Father John P. \nWashington, and Rabbi Alexander D. Goode. When the U.S troopship \nDorchester was torpedoed by a Nazi submarine, with only minutes to \nlive, these four chaplains calmly handed out what lifejackets there \nwere on the ship to the panicking passengers, the soldiers and sailors. \nWhen they ran out of life preservers to hand out, what did these four \nchaplains do?\n  Can you see it? Can you envision a moment like that?\n  They took off their own life preservers and gave them away. They gave \nthem to others so others might live.\n  Then, as the Dorchester was sinking, what did they do? They locked \narms and prayed, and sank to their watery graves. They prayed, locked \narms, and went to their watery graves.\n\n  While some among us might not hesitate to take off that life \npreserver and give it to our spouse, certainly, our child, or a parent, \nhow many of us would give it to a stranger, as did the immortal \nchaplains. Self-sacrifice, unity, and respect for each other and each \nother's faith were the qualities they displayed that night, and in so \ndoing these four chaplains of four different faiths demonstrated their \ndeep faith in God and they honored the mission of our great Nation.\n  These four chaplains, as I say, were of different faiths. Two were \nProtestant ministers, was one a Jewish rabbi, and the fourth was a \nRoman Catholic priest. But they were united as one in their devotion to \ntheir Maker, their love for their fellow man, and their willingness to \nsacrifice so that others might live. It was these convictions that \ninspired one of the most memorable events not just of World War II but \nof all time.\n  Memorials in their honor have been built in the country. The U.S. War \nDepartment posthumously awarded them the Distinguished Service Crosses. \nThe U.S. Postal Service issued a special stamp to commemorate their \nsacrifice. Congress has honored them by authorizing the Four Chaplains \nMedal and with a resolution designating a Four Chaplains Day.\n  Think about it. Amidst all the great and important military leaders \nsuch as Generals Patton, MacArthur, and Eisenhower, amidst all the \ngreat and powerful political leaders of that war such as Franklin \nRoosevelt and Winston Churchill, we also remember these four humble men \nof God.\n  Yes, think about it. Amidst all of the destruction and all of the \ncarnage of that war, destruction, and carnage in the form of an \nAuschwitz, Pearl Harbor, Dresden, and Hiroshima, we remember the \nimmortal chaplains for their act of kindness and mercy.\n  Yes, think about it. Amidst all the misery and tragedy of that war, \namidst all the hate and all the horror of that war, we still remember \nthe four chaplains and their act of heroism and love.\n  Today, a half century later, we again find ourselves in a terrified \nworld, a world that we did not seek, a terrifying world, a world that \nwe did not want but one in which we must endure if we are to prevail. \nWar, disease, crime, and terrorism have transformed our land into a \ncode red world.\n  Every generation has its turmoil. That is, sadly, the way of the \nworld. And this particular terrifying era of adversity and challenge in \nwhich we now find ourselves, we would do well to bear in mind those \nimmortal chaplains, the four who refused to succumb to fear and \nperformed selfless acts of kindness and mercy.\n  They truly, truly personified the greatest of men in all generations. \nThe sacrifice of those four men endures as an inspiring act of \nhumanity. For as Jesus said: Greater love hath no man than this, that a \nman lay down his life for another.\n  So on this Memorial Day, we will pray as we remember those American \nservice men and women who now stand in harm's way yonder on the other \nside, yonder in a faraway land. We will pray for those who are serving \nour Nation in the dangerous climates of Iraq and Afghanistan. They are \ndoing their duty for the families they love, and we will pray for their \nfamilies and for the families who have already lost loved ones, who \ndaily see that empty chair at the table, the chair which never again \nwill be filled, that place at the table which will forever be empty.\n  And as we pray, we will recall the words of the Scriptures from Psalm \n127: ``Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build \nit: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.''\n  So I close with lines written by Joyce Kilmer.\n\n                        ``Dulce et Decorum Est''\n\n     The bugle echoes shrill and sweet,\n     But not of war it sings to-day.\n     The road is rhythmic with the feet\n     Of men-at-arms who come to pray.\n\n     The roses blossom white and red\n     On tombs where weary soldiers lie;\n     Flags wave above the honored dead\n     And martial music cleaves the sky.\n\n     Above their wreath-strewn graves we kneel,\n     They kept the faith and fought the fight.\n     Through flying lead and crimson steel\n     They plunged for Freedom and the Right.\n\n     May we, their grateful children, learn\n     Their strength, who lie beneath this sod,\n     Who went through fire and death to earn\n     At last the accolade of God.\n\n     In shining rank on rank arrayed\n     They march, the legions of the Lord;\n     He is their Captain unafraid,\n     The Prince of Peace . . . Who brought a sword.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Memorial Day is always a time for our \ncountry to gratefully remember the brave men and women and their \nfamilies who risked their lives in defense of our country and our \nfundamental American values.\n  This year is a special time because we will dedicate a long awaited \nnational memorial for the 16 million men and women who fought in World \nWar II, including the 400,000 Americans who paid the ultimate sacrifice \nfor their country during the war. Almost 234,000 West Virginians served \nin World War II. At that time, it was 36 percent of the Mountain \nState's male population,\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\nand that was the fourth highest participation rate in the country. They \ndeserve this national tribute. Indeed it is long past due.\n  There are 4 million living World War II veterans who should be proud \nand honored this Memorial Day. The families of veterans who are no \nlonger with us should take pride to remember the sacrifice of their \nloved ones, and share those stories with relatives and friends. Such \nmemories are important to pass down to the next generation who can take \ninspiration from the ordeals and triumphs of their own family members \nwho were part of our ``Greatest Generation.''\n  The World War II Memorial which will be formally dedicated on May \n29th is the end result of an almost 20-year fight. I am honored that I \nwas able to cast a vote to help complete it. It will be an enduring, \npoignant reminder of the tens of thousands of individual and collective \ninstances of leadership and sacrifice during World War II\n  Today that tradition of leadership and sacrifice continues as so many \nAmericans, including scores of West Virginians serve in the Armed \nForces, the National Guard and Army Reserves. Each member of the \nmilitary, wherever they are stationed are defending our country and \nprotecting American values, but we are especially mindful of our \nmilitary personnel serving in regions of conflict like Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They are the new generation of West Virginia veterans who \ndeserve our admiration and respect.\n  As we celebrate Memorial Day Weekend, I hope we all take some time to \nremember what the holiday is truly about. This is a day designed to \nhonor all the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend \nand protect the American way of life, from the beaches of Normandy to \nthe deserts of Iraq. Their sacrifice deserves our eternal gratitude and \nsupport not just on Memorial Day, but every day.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Memorial \nDay and pay tribute to the brave men and women who have given their \nlives in defense of the freedom and liberties we cherish in this great \nNation.\n  Throughout this country, Memorial Day, originally recognized as \nDecoration Day, is a day to remember those who have died in service to \nour Nation.\n  It was first widely observed on May 30, 1868, to commemorate the \nsacrifices of Civil War soldiers by proclamation of General John A. \nLogan of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of former \nsailors and soldiers. Over a century later, in 1971, Congress declared \nMemorial Day a national holiday to be celebrated the last Monday in \nMay. Today, thousands of people attend Memorial Day ceremonies across \nthe country to commemorate this special day.\n  This year, our observance of this national holiday is marked by the \nopening of the National World War II Memorial in our Nation's capital. \nAuthorized by President Clinton in 1993, this national memorial will be \nthe first of its kind dedicated to all who served during World War II.\n  It is during this Memorial Day weekend, in conjunction with the new \nmemorial dedication, that Americans will honor the nearly 16 million \nwho served in the Armed Forces of the United States during World War \nII, the more than 400,000 who died, and the millions who supported the \nwar effort from home.\n  According to the Department of Defense, more citizens from California \nserved in World War II than any other State. And an estimated 457,000 \nWorld War II veterans currently live in California. That generation, \nled by the Nation's Armed Forces, defended America's ideals during \nWorld War II and changed the world in the process.\n  At this moment, another generation faces an equally difficult \nchallenge that will define the world for many years to come. Today, we \nface a new foe, terrorism, which threatens the very freedoms that World \nWar II was fought to protect. The battleground this time is less clear. \nIndeed, the threat of terrorism exists all over the world--not merely \nin the Middle East, but also on our shores.\n  The war on terror is a massive effort that will require the highest \nlevel of commitment and dedication possible to enable America and her \nallies to prevail. Today over 1.6 million men and women serve in active \nduty spread throughout 67 countries. California alone provides over \n182,000 military and civilian personnel.\n  In Afghanistan, American troops, along with a multinational \ncoalition, have defeated the Taliban regime, striking a severe blow to \nal-Qaida's operation in that country. Our forces have enabled Afghans \nto draft a constitution, laying the groundwork for a democratic \ngovernment. Women will soon have the right to vote and hold office. \nGirls are being educated in schools again. Nonetheless, there is still \nmuch work to be done to secure the country and ensure the basic rights \nof Afghan citizens.\n  The military success in Afghanistan has not come without sacrifice. \nNo example drives home this point more than the death of Army Ranger \nPat Tillman, killed in action a few weeks ago while on a mission in \nsoutheastern Afghanistan.\n  Tillman, a native of San Jose, California, was an All-American \nfootball player at Arizona State who later went on to play \nprofessionally with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals.\n  At the height of his career, he walked away from pro football to \nserve his country during wartime. On April 23, 2004, Tillman became one \nof 110 U.S. soldiers killed during Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan. His life was a model of sacrifice.\n  The war in Iraq has proven to be an even more difficult task. \nAlthough our Armed Forces have removed Saddam Hussein from power and \ntaken steps to set up a transitional democratic government run by the \npeople of Iraq, our troops are in a very dangerous situation. It is \nrare that a day goes by without the report of another American who has \nfallen victim to the attacks of Iraqi insurgents. As of May 21, 92 \nCalifornians have lost their lives in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  One of them was Marine Lance Corporal Brad Shuder, 21, of El Dorado \nHills, east of Sacramento. He enlisted a month after the September 11, \n2001 terrorist attacks and fought in the invasion of Iraq last year \nbefore returning for a second tour.\n  Shuder, a South Korean native, was adopted at 22 months and grew up \nto be a gourmet cook and opera lover. He was killed on April 12 of this \nyear.\n  I would also like to take a moment to name the other Californians who \nhave given their lives in Iraq.\n  Specialist Marcos O.

And more than 4,800 men and women have been wounded \nin these conflicts.\n  Such grim statistics underscore the fact that the current \nadministration must do more to seek international help, especially in \nIraq, during these trying times. Additionally, we must provide the \nequipment necessary to keep our soldiers safe. At the very least, we \nowe our soldiers this for their tremendous sacrifice.\n  In closing, I am honored to take this time to join every American in \nsaluting those individuals who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to \nuphold the ideals of our democratic Nation.\n  On Memorial Day, we renew the commitment of this great Nation to the \ncommon defense of the country and to the broader causes of peace and \nfreedom from tyranny throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6076-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, today I would like to discuss a major \n40-page white paper my office has now released about the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs overseas, and the larger challenge it represents to our \neconomic future. The paper attempts to reach beyond the current debate \nand focus on the next wave of this challenge, which potentially could \naffect high end research and development jobs, as well as manufacturing \nand call center jobs. The implications of this trend are profound: it \nthreatens America's competitive advantage in an era when the entire \nworld is competing based on free enterprise economics and open trade--\none of our longstanding goals.\n  Seen in this light, the challenge is more fundamental, and requires \nthat we fundamentally rethink America's competitiveness strategy over \nthe long-term. What we have thought was our nation's ultimate \ncompetitive advantage--our high end R prowess--may be challenged.\n  There has been little informed discussion of the fundamental long \nterm challenge of offshoring high end engineering, research and \ndevelopment jobs. Nor have many acknowledged how our nation's \nirresponsible fiscal policy has undermined U.S. competitiveness. The \ndebate needs to focus on our own needs and solutions, and not simply \ndecry other countries and their industries for rising to challenge us \nin the global economy.\n  To meet this challenge, we have to face some hard facts. The American \neconomy may be failing to adapt to fundamental changes and to growing \ncompetition in the global economy. We are not just losing jobs--we may \nbe losing critical parts of our innovation infrastructure, and with \nthem, our competitive edge in the global marketplace. The offshore \noutsourcing of jobs is just the tip of an economic iceberg that America \nis sailing towards.\n  Here is one measurement of the size of it. An analysis by the \nInstitute of Business and Economic Research at UC Berkeley estimates \nthat 14 million American jobs are at risk. If that's accurate, our \neconomic vitality and national security are in jeopardy. As the \nPresident's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology concluded \nrecently, ``Maintenance of U.S. technical preeminence is not forever \nassured.'' Carly Fiorina put it more succinctly and memorably: ``There \nis no job that is America's God given right anymore.''\n  How do we reassert our world economic leadership and regain our \ninnovation advantage in a more competitive world? And how do we do so \nwithout turning a blind eye to the very real\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\npain that many American workers are feeling as a result of the churning \nin the global job market? These are the big questions we must answer \ntogether--private and public sectors, business and labor, even \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents.\n  But first, we have to better understand what is occurring. \nOutsourcing is not new. It is really just a variation of the division \nof labor, a defining feature of capitalism. In a competitive \nmarketplace, with its premium on efficiency, businesses naturally focus \ntheir limited resources on their most profitable operations while \nsubcontracting--or outsourcing--functions that can be performed more \nefficiently and cheaply elsewhere. Jobs shift as a result.\n  What is new about outsourcing today is its global reach. \nTechnological innovations in transportation and communication have \nerased geographic borders. Physical proximity to the point of sale is \nno longer the absolute economic necessity it used to be, particularly \nfor service jobs.\n  We know that manufacturing jobs have been shifting overseas for some \ntime. But now the services sector is being hit hard by offshore \noutsourcing--and that hurts. The services sector provides 83 percent of \nAmerica's jobs, employing 86 million people. It dominates our economy. \nCustomer call centers and data entry facilities are being relocated to \nplaces where capable labor can be found at lower wage levels. High-\nspeed digital technologies make a connection between Boston and \nBangalore as fast as between Boston and Baltimore.\n  But offshoring is no longer limited to entry-level services jobs. \nHigher skilled professional jobs like computer chip design, \nprogramming, architecture, engineering, consulting, automotive design, \nand pharmaceutical research are beginning to go overseas. That is the \nbulk of the iceberg below the surface of the sea. The outsourcing of \nR is probably the most alarming illustration of this new problem. \nAmerican companies now invest $17 billion in R abroad every year. IT \nmultinationals have now established 223 R centers in China alone.\n  One study by Forrester Research estimates that over the next 15 \nyears, 3.3 million U.S. service jobs and $136 billion in wages will \nmove offshore. Another by McKinsey's Global Institute suggests that the \nnumber of U.S. services jobs lost to offshoring will accelerate at an \nannual rate of 30 to 40 percent during the next five years.\n  Because the government collects no official data on offshore \noutsourcing in the services sector, we cannot be at all certain of \nthese figures. But we can be certain that, although the offshore \noutsourcing problem in the high-end services sector may not be acute at \nthe moment, it will be in the near future if current trends continue. \nIf a software programmer in India earning $7,000 a year can do the same \nwork as a software programmer in the United States making $64,000 a \nyear, it is only a matter of time before more of those jobs relocate \noverseas.\n  The Washington response to offshore outsourcing has been predictable: \npoliticians and policy makers jump to predetermined conclusions and \nfinger the usual suspects.\n  On the one hand, we have the do nothings who profess an abiding and \nabsolute faith in laissez faire capitalism, and see any government \nintervention as self-defeating. In fact, they argue that jobs flowing \noverseas are healthy, that they are evidence that the system is \nworking, and that we have nothing to worry about.\n  The problem with this view, of course, is that we do have something \nto worry about. Not only does rising unemployment take a real human \ntoll, it also eats away at our ability to create new jobs. Advanced \nproduction capabilities and research and development jobs are strategic \nassets that have defined our nation's competitive advantage. While \nproximity to the point of sale is less critical, geography still \nmatters in the innovation process. Countries and regions that cluster \nuniversity and industry research, knowledge-based start-ups, capital \nfor entrepreneurs support from larger firms, and advanced \nmanufacturing--with the talent to support all of this capture new \nindustries.\n  As we lose jobs to foreign countries, especially high-skilled \nservices jobs, we lose critical parts of our innovation \ninfrastructure--labor, capital, knowledge, facilities, and technology--\nand with them, the engine of job creation. To cash in on our crops, we \nare moving the farm--and with it, the promise of future economic \nharvests.\n  On the other hand, you have the do anythings who will do anything \nthat might save some jobs today, even if it means losing more tomorrow. \nProtectionism is their favorite tool--raising higher and higher trade \nbarriers on the unproven argument that it will make it harder and \nharder for jobs to go overseas.\n  In their attempts to build a tall wall to stop offshore outsourcing, \nthe do anythings are falling into a trap. Trying to keep jobs in our \nown borders through protectionist measures will only keep other jobs \nout. It will also invite retaliation from beyond our borders that will \ncost us many of the millions of American jobs that are based on \nexports.\n  The bottom line is that both the do nothings and the do anythings are \nwrong. Neither gets to the heart of the outsourcing problem--America's \nfailure to innovate. That's what we all need to do something--the right \nthing--about.\n  To stop offshore outsourcing and preserve American jobs, America \nneeds to rise to the international competition and grow again through \ninnovation. There is no other way. Leaving it all to the markets won't \nwork. Hiding behind a wall won't work. Attempting to rig the game won't \nwork. Only education, innovation, investment, trade, training and hard \nwork will give us the growth and jobs we want and need.\n  In my white paper, I lay out a number of suggestions about how we can \nachieve this. Let me highlight a few.\n  First, we must encourage greater innovation and technology \ndevelopment. Basic research and development have been essential to \ncreating the kind of technological breakthroughs that create jobs and \nreap profits. But the high costs and high risk associated with early \nstage R make the needed investments burdensome for many businesses. \nFederal funding is crucial here, but federal R spending as a percent \nof GDP has been in steady decline since the mid-1960's--it is less than \nhalf of what it was then.\n  We need to reinvest in R And we need to reorganize our innovation \necosystem to bring on innovations much faster. Tax incentives for R \ninvestment are one means of doing so. We should make the R tax credit \npermanent, and restructure it to spur collaborative research.\n  We also need to look at the kind of R we do. Although the United \nStates is overwhelmingly a service economy, our federal and corporate \nR is geared to manufacturing. Corporate R is now 68 percent of the \ntotal national R expenditures--and 62 percent of that amount is still \nfocused on manufacturing. But much of the offshore outsourcing \nchallenge will hit our services sector. That is why we must add a new \nservices sector emphasis to our R investments. Government and \nindustry should review their R portfolios and raise their investments \nin services research.\n  Second, we must recognize that no matter how much we innovate, some \npeople are going to lose the jobs they have now. We need to shore up \nour safety nets to help those hurt by offshore outsourcing. We need, \nfor example, to extend coverage of Trade Adjustment Assistance programs \nto support and retrain service workers who lose their jobs due to \ntrade. We should also experiment with new concepts like wage loss \ninsurance, offered as part of severance and paid for by a small \npercentage of the employer's savings from offshoring.\n  Third, we need to strengthen our trade policies. America will prosper \nby selling high value goods and services to other nations, not by \nshutting ourselves off from competition and markets. We need to \ninnovate new goods and services and lower trade barriers abroad to \nstart to reverse our trade deficits, so trade becomes a net jobs \ninsourcer--not a net outsourcer. Overseas markets for American exports \nare critical to our economic well-being, already directly supporting 12 \nmillion American jobs and indirectly many, many more. We can't lose \nthose jobs. We can and must add to them.\n  But pirates do prey in international economic waters, stealing \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\njobs by breaking trade rules or exploiting trade loopholes. We need to \ncrackdown on cheating--and that will take strong government action. Our \nFederal trade agencies are oriented to negotiating trade agreements; \nthey focus less on the difficult implementation and enforcement of \nthose agreements. We must do both.\n  Foreign currency manipulation and intellectual property theft are \nforms of piracy that also must be fought and stopped.\n  To illustrate the impact of unfair trade practices on American \ncompetitiveness, and what we can do about it, let me discuss one sector \nI have followed over the years--semiconductors, the highest end of U.S. \nmanufacturing. In the 1980's, America was close to losing this sector \nto Japan. But we battled back, and thanks to innovations that grew from \na creative public-private partnership called Sematech, we secured our \nworld semiconductor dominance. It provided a key boost to our growth \nrate and IT leadership in the 90's.\n  But now, we are at risk of losing that dominance--this time to China. \nThe Chinese government is using straight industrial subsidies to \ncapture semiconductors: from value-added tax subsidies--which are in \nviolation of WTO agreements--to plant subsidies, to worker subsidies. \nChina's currency manipulation further skews the competition.\n  After neglecting this issue for too long, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative finally insisted in March on consultations with the \nChinese on VAT subsidies for semiconductors. If these talks fail, we \nshould not hesitate to bring a WTO case against China. The loss of most \nof our semiconductor industry will not only weaken our economy--it will \nthreaten our national security. The U.S. Department of Defense needs to \nreenter the R field with industry and work to spur new semiconductor \nadvances.\n  Fourth, our talent base is what ultimately sizes our economy, yet the \nnumber of U.S. graduates in engineering and physical science is \ndropping 1 percent a year. In China, 45 percent of all graduating \nstudents received their degree in engineering. In the United States, \nit's only 5 percent. Education reforms are no longer a policy option \nfor us. They are a necessity, from kindergarten through university \ndiploma.\n  We also need a whole new approach to job training. This century, 60 \npercent of the new jobs will require skills held by only 20 percent of \ntoday's workforce. That is one huge skills gap that we must fill fast \nif we want to remain competitive. One way to do so is to build stronger \npartnerships between companies and community colleges to ensure workers \nget the training they need. Increasing the number of graduates in \nscience, technology, engineering and mathematics through incentive \ngrants and special scholarships is another way to fill the skills gap.\n  Updating our methods of training to 21st century standards is also \nimportant. One way to do so is to train workers by using interactive \ninternet gaming technology to foster better knowledge retention, \npromote continual skills updating, and even have fun. IT has \ntransformed many sectors--it is time it got to training.\n  Finally, we need to get our federal fiscal house in order. Our \nstaggering $550 billion current annual deficit, and the course we are \non to add $10 trillion to the deficit in the next decade, will \neventually raise interest rates. The Medicare Trustees told us last \nmonth that our unfunded liabilities are $72 trillion. That's right--$72 \ntrillion. Meanwhile, other nations are buying our debt and are \nacquiring too much influence over our future. Foreign nationals hold 46 \npercent of the U.S. national debt. China and Japan together hold $662 \nbillion. We must get our fiscal house in order to stay strong, \nindependent and competitive.\n  To begin to act on such proposals and meet the challenges of offshore \noutsourcing, we first need an injection of political will--bipartisan \npolitical will--and that's not easy to find in Washington these days.\n  In the mid-1980's, we faced a similar political deadlock on economic \npolicy. We were in the midst of a recession and our two political \nparties were driven to the opposite poles of economic policy. \nRepublicans favored deeper and deeper tax cuts to stimulate job growth \nwhile sending the deficit through the roof. Democrats pushed for more \nprotectionism and an industrial policy. Neither side thought it could \ncompromise without risking the support of its political base. It sounds \nfamiliar, doesn't it?\n  The creation of a bipartisan commission that focused on the \nunemployment problem in a cool-headed, depoliticized way helped to \nbreak the deadlock. The President's Commission on Industrial \nCompetitiveness, known as the ``Young Commission,'' was proposed by \nPresident Reagan, supported by the Democratic Congress, and chaired by \nHelwett-Packard CEO John Young. It brought all sides to the table and \nforced each to acknowledge the hard facts that shaped the debate.\n  That Commission proposed the first generation of reforms that became \na bipartisan competitiveness agenda. Public-private collaborations \ninstead of industrial supports, R investments in information \ntechnology, became a foundation for the economic boom of the 90's.\n  That is exactly the kind of initiative we need today: a new Young \nCommission, charged with analyzing the impact of global economic \nchanges on the American economy, including the offshore outsourcing \nproblem, and offering nonpartisan proposals to preserve our innovation \ninfrastructure and create more high-wage American jobs.\n  We face a dramatically different set of economic competitors now than \nin the 80's. We have a much more complex set of competitive problems. \nThat's why we need a new generation of competitive solutions if we are \ngoing to restore our economic leadership. Some of these solutions will \nlook similar to the kinds I am proposing in my white paper today. Some \nmay not. But regardless, a consensus must be built that would rule out \nthe extremes and rule in the progressive course needed to meet the new \nforeign competition.\n  At the beginning of the last century, America faced equally profound \neconomic and social changes. In his inaugural address, President \nTheodore Roosevelt noted that, ``Modern Life is both complex and \nintense. And the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary \nindustrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber \nof our social and political being.''\n  He went on to say that, ``There is no good reason why we should fear \nthe future. But there is every reason why we should face it seriously--\nneither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems before us, \nnor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending, unflinching \npurpose to solve them.''\n  To meet the challenge of offshore outsourcing, we need to summon up \nthe same honesty, seriousness, and sense of national purpose that TR \ncalled for a century ago. If we do, I am confident we will prevail, the \nAmerican economy will keep on growing, and the next generation of \nAmericans will live better and better lives.\n  To conclude, I would like to submit for the record for the benefit of \nmy colleagues a summary of the white paper, which is posted on my \nSenate website with the title ``Offshore Outsourcing and America's \nCompetitive Edge: Losing out in the High Technology R and Services \nSectors,'' that my staff and I have worked on in the hope it will \nstimulate a better, broader response to the long-term implications of \noffshore outsourcing. I want to thank my staffers Elka Koehler, Sara \nHagigh, Bill Bonvillian, and Chuck Ludlam for their work on this \nreport.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the white paper \nsummary in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                         Summary of White Paper\n\n       The United States has enjoyed unparalleled technological \n     leadership for decades. Our capacity for innovation has \n     continued to create jobs and raise living standards despite \n     the ongoing migration of manufacturing to foreign nations in \n     the past decade. However, a new, potentially more dangerous \n     migration is upon us. The rising trend of outsourcing high \n     technology manufacturing and high-end services jobs to \n     overseas presents a new and fundamentally different \n     phenomenon. This new trend is far bigger and more complicated \n     than the current debate suggests. Key components of our \n     innovation infrastructure such as knowledge and capital have \n     become highly mobile. If our engineering, design, and \n     research and development (R) capabilities continue to \n     follow the manufacturing and services facilities going \n     abroad,\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\n     our competitiveness will be weakened, putting our economic \n     prosperity and national security at risk.\n       The offshoring of facilities, labor, capital, technology, \n     and information not only hurts our workers, but also \n     threatens the backbone of our knowledge-based economy. \n     Emerging nations such as China and India have realized that \n     technological leadership leads to economic prosperity. Their \n     governments are committed to attracting business investments, \n     technology transfer, and knowledge inflow into their \n     countries through industrial policies, subsidies, and \n     business incentives. The offshoring trend will most likely \n     accelerate and spread as more U.S. companies figure out how \n     to efficiently exploit these incentives, not to mention the \n     large pools of educated low cost foreign labor. Enabled by \n     high speed telecommunication connections, the recent \n     migration of labor-intensive services jobs was primarily \n     motivated by the potential of up to a 90% savings in labor \n     costs.\n       The innovation structure that served us well in the face of \n     less formidable competition is no longer sufficient in the \n     face of this new fierce global competition. Key components of \n     our innovation infrastructure are deteriorating as federal \n     funding of R, the number of science and technology \n     graduates, and business investments in the U.S. continue to \n     decline. Our innovation capacity is further undermined by the \n     massive budget deficits which threaten future federal \n     investments in R and education, and increase our \n     exposure to currency manipulation by foreign lenders. This \n     subsequently leads to the loss of manufacturing and \n     service jobs. Our competitiveness is further comprised by \n     international trade agreements that are not adequately \n     enforced when our trade partners fail to live up to their \n     commitments.\n       We can no longer afford to continue in this \n     Administration's path of denial and inaction. There are no \n     assurances that we will remain a global leader in innovation, \n     and maintain our jobs, our standard of living, and our global \n     market share. If our current employment and education trends \n     are an indication of where we are heading, we will eventually \n     fall behind those countries that are aggressively investing \n     in their people, education, R, and businesses.\n       It is time to begin a national debate on restoring U.S. \n     competitiveness so that we can remain at the cutting edge of \n     innovation. This report presents a five part strategy to \n     addresss offshoring, including developing policies that \n     encourage greater investments in federal and industrial R, \n     K-16 education and lifelong training, commercialization and \n     businesses, and technological infrastructures such as \n     broadband. Concurrently, it is essential that we assist our \n     displaced workforce by extending compensation benefits and \n     providing rapid retraining programs. We need to confront \n     emerging nations that are aspiring to lead by fighting for \n     greater access to overseas markets for goods and services, \n     enforcing fair trade practices, and vigorously defending our \n     intellectual property rights. Lastly, we must address our \n     nation's irresponsible fiscal policy which makes us dependent \n     on foreign purchases of U.S. securities and facilitates \n     currency manipulation, further exacerbating the loss of our \n     manufacturing and services jobs. By taking these proactive \n     steps, we can create an environment that enables Americans to \n     invent and develop the future waves of innovations that will \n     keep quality jobs in U.S. shores.\n       Following is a summary of my five-part strategy to address \n     offshoring.\n\n     1. IMPROVE SAFETY NETS TO ASSIST AFFECTED WORKERS\n\n       Extend coverage of Trade Adjustment Assistance programs to \n     support and retrain displaced services workers\n       Provide 3 months notice to workers when they lose their \n     jobs to offshoring\n       Encourage corporate-sponsored insurance for wage loss\n       Encourage proactive instead of reactive training, \n     continuous skills updating (e.g. use of Internet gaming and \n     other technologies)\n       Provide agile and rapid retraining for displaced workforce\n       Reform and enforce guest visa regulations\n\n     2. ENCOURAGE GREATER INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT\n\n       Increase federal funding in R, particularly early stage \n     R\n       Encourage corporate investment in R (e.g. permanent and \n     improved collaborative R tax credits)\n       Greater emphasis on services sector in R investments\n       Innovation in services (e.g. greater integration of IT \n     advances in sectors such as healthcare, construction and \n     education services)\n       Invest in broadband infrastructure\n       Create environment that rewards risk taken by firms (e.g. \n     eliminate capital gains for new investments in small \n     companies; ``make it in USA'' tax incentives to domestic \n     firms; accelerate asset depreciation schedules)\n\n     3. INVEST IN HUMAN CAPITAL THROUGH EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\n       Revitalize workforce training and education by bridging \n     institutional gaps between education and industry\n       Expand R tax credit to encourage industry-university \n     collaboration on science and technology research\n       Stronger partnerships between companies and community \n     colleges for worker training\n       Increase graduates in science, technology, engineering, \n     mathematics through incentive grants and special scholarships\n       Enable retired scientists' participation in education\n       Improve college readiness through K-16 partnerships\n\n     4. ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE EFFECTIVE TRADE POLICIES\n\n       Ensure greater access to world markets for U.S. exports\n       Link additional access to U.S. market to genuine \n     liberalization in overseas markets in both goods and services\n       Bring WTO dispute settlement cases when trade violations \n     occur\n       End unfair currency practices in international trade (enact \n     S. 1592, ``Fair Currency Enforcement Act of 2003'')\n       Vigorously defend U.S. intellectual property rights to \n     prevent foreign piracy and counterfeiting\n       Incorporate workers' rights and environmental protection in \n     trade agreements\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6079-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6079-S6080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NINTH CIRCUIT JUDGESHIP AND REORGANIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill \nintroduced last week by my colleague, Senator Ensign. I am pleased that \nhe has taken the helm in addressing the many problems posed by an \nexcessively large and cumbersome Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in his \nbill S. 2278. I am glad to add my name as a cosponsor of this bill. \nMontana sits in the Ninth Circuit, whose docket has grown in recent \nyears. In 2003, 12,872 appeals were filed at the court, up almost 1,500 \nfrom the previous year. The Ninth Circuit Judgeship and Reorganization \nAct of 2004 will create two new circuit courts in addition to a \nrestructured Ninth Circuit. The new Ninth Circuit would still contain \nCalifornia, and also Guam, Hawaii, and the Northern Marianas Islands. \nThe new Twelfth Circuit would include Montana, as well as Arizona, \nNevada, and Idaho. The new Thirteenth Circuit would comprise the \nremaining states: Alaska, Oregon, and Washington. I know many in the \nSenate have revisited this issue every year, and I am pleased to \nsupport this current bill.\n  Many times the judiciary in this country is bound to make unpopular \nbut correct decisions, but lately, the Ninth Circuit has made decisions \nwhich I believe are both unpopular and wrong. Many Montanans who hold \nfar more conservative views than the membership of the Ninth Circuit \nbench sitting in San Francisco were nonetheless bound to a particularly \noffensive decision made last year. The court found the phrase ``under \nGod'' in the Pledge of Allegiance violated the Establishment Clause of \nthe First Amendment when it is recited in school by our youngsters. The \nSupreme Court has heard this argument last month, and a decision is \nexpected in July. This case highlights the disconnect between the San \nFrancisco-based Ninth Circuit and my State of Montana which it \nsupposedly represents. When I walk around Washington, DC, I see the \npresence of our forefathers and our tradition everywhere, which \nincludes many references to God in our hallowed halls and on our \ncurrency. Many have given their lives in the name of God and country, \nand this faith has sustained us as a Nation. By limiting the words our \nchildren can utter in the classroom in support of this Nation and our \nfaith, the Ninth Circuit has taken yet another step to remove all that \nis sacred for Americans. Americans know the words to patriotic songs, \nlike ``God Bless America'' or ``America the Beautiful,'' but this may \nchange if our Nation's young people are not permitted to sing them in a \nclassroom. I find this decision extremely upsetting, because now more \nthan ever, we need to teach our children a little more about faith in \nAmerica and patriotism. There used to be a time when most young people \nfelt compelled to serve their country, whether it be completed through \nmilitary or volunteer service, but now it seems as though those numbers \nlessen every year. In America, we pride ourselves on the willingness of \nindividuals to lend a helping hand, and I am saddened that the court \nhas played an instrumental part in gradually eroding our Nation's \nvalues.\n  One of the other areas the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly addressed is \nland management, which usually has a negative effect on my State of \nMontana. One need only look to some of the court's recent decisions, \nwhich all share one commonality: they represent\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nthe conclusions of a bench that is thoroughly unfamiliar with land use \nand its implications on Montana.\n  It is worth noting at the outset that many cases never make their way \nto the Ninth Circuit docket, simply because the parties know the fate \nof their cause. This is especially true for the Forest Service, which \nhas lost many battles in front of the Ninth Circuit, and Montana is \ncertainly not better off for it.\n  For example, in Native Ecosystems Council v. Dombeck, the Ninth \nCircuit found that the Forest Service violated the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, NEPA, as well as the Endangered Species Act. \nNative Ecosystems Council v. Dombeck, 304 F.3d 886, 890, 9th Cir. 2002. \nIn this case, environmental groups challenged the validity of the \nDarroch- Eagle timber sale by the Forest Service. At the district court \nlevel, the Montana judge felt so strongly that the environmental groups \ndid not have a claim that he granted summary judgment in favor of the \nForest Service. This is important given the legal significance of \nsummary judgment. Even if all of the plaintiff's claims are true, there \nis no legal remedy available. The Ninth Circuit turned this decision on \nits head, and issued an injunction against the Forest Service so they \ncould not proceed with the sale.\n  In a similar situation, the Montana district court again granted \nsummary judgment for the Forest Service in 2003, and again, the Ninth \nCircuit reversed. In Sierra Club, Inc. v. Austin, an unreported case, \nthe Ninth Circuit found that the Forest Service's post-burn plan for \nLolo National Forest violated NEPA. According to a front-page story \ncarried by the Missoulian in December, 2003, the post-burn project \nwould have permitted salvage logging of 2,322 acres and commercial \nthinning of 2,470, no small undertaking by any means. Even though the \ncourt found that the water-quality assessment done by the Forest \nService was not arbitrary and capricious, it nonetheless concluded that \nthe actions by the Forest Service in the environmental impact \nstatement, EIS, did not include analysis of the logging effects on \nunroaded areas, and therefore violated NEPA in that sense.\n  Also in 2003, the Ninth Circuit found the Forest Service had \npotentially violated portions of the Montana Wilderness Study Act in \nMontana Wilderness Ass'n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 314 F.3d 1146, 9th Cir. \n2003. This act was passed by Congress in 1977 to allow the study of \ncertain lands, to be called wilderness study areas, so that they could \nmaintain their wilderness character and possibly be included within the \nNational Wilderness Preservation System. Since no final designation of \na wilderness area had been given, the Forest Service had been operating \nunder temporary rules for the past 25 years. Apparently, the Ninth \nCircuit found that there was an issue to be resolved by allowing the \ntrial to proceed, and remanded the case to go ahead to trial. The case \nhas now been appealed to the Supreme Court.\n  These three cases highlight recent action of the Ninth Circuit. The \nlast two years have been extremely litigious ones for the Forest \nService in Montana, and I regret the time and energy that the Forest \nService has had to put forward on this issue, but especially the \ntaxpayers' money involved needed to defend against all of these claims. \nThe Ninth Circuit's sympathy for the claims by various environmental \ngroups has provided an attractive solution to any local Montana court \ndecision they may not like. Unfortunately, the taxpayers end up footing \nthis bill, and the stewards who protect our forests are being second- \nguessed at every turn.\n  The Ninth Circuit is also rendered ineffective because of the size of \nits bench as well as its extensive geographic coverage. There are 47 \njudges on the bench, and as noted legal scholar Richard A. Posner once \nexplained that the circuit is predisposed to ``judicial \nirresponsibility'' because of its size. One Ninth Circuit judge, Andrew \nKleinfeld, said the judges do not even have the time to read one \nanother's opinions, which provides little guidance to other judges or \nthose affected by their decisions.\n  The problems with the Ninth Circuit are due to many factors, whether \nit be the geographic size of the region, the number of judges, or the \nimpractical decisions issued by those judges. The legislation recently \nintroduced will address this problem, so that Montanans will benefit \nfrom a more reasonable bench, which will reflect the opinions of those \nin our area, rather than those located near San Francisco.\n  In order to best preserve the common sense that Montanans pride \nthemselves in, I am pleased to support this bill. Let's bring a little \ncommon sense back to the judicial system. This is certainly a step in \nthe right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6080-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CHARLES F. ALBAUGH'S DEDICATION TO PATRIOTISM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am proud to pay tribute to the \nlate Charles F. Albaugh, a Vietnam era veteran from Fairhaven, MA. Mr. \nAlbaugh passed away on April 14, 2002, but his love of his country \ncontinues to be an inspiration in southeastern Massachusetts.\n  Shortly after September 11, 2001, Mr. Albaugh was determined to \nexpress the emotions we all shared on that terrible day. Although \nconfined to a wheelchair, he went to the interstate overpass running \nthrough his town of Fairhaven, MA, and placed American flags on it as a \nconstant reminder to the thousands who passed by each day of the \nstrength and unity of the American people.\n  Despite his physical limitations, he and his wife Mary Ann tended \nthose flags every day on the Main Street overpass, no matter the \nweather. At its peak, this man's monument totaled 175 flags. And each \nnight at dusk, he returned to the overpass with a lit votive candle to \npray for the victims of 9/11. His presence was an inspiration to the \ncommunity and soon drew volunteers to help maintain the flags.\n  Although Charles Albaugh has left us, his inspiration will be \nremembered permanently on the Main Street overpass in Fairhaven. On \nMemorial Day this year, a flagpole and plaque will be dedicated to his \nmemory and to the patriotism and love of country we all share. A light \nwill shine on the flag each night to remind us of Charles Albaugh's \ninspiration and dedication, and of the candle he lit in prayer each \nevening on that overpass.\n  I am pleased to join with those honoring Charles Albaugh and I know \nthat my colleagues in the Senate join in commending their efforts to \nmark the difference he made in Southeastern Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6080-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6080-S6081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, the Nation marked \nNational Suicide Prevention Week. Suicide takes the lives of more than \n30,000 Americans each year and is the eighth leading cause of death in \nthe United States.\n  According to a 2001 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, \nsuicide is the fourth-leading cause of death among children aged 7 to \n17. Between 1981 and 1998, the period of the study, 20,775 people in \nthat age group committed suicide, compared with 24,000 in that age \ngroup who died of cancer.\n  Suicide has long been considered an individual mental health issue, \nbut experts are starting to view suicide as a broad public health \nissue. In 2001, the U.S. Surgeon General released a report citing \nsuicide as a ``national public health problem,'' and announced a \nnational strategy for suicide prevention. Central to that strategy is \npromoting awareness that suicide is, indeed, preventable.\n  The same CDC study also highlighted the role of guns in both youth \nsuicide and homicides. During the study period, youth suicides \nincreased by 44 percent, with gun-related suicides making up 80 percent \nof that increase. At the same time, the number of youths who committed \nmurder with a firearm tripled, even as the total number of murders \nremained constant. This shows, according to the CDC, that suicide is \nlinked to other social ills, like gun violence.\n  One of the Surgeon General's recommendations for preventing suicide \nis to reduce access to guns or other lethal means of suicide. His \nnational suicide prevention strategy recommends not only a public \ncampaign to reduce gun accessibility, but also urges the gun industry \nto improve firearm safety design.\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\n  Suicide is a national problem that demands our attention. Congress \nshould do its part to help prevent suicide by encouraging the \nmanufacture of safer handguns and by closing the loopholes that allow \nyoung people easy access to handguns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6081-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6081-S6082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN v. BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the landmark 1954 civil rights decision of Brown v. \nBoard of Education. In its decision, the Supreme Court held that the \nEqual Protection Clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits States \nfrom maintaining racially segregated public schools.\n  In Brown, the Court upheld the principle that America is a land of \nlaws, not men.\n  In Brown, the Court affirmed that equality, fairness, and justice are \nfor all Americans, irrespective of race, ethnicity, color, or creed.\n  The Supreme Court found that the segregation of white and black \nchildren in public schools denied black children the equal protection \nof the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.\n  The Court reached this decision even if the physical facilities and \nother ``tangible'' factors of white and black schools were equal.\n  Of course, we all know that the facilities and resources were far \nfrom being equal.\n  It took courage on the part of the nine Justices of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt to reverse the so-called ``separate but equal'' precedent that \nthe Court had created in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson.\n  The Plessy decision concerned a 30-year-old shoemaker named Homer \nPlessy who had been jailed for sitting in the ``White'' car of the East \nLouisiana Railroad. Plessy was only one-eighth black and seven-eighth \nwhite, but under Louisiana law, he was considered black and therefore \nrequired to sit in the ``Colored'' car.\n  In Plessy, the Supreme Court found that laws requiring separate black \nand white railroad cars did not conflict with the thirteenth amendment \nwhich abolished slavery.\n  The Court held that ``a statute which implies merely a legal \ndistinction between the white and colored races has no tendency to \ndestroy the legal equality of the two races.'' Consequently, the \nnoxious notion of ``separate but equal'' took root in America.\n  The lone dissenter in the Plessy case, Justice John Harlan, wrote, \n``Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates \nclasses among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are \nequal before the law.'' Justice Harlan was a half-century ahead of his \ntime.\n  After years of arguing discrimination cases throughout the Nation, a \nteam of NAACP lawyers, led by Thurgood Marshall, brought five case from \nKansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and Washington DC to the \nSupreme Court. Thurgood Marshall--one of the giants of American \nhistory--stood before the Supreme Court determined to rid this Nation \nof a ``failure of our constitutional system.''\n  In Brown, the Court ruled that in the United States and under the \nU.S. Constitution, ``separate'' is inherently unequal.\n  These words were profound then and there are equally profound today \nbecause when the Supreme Court struck down school legal segregation, it \nadvanced the cause of human rights in America and set an example for \nall the world.\n  I just visited the ``Separate and Unequal'' exhibit at the \nSmithsonian. I was struck by how one of the displays put it: the Brown \ndecision told Americans and the world that ``the American dream of \nethnic diversity and racial equality under the law is a dream of \njustice for all.''\n  Although the Brown decision declared the system of legal segregation \nunconstitutional, the Court ordered only that the States end \nsegregation with ``all deliberate speed.'' One dictionary definition of \n``deliberate'' is ``leisurely or slow in manner or motion.''\n  This ambiguity over how to enforce the ruling gave segregationists an \nopportunity to organize what came to be called ``massive resistance.'' \nMany State officials in the South responded to the Brown decision by \npromising to use all legal means and resources under their command to \nprevent integration.\n  In Prince Edward County, VA, for example--one of the cases decided in \nthe Brown decision--the school district's response was to close the \npublic schools in Farmville for 5 years, from 1959 to 1964. White \nstudents enrolled in private schools while a generation of black \nchildren was denied access to education.\n  Over the 50 years since Brown, this Nation has continued to wrestle \nwith issues of racial and ethnic equality.\n  As I stand here today to pay homage to the Brown decision and the \ncivil rights struggle, I feel compelled to ask, ``A half-century after \nBrown, how far have we come? Where we are today, and where are we \nheaded?''\n  Fifty years after the Brown decision, the struggle for equality has \ncome to include not only racial and ethnic minorities, but also women, \nthe disabled, and gays and lesbians. That is a promising development.\n  We need only remember that it is only this week when the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court's order recognizing gay marriages is given \nthe full effect of law.\n  Since the 1954 Brown decision, we have made progress in the sense \nthat Americans overwhelmingly repudiate discrimination and segregation.\n  But while we no longer see the blatant vestiges of the segregationist \nera such as signs saying ``whites only'' or ``colored only,'' our \nsociety is still plagued by inequality and injustice.\n  African Americans have yet to enjoy true racial equality in this \nNation. And in the absence of real equality, African Americans are \nbeing denied the essence of what it means to be an American.\n  Statistics are the clearest barometer for measuring our progress and \nfar too many of them reveal that African Americans continue to lag \nbehind whites in important ways.\n  In April 2004, the Nation's unemployment rate was 4.9 percent for \nwhites; for blacks, it was 9.7 percent.\n  In 2002, the poverty rate was 12.1 percent nationwide; for blacks, it \nwas 22.7 percent.\n  In 1999, median income for white families was $51,244; for black \nfamilies, it was $31,778.\n  Today, black men make up 41 percent of all prisoners, but only 4 \npercent of all college and university students.\n  African Americans are 13 percent of the population in my home State \nof New Jersey, but they constituted a staggering 63 percent of the \nState's prison population in 2002.\n  The murder rate for whites is 3.3 per 100,000 people; for blacks, \nit's six times as high, 20.5 per 100,000 people.\n  These statistics make it pretty clear that while we have come a long \nway from the blatant racism of ``separate but equal'' and the decision \nto close the Farmville public schools to prevent their integration, we \nstill have a long way to go in making the dream of justice and equality \nfor all Americans a living, breathing reality.\n  As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Brown decision, we need \nto rededicate ourselves to the civil rights struggle. As Teddy \nRoosevelt said, ``This country will not be a really good place for any \nof us to live in if it is not a really good place for all of us to live \nin.''\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr President, 50 years ago, our Nation set out to give \nevery child the chance for excellence and equality in education. In a \nquote from the Brown decision in 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court said, \n``Today education is perhaps the most important function of State and \nlocal governments . . . It is a principal instrument in awakening the \nchild to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional \ntraining, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In \nthese days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to \nsucceed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such \nan opportunity, where the State has undertaken to provide it, is a \nright, which must be made available to all on equal terms.'' We have \nmade great progress in the past 50 years but we still have a long way \nto go.\n  By fulfilling the promise of Brown, school systems have the ability \nto lay a great foundation for our Nation. Providing children with a \nhigh quality education, in a diverse classroom setting, gives our \nchildren the educational\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\ntools which they need to succeed. Additionally, it provides them with \nan environment which will equip them with the necessary tools to become \ntrue leaders. The goals of Brown were to provide to all children, \nexcellent schools which were as diverse as possible. The greatest gift \nthat we can give our children is to ensure that they receive nothing \nless.\n  Fifty years after Brown, its full promise remains unrealized. Public \neducation in our country has become more and more separate. In \nWashington, DC, public schools, nearly all students are attending \nsegregated, poor schools. For example, 2,455 students are attending \n12th grade. Of those, 121 are white, about 1,900 are black and the rest \nare primarily Latino and Asian/Pacific Islander. Of the white students, \n116 attend just three schools with 88 of those at just one school. This \nscenario is happening not only in our Nation's capital but across the \nNation. In my State of Louisiana, public schools in the City of Monroe \nhave 88 percent minority students, while the surrounding rural district \nhas 71 percent white students.\n  Not only are our schools more separate, but they are also more \nunequal. Since 1988, the minority achievement gap in our country has \ncontinued to grow. Nationally, African American and Latino 17-year-olds \ndemonstrate reading and math skills that are virtually \nindistinguishable from white 13-year-olds. In my own State of \nLouisiana, there is a 42.9 point gap between the performance of African \nAmerican students and their white peers. These statistics can be \nexplained by many different variables. Poor and minority students are \none-third more likely to be taught by an unqualified teacher than their \npeers. Students of color and low-income students do not receive \ncurriculum and instruction that is as challenging or rigorous as other \nstudents. According to the U.S. Department of Education, less than a \nthird of students from low-wealth families were enrolled in the college \nprep track, while two-thirds of students from high-wealth families were \nin college prep. What is worse, we have put educational funding on its \nhead. In a majority of States, the more students of color you have, the \nless likely you are to receive State and local funds.\n  The founding principle of No Child Left Behind was that all children \ncan learn. There are hundreds of examples, many of which you will hear \nin commemoration of the Brown decision, to demonstrate this fact to be \ntrue. Centennial Place Elementary School in Atlanta, GA is 91 percent \nAfrican American and 79 percent low-income and is in the top 10 percent \nof the entire State of Georgia in reading. Moreover, Centennial Place \nElementary outscored 88 percent of other Georgia schools on the State's \nmath test. In my home State of Louisiana, Claiborne Fundamental \nElementary School has an 80 percent minority student body, 60 percent \nof which are in poverty. Yet they finished in the 94th percentile on \nLEAP testing and finished in the top 10 percent in closing the \nachievement gap. These are only a few examples of success in schools \nwhich support the principles of No Child Left Behind. For the first \ntime, the Federal Government has rejected the bigotry of lower \nexpectations and has required States and local school districts to do \nsomething about the growing gap of opportunity in our schools. If we \nare to realize the promise of Brown we must ensure that each and every \nchild, regardless of race or income, has an opportunity to realize \ntheir potential.\n  The links between all of these examples of success are \naccountability, full and equal funding, and teacher quality. If we can \nset clear, measurable goals for performance and continue to hold \nschools accountable for results, we can truly measure success and \nfailure. Backlash against No Child Left Behind is in part because \npeople are being forced to face the reality that gaps do exist. Under \nthe old system, schools with huge gaps in the performance of their \nstudents were labeled as being successful. Nationally, 4th grade \nAfrican Americans lag behind their white peers in reading, with 39 \npercent of white students considered proficient but only 12 percent of \nblack students. Things are similar in 8th grade mathematics, 36 percent \nof white students are labeled proficient, but only 7 percent of black \nstudents fall into the same category.\n  While we continue to make schools accountable, we must also ensure \nthat they are fully and equally funded. Over the past four years, Title \nI of No Child Left Behind has been underfunded by the President's \nBudget by $22.3 billion. In my State of Louisiana, that means that 135, \n962 disadvantaged children, 6,029 English-learners, and 62,977 \npreschool children are left behind. We cannot continue to expect our \nschools to perform, if we do not give them the tools they need. This \nfunding must also be equal. In 22 States, the highest poverty school \ndistricts receive less per-student funding from State and local sources \nthan the lowest-poverty school districts. This is also true of the \nNation as a whole. The top 25 percent of school districts in terms of \nchild poverty nationwide receive less funding than the bottom 25 \npercent. Similarly, in 28 States the local districts with the highest \npercentage of minority children receive less funding than districts \nwith the fewest minority children.\n  These increases in funding will go towards many different aspects of \nour children's education but also towards recruiting the best and the \nbrightest teachers. The difference between an effective teacher and an \nineffective teacher can be a whole grade level in school. In a recent \nstudy in Dallas, students who had the added value of a good teacher 3 \nyears in a row were scoring in the 76th percentile; while students who \nhad a bad teacher 3 years in a row were performing in the 27th \npercentile. We can help recruit and retain quality teachers by \nincreasing their opportunity for professional development, increasing \nthe pay for teachers who work in high challenge areas, merit pay and \nbonuses for good teachers, and by increasing administrative and \nprofessional support for teachers in schools.\n  The principles laid out in No Child Left Behind give our Nation the \nopportunity to fully realize the promise of Brown v. Board of \nEducation. If we can continue to fund initiatives which encourage \naccountability and excellence for all students we can continue to close \nthe achievement gap that plagues our Nation's schools. In 1960, four \nblack 6-year-old girls were the first to integrate two white schools in \nmy home town of New Orleans. These brave children set out as pioneers \nto create a school system in this country which was equal for all \nchildren regardless of race or religion. We must keep these children in \nour hearts as we set forth to make their dream truly a reality. On this \n50th commemoration of the Brown decision, I hope that my colleagues \nwill join with me in ensuring that every child receives access to the \nsame high quality education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6082-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6082-S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor children \nacross the Nation who live in foster care and the admirable adults who \nprotect and care for them. Currently, there are over half a million \nchildren in foster care in the United States--a number that has doubled \nsince 1987. Coming from every socioeconomic background, these innocent \nchildren cannot live at home due to troubling family situations. \nLuckily, 170,000 foster families have opened their hearts and homes to \nthese disadvantaged children.\n  Children enter foster care for a number of reasons. For some \nchildren, the journey begins at birth. Other children come to the \nattention of child welfare when a teacher, a social worker, a police \nofficer, or a neighbor reports suspected child maltreatment. Often, \nthese children have experienced physical or sexual abuse at the hands \nof a loved and trusted adult or have been woefully neglected by their \ncaregivers. On average, children stay in foster care for 33 months.\n  Foster parents meet a special need in our society by ensuring that \nfoster children receive attention, love, and health and educational \nservices. In doing so, they help to restore a sense of hope and \nstability in the lives of our country's youth.\n  In my home State of Illinois, we are doing our part to recognize the \nselfless\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\ncontributions made by foster parents. On April 26, Governor Rod \nBlagojevich proclaimed May 2004 ``Foster Parent Appreciation Month.'' \nThe Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is the Nation's \nlargest child welfare agency accredited by the Council on Accreditation \nfor Children and Family Services.\n  Illinois DCFS is working to reduce the number of children who require \nfoster care. Through a program called Front End Redesign, early \nintervention services are provided to families after their needs become \napparent to prevent the need for a child to be placed in foster care. \nFor four consecutive years, Illinois has been a national leader in \nadoptions. With an increasing emphasis on early intervention and \nadoption, the number of Illinois children in foster care has declined \nfrom 51,331 children in 1997 to 19,297 children in 2004.\n  We still have a great demand--not only in Illinois but in States \nacross the Nation--for additional caring adults to open their homes to \nfoster children. Teenagers, adolescent moms and their babies, children \nwith special needs, and sibling groups are some of the children most in \nneed of foster and adoptive parents.\n  All children can reach their greatest potential when they live in \nsafe, stable, and nurturing families. Yet far too many children lack \nthis fundamental foundation. Foster parents, as well as the \nprofessionals and volunteers working within state child welfare \nprograms, deserve our gratitude and respect for the sacrifices they \nmake every day to ensure that our children--our Nation's future--\nreceive the support they need as they mature into adulthood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6083-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF DR. CHARLES IRVIN HUDSON\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, like so many of the people who \nwere fortunate enough to know him, I was deeply saddened to learn of \nthe passing of a dear friend and true leader, Dr. Charles Irvin Hudson. \nDr. Hudson, known to many affectionately as ``Doc,'' died unexpectedly \nMay 7, 2004, at Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in Baton Rouge, LA, at \nthe age of 72.\n  Doc Hudson was an educator and community leader in St. Landry Parish \nfor nearly 50 years. He demonstrated his commitment to education by \nserving as a high school mathematics teacher for 10 years and later as \nthe principal of two elementary schools, for which he received numerous \nawards and honors.\n  But Doc Hudson was equally committed to public service, and served \nhis community as an elected official for nearly 30 years. First elected \nto the Opelousas City Council in 1974, he was to serve for three \nconsecutive 4-year terms before becoming deputy secretary for the \nLouisiana State Department of Transportation and Development from 1984-\n88. Doc Hudson was then elected to the Louisiana House of \nRepresentatives in 1991 where he served till his passing.\n  Throughout his remarkable career, Doc worked tirelessly for the \npeople of St. Landry Parish and the State of Louisiana. He fought for \nboth decency and accountability in our schools, worked to improve the \nquality of life for everyone in District 40, and developed warm, \nquality relationships with all who met him.\n  It was my privilege to have worked very closely with Doc on a number \nof occasions and to benefit from the wisdom of his counsel and the \nbreadth of his understanding. I am honored to have known and learned \nfrom a man of such high moral character.\n  Representative Hudson will be remembered for his nearly 30 years of \nservice in public life and 20 years as an educator, and for the great \nvalue he placed on developing relationships with people. He rooted his \nwork in his personal experiences with the people affected by the \nissues. His dedication to people will stand as a legacy from which \nfuture generations will learn.\n  On behalf of the entire State of Louisiana, I pay tribute to this \ncourageous statesman and convey my most respectful condolences to his \nfamily and to all who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6083-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            H-2B VISA CRISIS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I would like to discuss my \ndisappointment with the failure to address an issue of critical \nimportance to small businesses around the country--- the need to \nconsider legislation temporarily raising the cap on the number of H-2B \nvisas for this fiscal year.\n  As many of my colleagues know after hearing from their constituents, \nthe limit on the number of H-2B visas that could be issued this fiscal \nyear was reached in early March. The H-2B cap was reached less than \nhalfway through the current fiscal year and has caused critical \nproblems around the country. This is especially true for those small \nbusinesses that rely on H-2B visas to completely fill their staffing \nneeds over the summer months. A business may apply for a H-2B visa no \nsooner than 120 days before the individual is needed for employment, \nand the cap was reached as businesses were applying for their summer \npositions.\n  I quickly heard from many Vermont businesses expressing their \nconcerns about not being able to obtain these needed workers, and I was \npleased to join Senator Kennedy in introducing the Save the Summer Act \non March 29, 2004. This commonsense approach would raise the cap on H-\n2B visas for this fiscal year by 40,000. This is a simple, \nstraightforward, easy-to-understand-and-implement solution to this \nproblem. I was pleased that the bill had bipartisan support when it was \nintroduced and I was hopeful that it could be considered and passed \nquickly in the Senate. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case.\n  The next day, on March 30, Senator Hatch introduced the Summer \nOperations and Services Relief and Reform Act that addressed the H-2B \ncap problem in a different manner. While I felt that this legislation \naddressed the problem in a less clear, more complicated way, I was very \npleased that the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Hatch, \nand the Judiciary Committee's Immigration Subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Chambliss, recognized that there was a problem that had to be \nimmediately addressed.\n  In the normal legislative process, the next step should have been for \nthe two sides to sit down and try to work through the differences \nbetween the bills and then quickly pass legislation to solve this \nproblem. However, in this case, the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee were not in agreement on how to address the matter and began \nto negotiate among themselves. Unfortunately, they chose not to \nnegotiate with the supporters of the Save the Summer Act until they had \nreached a consensus. Supposedly, more than a month after the bill was \nintroduced, the Republicans finally reached an agreement amongst \nthemselves.\n  Although the majority reached a consensus, the business community and \nthe Department of Homeland Security raised concerns about the \nRepublican agreement. Thus, the Republicans have gone back to the \ndrawing board and are once again negotiating amongst themselves.\n  It is now the day before the Senate will take its break for the \nMemorial Day holiday. Many think of Memorial Day weekend as the \nunofficial beginning of summer. However, almost 2 months after \nlegislation had been introduced, businesses around the country that \nwere counting on the Congress to solve this problem still do not have \nan answer. Summer may have begun, but for many businesses, this summer \nseason will not be something to celebrate.\n  Senator Kennedy and I introduced a simple, easy solution to this \nproblem on March 29 that would have allowed businesses to obtain the \nemployees they desperately need for the summer, while giving the \nCongress the opportunity to address the long-term issues with the H2-B \nprogram. However, the Republican leadership will not allow the Senate \nto pass this legislation with an overwhelming vote.\n  It has been almost 2 months since legislation was introduced, almost \n3 months since the problem arose, and the Republicans are still \ndebating the issue internally. The Senate should pass the Save the \nSummer Act immediately and help our Nation's small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6083-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6083-S6084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING RETIRING TEACHERS\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor five \noutstanding\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\nwomen who have dedicated themselves to the teaching profession and will \nsoon retire after spending more than 30 years each as educators. Each \nof these women will end their career at the close of this school year \nat Elm Elementary School in Burr Ridge, IL, having touched the lives of \nhundreds of children, parents, and colleagues.\n  Catherine Nufer has been teaching for 36 years and has been \nrecognized for her achievements in teaching writing and social studies. \nHer students have consistently excelled in State standardized tests in \nthese areas. Ms. Nufer has taken courses over the years to keep current \non new teaching standards, always striving to bring a fresh approach to \nthe classroom.\n  Virginia Bojan is retiring after 33 years of teaching. She is known \nfor her excellence in teaching language arts and science. To her \nstudents and colleagues, Ms. Bojan will be remembered most for her \npleasant demeanor and use of humor in classroom lessons. Laughter and \njoy have been central to her teaching style, which will surelly be \nmissed at Elm Elementary School.\n  Nancy Taylor has been teaching for 34 years, during which time she \nled district-wide curriculum development initiatives in the areas of \nlanguage arts and mathematics. Under her soft-spoken, gentle approach \nto teaching, hundreds of students have learned and flourished. She will \nbe remembered for always striving to care for and understand each child \nas an individual.\n  Beverly Oliveri is retiring after 34 years of teaching. She has \ndemonstrated leadership on curriculum development committees which have \nadvanced the way mathematics is taught in District 181. Ms. Oliveri \nwill be remembered by students and colleagues for her unique practice \nof utilizing storytelling in her classroom lessons, helping students to \ngrasp new concepts by applying them to humorous real-life situations.\n  Patricia Trudicks has been teaching at Elm Elementary School \nthroughout all 36 years of her teaching career. She was instrumental in \nintroducing technology as an instructional tool and also played a vital \nrole in developing Elm Elementary's Media Resource Center, which offers \nstudents and teachers access to educational enrichment materials. Ms. \nTrudicks has constructed creative, hands-on displays in the media \nresource center, leaving the hundreds of students she has served with \neducational experiences they will never forget.\n  I am honored to have this opportunity to publicly recognize these \nfive women, who have dedicated their professional lives to educating \nchildren. They have made an invaluable impact on the minds and hearts \nof the hundreds of students they have served, providing their students \nwith a broad base of knowledge that has endured well beyond their \nelementary school years. These five teachers are fine examples of \nexcellence in education, and I proudly salute them for their dedicated \nservice and wish them well in their retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6084-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6084-S6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there are 542,000 reasons that we \nshould all be involved in recognizing May as National Foster Care \nMonth. These reasons represent the number of children currently in the \nfoster care system, roughly 126,000 of whom are waiting to be adopted. \nOver 70 percent of these children entered foster care because of abuse \nor neglect. And, the average length of time that these children stay in \nfoster care is almost 3 years.\n  For many of these children, the wait for a loving family where they \nare nurtured, comforted, and protected is endless. Every year, 25,000 \nchildren ``age out'' of foster care because they reach adulthood \nwithout ever being found a permanent home. These children are more \nlikely to drop out of school and are more likely to be unemployed, \nwelfare dependent, and homeless. In fact, roughly 30 percent of the \nNation's homeless are former foster children.\n  As Senators, we cannot allow over half a million children to continue \nlanguishing in the foster care system, vulnerable to facing these \nnegative outcomes. During this National Foster Care Month or at any \nother appropriate time throughout the year, I ask that you focus \nattention on the need to find secure and supportive families for these \nchildren.\n  Nurturing and stable environments can allow these children to achieve \ngreat success by helping them to overcome the challenges posed by \ninvolvement in the foster care system. One such example of the effect \nthat a nurturing and stable environment can have on a foster child \nexists right in Congress's own backyard--the Mayor of Washington, DC, \nAnthony Williams. Mayor Williams' mother once told the story that when \nshe visited the orphanage where she first met her son, she was told by \nthe workers that he was not as advanced developmentally and \nintellectually as he should be for a child his age. These workers even \nindicated that little Anthony might have to be sent to an institution. \nAnd, they were right. His mother sent him off to two of the most \nprestigious institutions in our country--Yale University for college \nand Harvard University for law school.\n  I invite all Members to come to the Senate floor to speak about \nformer foster children such as Mayor Williams, about foster children \ncurrently waiting for loving families, or about the significance of \nfoster care in your own life, in your State, or in the life of a child. \nBut, I want to ask more of you than simply sharing these stories. I \nwould like to urge my colleagues to commit their efforts to ensuring \nthat we institute legislative reforms for the child welfare system that \nwill emphasize permanency for foster children, whether that be \nreunification with families, adoption, or teaching youth skills to be \nable to live self-sufficiently after emancipation. The time is now for \nus to reform a foster care system that does not adequately address the \nneeds of our most vulnerable children and families.\n  One of the areas that will require the greatest reform is the Federal \nfinancing structure of child welfare services. Currently, the Federal \nfinancing system is structured in a way that provides the greatest \nfinancial support for a child by the Federal Government when that child \nis in the foster care system. In other words, it creates a funding \nincentive to keep children in foster care, rather than moving them \ntowards re-unification or adoption. We must revise this system so that \nfunding matches the Federal priorities. This means that Government \nshould fund the programs and approaches that are actually working to \nprovide safety and permanency to children. Decisions regarding the \nplacement of a child should not be influenced by the type of placement \nthat would offer the greatest resources for the child, but instead be \nbased on the best interests of the child. Adequate resources should be \navailable for children involved in any area of the child welfare \nsystem. Therefore, the money and resources should follow the child, \nwhether that is in foster care, in an adoptive home, or after re-\nunification with the biological family. The current financing system \nincludes a patchwork of programs, many of which are funded through \ndiscretionary spending that is vulnerable to cuts in the appropriations \nprocess. Reforms must be instituted that allow the child welfare system \nto encompass a more comprehensive approach that includes prevention, \nre-unification services, adequate foster care services, adoption \nresources, and post-permanency support.\n  The time has come to fix these problems, to focus on the solutions in \norder to help our most vulnerable children. The Pew Commission on \nChildren in Foster Care released a report this week that summarizes a \n1-year study of the foster care system. This study includes the \nfeedback of advocates, State service providers, lawmakers, judges, and \nformer foster youth around the country. I respectfully ask my \ncolleagues to carefully look at the recommendations of not only the Pew \nCommission but of the hundreds of other individuals, groups, and States \nthat have studied this system and have provided valuable ideas for \nreform.\n  Further, I hope that the leadership in the Finance Committee will \nhold hearings on the topic of Federal financing of the child welfare \nsystem to fully explore the problems in this system and the proposals \nfor reform that will help to resolve these problems. I also ask all \nMembers of Congress to make these reforms a priority during the \nremainder of this session and during the next session of Congress. I am \npersonally committed to seeing reform done within\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\nthis time period. And, I am hopeful that we will soon enact legislation \nthat will help the hundreds of thousands of children in foster care in \nour country. Let us work together to ensure the success of our future \nby promoting safety and stability for our children today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6085-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GIFT OF TIME FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. TALENT.

The Gift of Time \nFoundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing community \nservice, academic, and physical fitness programs for children between \nthe ages of four and eighteen.\n  The mission of the Gift of Time Foundation is: ``To provide children \nwith resources, opportunities and assistance that help them develop \nhigh self-esteem, self confidence, socially acceptable value systems, \ndiverse cultural appreciation and family values by providing them with \nstructured environments for membership in mandatory participation in \nphysical fitness, academics, and community service programs. To provide \nchildren with personal character development assistance for self \nexpression through structured positive activities alternatives.''\n  The Gift of Time Foundation was spearheaded by E.

Mr. McFarlin has worked closely with business, community, and \ncivic leaders to launch this important project. He is hoping that the \nSt. Louis complex will be the first of many across the country.\n  Mr. President, organizations such as the Gift of Time Foundation can \nhelp a community in building character and values in its children. The \nefforts of Mr. McFarlin and his organization are to be commended for \ntaking this challenge head on. I ask that you join me in recognizing \nthis fine organization and wishing Mr. McFarlin the very best on his \nendeavors to bring this program to the children of our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6085-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DENNIS MARTIN\n\n Mr. TALENT.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Sister \nClarita Anneken of Villa Hills, KY for her 63 years devoted to \neducating young men and women who attended Villa Madonna Academy.\n  Everything that we do in the United States Senate is done with the \nidea in mind that we are making the world a better place for those who \ncome after us. Indeed the entire government is dedicated to ensuring \nthat America will continue to protect the rights to life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness long into the future. However, let me remind \nthe Senate that if the people of America are not educated to appreciate \nthe sanctity of life, the glory of liberty, and the meaningfulness of \npursuing happiness, that everything we do here will be wasted. No \nmatter how wise the laws we enact, a people ignorant of these important \nprinciples will only resent wise laws, not benefit from them.\n  It is for this reason that I believe that the work of Sister Clarita \nis so crucial. Sister Clarita has dedicated her life to the education \nof America's future. For 63 years Sister Clarita has invested her \nknowledge, time, effort, patience, and understanding in the young \npeople of Villa Madonna Academy. Her efforts have shaped the \nunderstanding of many young people who will be a part of America's \nfuture.\n  I believe that no good deed goes unrewarded. The reward that Sister \nClarita will reap, however will be a reward reaped for many years, long \nafter her teaching career is finished. It will be a reward which many \nAmericans will share. It will be the reward of young, educated men and \nwomen who will be able to continue the great traditions of this \ncountry.\n  Sister Clarita's dedication to the young is an assurance of the \nbrightness of America's future. And I thank Sister Clarita for this \nassurance and for the bright future of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6085-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WALNUT, IOWA, SAYS THANK YOU TO WORLD WAR II VETERAN\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the National World War II Memorial \nwill be dedicated here in Washington on the Saturday before Memorial \nDay. It is a stunningly beautiful monument, located midway between the \nLincoln Memorial and Washington Monument. It is a long-overdue salute, \nan expression of profound gratitude, to the millions of Americans who \nserved their country with courage, sacrifice, and selflessness in that \nwar.\n  I would like to share with my Senate colleagues a remarkable story \nabout how the small community of Walnut, IA, has expressed its \ngratitude to a local veteran of the Second World War, Erwin Arndt.\n  Mr. Arndt returned from the war to serve his community as an \nelectrician, a volunteer firefighter, a city council member, and \ncommander of the local AMVETS unit. Just about everybody in Walnut \nknows and respects Mr. Arndt. And there was much concern when he \nsuffered a series of strokes over the past year.\n  All too typically, a man in Mr. Arndt's condition would have no \nchoice but to become a dependent in a nursing home. But friends and \nneighbors in Walnut came to his rescue in a truly remarkable and \ninspiring way. They joined hands to give him the wherewithal and \nassistance he needed to continue living independently in his apartment.\n  A local restaurant helped to provide daily meals. Several citizens \nhelped Mr. Arndt to keep his apartment clean and orderly, and take him \nto medical appointments. Still others organized shifts to keep him \ncompany in his apartment. Several especially kind citizens got together \nto purchase a motorized chair to help Mr. Arndt get around.\n  It was truly a community effort, an act of collective kindness that I \nfind truly inspiring. Mr. Arndt's daughter, Karen DeWinter, is \noverwhelmed with gratitude for what the people of Walnut did for her \nfather. She told me that she was especially touched that on her \nfather's birthday, the local AMVET auxiliary held a party at a cafe, \nwhere they brought cards from local elementary and preschool children.\n  I want to acknowledge the people of Walnut, IA, for their \nextraordinary caring and kindness toward Erwin Arndt. Like millions of \nAmericans of what Tom Brokaw has labeled ``the Greatest Generation,'' \nMr. Arndt served our Nation with dedication in both war and peace.\n  In their own special way, the people of Walnut have said thank you to \nthis veteran and beloved member of the community. I would like to add \nmy own gratitude, not just to Mr. Arndt but also to the good citizens \nof Walnut.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6086-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n THE OPENING OF A NEW HATFIELD-McCOY TRAIL HONORING THE FOUNDER, LEFF \n                                 MOORE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, monumental achievements are \nthe work of visionary people. On the celebratory occasion marking the \nopening of a new 100-mile section of the Hatfield-McCoy recreational \ntrail in Wyoming County, it is important to take the time to honor the \nvisionary behind this monumental accomplishment, the late O.L. ``Leff'' \nMoore. Leff Moore was one of the wisest men I have ever had the great \npleasure of knowing, and I consider it an honor to call him my dear \nfriend. I had a habit of calling him ``Uncle Leff''. He just had that \naffect on people. He had this unique way of encouraging and inspiring \npeople to come together and do great work for their communities. It was \nrare to hear a negative word from Leff. He was an optimistic who truly \nthought ahead of his time.\n  Leff was a driving force in the West Virginia Democratic Party, a \nlife-long civil servant, and a tireless advocate for the safe operation \nof recreational vehicles. A deep love for the Mountain State ran \nthrough everything Leff did in his life, and his commitment to public \nservice was evidenced by the numerous boards and committees he served \non. His vision and leadership were widely respected in Putnam County, \nand his efforts contributed greatly to the area's growth and success. \nIn recognition for his work, Leff was the only two-time recipient of \nthe respected Putnam County Chamber of Commerce Mayo Lester Award.\n  Born in 1943, the son of Orville L. Moore, Sr. and Margaret Peyton \nMoore, Leff graduated Winfield High School and West Virginia State \nCollege. He served as the executive director of the West Virginia \nManufactured Housing Association for more than 30 years where he helped \nwrite the policies and set the laws that will govern safe housing \npractices in West Virginia for future generations.\n  When his beloved Putnam County started growing rapidly in the 1970's, \nLeff's vision and determination led to the establishment of Putnam \nGeneral Hospital, and planning measures brought public water and sewer \nto aid in the county's growth.\n  Leff's most stunning success, though, may be the Hatfield-McCoy \nRegional Recreation Authority trail system in southern West Virginia, \nwhich is breathing to new life into an entire region's economy. Over a \ndecade ago when many of us had no idea what ATV's were, Leff somehow \nknew how popular they would become and saw the potential of marrying \nATV's to West Virginia's scenic beauty. With little more than a VHS \ntape of a Utah trail and his gift for articulating ideas in a way that \nexcited people, he sold even the most skeptical on the benefits of a \nrecreational trail that will eventually reach into Kentucky and \nVirginia.\n  Southern West Virginia has already begun to feel the impact of Leff's \nvision for the trail as more and more out-of-State tourist dollars flow \ninto the mountains of Mingo, Logan and Boone counties. During the last \nfiscal year, trail riders bought nearly $400,000 in trail permits, and \nthis year, the Regional Recreation Authority expects that number to \nrise 25 to 31 percent. The average visitor who comes to take advantage \nof the Hatfield-McCoy trails spends between $250 and $500 during a 3-\nday stay.\n  Even at a conservative estimate, that translates into nearly $1 \nmillion tourist dollars injected into the local economy every month. \nThese visitors to Southern West Virginia stay in local hotels and eat \nat local restaurants, many of which have sprung up to feed the growing \ntourist trade.\n  Leff's plan to stimulate the Southern West Virginia economy and \nshowcase the beauty of the Mountain State has certainly been a \nresounding triumph thus far, and the potential for further expansion is \nlimitless. The addition of this new section of trail brings the total \nsystem up to 500 miles across 4 different counties. I look forward to \nthe day when Leff's original vision of over 2,000 miles of trails over \nall of Appalachia becomes a reality.\n  Soon, I will participate in the grand opening of the Wyoming County \nsection of the Trail, and I am very happy about what it will mean for \nthe area. I am also proud of all the Wyoming County officials who \nworked so hard to make the Trail a reality, but there will be a deep \nsadness in my heart as I miss my friend Leff Moore. I am comforted, \nhowever, because I know that his passion and vision for the people of \nWest Virginia will guarantee that he is never forgotten in the hearts \nof many communities. I know that as his vision continues to expand into \na reality, the legacy of Leff Moore will live on for a long time in \nmany positive ways for West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6086-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO LTG JAMES E. SHERRARD\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nan exceptional officer in the United States Air Force and a good \nfriend, LTG James E. Sherrard III, upon his retirement after more than \n38 years of distinguished service. Throughout his career, General \nSherrard has personified the Air Force core values of integrity, \nselfless service, and excellence across the many missions the Air Force \nprovides in defense of our Nation. As Chief of Air Force Reserve, many \nof us on Capitol Hill have enjoyed the opportunity to work with General \nSherrard on a wide variety of Air Force issue and programs and it is my \nprivilege to recognize his many accomplishments. I commend his superb \nservice to the United States Air Force and this great Nation.\n  General Sherrard is a native of Tutwiler, MS, and graduated from the \nUniversity of Mississippi's Reserve Officer Training Corps program in \n1965. His career has spanned a variety of operational assignments and \nmajor command staff functions. The general has commanded the 910th \nAirlift Wing at Youngstown, OH; the 433rd Airlift Wing at San Antonio, \nTX; the 4th Air Force, March Air Reserve Base, CA; and 22nd Air Force, \nDobbins Air Reserve Base, GA. Currently, General Sherrard serves as \nboth the Chief of Air Force Reserve and Commander, Air Force Reserve \nCommand. He is a command pilot with more than 5,000 hours in the T-41, \nT-37, T-38, C-130A/B/E/H, AC-130A, C-141B, and C-5A/B. In 1996, he \nreceived special recognition from the Air Force enlisted force with the \npresentation of the Order of the Sword.\n  General Sherrard's exceptional leadership skills have been evident to \nboth supervisors and subordinates throughout his career as he \nrepeatedly led and inspired those around him. He was the Chief of Air \nForce Reserve during the most demanding period in history for the \nReserve Components. Under his tenure, the Air Force Reserve \nsuccessfully experienced the largest mobilization since the Korean War. \nCumulatively, more than 28,000 members of the command have been \nactivated since September 11, 2001, with 5,300 members still on orders \nin support of the Global War on Terror, OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, \nOPERATION NOBLE EAGLE and OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.\n  During his term as the Chief of Air Force Reserve, General Sherrard \nhas always maintained a ``People First'' philosophy. He has called on \neach member of his team to advance legislative strategies, readiness, \nand quality of life issues that are absolutely essential to maintaining \nboth active and reserve components of our all volunteer force. The \nresults of his efforts include a Montgomery GI Bill Kicker for the \nSelected Reserve and extension of eligibility from 10 to 14 years; \ncommand responsibility pay; hostile fire and imminent danger pays for \nReservists on inactive duty; expanded TRICARE benefits; lodging \nreimbursements during leave; and commissary privileges for all \nreservists. General Sherrard has been the driving force on every major \nAir Force Reserve issue from rebalancing the force structure between \nthe Reserve and Active components to updating Cold War era laws to more \neffectively employ Reserve members.\n  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank \nGeneral Sherrard, his wife Marsha, and their entire family for the \ncommitment, sacrifices, and contribution that they have made throughout \nhis honorable military career. Congratulations on completing an \nexceptional and extremely successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6086-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6086-S6087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:19 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiapparti, announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nwhich it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4200.

A bill to require payment of appropriated funds that are \nillegally disbursed for political purposes by the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. president, yesterday, the Comptroller General of \nthe United States ruled that the Bush administration illegally spent \ntaxpayer dollars for political propaganda in violation of two laws.\n  To make matters worse, these funds were taken from the Medicare Trust \nFund.\n  In other words, money reserved for our seniors' healthcare was \nillegally used for political activity. It is outrageous.\n  The President has raised plenty of money for his campaign. Over \n200 million dollars. Why does he need to use Medicare funds?\n\n  With taxpayer money, the Bush administration produced so-called \n``video news released'' --fake news stories that hailed the new \nMedicare law--and distributed them to TV stations across the country.\n  This covert propaganda was never identified as being produced by the \nadministration. As a result many news stations ran this story as real \nnews and\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\nviewers had no idea it was produced by the government.\n  The phony news stories show scenes of the President receiving a \nstanding ovation before signing the bill into law and even end with a \nsign off from a fake reporter.\n  The GAO has said that these materials are illegal, but the money is \nalready spent and that money will likely never be recovered unless we \npass this legislation.\n  My bill calls on the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign to repay this \nmoney to the Federal Government. It's the right thing to do.\n  I have long said that this administration's so-called ``education'' \ncampaign on the new Medicare law is fraught with questionable activity.\n  And now we know that they have in fact acted illegally. I think \nsomewhere along the way they confused the word ``education'' with \n``election.''\n  This is just the most recent incident in a long line of advertising \nby the Bush administration that the non-partisan GAO has called \nmisleading and political.\n  If the Bush-Cheney campaign wants to spend funds dollars touting the \nnew Medicare law, that's their prerogative--but they cannot use \ngovernment agencies and taxpayer funds to do it.\n  I am all for educating seniors, but I will always guard against any \nmisuse of taxpayer dollars, especially those reserved for Medicare.\n  I am here today to tell the President: Don't use the people's money \nto promote your bid for reelection. It's not only unethical, it's \nagainst the law.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services's (CMS) use \n     of appropriated funds to pay for the production and \n     distribution of story packages that were not attributed to \n     CMS violated the restriction on using appropriated funds for \n     publicity or propaganda purposes in the Consolidated \n     Appropriations Resolution of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, Div. J, \n     Tit. VI, Sec. 626, 117 Stat. 11, 470 (2003).\n       2. CMS, in using appropriations in violation of the \n     publicity or propaganda prohibition, incurred obligations in \n     excess of appropriations available for that purpose. See B-\n     300325, Dec. 13, 2002. Accordingly, CMS violated the \n     Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, and must report the \n     violation to the Congress and President in accordance with 31 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1351 and Office of Management and Budget Circular \n     No. A-11.\n\n\n                                DECISION\n\n       In a March 10, 2004, opinion, we concluded that the \n     Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS) use of \n     appropriated funds to produce and distribute a flyer and \n     print and television advertisements, as part of a campaign to \n     inform Medicare beneficiaries about changes to Medicare under \n     the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization \n     Act of 2003 (MMA), did not violate publicity or propaganda \n     prohibitions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004, \n     Pub. L. No. 108-199, Div. F, Tit. VI, Sec. 624, 118 Stat. 3, \n     356 (2004), and the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of \n     2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, Div. J, Tit. VI, Sec. 626, 117 Stat. \n     11, 470 (2003). B-302504, Mar. 10, 2004. During our \n     development of that opinion, we learned that the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency in the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, had prepared as part \n     of this campaign video news releases or VNRs, including a \n     news story for television broadcast, to provide information \n     to the television medium. Letter from Dennis G. Smith, \n     Director, Center for Medicaid and State Operations, to Gary \n     L. Kepplinger, Deputy General Counsel, General Accounting \n     Office (GAO), April 2, 2004 (Smith Letter). The VNRs consist \n     of (1) video clips known as B-roll film, (2) introductory and \n     concluding slates with facts about MMA, and (3) prepackaged \n     news reports referred to as story packages with suggested \n     lead-in anchor scripts. Importantly, the prepackaged story \n     packages and anchor scripts did not include statements noting \n     that they had been prepared by CMS.\n       Our March 10, 2004, opinion addressed only the flyer and \n     advertisements and did not address CMS's use of appropriated \n     funds to prepare and distribute the VNRs. This decision \n     addresses whether CMS's use of appropriated funds to produce \n     and distribute the VNRs violated the publicity or propaganda \n     prohibitions enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations \n     Resolution of 2003, cited above. CMS told us that it used \n     fiscal year 2003 CMS program management appropriations to \n     produce and distribute the VNRs. Smith Letter, Enclosure 1 at \n     8. As we explain below, we conclude that of the three parts \n     of the VNRs, one part--the story packages with suggested \n     scripts--violates the prohibition. In neither the story \n     packages nor the lead-in anchor scripts did HHS or CMS \n     identify itself to the television viewing audience as the \n     source of the news reports. Further, in each news report, the \n     content was attributed to an individual purporting to be a \n     reporter but actually hired by an HHS subcontractor.\n       To perform our analysis, we requested information from CMS \n     regarding the production, filming and distribution of the VNR \n     materials. Letter from Gary L. Kepplinger, Deputy General \n     Counsel, GAO, to Dennis G. Smith, Acting Administrator, CMS, \n     March 17, 2004. CMS responded by letter dated April 2, 2004. \n     Smith Letter. We met with agency officials to clarify their \n     responses and to gain further factual information regarding \n     the production and distribution of the VNRs at issue. In \n     addition to the information CMS provided us, we also examined \n     available information regarding the use of VNRs generally by \n     the broadcast media and their current use as a public \n     relations tool.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n     Use of VNRs\n       VNRs have become a popular public relations tool to \n     disseminate desired information from private corporations, \n     nonprofit organizations and government entities, in part \n     because they provide a cheaper alternative to more \n     traditional broadcast advertising.\\1\\ While the practice is \n     widespread and widely known by those in the media industry, \n     the quality and content of materials considered to constitute \n     a VNR can vary greatly.\\2\\ Generally, a VNR package may \n     contain a prepackaged news story, referred to as a story \n     package, accompanied by a suggested script, video clips known \n     as B-roll film, and various other promotional materials.\\3\\ \n     These materials are produced in the same manner in which \n     television news organizations produce materials for their own \n     news segments.\\4\\ By eliminating the production effort and \n     costs of news organizations, producers of VNRs find news \n     organizations willing to broadcast a favorable news segment \n     on the desired topic.\\5\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     See footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Since 1990, there has been a notable rise in the \n     distribution of VNR materials.\\6\\ With growing use of VNRs, \n     journalism scholars began questioning the effect of this \n     third-party material upon the perception that news was \n     derived from a neutral source.\\7\\ In particular, scholars \n     raised concerns regarding the influence of third-party \n     sources.\\8\\\n       Given these ethical concerns, there have been a number of \n     studies of the use of VNRs by the broadcast industry. Several \n     journalism scholars attribute the rise in the use of VNRs to \n     the economic circumstances of the industry.\\9\\ In smaller \n     broadcast markets during the early 1990s, news stations \n     suffered significant reductions in staff and budget, and had \n     difficulty obtaining footage of certain public interest \n     events.\\10\\ Footage from an outside source helped stations \n     fill airtime with programming that would otherwise not be \n     available and helped avoid depletion of already overextended \n     funds.\\11\\\n       Studies also show, however, that most news organizations \n     using VNR materials often use only a portion or edited \n     versions of the materials provided.\\12\\ Still, parties \n     interested in obtaining the maximum audience for VNR \n     materials argue that, even if the story package or scripted \n     materials are not used in full, the production of a \n     professionally complete news story provides a framework for \n     the message conveyed in the\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\n     final broadcast.\\13\\ This allows the story package producer \n     to assert some control over the message conveyed to the \n     target audience.\n       Also, the use of VNRs may be attributed to the ease with \n     which the materials may be distributed. While some packages \n     are distributed directly from the source to the television \n     stations, satellite and electronic news services such as \n     provided by CNN Newsource facilitate distribution to a number \n     of news markets in a short period of time.\\14\\ Broadcast \n     stations subscribe to these services, which provide, in \n     addition to VNR materials, journalist reports and stories, \n     and advertising.\\15\\ While the news services label VNRs \n     differently than independent journalist news reports, there \n     apparently is no industry standard as to the labeling of \n     VNRs. In fact, when questioned about the use of the VNR \n     materials at issue here, some news organizations indicated \n     that they misread the label or they mistook the story \n     package as an independent journalist news story on CNN \n     Newsource.\\16\\\n       Professional journalism societies have noted in their codes \n     of ethics that journalists should resist influence from \n     outside sources, including advertisers and special interest \n     groups.\\17\\ Because VNRs consist of information generated by \n     a group with a distinct perspective on an issue, the \n     unfettered use of VNRs may run afoul of these principles.\\18\\ \n     Moreover, professional organizations warn against using \n     materials that would deceive audiences.\\19\\ VNRs that \n     disclose the source of information to the target audience \n     alleviate these ethical concerns.\n     CMS's Medicare VNRs\n       The CMS VNRs consist of three videotapes with corresponding \n     scripts. CMS informed us that these videotapes represent what \n     a news organization would receive when obtaining the VNR \n     materials. Two of the videotapes are in English, and one is \n     in Spanish. The two English videotapes contain three items: \n     (1) video clips, referred to as B-roll, (2) slates \n     containing, among other things, title cards with facts on \n     MMA, and (3) a video segment called a ``story package.'' \\20\\ \n     The B-roll provides news organizations with footage for use \n     in developing their own news reports. The slate is a visual \n     feed from CMS to recipient news organizations that contains \n     some facts regarding MMA.\\21\\ The last slate in the VNR \n     materials directs the receiving news station to contact CMS \n     for information on the VNR materials. The story packages are \n     news reports prepared by CMS rather than a news organization.\n       The B-roll clips on each videotape are exactly the same and \n     contain footage of President Bush, in the presence of Members \n     of Congress and others, signing MMA into law, and a series of \n     clips of seniors engaged in various leisure and health-\n     related activities, including consulting with a pharmacist \n     and being screened for blood pressure. The English videotapes \n     also include clips of Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Leslie \n     Norwalk, Acting Deputy Administrator of CMS, making \n     statements regarding changes to Medicare under MMA. The \n     Spanish videotape includes clips of Dr. Cristina Beato of CMS \n     offering statements about MMA's changes to Medicare, instead \n     of Thompson and Norwalk.\n       The two English VNRs contain segments entitled ``story \n     packages'' that consist of self-contained news reports \n     regarding Medicare benefits under MMA. Although the English \n     story packages contain several of the same B-roll video clips \n     and the same narrator, identified as Karen Ryan, the contents \n     of the two story packages vary. With each story package, CMS \n     included a script for a news anchor of the recipient news \n     organization to read as a lead-in to the CMS produced news \n     report. One story package focuses on CMS's advertising \n     campaign regarding MMA (Story Package 1). The suggested \n     anchor lead-in states that ``the Federal Government is \n     launching a new, nationwide campaign to educate 41 million \n     people with Medicare about improvements to Medicare.'' The \n     lead-in ends with ``Karen Ryan explains.'' The video portion \n     of the story package begins with an excerpt of the television \n     advertisement with audio indicating ``it's the same Medicare \n     you've always counted on plus more benefits.'' Karen Ryan \n     explains, ``That's the main message Medicare's advertising \n     campaign drives home about the law.'' As more clips from the \n     advertisement appear, Karen Ryan continues her narration, \n     indicating that the campaign helps beneficiaries answer their \n     questions about the new law, the administration is \n     emphasizing that seniors can keep their Medicare the same, \n     and the campaign is part of a larger effort to educate people \n     with Medicare about the new law. The story package ends with \n     Karen Ryan stating: ``In Washington, I'm Karen Ryan \n     reporting.''\n       The second English story package (Story Package 2) focuses \n     on various provisions of the new prescription drug benefit of \n     MMA and does not mention the advertising campaign of CMS. The \n     anchor lead-in states: ``In December, President Bush signed \n     into law the first ever prescription drug benefit for people \n     with Medicare.'' The anchor lead-in then notes, ``[t]here \n     have been a lot of questions about'' MMA and its changes to \n     Medicare and ``Karen Ryan helps sort through the details.'' \n     The video portion of the news report starts with footage of \n     President Bush signing MMA. Karen Ryan's voice narration \n     indicates that when MMA was ``signed into law last month, \n     millions of people who are covered by Medicare began asking \n     how it will help them.'' Next, the segment runs footage of \n     Tommy Thompson, in which he states that ``it will be the same \n     Medicare system but with new benefits. . . .'' Karen Ryan \n     continues her narration, stating ``most of the attention has \n     focused on the new prescription drug benefit . . . all people \n     with Medicare will be able to get coverage that will lower \n     their prescription drug spending . . . Medicare will offer \n     some immediate help through a discount card.'' She also tells \n     viewers that new preventive benefits will be available, low-\n     income individuals may qualify for a $600 credit on available \n     drug discount cards, and ``Medicare officials emphasize that \n     no one will be forced to sign up for any of the new \n     benefits.'' Karen Ryan's narration leads into clips of \n     Secretary Thompson and Leslie Norwalk explaining other \n     beneficial provisions of MMA. Similar to Story Package 1, \n     Story Package 2 ends with ``In Washington, I'm Karen Ryan \n     reporting.''\n       The Spanish-language materials contain the same three items \n     as the English language VNRs-a B-roll, slates and a story \n     package (Story Package 3). After the B-roll segments, the \n     story package segment appears. This segment is considerably \n     longer than its two English counterparts. Similar to Story \n     Package 2, Story Package 3 focuses on prescription drug \n     benefits available under MMA. It does not mention that CMS is \n     engaging in an advertising campaign. Here, the anchor lead-in \n     is similar to Story Package 2, except the anchor indicates \n     that Alberto Garcia ``helps sort through the details.'' The \n     video segment begins with the footage of President Bush \n     signing MMA into law as Alberto Garcia narrates that after \n     signing the law, millions of people who are covered by \n     Medicare began asking how the new law will help them. The \n     remainder of the story package contains identical footage of \n     Dr. Beato and of seniors engaged in various activities as in \n     the B-roll footage. During the video clips of seniors, \n     Alberto Garcia narrates that the focus of most of the \n     attention to MMA is on the prescription drug benefit \n     available in 2006. He also explains that prescription drug \n     discount cards will be available in June 2004 and that \n     ``[p]eople with Medicare may be able to choose from several \n     different drug discount cards, offering up to 25 percent \n     savings on certain medications.'' \\22\\ Alberto Garcia \n     concludes his report, stating: ``In Washington, I'm Alberto \n     Garcia reporting.''\n       In response to our request for more factual information on \n     CMS's practice of using VNRs, CMS forwarded to us a fourth \n     videotape. This tape contains Story Package 2 and two VNRs, \n     each of which CMS described as a ``produced story segment,'' \n     that HHS produced and distributed in 1999 under then-\n     Secretary Donna Shalala of the Clinton Administration. Smith \n     Letter at 2. These two story packages were designed to inform \n     beneficiaries of the Clinton Administration's position on \n     prescription drug benefits and preventive health benefits. \n     CMS pointed out similarities between the story packages in \n     current use and the earlier ones. Much like the story \n     packages at issue here, the earlier story packages contain \n     footage of seniors engaging in various activities, then-HHS \n     Secretary Donna Shalala appearing to answer questions \n     regarding the provisions of proposed legislation for a \n     prescription drug benefits and preventive health benefits, \n     and a report of the Administration's proposal. The earlier \n     story packages end with the phrase, ``Lovell Brigham, \n     reporting.''\n     Distribution of Medicare VNRs\n       CMS explained to us that HHS hired Ketchum, Inc., to \n     disseminate information regarding the changes to Medicare \n     under MMA. Specifically, HHS contracted with Ketchum to \n     assist HHS and its agencies with a ``full range of social \n     marketing activities to plan, develop, produce, and deliver \n     consumer-based communication programs, strategies, and \n     materials.'' Ketchum Contract at 2. Ketchum hired Home Front \n     Communications (HFC) to create the VNR materials. HFC is a \n     broadcast public relations firm specializing in producing \n     video products. Smith Letter, Enclosure 1 at 6-7. HFC wrote \n     the VNR scripts, which were reviewed, edited, and approved by \n     CMS and HHS. Id. at 7. HFC completed all production work, \n     including filming, audio work and editing. The final VNR \n     packages were reviewed and approved by CMS and HHS. Id.\n       The VNR materials were then distributed to television \n     stations via satellite, electronic services provided by CNN \n     Newsource, and/or mail. Id. at 2. CMS and HFC staff members \n     contacted some news directors by telephone to inform the \n     stations that the materials were available. Id. Additionally, \n     CMS e-mailed and faxed news advisories to news stations \n     regarding the VNR availability. Id.; see also Smith Letter, \n     Enclosure 4. The advisory indicated the satellite coordinates \n     to obtain the materials, how to find the materials on CNN \n     Newsource, and bullet-point key facts regarding the new \n     benefits available. Smith Letter, Enclosure 4. The advisory \n     further explains what the visual elements of the VNR \n     consisted of, including interviews, a story package, and B-\n     roll. Id. All stations could access satellite distribution. \n     Smith Letter, Enclosure 1 at 6. Computers of the subscribing \n     location stations' newsrooms could access CNN Newsource. Id. \n     The advisory directed news stations to contact Robin Lane, an \n     HFC employee, for more information on retrieving VNR \n     materials. CMS also mailed videotapes of VNR materials to \n     those television stations that requested the material. Smith \n     Letter, Enclosure 4. CMS provided us a list of television\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\n     stations that aired at least some portion of the VNRs \n     between January 22, 2004, and February 12, 2004. This list \n     contained 40 stations in 33 different markets. Smith \n     Letter, Enclosure 3. CMS did not identify what parts of \n     the VNR each station broadcasted. One of the stations that \n     aired the story package was WBRZ, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \n     According to transcripts published on the World Wide Web, \n     WBRZ broadcast Story Package 2 and used the suggested \n     anchor lead-in script on January 22, 2004, in its \n     entirety.\\23\\ At least two other television stations may \n     have aired either Story Package 1 or 2 in their entirety. \n     A review of excerpts of transcripts from Video Monitoring \n     Services of America show that two stations, WMBC-TV in New \n     Jersey (Story Package 1) and WAGA-TV in Atlanta (Story \n     Package 2), aired MMA news stories ending with Karen \n     Ryan's by-line.\\24\\\n\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n       This is the first occasion that we have had to review the \n     use of appropriated funds by government entities to engage in \n     the production of VNRs. At issue here is whether CMS's use of \n     appropriated funds to produce VNR materials constituted a \n     proper use of those funds. In its written response and during \n     our informal interview, CMS contended that the production of \n     the VNR materials constitutes a ``standard practice in the \n     news sector'' and a ``well-established and well-understood \n     use of a common news and public affairs practice.'' Smith \n     Letter at 2. While we recognize that the use of VNR \n     materials, with already prepared story packages, is a common \n     practice in the public relations industry and utilized not \n     only by government entities but also the private and non-\n     profit sector as well, our analysis of the proper use of \n     appropriated funds is not based upon the norms in the public \n     relations and media industry.\n       CMS told us that it used fiscal year 2003 CMS program \n     management appropriations to produce and distribute the VNR \n     package. Smith Letter, Enclosure 1 at 8. While CMS may have \n     authority to use appropriated funds to disseminate \n     information regarding the changes to Medicare pursuant to \n     MMA,\\25\\ this authority is subject to the publicity or \n     propaganda prohibition appearing in the annual appropriation \n     act.\\26\\ Specifically, this prohibition states: ``No part of \n     any appropriation contained in this or any other Act shall be \n     used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United \n     States not heretofore authorized by the Congress.'' Pub. L. \n     No. 108-7, Div. J, Tit. VI, Sec. 626, 117 Stat. 11, 470 \n     (2003).\n       Our March 10, 2004, opinion noted that to date we have \n     applied the publicity or propaganda restriction to prohibit \n     the use of appropriated funds for materials that are self-\n     aggrandizing, purely partisan in nature, or covert as to \n     source. See generally B-302504. Of these three types, the VNR \n     materials on MMA raise concerns as to whether they constitute \n     ``covert'' propaganda because they are misleading as to \n     source.\\27\\\n       CMS asserts that, in keeping with the traditional practices \n     in the media industry, CMS or the service it used to \n     distribute the VNR materials clearly labeled the materials as \n     VNRs. See generally Smith Letter. Because they are so labeled \n     and easily identifiable among those in the media, CMS \n     contends that the story packages could not be considered \n     misleading as to source. CMS officials also assert that it \n     was not their intent to distribute the VNR materials to the \n     broadcast stations covertly and that the labeling of the \n     entire VNR package clearly attributes the source of the \n     information to HHS and CMS. Smith Letter, Enclosure 1 at 4.\n       The ``critical element of covert propaganda is the \n     concealment of the agency's role in sponsoring the \n     materials.'' B-229257, June 10, 1988. In our case law, \n     findings of propaganda are predicated upon the fact that the \n     target audience could not ascertain the information source. \n     For example, we found government-prepared editorials to be \n     covert propaganda; although the newspapers who would have \n     printed the suggested editorials should have been aware of \n     the source, the reading public would not have been aware of \n     the source. B-223098, Oct. 10, 1986. In that case, we \n     examined materials concerning President Reagan's proposal to \n     transfer the Small Business Administration (SBA) to the \n     Department of Commerce. Id. In support of the \n     Administration's proposal, SBA prepared and distributed a \n     variety of materials, including suggested editorials. SBA \n     prepared these editorials and provided them to newspapers \n     around the country to run as the position of the recipient \n     newspapers without disclosing to the readers of those \n     editorials that SBA was the source of the information. \n     Because the SBA-prepared editorials did not identify SBA as \n     the source, SBA's use of appropriated funds to prepare and \n     distribute the editorials violated the publicity or \n     propaganda prohibition.\\28\\\n       In a 1987 case, the Department of State's Office of Public \n     Diplomacy for Latin America violated the prohibition by \n     paying consultants to write op-ed pieces in support of the \n     Administration's policy on Central America for distribution \n     to newspapers. B-229069, Sept. 30, 1987. The State Department \n     did not advise the newspapers of its involvement in the \n     writing of the op-ed pieces. The newspapers published these \n     articles for distribution to an equally uninformed audience \n     of individual readers. These materials were ``propaganda'' \n     within the ``common understanding'' of the term, and they \n     constituted ``deceptive covert propaganda'' designed to \n     influence the media and public to support the \n     Administration's Latin American policies. Id.\n       In defending its VNRs, CMS fails to distinguish among the \n     three separate parts of its VNRs and the intended audience \n     for each part. We do not dispute the fact that CMS labeled \n     the entire package of VNR materials so that the receiving \n     news organizations could identify HHS or CMS as the source of \n     the information, whether they were received directly from CMS \n     through the mail or retrieved by the news organizations from \n     CNN Newsource or other satellite services.\\29\\ However, in \n     both B-223098 and B-229069, the readers of the printed \n     editorials and op-ed pieces would not have been aware of the \n     government's influence. In analyzing whether the three \n     separate materials that make up the VNR package are covert \n     propaganda, we do not consider the VNR as a whole, because \n     each of the three items that comprise the VNR was prepared \n     for a different purpose and audience.\n       In its written response and during our interviews, CMS \n     indicated that the 41 million Medicare beneficiaries, who may \n     comprise the news stations' viewing audience, and not just \n     the television stations themselves, were the intended \n     audience of the VNR materials. Some VNR materials, including \n     the B-roll and the slates, could not reasonably be targeted \n     directly to a television viewing audience. By their very \n     nature, the B-roll and slates were designed to be \n     incorporated in a news story of the receiving stations' own \n     creation. CMS clearly identified itself as the source of \n     these materials to the television stations receiving them. \n     CMS made efforts to notify the news stations of the \n     availability of these materials via e-mail, telephone, and \n     facsimile and the available distribution sources identified \n     the materials as a VNR. Smith Letter at 2, Enclosure 1 at 2. \n     Accordingly, the B-roll and slates do not violate the \n     publicity or propaganda prohibition.\n       The story packages and lead-in scripts, however, were \n     clearly designed to be seen and heard directly by the \n     television viewing audience and not solely by the media \n     receiving the package. CMS and HHS officials told us that the \n     story packages were designed so that television stations \n     could include them in their news broadcasts exactly as CMS \n     had produced them, without any production effort by the \n     stations. The suggested anchor lead-in scripts facilitate the \n     unaltered use of the story package, announcing the package as \n     a news story by Karen Ryan or Alberto Garcia. Importantly, \n     CMS included no statement or other reference in either the \n     story package or the anchor lead-in script to ensure that the \n     viewing audience would be aware that CMS is the source of the \n     purported news story.\n       The story packages, similar to the SBA editorials and the \n     State Department op-ed pieces, could be reproduced with no \n     alteration thereby allowing the targeted audience to believe \n     that the information came from a nongovernment source or \n     neutral party. The story packages of the VNRs consist of a \n     complete message that could be reproduced directly by the \n     news organizations to be viewed by the audience of the \n     newscasts. As such, the viewing audience does not know, for \n     example, that Karen Ryan and Alberto Garcia were paid with \n     HHS funds for their work.\n       The receiving news organization's ability to edit the story \n     packages to produce an independent news story does not negate \n     the fact that CMS designed the segments to broadcast as CMS \n     had produced them. CMS's effort to identify itself to the \n     news organizations that received the VNRs did not alert \n     television viewers that CMS was the source of the story \n     package. CMS has acknowledged that the television viewer was \n     the targeted audience. Because CMS did not identify itself as \n     the source of the news report, the story packages, including \n     the lead-in script, violate the publicity or propaganda \n     prohibition.\\30\\\n       In a modest but meaningful way, the publicity or propaganda \n     restriction helps to mark the boundary between an agency \n     making information available to the public and agencies \n     creating news reports unbeknownst to the receiving audience. \n     It is not the only marker Congress has placed in statute \n     between the government and the American press, however. \n     Consistent with the restrictions on publicity or propaganda \n     ``within the United States,'' \\31\\ Congress has prohibited \n     the U.S. Information Agency and its succeeding agency, Board \n     of Broadcasting Governors, created by Congress for the \n     purpose of producing pro-U.S. government news reports and \n     print materials for international audiences, 22 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1461, from broadcasting to domestic audiences, 22 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1461(b), 1461-1a.\\32\\ In limiting domestic \n     dissemination of the U.S. government-produced news reports, \n     Congress was reflecting concern that the availability of \n     government news broadcasts may infringe upon the traditional \n     freedom of the press and attempt to control public opinion. \n     See B-118654-O.M., Feb. 12, 1979. Congress also restricted \n     government-produced programming for domestic audiences in the \n     law creating the Public Broadcasting Corporation. 47 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 396. Although the mission of the Public Broadcasting \n     Corporation includes instructional, educational and cultural \n     purposes, the statute creating the Corporation prohibits the \n     Corporation from directly producing any news programming. 47 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 396(g)(3)(A) & (B).\\33\\ While Congress authorized \n     HHS to conduct a wide-range of informational activities, CMS \n     was given no authority to produce and disseminate \n     unattributed news stories.\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\n       CMS makes two other arguments in support of its use of \n     appropriated funds to produce and distribute the story \n     packages. Neither argument is persuasive. CMS argues that the \n     VNR materials cannot be covert propaganda because the VNR \n     materials were not produced as a ``purported editorial, \n     advocacy piece or commentary.'' Smith Letter, Enclosure 1 at \n     4. CMS asserts that the narration by Karen Ryan (and \n     presumably Alberto Garcia) does not take a position on the \n     MMA. Id. While we agree that the story packages may not be \n     characterized as editorials, explicit advocacy is not \n     necessary to find a violation of the prohibition.\\34\\ As with \n     the SBA-suggested editorials, the content of the story \n     packages themselves would not violate the publicity or \n     propaganda prohibition if identifying the source to the \n     target audience were not an issue. See B-302504, Mar. 10, \n     2004.\n       Further, CMS refers to our recent opinion in B-301022, Mar. \n     10, 2004, regarding the Office of National Drug Control \n     Policy's (ONDCP) open letter to state-level prosecutors \n     opposing efforts to legalize marijuana and other controlled \n     substances.\\35\\ Smith Letter, Enclosure 1 at 3. The open \n     letter contained two attachments, one of which did not \n     identify ONDCP as the source of the information. B-301022, \n     Mar. 10, 2004. We found that the unidentified attachment was \n     not a violation of the publicity or propaganda prohibition \n     because the document was part of a package that clearly \n     identified ONDCP as the source and because there was no \n     attempt to portray the contents of the document as the \n     position of an individual outside the agency. Id.\n       This reasoning cannot be applied to the story packages at \n     issue here. The target audience of the ONDCP letter and \n     attachments, the state prosecutors, had access to the entire \n     package. The television viewing audiences, however, could not \n     view the entire MMA VNR package. Evidence shows, and CMS \n     acknowledges, that the story package could be broadcast \n     without edit or alteration, and actually was broadcasted \n     unedited in some markets. Television audiences viewing the \n     story packages were not in a position to determine the source \n     from the other materials in the VNR packages. Unlike the \n     ONDCP materials, the content of the message expressed in the \n     story packages was attributed to alleged reporters, Karen \n     Ryan and Alberto Garcia, and not to HHS or CMS. Nothing in \n     the story packages permit the viewer to know that Karen Ryan \n     and Alberto Garcia were paid with federal funds through a \n     contractor to report the message in the story packages. The \n     entire story package was developed with appropriated funds \n     but appears to be an independent news story. The failure to \n     identify HHS or CMS as the source within the story package is \n     not remedied by the fact that the other materials in the VNR \n     package identify HHS and CMS as the source of the materials \n     or that the content of the story package did not attempt to \n     attribute the agency's position to an individual outside the \n     agency.\\36\\\n       HHS's misuse of appropriated funds in violation of the \n     publicity or propaganda prohibition also constitutes a \n     violation of the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(a). \n     The Antideficiency Act prohibits making or authorizing an \n     expenditure or obligation that exceeds available budget \n     authority. See B-300325, Dec. 13, 2002. Because CMS has no \n     appropriation available for the production and distribution \n     of materials that violate the publicity or propaganda \n     prohibition, CMS has violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1341(a). See B-300325, Dec. 13, 2002. CMS must \n     report its Antideficiency Act violation to the President and \n     the Congress. 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1351.\\37\\ Office of Management \n     and Budget Circular No. A-11 provides guidance to executive \n     agencies on information to include in Antideficiency Act \n     reports.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       Although the VNR materials were labeled so that the \n     television news stations could identify CMS as the source of \n     the materials, part of the VNR materials--the story packages \n     and lead-in anchor scripts--were targeted not only to the \n     television news stations but also to the television viewing \n     audience. Neither the story packages nor scripts identified \n     HHS or CMS as the source to the targeted television audience, \n     and the content of the news reports was attributed to \n     individuals purporting to be reporters, but actually hired by \n     an HHS subcontractor. For these reasons, the use of \n     appropriated funds for production and distribution of the \n     story packages and suggested scripts violated the publicity \n     or propaganda prohibition of the Consolidated Appropriation \n     Resolution of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, Div. J, Tit. VI, \n     Sec. 626, 117 Stat. 11, 470 (2003). Moreover, because CMS had \n     no appropriation available to produce and distribute \n     materials in violation of the publicity or propaganda \n     prohibition, CMS violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1341. CMS must report the Antideficiency Act violation \n     to the Congress and the President. 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1351.\n                                                Anthony H.

Our legal opinion of March \n     10, 2004, B-302504, reviewed this material, and found that \n     HHS's use of appropriated funds for the advertisement did not \n     violate the publicity or propaganda prohibition.\n     \\21\\ In addition to the title cards, the slates contain the \n     visual feeds of the B-roll and the story packages. Each slate \n     may be separated and edited for individual use by the \n     receiving television station. For example, the receiving \n     station could separate the slate with the B-roll footage of \n     seniors engaged in health-related activities from the other \n     B-roll footage and the story packages.

These two \n     story packages were not brought to our attention at that \n     time. Had we been aware of the use of story packages in this \n     or other contexts, the principles discussed here would have \n     been applicable.

On \n     balance, the contents of the story packages consist of a \n     favorable report on effects on Medicare beneficiaries, \n     containing the same notable omissions and weaknesses as the \n     flyer and advertisements that we reviewed in our March 2004 \n     opinion.\n     \\35\\ The National District Attorneys Association sent the \n     open letter and attachments with its own cover letter to the \n     state-level prosecutors.\n     \\38\\ CMS also argues that VNRs are similar to press releases \n     as ``[e]ach is designed to provide information to reporters \n     and is crafted for the use by the media to which it is \n     directed. Each provides quotes, facts and background that a \n     reporter can use to write or produce a story. Each is created \n     to provide context to the issue.'' Smith Letter at 1. There \n     may, indeed, be similarities between these two public \n     relations tools. We are familiar with the practice of \n     preparing press releases to include information useful to \n     reporters who then prepare and produce their own news stories \n     for publication. With the story packages, CMS prepared news \n     stories using alleged reporters rather than simply offering \n     information to reporters who would prepare their own stories.\n     \\37\\ We were unable to identify the amount of HHS's \n     violation. HHS advised that the English language story \n     packages cost $33,250, and that the Spanish language VNR cost \n     $9,500. Smith Letter, Enclosure 1 at 8. Although requested, \n     HHS did not provide further documentation of these costs to \n     us.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Guardsmen and \nReservists Financial Relief Act of 2004. National guardsmen and \nreservists are serving our country with virtue and valor in the war on \nterror. These brave men and women deserve recognition for the many \nsacrifices they make in serving and protecting this great country. \nTheir families also deserve protection from potential financial \nhardships experienced at home that may result from the guardsmen or \nreservists being called to service.\n  Since September 11, 2004, many men and women have left their jobs in \nthe private sector to fill vitally needed positions for our national \ndefense. In playing the role of true citizen soldiers, some have taken \ndrastic pay cuts from their civilian jobs in order to fulfill their \nduty to their country. This is beginning to create financial strains on \ntheir families.\n  The Department of Defense estimates that 3 percent of its reservists \nhave been called up more than once since September 11, 2001. \nAdditionally, the GAO reports that nearly 41 percent of reservists are \nimpacted by a pay discrepancy between his or her military and civilian \nsalary.\n  The Guardsmen and Reservists Financial Relief Act of 2004 will see \nthat the families and loved ones of Guard members and reservists, who \nare called to service after September 11, 2001, can access retirement \nfunds without incurring any penalties.\n  This important legislation will allow Guard members and reservists \nwho are activated for more than 179 days to make penalty-free early \nwithdrawals from their IRA or 401(k) plan.\n  This bill retroactively covers members of the Guard and Reserve who \nwere called to service beginning on September 11, 2001, and extends \ncoverage to those who may continue to be called on to serve on an \nactive basis through September 12, 2005.\n  Furthermore, this bill will encourage repayment of any withdrawal \nfrom an IRA or 401(k) fund within 2 years of a guardsman or reservist \nending their active duty, ensuring retirement, financial security for \nsoldiers and their families.\n  It also temporarily lifts the contribution cap to equal the amount of \nthe withdrawn funds to allow for full repayment.\n  National Guard members and military reservists have been imperative \nto the military strength of our Nation over the years. Today, almost \nhalf of our military strength is from those who serve in the National \nGuard and military Reserve. There are currently 169,000 National Guard \nmembers and military reservists on active duty helping fight the war on \nterror.\n  Since September 11, 2001, 373,707 total National Guard members and \nmilitary reservists have been mobilized. There is no doubt we owe a \ngreat deal to our men and women in uniform who are so honorably serving \ntheir country by fighting the war on terror. Helping to ease the \nfinancial burdens of families of Guard members and reservists is a good \nstart.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on the \nGuardsmen and Reservists Financial Relief of 2004 to provide members of \nour National Guard and military Reserve with the financial relief they \ndeserve for loyally serving and protecting this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require enhanced disclosure to consumers regarding \nthe consequences of making only minimum required payments in the \nrepayment of credit card debt; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Credit Card \nMinimum Payment Warning Act. I greatly appreciate the significant \ncontributions Senator Durbin made to this\n\n[[Page S6094]]\n\nbill, and I thank him very much for that. Also, I thank Senator Leahy \nand Senator Schumer for cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Americans are carrying enormous amounts of debt. In 2003, consumer \ndebt increased for the first time to more than $2 trillion, according \nto the Federal Reserve. This is a 28-percent increase since the year \n2000. According to the Daily Bankruptcy News, consumer debt is now \nequal to 110 percent of disposable income. Ten years ago, it was 85 \npercent; and 20 years ago, it was 65 percent. A key component of \nhousehold debt can be attributed to the use of credit cards. Revolving \ndebt, mostly comprised of credit card debt, has more than doubled from \n$313 billion in January 1994 to $753 billion in debt in January 2004. A \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group and Consumer Federation of America \nanalysis of Federal Reserve data indicates that the average household \nwith debt carries approximately $10,000 to $12,000 in total revolving \ndebt and has nine credit cards.\n  More and more working families are trying to meet growing financial \nobligations and are having difficulties surviving financially. When \ninterest rates do eventually rise, consumers' increasing debt \nobligations will be compounded further.\n  As household debt has increased, bankruptcy filings have surged to \nrecord levels. In the year 2003, more than 1.6 million consumers filed \nfor bankruptcy. This staggering amount is an increase of 5.6 percent \nover the previous record set in 2002. Bankruptcies disrupt the lives of \nconsumers and limit their ability to access credit in the future. In \naddition, bankruptcies lead to significant financial losses for \ncreditors. It is imperative that we make consumers more aware of the \nlong-term effects of their financial decisions, particularly in \nmanaging their credit card debt, so that they can avoid bankruptcy.\n\n  Even as we contemplate the consequences of more and more debt, it has \nbecome easier to access credit. Pre-approved credit card offers are now \na routine piece of mail. Students are offered credit cards at earlier \nages, especially in view of the success that credit card companies are \nhaving with their aggressive campaigns targeted towards college \nstudents. Mr. President, 55 percent of college students acquire their \nfirst credit card during their first year in college, and 83 percent of \ncollege students have at least one credit card. Forty-five percent of \ncollege students are in credit card debt, with the average debt being \nover $3,000.\n  While it is relatively easy to obtain credit, not enough is done to \nensure that credit is properly managed. Currently, credit card \nstatements fail to include all of the information necessary to allow \nindividuals to make fully informed financial decisions. Additional \ndisclosure is needed to ensure that individuals completely understand \nthe implications of their credit card use.\n  Our legislation will provide a wakeup call for consumers. It will \nmake it very clear what costs consumers will incur if they make only \nthe minimum payments on their credit cards. The personalized \ninformation they will receive for each of their accounts will help them \nto make informed choices about the payments that they choose to make \ntowards their balance.\n  This bill requires a minimum payment warning notification on monthly \nstatements stating that making the minimum payment will increase the \namount of interest that will be paid and extend the amount of time it \nwill take to repay the outstanding balance. Consumers would have to be \ninformed of how many years and months it will take to repay their \nentire balance if they make only the minimum payments. In addition, the \ntotal costs in interest and principal, if the consumer pays only the \nminimum payment, would have to be disclosed. These provisions will make \nindividuals much more aware of the true costs of their credit card \ndebts.\n  The bill also requires that credit card companies provide useful \ninformation so that people can develop strategies to free themselves of \ncredit card debt. Consumers would have to be provided with the amount \nthey need to pay to eliminate their outstanding balance within 36 \nmonths. Finally, the legislation would require that creditors establish \na toll-free number so that consumers can access trustworthy credit \ncounselors. In order to ensure that consumers are referred from the \ntoll-free number to only trustworthy organizations, the agencies for \nreferral would have to be approved by the Federal Trade Commission and \nthe Federal Reserve Board as having met comprehensive quality \nstandards. These standards are necessary because certain credit \ncounseling agencies have abused their nonprofit, tax-exempt status and \nhave taken advantage of people seeking assistance in managing their \ndebts. People believe, sometimes mistakenly, that they can place blind \ntrust in nonprofit organizations and that their fees will be lower than \nthose of other credit counseling organizations.\n  Too many individuals may not realize that the credit counseling \nindustry does deserve the trust that consumers often place in it.\n  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act has been endorsed by the \nConsumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, and U.S. Public \nInterest Research Group.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support and factsheet from \nthese organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, U.S. \n           Public Interest Research Group,\n                                                     May 13, 2004:\n       Dear Senators Akaka and Durbin The undersigned national \n     consumer organizations write to strongly support the Credit \n     Card Minimum Payment Warning Act. The act would require \n     credit card issuers to disclose more information to consumers \n     about the costs associated with paying their bills at ever-\n     declining minimum payment rates. The Act provides a \n     personalized ``price tag'' so consumers can understand what \n     are the real costs of credit card debt and avoid financial \n     problems in the future.\n       Undisputed evidence links the rise in bankruptcy in recent \n     years to the increase in consumer credit outstanding. These \n     numbers have moved in lockstep for more than 20 years. \n     Revolving credit, for example (most of which is credit card \n     debt) ballooned from $214 billion in January 1990 to over \n     $750 billion currently. As a family debt increases, debt \n     service payments on items such as interest and late fees take \n     an ever-increasing piece of their budget. For some families, \n     this contributes to the collapse of their budget. Bankruptcy \n     becomes the only way out. (See the attached fact sheet for \n     more information about the scope and impact of credit card \n     debt.)\n       Credit card issuers have exacerbated the financial problems \n     that many families have faced by lowering minimum payment \n     amounts, from around 4 percent of the balance owed, to about \n     2 percent currently. This decline in the typical minimum \n     payment is a significant reason for the rise in consumer \n     bankruptcies in recent years. A low minimum payment often \n     barely covers interest obligations. It convinces many \n     borrowers that they are financially sound as long as they can \n     meet all of their minimum payment obligations. However, those \n     that cannot afford to make these payments often carry so much \n     debt that bankruptcy is usually the only viable option.\n       This bill will provide consumers several crucial pieces of \n     information on their monthly credit card statement:\n       A ``minimum payment warning'' that paying at the minimum \n     rate will increase the amount of interest that is owed and \n     the time it will take to repay the balance.\n       The number of years and months that it will take the \n     consumer to pay off the balance at the minimum rate.\n       The total costs in interest and principal if the consumer \n     pays at the minimum rate.\n       The monthly payment that would be required to pay the \n     balance off in three years.\n       The bill also requires that credit card companies provide a \n     toll-free number that consumers can call to receive \n     information about credit counseling and debt management \n     assistance. In order to assure that consumers are referred to \n     honest, legitimate non-profit credit counselors, the bill \n     requires the Federal Reserve to screen these agencies to \n     ensure that they meet rigorous quality standards.\n       Our groups command you for offering this very important and \n     long-overdue piece of legislation. It provides the kind of \n     personalized, timely disclosure information that will help \n     debt-choked families make informed decisions and start to \n     work their way back to financial health.\n           Sincerely,\n     Travis B.

At simple interest, \n     with no compounding, then, consumers pay at least $85 billion \n     annually in interest on credit card and other revolving debt.\n       Just about 55 percent of consumers carry debt. The rest are \n     convenience users.\n       From PIRG/CFA analysis of Federal Reserve data, the average \n     household with debt carriers approximately $10,000-12,000 in \n     total revolving debt and has approximately nine cards.\n\n\n           FACTS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS\n\n       A household making the monthly minimum required payments on \n     this debt (usually the greater of 2 percent of the unpaid \n     balance or $20) at the very low average 12.4% APR (many \n     consumers pay much higher penalty rates than this FRB-\n     reported average) would pay $1,175 in interest just in the \n     first year, even if these cards are cut up and not used \n     again.\n       This household would pay a total of over $9,800 in interest \n     over a period of 25 years and three months. That fact is not \n     disclosed.\n       A household or consumer who merely doubled their minimum \n     payment and paid 4% of the amount due would fare better. A \n     household or consumer that paid 10% of the balance each month \n     would fare much better.

Source: Demos\n       Thirty-nine percent of student loan borrowers now graduate \n     with unmanageable levels of debt, meaning that their monthly \n     payments are more than 8 percent of their monthly incomes. \n     According to PIRG analysis of the 1999-2000 NPSAS data, in \n     2001, 41 percent of the graduating seniors carried a credit \n     card balance, with an average balance of $3,071.

Mr. President, I am delighted to be working with my \nfriend the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, to \nintroduce a measure that provides a simple yet vital commodity to users \nof credit cards. The commodity I speak of: information.\n  The modern-day credit-reporting system has benefitted consumers by \nmaking affordable credit more widely available than ever before, and \nthe spread of credit cards is an important part of this ``credit \nrevolution.'' Along with this revolution in credit availability, \nhowever, we need a revolution in consumers' ability to manage their \ncredit. Two facts provide a quick and simple snapshot of our progress \nin that regard. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the number of \ndelinquencies on regular consumer loans went down. That same quarter, \nthe number of past-due credit card accounts hit an all-time high. \nClearly, an increasing number of credit card holders need to do a \nbetter job of responsibility managing their credit exposure.\n  This bill is designed to help them to do just that by providing that \nvital commodity, information. It would require credit card statements \nto provide information that will help consumers understand the \nrelationships among their total balance, the minimum payment due, and \nthe accumulation of interest over time. Specifically, this bill would \nrequire that statements provide the following information: the amount \nof time it would take to pay off the total balance if just minimum \npayments are made each month; the total cost to the consumer that would \nbe incurred over that time period, broken into interest and principle; \nthe payment amount that would be necessary each month to pay off the \ntotal balance in three years; and a toll-free telephone number \nconsumers could call to get a referral to a legitimate, accredited, \nnon-profit credit counseling agency.\n  We would like to think that the credit card companies would be glad \nto provide whatever information their consumers needed to responsibly \nmanage their credit. The fact of the matter is, though, that they do \nnot provide the information I just described, and chances are they will \nnot begin doing so on their own initiative. These numbers are not all \nthat hard to calculate. A few lines of computer code is all it would \ntake. And yet provision of these three simple numbers would provide a \nhuge payback by helping credit card users quickly and easily get a \nclearer understanding of the size of their balance and what the \nconsequences will be for them--in terms of time and financial cost--of \ncarrying that balance.\n  Let me be extra clear about one thing: This bill will help markets \nfor credit work better. As Adam Smith told us, the free flow of \ninformation is an absolute prerequisite of an efficient market. For \nmarkets to work, buyers must know and understand what they are buying. \nWhen our bill becomes law, credit card holders--who are simply buyers \nof credit in the marketplace--will have a better understanding of what \nexactly they are buying into, for the long term. The result can only be \nthat the credit markets will better serve us, and that our households \nand our Nation will be on stronger financial footing.\n  I thank my friend Senator Akaka for working with me on this important \nmeasure. I am also delighted that my friends Senator Schumer and \nSenator Leahy have joined us as original cosponsors. I urge the rest of \nmy colleagues to join us by cosponsoring this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Miller, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Sessions, \n        Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 2476. A bill to amend the USA PATRIOT Act to repeal the sunsets; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \nrepeal \nSec. 224 of the USA Patriot Act. Section 224 provides that 16 different \nparts of the Patriot Act ``shall cease to have effect on December 31, \n2005.'' The authorities subject to this sunset include some of the most \nimportant provisions of the Act. They are sections 201, wiretapping in \nterrorism cases; 202, wiretapping in computer fraud and abuse felony \ncase; 203(b) sharing wiretap information; 203(d), sharing foreign \nintelligence information; 204, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n(FISA) pen register/trap and trace exceptions; 206, roving FISA \nwiretaps; 207, duration of FISA surveillance of non-United States \npersons who are agents of a foreign power; 209, seizure of voice-mail \nmessages pursuant to warrants; 212, emergency disclosure of electronic \nsurveillance; 214, FISA pen register/ trap and trace authority; 215, \nFISA access to tangible items; 217, interception of computer trespasser \ncommunications; 218, purpose for FISA orders; 220, nationwide service \nof search warrants for electronic evidence; 223, civil liability and \ndiscipline for privacy violations; and 225, provider immunity for FISA \nwiretap assistance.\n  Rather than praise the Patriot Act myself, I would like to quote \nothers who have done so. First, I would note that the President has \ncalled on Congress to renew all parts of the Patriot Act that are \nscheduled to expire next year. As he has emphasized, ``to abandon the \nPatriot Act would deprive law enforcement and intelligence officers of \nneeded tools in the war on terror, and demonstrate willful blindness to \na continuing threat.''\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller, in a hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee yesterday, also voiced strong support for renewing the \nPatriot Act. As he noted, ``for over two and a half years, the PATRIOT \nAct has proved extraordinarily beneficial in the war on terrorism and \nhas changed the way the FBI does business. Many of our counterterrorism \nsuccesses, in fact, are the direct results of provisions included in \nthe Act, a number of which are scheduled to `sunset' at the end of next \nyear. I strongly believe it is vital to our national security to keep \neach of these provisions intact.''\n  Similarly, in an April 14 field hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee, Deputy Attorney General James Comey stated that the Patriot \nAct ``has made us immeasurably safer.'' He also responded to the \nallegation, occasionally made by some critics, that the Patriot Act was \npassed too quickly. He replied that ``the USA Patriot Act was not \nrushed, it actually came 10 years too late.''\n  The importance of the Patriot Act to American security also has drawn \nthe attention of the 9/11 Commission. Former New Jersey Governor Thomas \nKean has noted that the Commission has had ``witness after witness tell \nus that the Patriot Act has been very, very helpful, and if the Patriot \nAct, or portions of it, had been in place before 9/11, that would have \nbeen very helpful.''\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\n  This praise has not been limited to the Republicans who have \nparticipated in the Commission's proceedings. Former Attorney General \nJanet Reno, for example, testified before the Commission that \n``everything that's been done in the Patriot Act has been helpful.''\n  Nor is President Bush alone among the major candidates for President \nthis year in hailing the importance of the Patriot Act. Indeed, his \nprincipal rival for the office, Senator Kerry, recently claimed that he \nwould go even further than the President. According to an April 25 \nstory in the Los Angeles Times, Senator Kerry's spokesman insists that \n``it is the challenger, not the president, who brings the most muscular \nview of the Patriot Act into the race.'' Senator Kerry's presidential \ncampaign website even includes a ``Plan to Restore American Security,'' \nwhich lists as its number-one priority to ``improve intelligence \ncapabilities.'' Senator Kerry states that he ``understands that \nintelligence information is the key to disrupting and dismantling \nterrorist organizations and that we need to improve our intelligence \ncapabilities, both domestically and internationally, in order to win \nthe war on global terrorism.''\n  One reform implemented by the Patriot Act that Attorney General Reno \nand others have particularly emphasized is its authorization for \ninformation sharing. Because this part of the Patriot Act is often \npraised but infrequently described in detail, I would like to quote the \nfollowing accounts of pre-Patriot barriers to information sharing, and \nof the investigative successes that the removal of those barriers has \nmade possible.\n  The FISA Court of Review decision upholding the Patriot Act's \nauthorization for information sharing, In re: Sealed Case, 310 F.3d \n717,\n\n\n    F.I.S. Ct. Rev. 2002 , describes the origins of the pre-Patriot \n                               barriers:\n\n       Apparently to avoid running afoul of the primary purpose \n     test used by some courts, the 1995 [Attorney General] \n     Procedures [(``Procedures for Contacts Between the FBI and \n     the Criminal Division Concerning Foreign Intelligence and \n     Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations'')] limited \n     contacts between the FBI and the Criminal Division in cases \n     where FISA surveillance or searches were being conducted by \n     the FBI for foreign intelligence (FI) or foreign \n     counterintelligence (FCI) purposes. The procedures state that \n     ``the FBI and Criminal Division should ensure that advice \n     intended to preserve the option of a criminal prosecution \n     does not inadvertently result in either the fact or the \n     appearance of the Criminal Division's directing or \n     controlling the FI or FCI investigation toward law \n     enforcement objectives.'' Although these procedures provided \n     for significant information sharing and coordination between \n     criminal and FI or FCI investigations, based at least in part \n     on the ``directing or controlling'' language, they eventually \n     came to be narrowly interpreted within the Department of \n     Justice, and most particularly by OIPR, as requiring OIPR to \n     act as a ``wall'' to prevent the FBI intelligence officials \n     from communicating with the Criminal Division regarding \n     ongoing FI or FCI investigations. Thus, the focus became the \n     nature of the underlying investigation, rather than the \n     general purpose of the surveillance. Once prosecution of the \n     target was being considered, the procedures, as interpreted \n     by OIPR in light of the case law, prevented the Criminal \n     Division from providing any meaningful advice to the FBI.''\n\nIn re: Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 727-28 citations omitted.\n  FBI Director Mueller, in his testimony yesterday, provided a concrete \naccount of the impact that these information-sharing barriers had on \nintelligence investigations:\n\n       Prior to September 11, an [FBI] Agent investigating the \n     intelligence side of a terrorism case was barred from \n     discussing the case with an Agent across the hall who was \n     working the criminal side of that same investigation. For \n     instance, if a court-ordered criminal wiretap turned up \n     intelligence information, the criminal investigator could not \n     share that information with the intelligence investigator--he \n     could not even suggest that the intelligence investigator \n     should seek a wiretap to collect the information for himself. \n     If the criminal investigator served a grand jury subpoena to \n     a suspect's bank, he could not divulge any information found \n     in those bank records to the intelligence investigator. \n     Instead, the intelligence investigator would have to issue a \n     National Security Letter in order to procure that same \n     information.\n\n  Chicago U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, in an October 21, 2003 \nhearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, described how these pre-\nPatriot information-sharing limits undercut one potentially vital \nterror investigation. Mr. Fitzgerald discussed the grand-jury testimony \nof Wadih el Hage, a key member of the Al Qaeda cell in Nairobi who, in \nSeptember 1997, was apprehended while changing flights in New York \nCity. Federal prosecutors subpoenaed el Hage from the airport to \ntestify before a Federal grand jury in Manhattan. Mr. Fitzgerald \ndescribed how el Hage:\n\n       [P]rovided some information of potential use to the \n     intelligence community--including potential leads as to the \n     location of his confederate Harun and the location of Harun's \n     files in Kenya. Unfortunately, as el Hage left the grand-jury \n     room, we knew that * * * [because of pre-Patriot \n     restrictions] we would not be permitted to share the grand-\n     jury information with the intelligence community. * * * \n     Fortunately, we found a way to address the problem that in \n     most other cases would not work. Upon request, el Hage \n     voluntarily agreed to be debriefed by an FBI agent outside \n     the grand-jury room * * *. El Hage then repeated the essence \n     of what he told the grand jury to the FBI agent, including \n     his purported leads to on the location of Harun and his \n     files. The FBI then lawfully shared the information with the \n     intelligence community. In essence, we solved the problem by \n     obtaining the consent of a since-convicted terrorist. We do \n     not want to have to rely on the consent of al Qaeda \n     terrorists to address the gaps in our national security.\n\n  Mr. Fitzgerald went on to describe how, in August 1998, the American \nEmbassy in Nairobi was bombed by al Qaeda. Investigators quickly \nlearned that el Hage's associate Harun was responsible. In this \nparticular case, investigators had been able to work around \ninformation-sharing limits because of an al Qaeda terrorist's \nwillingness to be interviewed by the FBI, and even with this \ninformation U.S. agents were not able to stop a terrorist attack. The \npre-Patriot limits were not a decisive factor in blocking U.S. \nintelligence agents from preventing the Kenya bombing. But they could \nhave been. As U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald concluded, ``we should not have \nto wait for people to die with no explanation [other] than that \ninterpretations of the law blocked the sharing of specific information \nthat probably [c]ould have saved [American lives].''\n  As Attorney General Reno noted in her testimony before the 9/11 \nCommission, ``these restrictions [on information sharing] have now been \neliminated as part of the Patriot Act.'' Director Mueller, in his \nJudiciary Committee testimony yesterday, described the impact of this \nchange:\n\n       The removal of the ``wall'' has allowed government \n     investigators to share information freely. Now, criminal \n     investigative information that contains foreign intelligence \n     or counterintelligence, including grand jury and wiretap \n     information, can be shared with intelligence officials. This \n     increased ability to share information has disrupted \n     terrorist operations in their early stages--such as the \n     successful dismantling of the ``Portland Seven'' terror \n     cell--and has led to numerous arrests, prosecutions, and \n     convictions in terrorism cases.\n       In essence, prior to September 11th, criminal and \n     intelligence investigators were attempting to put together a \n     complex jigsaw puzzle at separate tables. The Patriot Act has \n     fundamentally changed the way we do business. Today, those \n     investigators sit at the same table and work together on one \n     team. They share leads. They fuse information. Instead of \n     conducting parallel investigations, they are fully integrated \n     into one joint investigation.\n\n  These Patriot Act changes can directly be credited with some \nimportant recent successes in the war on terror. For example, in \nFebruary 2003, Federal prosecutors arrested and indicted Sami Al-Arian \nand seven other suspected terrorists. The 50-count indictment indicated \nthat Al-Arian was the financial director and the North American leader \nof Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a terrorist group that has killed more \nthan 100 people in and around Israel, including two Americans. Al-Arian \nwired money to groups in Israel that paid money to the families of \nterrorists who carried out suicide bombings. He also founded three \norganizations in Florida which, among other things, drafted final wills \nand testaments for suicide bombers.\n  Incredibly, through much of the 1990s, Al-Arian was secretly watched \nby two different sets of U.S. investigators. The FBI had been \nconducting a criminal probe of Al-Arian since 1995. Meanwhile, \nintelligence agents had monitored Al-Arian since the late 1980s. \nBecause of pre-Patriot restrictions, the two sets of investigators were \nnot able to share information and were not aware of the full extent of \neach other's investigations. It was only after the FISA Court of Review \nupheld Patriot\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\nAct Sec. 203's information-sharing provisions in November 2002 that \nintelligence officials were able to show their files to prosecutors. \nSeveral months after this Patriot provision was upheld and made \neffective, prosecutors arrested and indicted Al-Arian and put an end to \nhis activities.\n  Of course, the provisions of the Patriot Act subject to the Sec. 224 \nsunset include much more than just the three provisions that facilitate \ninformation sharing. Although I will not discuss all of those \nprovisions in detail today--some of which have never been \ncontroversial--I would like to discuss one provision that has been a \nparticular focus of attacks on the Patriot Act.\n  Section 215 of the Patriot Act allows the FBI to seek an order for \n``the production of tangible things (including books, records, papers, \ndocuments, and other items) for an investigation to obtain foreign \nintelligence information.'' FISA defines ``foreign intelligence'' as \ninformation relating to foreign espionage, foreign sabotage, or \ninternational terrorism, or information respecting a foreign power that \nrelates to U.S. national security or foreign policy. Thus Sec. 215 \ncannot be used to investigate ordinary crimes or even domestic \nterrorism. And in every case, a Sec. 215 order must be approved by a \njudge.\n  Alhough Sec. 215 is basically a form of subpoena authority, like that \nallowed for numerous other types of investigation indeed, it is more \ntightly restricted than other types of subpoenas because it must be \npre-approved by a judge Sec. 215 has been heavily targeted by Patriot \nAct critics. Chief among their complaints is that Sec. 215 could be \nused to obtain records from bookstores or libraries. Some of these \ncritics have even alleged that Sec. 215 would allow the FBI to \ninvestigate someone simply because of the books that he borrows from a \nlibrary.\n  Section 215 could in fact be used to obtain library records, though \nneither Sec. 215 nor any other provision of the Patriot Act \nspecifically mentions libraries or is directed at libraries. \nNevertheless, Sec. 215 does authorize court orders to produce tangible \nrecords--which could include library records.\n  Where the critics are wrong is in suggesting that a Sec. 215 order \ncould be obtained because of the books that someone reads or the \nwebsites that he visits. Sec. 215 allows no such thing. Instead, \nSec. 215 allows an order to obtain ``tangible things'' as part of an \ninvestigation to ``obtain foreign intelligence information''--\ninformation relating to foreign espionage or terrorism or relating to a \nforeign government or group and national security. By requiring a judge \nto approve such an order, Sec. 215 ensures that these orders will not \nbe used for an improper purpose. And as an added protection against \nabuse, the Patriot Act also requires that the FBI ``fully inform'' the \nHouse and Senate Intelligence Committees on all use of Sec. 215 every \nsix months. These checks and safeguards leave FBI agents little room \nfor the types of witch hunts that Patriot Act critics conjure up.\n  Further, it bears mention that federal investigators already use an \nauthority very similar to Sec. 215 the grand jury subpoena--to obtain \nbookstore records. As Deputy AG Comey recently emphasized in a letter \nthat he submitted to the editor of the New York Times, ``orders for \nrecords under [Sec. 215] are more closely scrutinized and more \ndifficult to obtain than ordinary grand jury supoenas, which can \nrequire production of the very same records, but without judicial \napproval.'' Similarly, in a September 11, 2003 editorial, ``Patriot \n(Act) Games,'' the Washington Post noted that investigative authority \nto review library records ``existed prior to the Patriot Act; the law \nextends it to national security investigations, which isn't \nunreasonable.''\n  Finally, I would emphasize that an intelligence or criminal \ninvestigation may have good and legitimate reasons for extending to \nlibrary or bookstore records. For example, in a recent domestic \nterrorism case, Federal investigators sought to prove that a suspected \nbomber had built a particularly unusual detonator that had been used in \nseveral bombings. The investigators used a grand-jury subpoena to show \nthat the suspect had purchased a book giving instructions on how to \nbuild such a detonator.\n  Moreover, we should not forget that terrorists and spies historically \nhave used libraries to plan and carry out activities that threaten U.S. \nnational security. We know, for example, that some terrorists have used \ncomputers at public libraries to use the internet and communicate by \nemail. It would be unwise to place libraries and bookstores beyond the \nscope of anti-terror investigations.\n  Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor who led the 1995 \nterrorism case against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, recently elaborated on \nthis point in a November 13, 2003 article in National Review Online, \n``Patriot Act Under Siege'':\n\n       [H]ard experience--won in the course of a string of \n     terrorism trials since 1993--instructs us that it would be \n     folly to preclude the government a priori from access to any \n     broad categories of business record. Reading material, we now \n     know, can be highly relevant in terrorism cases. People who \n     build bombs tend to have books and pamphlets on bomb making. \n     Terrorist leaders often possess literature announcing the \n     animating principles of their organizations in a tone \n     tailored to potential recruits. This type of evidence is a \n     staple of virtually every terrorism investigation--both for \n     what it suggests on its face and for the forensic \n     significance of whose fingerprints may be on it. No one is \n     convicted for having it--jurors are Americans too, and they'd \n     not long stand for the odious notion that one should be \n     imprisoned for the mere act of thinking.\n       When a defendant pleads ``not guilty,'' however, he is \n     saying: ``I put the government to its proof on every element \n     of the crime, including that I acted with criminal purport.'' \n     Prosecutors must establish beyond a reasonable doubt not only \n     that the terrorist engaged in acts but did so intending \n     execrable consequences. If an accused says the precursor \n     components he covertly amassed were for innocent use, is it \n     not relevant that he has just borrowed a book that covers \n     explosives manufacture? If he claims unfamiliarity with the \n     tenets of violent jihad, should a jury be barred from \n     learning that his paws have yellowed numerous publications on \n     the subject? Such evidence was standard fare throughout Janet \n     Reno's tenure as attorney general--and rightly so.\n\n  In his testimony yesterday, FBI Director Mueller also described the \nimportance to antiterror investigations of some of the other Patriot \nAct authorities subject to expire under Sec. 224. For example, Director \nMueller noted that:\n\n       The PATRIOT Act gave federal judges the authority to issue \n     search warrants that are valid outside the issuing judge's \n     district in terrorism investigations. In the past, a court \n     could only issue a search warrant for premises within the \n     same judicial district--yet our investigations of terrorist \n     networks often span multiple districts. The PATRIOT Act \n     streamlined this process, making it possible for judges in \n     districts where activities related to terrorism may have \n     occurred to issue search warrants applicable outside their \n     immediate districts.\n       In addition, the PATRIOT Act permits similar search \n     warrants for electronic evidence such as email. In the past, \n     for example, if an Agent in one district needed to obtain a \n     search warrant for a subject's email account, but the \n     Internet service provider (ISP) was located in another \n     district, he or she would have to contact an AUSA and Agent \n     in the second district, brief them on the details of the \n     investigation, and ask them to appear before a judge to \n     obtain a search warrant--simply because the ISP was \n     physically based in another district. Thanks to the PATRIOT \n     Act, this frustrating and time-consuming process can be \n     averted without reducing judicial oversight. Today, a judge \n     anywhere in the U.S. can issue a search warrant for a \n     subject's email, no matter where the ISP is based.\n       [Further], the PATRIOT Act updated the law to match current \n     technology, so that we no longer have to fight a 21st-century \n     battle with antiquated weapons. Terrorists exploit modern \n     technology such as the Internet and cell phones to conduct \n     and conceal their activities. The PATRIOT Act leveled the \n     playing field, allowing investigators to adapt to modern \n     techniques. For example, the PATRIOT Act clarified our \n     ability to use court-ordered pen registers and trap-and-trace \n     devices to track Internet communications. The Act also \n     enabled us to seek court-approved roving wiretaps, which \n     allow investigators to conduct electronic surveillance on a \n     particular suspect, not a particular telephone this allows \n     them to continuously monitor subjects without having to \n     return to the court.\n\n  All of the authorities described by Director Mueller obviously are \ncritical to antiterrorism investigations--and all will expire next year \nunless Congress acts to repeal Sec. 224.\n  In responding to some of the accusations of Patriot Act critics, I do \nnot mean to dismiss the importance of either civil liberties or of \nindependent oversight of the federal government. I would simply \nemphasize that the Patriot Act is carefully crafted legislation that \nboth guarantees protection for civil liberties and is subject to ample \noversight. I would note, in this vein, that in a report filed in \nJanuary\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\n2004, Department of Justice Inspector General Glenn A. Fine--an \nappointee of President Clinton described the results of his \ninvestigation of all recent civil-rights and civil-liberties complaints \nreceived by the Justice Department. The Inspector General found no \nincidents in which the Patriot Act was used to abuse civil rights or \ncivil liberties.\n  The Patriot Act's provisions for independent oversight of the new \nauthorities created by the Act were described in detail by Deputy AG \nComey in his April 14, 2004 testimony before the Judiciary Committee. \nMr. Comey noted:\n\n       First, the USA PATRIOT Act preserves the historic role of \n     courts by ensuring that the vital role of judicial oversight \n     is not diminished. For example, the provision for delayed \n     notice for search warrants requires judicial approval. In \n     addition, under the Act, investigators cannot obtain a FISA \n     pen register unless they apply for and receive permission \n     from federal court. The USA PATRIOT Act actually goes farther \n     to protect privacy than that Constitution requires, as the \n     Supreme Court has long held that law enforcement authorities \n     are not constitutionally required to obtain court approval \n     before installing a pen register. Furthermore, a court order \n     is required to compel production of business records, in \n     national security investigations.\n       Second, the USA PATRIOT Act respects important \n     congressional oversight by placing new reporting requirements \n     on the Department. Every six months, the Attorney General is \n     required to report to Congress the number of times section \n     215 has been utilized, as well as to inform Congress \n     concerning all electronic surveillance under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under section 1001 of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act, Congress receives a semiannual report from the \n     Department's Inspector General detailing any abuses of civil \n     rights and civil liberties by employees or officials of the \n     Department of Justice. It is important to point out that in \n     the Inspector General's most recent report to Congress, he \n     reported that his office has received no complaints alleging \n     misconduct by Department employees related to the use of a \n     substantive provision of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n       Finally, the USA PATRIOT Act fosters public oversight of \n     the Department. In addition to the role of the Inspector \n     General to review complaints alleging abuses of civil \n     liberties and civil rights, the Act provides a cause of \n     action for individuals aggrieved by any willful violation of \n     Title III or certain sections of FISA. To date, no civil \n     actions have been filed under this provision.\n\n  The United States has had some important successes in the war on \nterror so far. Worldwide, more than half of al Qaeda's senior \nleadership has been captured or killed. More than 3,000 al Qaeda \noperatives have been incapacitated. Within the United States, 4 \ndifferent terrorist cells have been broken up--cells located in \nBuffalo, Detroit, Seattle, and Portland. 284 individuals have been \ncriminally charged to date, and 149 individuals have been convicted or \npleaded guilty, including: shoe bomber Richard Reid, six members of the \nBuffalo terrorist cell, two members of the Detroit cell, Ohio truck \ndriver Iyman Faris, and U.S.-born Taliban John Walker Lindh.\n  Patriot-aided criminal prosecutions also have contributed to U.S. \nintelligence efforts to learn more about terrorist organizations. \nFacing long prison terms, some apprehended terrorist have chosen to \ncooperate with the U.S. government. So far, the Justice Department has \nobtained plea agreements from 15 individuals who are now cooperating \nwith terror investigations. One individual has given the U.S. \ninformation about weapons stored by terrorists in the United States. \nAnother cooperating terrorist has given U.S. investigators information \nabout locations in the U.S. that are being scouted or cased for \npotential attacks by al Qaeda.\n  The Patriot Act has played a major role in what U.S. antiterror \ninvestigations have accomplished so far. And it is clear that we will \ncontinue to need the authorities created by the Patriot Act into the \nforeseeable future. For these reasons, I am pleased to introduce today \nwith my colleagues a bill to repeal Sec. 224 and make the Patriot Act \npermanent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF USA PATRIOT ACT SUNSETS.\n\n       Section 224 of the USA PATRIOT Act (18 U.S.C. 2510 note) is \n     repealed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 2477. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to expand \ncollege access and increase college persistence, to simplify the \nprocess of applying for student assistance, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation to expand access to college. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis effort by Senators Collins, Kennedy, and Murray.\n  In a year in which we are slated to reauthorize the Higher Education \nAct, we have had only a few hearings on the reauthorization in the HELP \nCommittee. In these hearings and the discussions ongoing in the other \nbody, there has been scant mention of our insufficient investment in \nneed-based financial aid. Instead, the discussions have been dominated \nby proposals that will hurt, rather than help, the neediest students.\n  This is troubling, particularly as more and more students are being \npriced out of college, which shortchanges their future and that of our \nnation. Economic security is a necessity not just for the wealthy, but \nfor every American. And the key to economic security is education.\n  An individual's climb up the economic ladder is directly related to \nthe amount of education he or she receives. Given the strong \ncorrelation among educational attainment, employment, and wages, the \ncost of not going to college is just too high.\n  Almost a third of the growth in employment over the next decade is \nexpected to occur in occupations that require at least a bachelor's \ndegree. College graduates, on average, earn 60 percent more than high \nschool graduates, while an individual with a professional degree earns \nalmost four times what a high school graduate earns.\n  And yet, too many college students are under-prepared, underfinanced, \nand overworked. Those who make it through are saddled by nearly \ninsurmountable loan debt. But many more cannot afford the cost of \ncollege at all.\n  Even though there have been gains due to the Higher Education Act, \nthe current approach to student aid isn't alleviating the gaps between \nour lowest and highest income students nor is it addressing the gaps \nbetween the aid low-income students receive and the actual cost of \nattendance.\n  7 times as many students from high-income families 48 percent \ngraduate from college by age 24 as students from low-income families 7 \npercent. Low-income, college-qualified high school graduates have an \nannual ``unmet need'' of nearly $4,000 in college expenses. Without \ndrastic increases in need-based aid, over the next decade, according to \na report by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, 4.4 \nmillion low- and moderate-income college qualified high school \ngraduates will not be able to pursue a four year degree full time and 2 \nmillion will not go to college at all.\n  A combination of factors has arisen to create this unfortunate \nsituation, chief among them a decline in the purchasing power of the \nPell Grant and sharp increases in the cost of college.\n  My predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell, established what is now known \nas the Pell Grant in order to ensure higher education wasn't an \n``unachievable dream.'' Almost one quarter of undergraduate students \nfrom colleges and universities nationwide receive a Pell Grant. It is \nthe single largest source of grant aid for higher education funded by \nthe Federal government.\n  Unfortunately, the Pell Grant's purchasing power has plummeted due to \nthe slow growth in funding and the rapid rise of college prices. In the \nlate 70s, the maximum grant covered 77 percent of costs at a public \nfour-year institution. Today, the maximum Pell Grant of $4,050 covers \nonly 41 percent.\n  On top of that, an estimated 60 percent of student aid is now in the \nform of loans and 40 percent in grants, a reversal of the distribution \n20 years ago. Indeed, the average graduate has a student loan debt of \n$17,000. Pell Grant recipients, who represent the lowest income sectors \nof students, graduate with an average of $20,000 in student loan debt.\n\n[[Page S6100]]\n\n  Over the last ten years, public and private 4-year college costs, \ntuition and fees, rose 47 percent and 42 percent, respectively, after \nadjusting for inflation, which is a more rapid growth rate than \nconsumer prices. Over the last three years, since President Bush \nentered office, tuition has increased by 28 percent on average, even \nafter inflation. Students have felt the bite as states have drastically \ncut funding for public colleges.\n  There is a further convergence of economic and demographic factors. \nIn 2008, the largest number of students in our history will graduate \nfrom high school. A high percentage of these students will be from low-\nincome, minority families, who will need student aid. At the same time, \nour Nation will need replacement workers as aging, college-educated \nbaby boomers begin to retire in increasing numbers.\n  This crisis calls out for action. It should be a national imperative \nto ensure an educated citizenry and a world class workforce. Our Nation \ncannot afford to lose out on the countless returns from a robust \neducation investment.\n  The legislation we introduce today, the ACCESS, Accessing College \nthrough Comprehensive Early outreach, State partnerships, and \nSimplification, Act, seeks to set our Nation back on the course that \nSenator Pell sought when he authored the grants later named after him \nin 1972.\n  The ACCESS Act revitalizes the Leveraging Educational Assistance \nPartnership (LEAP) program, which was established over thirty years ago \nto encourage States to play a role in helping low-income students go to \ncollege. Without this important, although extremely modest, Federal \nincentive, many States would never have established need-based grant \nprograms and many States would not continue to maintain such programs.\n  Recognizing that LEAP can do even more to address the barriers to \ncollege access and persistence, the ACCESS Act forges a new Federal \nincentive for states--via higher levels of Federal match--to spur \ngreater investments by states, colleges, businesses, and philanthropies \nin need-based grants for low-income students. At a time when public \nhigher education is bearing the brunt of the fiscal crises confronting \nour States, we need to do more to encourage States to help low-income \nstudents attend college.\n  We want States to focus their energies on enhancing coordination and \ncohesion among Federal, State, and local programs and efforts of \ncolleges, philanthropies, and businesses, with the goal of generating \nnew investments in need-based aid sufficient to provide low-income \nstudents with an access and persistence grant to fill the gap in aid \nthey face. All too often successful middle school students give up the \ndream of college because they think there is no way they can ever \nafford college. The ACCESS Act also requires States to notify low-\nincome students beginning in middle school of their potential \neligibility for student financial aid and encourages increased \nparticipation in early intervention, mentoring, and outreach programs.\n  The legislation is modeled after initiatives like the Rhode Island \nChildren's Crusade in my home state and Indiana's 21st Century Scholars \nProgram. A Lumina Foundation evaluation found that 21st Century \nScholars--low-income students who receive an early notification of \nassistance, early intervention and support, and scholarships equivalent \nto the cost of in-state college tuition--were nearly 5 times more \nlikely than non-participants to enroll in college. Indeed, successful \ncollege access programs are those that offer early intervention and \nmentoring services coupled with early information about estimated \nfinancial aid awards and adequate grant funding to make the dream of \nhigher education a reality. Students participating in such programs are \nmore financially and academically prepared, and thus more likely to \nenroll in college and persist to degree completion.\n  Our legislation also simplifies the financial aid process for low-\nincome students. It allows more students to qualify for an Automatic-\nZero Expected Family Contribution, aligning its eligibility with the \nstandards for other Federal means-tested programs, like free school \nlunch, SSI, and Food Stamps. Students and families should not have to \nprove over and over again that they are low-income, and asking students \nto fill out lengthy forms when they already meet the eligibility level \nfor Pell Grants is a burden we should ease.\n  In a similar vein, the legislation establishes a short, paper FAFSA-\nEZ application form for students qualifying for the auto-zero along \nwith a tailored web-based system and a free telefile system for \nstudents without Internet access.\n  The ACCESS Act also expands college access for low-income students, \nin part by prohibiting a qualified education benefit, like education \nsavings plans, from being considered as a student asset and by reducing \nthe work penalty. The current income protection allowance levels are \nunrealistically low, creating a disincentive for students who work in \norder to pay college costs. I look forward to receiving further \ninformation on this and other problems addressed in the legislation \nwhen the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance completes \nwork on the congressionally mandated financial aid simplification study \nlater this year.\n  We must act on this legislation and others to make sure that every \nstudent who works hard and plays by the rules gets the opportunity to \nlive the American Dream.\n  I was pleased to work with the Advisory Committee on Student \nFinancial Assistance, and a host of other higher education \norganizations and charitable foundations, including Scholarship \nAmerica, on this legislation. I am also pleased that this legislation \nhas the support of a range of higher education and student groups, \nincluding the American Association of Community Colleges, the American \nAssociation of State Colleges and Universities, the American Council on \nEducation, the Association of American Universities, the Association of \nJesuit Colleges and Universities, the Center for Law and Social Policy, \nthe Council for Opportunity in Education, National Association for \nCollege Admission Counseling, the National Association of Independent \nColleges and Universities, National Association of State Student Grant \nand Aid Programs, the National Association of State Universities and \nLand-Grant Colleges, the National Association of Student Financial Aid \nAdministrators, the United Negro College Fund, and the United States \nStudent Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work \nfor its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2477\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, \nto provide for Federal employees to make elections to make, modify, and \nterminate contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund at any time, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Akaka, Fitzgerald, Lieberman, and Voinovich in \nintroducing the Thrift Savings Plan Open Elections Act of 2004. This \nlegislation would provide Federal employees with maximum flexibility to \ntailor their investment decisions by eliminating the current \nrestrictions on when employee contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan \ncan begin or be modified.\n  Since its inception in 1987, the Thrift Savings Plan has provided \nFederal employees with the opportunity to participate in a retirement \nsavings plan similar to the 401(k) plans offered by many private \ncompanies. The open seasons were created to encourage Federal employees \nto contribute money toward their retirement. Open seasons were \npractical during the early years when the Thrift Savings Plan was just \ngetting started and lacked the administrative capability to quickly \nenroll participants and to implement investment elections on a real-\ntime basis. With the introduction of the automatic record-keeping \nsystem, however, the program has outgrown its existing framework.\n  Under current law, newly hired employees can sign up to contribute to \nthe Thrift Savings Plan during an initial 60-day eligibility period. If \nan employee chooses not to make an election, he or she must wait until \nan open season to do so. Further, if an employee stops contributing to \nthe Thrift Savings Plan outside of an open season, he or she must wait \nuntil the second open season after contributions stop before \ncontributions can resume. These\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\nrestrictions can unfairly penalize employees and discourage their \nparticipation. But allowing employees to initiate, modify, or terminate \ncontributions to the TSP in any period, provided the amount does not \nexceed existing limits for contributions, the legislation ensures that \nFederal employees' investment decisions will no longer be restricted by \nthe open season requirement.\n  In testimony before the Congress, Andrew Saul, Chairman of the \nFederal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, stated that the Board \nsupports the elimination of the open season requirement because it \nwould expand participant access and simplify the administration of the \nThrift Savings Plan. Jim Sauber, Chairman of the Employee Thrift \nAdvisory Council, testified in March 2004 that eliminating the TSP open \nseason is perhaps the single best way to reach the 13 percent of \nemployees in the Federal Employees Retirement System who still do not \nmake contributions to the TSP.\n  In addition to the support by the Federal Retirement Thrift \nInvestment Board and the Employee Thrift Advisory Council, the \nlegislation is supported by the American Federation of Government \nEmployees, the National Treasury Employees Union, the National \nAssociation of Retired Federal Employees, the Federal Managers \nAssociation, and the Senior Executives Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6106-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6106-S6107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN OPEN ELECTIONS ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. I am delighted to join with Senator Collins \nand other colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee to introduce \nthe Thrift Savings Plan Open Elections Act of 2004. Our bill will \nprovide participants in the Thrift Savings Plan, TSP, significant \nflexibility in managing their TSP accounts.\n  Over the years, I have successfully offered legislation which has \nensured that Federal employees enrolled in the Government's retirement \nsavings plan enjoy the same opportunities afforded to employees in the \nprivate and public sectors, such as the ability to make additional \ncontributions to the TSP for those over the age of 50 and immediate \nenrollment for new employees. This new bill would eliminate open \nseasons, which prohibit employees who choose not to contribute to wait \nuntil for a specific amount of time if they later decide to \nparticipate.\n  I am especially pleased that the legislation also includes a section \ndevoted to enhancing financial literacy for Federal employees. As my \ncolleagues know, I have long championed the need for expanded financial \nliteracy for Americans of all ages and background who face increasingly \ncomplex financial decisions as members of the Nation's workforce, \nmanagers of their families' resources, and voting citizens.\n  Our bill directs the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, \nFRTIB, which administers the TSP, to enhance the tools available to TSP \nparticipants so that they will be better able to understand, evaluate, \nand compare the financial products, services, and opportunities \navailable from the Thrift Savings Plan. The measure also requires that \nas part of the retirement training offered by the Office of Personnel \nManagement, OPM, that OPM, in consultation with the board, develop a \nretirement financial literacy and education strategy for Federal \nemployees. I wish to commend both the thrift board and OPM for the work \nthat has already been undertaken to increase financial literacy among \nFederal employees, including the recent OPM-sponsored financial \nliteracy fairs.\n  As for all Americans, financial literacy education is essential for \nFederal employees to develop a base of knowledge so that they can \nparticipate effectively in the modern economy. We must find \nopportunities to get information to individuals at the appropriate \ntimes throughout their lives as their financial situations and needs \nchange. I believe that the provisions in this bill will give Federal \nemployees the tools needed to empower them to make informed decisions \nregarding their retirement and financial security.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2480. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to research \nand prevent drug impaired driving; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, every half hour, somewhere in this \ncountry somebody is killed as a result of an alcohol related traffic \naccident. This is a sobering statistic. Thanks in part to a massive \nnational response, nearly 1.5 million people are arrested and taken off \nthe road each year for driving under the influence of alcohol, \nundoubtedly saving lives. But, there is an equally dangerous and \npotentially devastating problem lurking on our Nation's highways that \nis going largely undetected.\n  In 2002, nearly 11 million people drove under the influence of \nillegal drugs, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health \nReport. While the effort to reduce drunk driving is making progress, \nthose using illegal drugs like marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and \nopiates continue to get behind the wheel, putting each of us at risk \neveryday.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \ndrugs are used by approximately 10 to 22 percent of all drivers \ninvolved in fatal motor vehicle crashes. In 2003, a study conducted at \nthe Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Hospital in \nBaltimore found that testing for alcohol alone would have identified \nless than 30 percent of all the substance abusing drivers admitted to \nthe trauma unit as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Drugged \ndriving is clearly a serious problem.\n  While it is illegal in all 50 States to drive a motor vehicle under \nthe influence of alcohol or drugs, there is no consistency in the way \nthe States approach drug impaired drivers. In fact, existing laws often \nhinder the prosecution of drugged drivers. Adding further difficulty, \nthere currently is no road side test to detect the presence of a \ncontrolled substance in a driver's body.\n  In response to these challenges, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Feinstein in introducing legislation designed to encourage \nStates to develop and carry out drug impaired driving traffic safety \nprograms. By adopting a model statute, States become eligible for \ngrants that would assist drivers in need of drug treatment, as well as \ngrants that would enhance the training of law enforcement and \nprosecutors. Furthermore, in an effort to keep drug impaired drivers \noff the road, passage of this legislation will advance the research and \ndevelopment of a roadside testing mechanism.\n  Clearly there is a need to strengthen efforts to identify, prosecute, \nand treat drugged drivers. Just as the coordinated efforts to prevent \ndrunk driving have saved lives, so too can the devastating consequences \nof drugged driving be prevented. I encourage my colleagues to join in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2480\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Impaired Driving \n     Research and Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) driving under the influence of, or after having used, \n     illegal drugs has become a significant problem worldwide;\n       (2) in 2002, over 35,000,000 persons in the United States \n     aged 12 or older had used illegal drugs in the past year and \n     almost 11,000,000 of these persons (5 percent of the total \n     population of the United States aged 12 or older and 31 \n     percent of past year illicit drug users) had driven under the \n     influence of, or after having used, illegal drugs in the past \n     year;\n       (3) research has established that abuse of a number of \n     drugs can impair driving performance;\n       (4) according to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, illegal drugs (often in combination with \n     alcohol) are used by approximately 10 to 22 percent of \n     drivers involved in all motor vehicles crashes;\n       (5) drug impaired drivers are less frequently detected, \n     prosecuted, or referred to treatment than drunk drivers;\n       (6) there is a lack of uniformity or consistency in the way \n     the 50 States approach drug impaired drivers;\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\n       (7) too few police officers have been trained to detect \n     drug impaired drivers, and too few prosecutors have been \n     trained to prove drug impaired driving cases beyond a \n     reasonable doubt;\n       (8) per se drug impaired driving laws, like those used for \n     driving under the influence of alcohol, are feasible and \n     represent a sound strategy for dealing with drug impaired \n     drivers and can assist in the prosecution of drug impaired \n     driving offenders; and\n       (9) while it is illegal in all States to drive a motor \n     vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs other \n     than alcohol, or a combination of alcohol and other drugs, \n     there is no consistent method across States for identifying \n     drug impairment and the presence of drugs in the body.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide a model for States to implement and enforce \n     a drug impaired driving statute;\n       (2) to ensure drivers in need of drug education or \n     treatment are identified and provided with the appropriate \n     assistance;\n       (3) to advance research and development of testing \n     mechanisms and knowledge about drugged driving and its impact \n     on traffic safety; and\n       (4) to enhance the training of traffic safety officers and \n     prosecutors to detect, enforce, and prosecute drug impaired \n     driving laws.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the following definitions apply:\n       (1) Controlled substance.--The term ``controlled \n     substance'' includes substances listed in schedules I through \n     V of section 112(e) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 812(e)).\n       (2) Inhalant.--The term ``inhalant'' means a household or \n     commercial product that can be used by inhaling for \n     intoxicating effect.\n       (3) Drug recognition expert.--The term ``drug recognition \n     expert'' means an individual trained in a specific evaluation \n     procedure that enables the person to determine whether an \n     individual is under the influence of drugs and then to \n     determine the type of drug causing the observable impairment.\n\n     SEC. 5. MODEL STATUTE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall develop and \n     provide to the States a model statute relating to drug \n     impaired driving which incorporates the provisions described \n     in this Act.\n       (b) Mandatory Provisions.--Provisions of the model statute \n     developed by the Secretary for recommendation to the States \n     under this section shall include, at a minimum, a provision \n     that the crime of drug impaired driving is committed when a \n     person operates a motor vehicle--\n       (1) while any detectable amount of a controlled substance \n     is present in the person's body, as measured in the person's \n     blood, urine, saliva, or other bodily substance; or\n       (2) due to the presence of a controlled substance or a \n     controlled substance in combination with alcohol or an \n     inhalant, or both, in the person's body, the person's mental \n     or physical faculties are affected to a noticeable or \n     perceptible degree.\n       (c) Discretionary Provisions.--Provisions of the model \n     statute developed by the Secretary for recommendation to the \n     States under this section may include the following:\n       (1) Sanctions for refusing to submit to a test for the \n     presence of a controlled substance in a person's body which \n     are equivalent to sanctions for a positive test result.\n       (2) Lawful use of any controlled substance listed in \n     schedule II, III, IV, or V of section 112(c) of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812(c)) that was \n     lawfully prescribed by a physician licensed under State law \n     is an affirmative defense to a charge of drug impaired \n     driving; except that the affirmative defense shall not be \n     available if it is shown that the person's mental or physical \n     faculties were impaired by such use to a noticeable or \n     perceptible degree.\n       (3) A graduated system of penalties for repeat offenses of \n     drug impaired driving, including, at a minimum, that a third \n     or subsequent offense within a 10-year period shall be a \n     felony punishable by imprisonment for more than a year.\n       (4) Authorization for States to suspend or revoke the \n     license of any driver upon receiving a record of the driver's \n     conviction of driving a motor vehicle while under the \n     influence of a controlled substance.\n       (5) Provisions that require a sentence of imprisonment \n     imposed for any drug impaired driving offense be served \n     consecutively, not concurrently, from a sentence imposed for \n     any other criminal act; except that a sentence imposed for \n     the same act of impaired driving may be imposed concurrently \n     if the additional conviction was based on an alternate theory \n     of culpability for the same act.\n       (6) An appropriate system of evaluation, counseling, \n     treatment (if required), and supervision for persons \n     convicted of drug impaired driving.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nrecognizing National Tourette Syndrome Awareness Month. This resolution \nrecognizes the importance of an early and accurate diagnosis, proper \ntreatment for Tourette Syndrome and is intended to raise public \nawareness about the disorder. I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, in offering this resolution.\n  Tourette Syndrome, or TS, is an inherited, neurobiological disorder \nthat affects children of all racial and ethnic groups. The symptoms of \nTS are rapid, repeated, involuntary movements, and sounds called tics. \nIn a large percentage of cases, TS is accompanied by other disorders, \nthe most common of which are Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Attention \nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder and nonverbal Learning Disabilities.\n  An estimated 200,000 Americans have substantially impairing TS and \nmany more have milder symptoms of the disorder. Many endure the stigma, \nisolation, and psychological impact associated with this chronic \ndisorder. There is, unfortunately, no cure for TS, although some \nindividuals benefit from a reduction in symptoms from medication or \nother clinical treatments.\n  In my State of Oregon, approximately 600 individuals are affected by \nTourette Syndrome. While the Oregon chapter of the Tourette Syndrome \nAssociation, TSA, serves as an outstanding resource for information, it \nconstantly faces the challenge of fulfilling its mission in a large, \nmostly rural State. TSA of Oregon currently operates a support group in \nthe Portland area, and it is emerging as a useful source for families \nand provides leadership within the community. I would like to commend \nTSA of Oregon and thank them for their outstanding work.\n  Designating the month of June as the National Tourette Syndrome \nAwareness Month gives everyone an opportunity to familiarize themselves \nwith TS and to better understand the impact that TS has on people \nliving with the disorder. Additionally, it recognizes the importance of \nearly diagnosis and receiving proper treatment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6108-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3239.

NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The airborne forces of the United States Armed Forces \n     have a long and honorable history as units of adventuresome, \n     hardy, and fierce warriors who, for the national security of \n     the United States and the defense of freedom and peace, \n     project the effective ground combat power of the United \n     States by Air Force air transport to the far reaches of the \n     battle area and, indeed, to the far corners of the world.\n       (2) August 16, 2004, marks the anniversary of the first \n     official validation of the innovative concept of inserting \n     United States ground combat forces behind the battle line by \n     means of a parachute.\n       (3) The United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the United States Department \n     of War, and was launched when 48 volunteers began training in \n     July 1940.\n       (4) The Parachute Test Platoon performed the first official \n     Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940.\n       (5) The success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the days \n     immediately preceding the entry of the United States into \n     World War II led to the formation of a formidable force of \n     airborne units that, since then, have served with distinction \n     and repeated success in armed hostilities.\n       (6) Among those units are the former 11th, 13th, and 17th \n     Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd Airborne Division, the \n     versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     airborne regiments and battalions (some as components of \n     those divisions, some as separate units) that achieved \n     distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the 173rd \n     Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) Regiment, the \n     503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd Parachute \n     Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment, the \n     509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry Batallions, and \n     the 550th Airborne Infantry Battalion.\n       (7) The achievements of the airborne forces during World \n     War II provided a basis of evolution into a diversified force \n     of parachute and air assault units that, over the years, have \n     fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf \n     Region, and Somalia, and have engaged in peacekeeping \n     operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the Dominican \n     Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo.\n       (8) The modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment which, together with other units, \n     comprise the quick reaction force of the XVIII Airborne Corps \n     of the Army when not operating separately under a regional \n     combatant commander.\n       (9) The modern-day airborne force also includes other elite \n     forces composed entirely of airborne trained and qualified \n     special operations warriors, including Army Special Forces, \n     Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and Air \n     Force combat control teams, all or most of which comprise the \n     forces of the United States Special Operations Command.\n       (10) In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere.\n       (11) In the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, together with other units of \n     the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war against \n     terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting civil \n     affair missions, and assisting in establishing democracy in \n     Iraq.\n       (12) The airborne forces are and will continue to be at the \n     ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism is \n     concluded.\n       (13) The members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction by \n     earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor.\n       (14) The members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operations forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops.\n       (15) The history and achievements of the members and former \n     members of the airborne forces of the United States Armed \n     Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of the \n     American people as the airborne community celebrates August \n     16, 2004, as the 64th anniversary of the first official jump \n     by the Army Parachute Test Platoon.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--The Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2004, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State, and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe ``National Airborne \n     Day'' with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3250.

Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere.\n       (11) In the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, together with other units of \n     the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war against \n     terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting civil \n     affair missions, and assisting in establishing democracy in \n     Iraq.\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\n       (12) The airborne forces are and will continue to be at the \n     ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism is \n     concluded.\n       (13) The members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces, all have achieved distinction by \n     earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor.\n       (14) The members and former members of the United States \n     combat airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operations forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops.\n       (15) The history and achievements of the members and former \n     members of the airborne forces of the United States Armed \n     Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of the \n     American people as the airborne community celebrates August \n     16, 2004, as the 64th anniversary of the first official jump \n     by the Army Parachute Test Platoon.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--The Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2004, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State, and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe ``National Airborne \n     Day'' with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url":

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are approximately 1,500,000 interstate household \n     moves every year. While the vast majority of these interstate \n     moves are completed successfully, consumer complaints have \n     been increasing since the Interstate Commerce Commission was \n     abolished in 1996 and oversight of the household goods \n     industry was transferred to the Department of Transportation.\n       (2) While the overwhelming majority of household goods \n     carriers are honest and operate within the law, there appears \n     to be a growing criminal element that is exploiting a \n     perceived void in Federal and State enforcement efforts. The \n     growing criminal element tends to prey upon consumers.\n       (3) The movement of an individual's household goods is \n     unique and differs from the movement of a commercial \n     shipment. A consumer may utilize a moving company once or \n     twice in the consumer's lifetime and entrust virtually all of \n     the consumer's worldly goods to a mover.\n       (4) Federal resources are inadequate to properly police or \n     deter, on a nationwide basis, those movers who willfully \n     violate Federal regulations governing the household goods \n     industry and knowingly prey on consumers who are in a \n     vulnerable position. It is appropriate that a Federal-State \n     partnership be created to enhance enforcement against \n     fraudulent moving companies.\n\n     SEC. 4303. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title, the terms ``carrier'', ``household goods'', \n     ``motor carrier'', ``Secretary'', and ``transportation'' have \n     the meaning given such terms in section 13102 of title 49, \n     United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4304.

Mr. President, first of all, I want to make some comments \non the issue of the Abu Ghraib abuses and the role of Secretary \nRumsfeld and some of the statements that he has made, but also the \ntremendous leadership he has given over the last several weeks in what \nhave been very difficult times for us as a nation, as we have \nwitnessed, through both report and visual images, the occurrences that \nhappened at Abu Ghraib prison.\n  First and foremost, I thank the Secretary for, ever since these \nabuses became apparent, being available to us in the Senate, the \nappropriate committees, and providing the appropriate resources and \npersonnel to keep us informed of the abuses, the response to the \nabuses, and the many investigations that are underway.\n  Yesterday, Secretary Rumsfeld came to the Capitol for an all-Senators \nbriefing on Iraq, and with him were a number of the generals and other \nmen and women in our Armed Forces to help us better understand the \nevents as they have unfolded over the last several weeks and months. \nThe Secretary, as always, was forthright and direct and complete, \nsharing with us everything that was known, and being very clear that \nthere is, at any point in time, a lot that is not known that will \nhopefully soon be known.\n  He addressed a whole range of issues, in particular our efforts to \nsecure peace, to fight boldly in this war on terror, and also shared \nwith us his views, his observations, on the Army's investigation of the \nAbu Ghraib abuses. He reiterated again and again his absolute \ncommitment to thorough and complete and timely investigations. For \nthat, we thank him.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has appointed, also, an independent panel to \nreview allegations of abuse at the DOD detention facilities. This \nparticular panel will also review other matters related to detention \noperations. The panel consists of four individuals who have been \ninvolved in public service in the past. I believe all those names have \nbeen announced publicly. These experts will provide an independent and \nprofessional analysis to the Secretary, and they will make \nrecommendations to address any problems they identify. I had the \nopportunity to talk to several members of this panel, and I look \nforward to their report and bringing together many of the other reports \nthat are currently underway.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has made it very clear that all DOD, Department of \nDefense, agencies and the military services will be cooperating with \nthis panel. The panel was to begin its work on May 20 and will report \nits findings in early July. That report will be shared with all of us \nin the Senate and throughout the Defense Department.\n  As I said, Secretary Rumsfeld is displaying tremendous leadership. He \nis devoting, rightly so, a huge amount of time and resources to make \nsure that we, the American people, and the world get all the facts; \nthat everything is transparent; that those people who are guilty are \nbrought both to trial and punished appropriately. That is the American \nway. He made it clear that he is seeing that that is being done.\n  He is committed to preventing such abuses and such incidents from \never happening in the future. I know the Secretary's resolve, and he \nhas expressed that to the Senate.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has proven himself over and over again, through a \nlong and distinguished career, to be a man of great integrity and \nresults. We, as a nation, express our gratitude to him.\n  These are difficult times for all Americans. The abuses at the Abu \nGhraib prison continue to shock us--the photographs, the fact that such \nincidents, that we would have never thought possible, actually did \noccur. For some, the ugly behavior of a few made them question our \noverall mission in Iraq and fighting this war on terror. But while all \nthis is going on we should not lose hope, we cannot lose hope, and we \nmust not lose sight of that big picture.\n  The vast majority of our troops--and, again, over 130,000 men and \nwomen are fighting for us overseas right now--the overwhelming majority \nof those troops are serving us each and every day with courage and with \nhonor, of which we are all very proud. And we need to send that message \nto our troops. We do not say it nearly enough. And now is the time for \nus to do so, when the world is focused so much on the abuses, terrible \nabuses, caused by these very few people.\n  The men and women overseas, every day, are improving the lives of \nIraqis, of citizens throughout that country. They are bringing freedom. \nThey are fighting for freedom. They are sacrificing for the freedom of \nthe Iraqi people who have lived under merciless tyranny over the last \nseveral decades. By doing all this, our troops are there defending our \nsecurity so we can live in this great country, enjoying the freedoms \nand democracy that maybe all too often we take for granted, but in \nthese times we simply cannot. And that gratitude we express to those \nmen and women who are overseas right now fighting for us with boldness \nand courage and integrity and unselfishness.\n  I implied that elemental point of defending our security. Every day \nwe see the pictures of the terrible abuses. We\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\nneed to recognize that all this effort that our U.S. Government and the \nAmerican people are directing is to defend our security. That is an \nelemental point that we need to keep coming back to. We are fighting a \nshadowy enemy that seeks nothing less--their goal is to have \ndestruction of our way of life, of the freedoms that we enjoy.\n  They take pleasure in wanton murder. They hide behind innocents and \nthen slaughter them. They do so without hesitation. We can see the \ncharacter of our enemy in the brutal slaughter last week of Nicholas \nBerg.\n  We saw it in the slaughter of Daniel Pearl, and we saw it in the \nslaughter of 3,000 innocent people on September 11 in this country.\n  As our President reminds us, we did not ask for this conflict. The \nwar was brought to our doorstep. The battle against terror will last \nfor years, and we all know that. That is the new reality. It may last \nfor decades, but fight we must. It is a war we cannot afford to lose, \nand it is a war that we will win.\n  To his credit, Secretary Rumsfeld has shown vision and resolve in \npreparing us against these new threats. At the very beginning of the \nadministration, Secretary Rumsfeld resaw the need to modernize our \nmilitary. From focusing at the time on what was an outdated cold war \nstrategy to now this current era of adjusting to new threats, which are \nposed by terrorism, to be able to address issues as we did in the \nSenate this week on bioterrorism, using viruses and bacteria and \nmicroorganisms that know no boundaries or borders and can spread \nrapidly--this is the new reality. He recognized that not all future \nthreats to America will come from enemy soldiers in uniform. And before \nhe became Secretary of Defense, he chaired a commission that identified \nthe growing danger of a missile strike against the homeland.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has been a strong and innovative leader. He has \ndone a tremendous job in preparing our military for successful \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are grateful for the \ntremendous service he demonstrates every day. America is, indeed, \nfortunate to have such an exceptional Secretary of Defense in these \ntimes of crisis. Every day he is on the job, he is helping to make \nAmerica safer and more secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6249-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE PROGRESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before closing, I want to mention several \nthings that have occurred over the past several weeks on a different \ntopic. We are an evenly divided body in the Senate, and people say they \nhaven't seen more partisanship ever in their lives than over the last \nseveral years. I know that is true, but at the same time all of us, \nboth sides of the aisle, recognize we were sent here to govern and to \nserve the national interest.\n  As we prepare to enter into our weeklong Memorial Day recess, very \nquickly I want to look back and share what progress we have made. Two \ndays ago we passed Project Bioshield. It was supported by 99 Senators \nwith a resounding yes. Project Bioshield, proposed by the President in \nhis 2003 State of the Union Address, is comprehensive legislation that \nencourages research and encourages the development of new cutting-edge \ncountermeasures to fight biological terrorism, chemical warfare, \nterrorism used with radiological or nuclear weapons. It is critical to \nour national security. This body came together and 2 days ago passed \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  We also passed the JOBS bill which will protect more than 1 million \nhigh-quality manufacturing jobs in the United States. It cut taxes, a \nEuro tax that was going up at $40 million a month in this country on \n100 American-made products.\n  Last week we passed, in terms of education, the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. That special education bill refocuses our \nFederal law on outcomes for disabled children. It affects over 6.5 \nmillion children in this country and well over 400,000 special \neducation teachers.\n  In the field of taxation and technology, we passed an Internet access \ntax moratorium extension which makes sure that we will be able to \ncontinue to access and promote broadband technologies. We are going to \nconference on the bill. We had agreement last week, actually last \nnight, to go to the highway bill with the appointment of conferees. We \nhave been able in the past week to come to an accommodation on the \nappointment of the President's judicial nominations.\n  We confirmed the nomination of Marcia Cooke. We confirmed John \nNegroponte to become American Ambassador to Iraq. The Senate has been \nproductive, and I thank my colleagues for their hard work and \ncooperation.\n  When we return following Memorial Day we will go straight to class \naction reform. We will also return to the Department of Defense \nreauthorization.\n  We have a lot more to do, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in a productive, collaborative way as we move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6249-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6249-S6250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT OF 2004--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, earlier today the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee were here to make further \nprogress on the Department of Defense authorization bill. We have \nadopted a number of amendments that have been cleared. However, we have \nbeen unable to vote on the pending amendment which was offered by \nSenator Graham of South Carolina. In addition, Senator Warner has been \nunable to secure an agreement for a filing deadline or an amendment \nlist. We have a list of possible Republican amendments. However, there \nis an objection on the Democratic side of the aisle to limiting \namendments.\n  Further, many weeks ago we scheduled the class action legislation for \nwhen the Senate returns from the upcoming recess. I would add that the \nclass action bill does have strong bipartisan support, and we would \nlike to finish that bill in a reasonable period of time. I believe we \ncan, indeed, do just that. I had hoped we would have been able to \nproceed to that bill by consent, but again there is an objection to \nproceeding to the class action bill.\n  I want to reiterate that we are going to finish the Defense \nauthorization bill. It is a critical bill, an important bill. It is a \nbill we have made progress on this week. We need to lock in an \namendment list on this legislation, the Defense authorization, to allow \nour managers to work with Senators on their respective amendments and \nto make continued progress. This is a vital piece of legislation, and \nwe will return to the bill.\n  My intention is to go to the class action bill and then return to the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Thus, I now ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 on Tuesday, June 1, \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 430, S. 2062, \nthe class action bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we are very \ndisappointed that the distinguished majority leader is going to file \ncloture on this matter. We have said on more than one occasion we are \nwilling to work toward completion of the Defense bill. We cooperated \nthis week. We told the manager of the bill, both Senator Levin and I, \nlet's go off of the Lindsey Graham amendment. We will agree to a 2-hour \nlimitation of time when we come back next Tuesday to dispose of that \nand the Cantwell amendment that she would have offered. But that wasn't \nto be done. We indicated at that time that we would waste a lot of \ntime.\n  We had a bipartisan amendment by Senator Daschle and Senator Lindsey \nGraham on TRICARE that would have moved forward. We had one that \nSenator Kennedy had on the reporting. We were standing by with a number \nof amendments ready to go.\n  I would also say to the distinguished majority leader, we have \nsupplied to the two managers of the bill our amendments, as Republicans \nhave supplied amendments. There are about 100 amendments. They cleared \na number this morning. They have cleared amendments in the past. I \nwould also say that we take about 10 days on this bill normally. We \ndon't think this bill will take that much time. We believe that when we \ncome back, we would be in a position at that time, maybe not on Tuesday \nbut by Wednesday, enter into an agreement as to a list of amendments. \nIt is difficult to have our Members do this with a 10-day break because \nwe don't know if there is going to be another Chalabi problem. We don't \nknow if there is going to be another problem dealing with a prison.\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\nWe don't know what is going to happen. Events are moving so quickly.\n  I say to my distinguished friend, the majority leader, we believe it \nis more important to go to this Defense bill. I listened to every word \nof the statement of the distinguished majority leader about the \nSecretary of Defense. We have had other speeches on the floor today \nabout how important it is that we continue supporting our troops. We \nbelieve that.\n  Last night, the House passed, on a bipartisan basis, a very important \nDefense authorization bill, by an overwhelming margin. We need to do \nthe same.\n  I also say that we are willing to go to class action when we finish \nthe Defense bill, which will probably be, I respectfully submit to my \nfriend, Tuesday anyway because I don't think you are going to get \ncloture on this motion to proceed. I have spoken to my people who are \nadvocates of class action reform--the junior Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nCarper, and the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer. They believe in \nclass action reform a lot, but they are not going to vote for cloture.\n  We believe we should finish the Defense bill and then go to class \naction. I ask my friend, the distinguished majority leader, to modify \nhis request to provide that the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nthe class action legislation upon disposition of the Defense \nauthorization bill. I make that request.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I object to the request of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me briefly say I have had the \nopportunity to talk to the manager of the bill, and we feel very \nstrongly that it is critical that we address this bill. The best way to \ndo it is to allow the managers to work together over the recess and see \nif they can come back with amendments that are identified so we have \nsome kind of certainty as to how we are going to bring this to closure.\n  In the meantime, while those discussions are underway, we will \nhopefully be able to proceed with class action.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I move to proceed to the consideration of \nS. 2062, and I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 430, S. 2062.\n         Bill Frist, Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, John Sununu, \n           Lamar Alexander, Pete Domenici, Norm Coleman, Jim \n           Talent, Larry Craig, Mitch McConnell, Trent Lott, John \n           Cornyn, Judd Gregg, Richard G. Lugar, Mike Crapo, Saxby \n           Chambliss, Jon Kyl, Peter Fitzgerald.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could the \nmajority leader schedule that for 5:30? It is so difficult for people \non the west coast--and I am one of them--coming back that day. We don't \narrive, if the plane is on time, until about 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. FRIST. We are happy to make it 5:30, June 1. We modify the \nunanimous consent request to be 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want the record to reflect that we have \ncleared a significant number of people today, and we have basically \nfilled the diplomatic corps, ambassadorial vacancies, except for one, \nand that is in Nepal.\n  I was on the Senate floor about 10 days ago when we cleared another \nbatch of ambassadors. We had the same problem then that we have now. We \nhave not cleared the only vacant ambassadorial spot open, and that is \nNepal. There is an objection by the majority. The ambassadorial \nappointments are all done except for Nepal. It is not our fault. It is \nthe fault of the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                      department of transportation\n\n       Linda Morrison Combs, of North Carolina, to be an Assistant \n     Secretary of Transportation.\n       Francis Mulvey, of Maryland, to be a Member of the Surface \n     Transportation Board for a term expiring December 31, 2007.\n       W.

Mr. President, indeed, we just confirmed about 12 of the \n96 pending nominations on the Executive Calendar, and I do thank my \ncolleagues for allowing us to proceed on this list. These ambassadorial \nappointments and other nominations are all very important. It reflects \na lot of work on both sides of the aisle to make this progress. We \nappreciate the cooperation of those to date. Again, that is 12 of 96 \nnominations on the Executive Calendar that I mentioned earlier this \nmorning.\n  Mr. President, thus, I now ask consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the following nominations, en bloc: Calendar Nos. 429, \n594, 595, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 617, 622, 623, 628, 629, 630, \n631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 641, 642, 643, 654, 655, 656, 658, 687, \n688, 689, 690, 691, 694, 695, and 696.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FRIST. I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be \nconfirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then return to legislative session.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the reason I got a little \nout of sorts there, I thought I was in Nevada listening to a bingo game \nbeing called. I apologize.\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\n  I reserve the right to object, and I do it for this reason: The two \nleaders have worked hard to clear nominations. We got a little movement \non our side today. Therefore, we cleared some 12 nominations. We need \nsome reciprocation. I do not know what the numbers were today. I do not \nknow exactly, it is 3 to 12, 3 to 16. We got 3; they got 12 or 16. We \nneed some reciprocation. Let me give an example.\n  We have nominated and sent to the White House, and the White House \nhas sent back to us a man by the name of Dr. Greg Jasko. Dr. Greg Jasko \nis to go on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I appeared at a hearing \nyesterday. This is one of the most important sensitive commissions in \nthe entire American Government. They deal with the most sensitive \nissues--nuclear powerplants, the nuclear repository in Nevada, other \nnuclear facilities all over America. Dr. Jasko is eminently qualified. \nHe has a Ph.D. in physics. We cannot get him cleared.\n  This is one of many examples of how it is not fair. I hope the \ndistinguished majority leader will weigh in and help Dr. Jasko and \nothers to get this roadblock cleared. It just really is not fair. We \nneed some help on our boards and commissions. Therefore, I object, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, indeed, I will continue to work with the \nDemocratic leadership to search for a way to confirm the remaining \nnominations. For those people listening who are not familiar with this \nprocess, as they can see, it is a give-and-take process that is a real \nstruggle, but it does involve very important positions and, just as the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada said, individuals who are willing, \nwho put themselves forward for public service in very important \npositions.\n  We will continue to work on those who remain on the calendar and \nfuture nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6251-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MISCELLANEOUS TRADE AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, first I want to say I will be very \nbrief. I have told the Senate, as best I could, that I would try to \ntake the floor every day and say something about America's energy \ncrisis. So today I want to speak again for a couple of minutes.\n  A week ago, some of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle \nwere down here on the Senate floor complaining because they wanted the \nadministration to persuade OPEC to increase its production. They acted \nand spoke as if our President was not doing anything about it, and that \nthey were going to have to direct him to do it.\n  Instead of passing an energy bill, Senators on the other side \ncontinue to blame the President for the high price of gasoline. This \nadministration has been part of an announcement today which I think \nindicates the President is doing his job well. Saudi Arabia has \nannounced it will ask OPEC to increase its production by 2 million \nbarrels a day.\n  That is the first solid good news we have had in a long time. If it \nhappens, if they can, I think it is obvious part of that will be due to \nthe good relations between our President and the Saudis. In a sense, \nthe President is working hard with the tools he has to help us through \nthis energy crisis.\n  But the American people are still waiting for this Senate to deliver \nan energy bill. I have been trying to pass the Energy bill for more \nthan a year. Some of the same Senators who wanted the administration to \npersuade OPEC to increase production, as if the President were doing \nnothing, are the very Senators who have blocked the Energy bill for \nmore than a year. Each of them seems to have one other reason that they \nwill or will not vote for this energy bill. I am telling these \nSenators, the administration is doing everything it can to address oil \nprices, and they have asked us repeatedly to produce an energy bill.\n  If you don't like the President's suggestions, let's do something \nelse. The Energy bill we produced was not exclusively the President's, \nthough some on the other side continue to say they didn't like the \nPresident's and we have the President's bill here. That is not the \ncase.\n  I again ask that the other side of the aisle seriously consider the \nproposition of sitting down with our side of the aisle and working \nthrough the Energy bill to see if we can't get together on an \noverwhelming portion of it so if the OPEC cartel reduces oil prices and \nwe get some good news that it will not be temporary, it will not be a \none-time event, but we can send a message to the world we are trying to \nsolve our problem by bringing alternatives to the market in America.\n  If we told the world we were moving on natural gas and moving on coal \nand moving on nuclear and moving on wind energy and we are doing \nsomething for our electricity grid that is important and long term, \nthey would react first in disbelief, because they wouldn't believe we \ncould do it, and then, when it was done, there would be great relief in \nthe world that America is doing something to help itself out of this \ncrisis.\n  I commend to my colleagues an article from the June 2004 issue of the \nNational Geographic, at page 84.\n  You wouldn't expect that to be the great source of this information, \nbut it has the best article I have seen on oil today and oil in the \nfuture. It is called ``The End Of Cheap Oil.'' It tells us what a \nproblem we have in America if we do not solve our energy crisis.\n  Let me close by saying most of us think our oil and its related \nproducts all go to automobiles and transportation. If you read this \narticle you will find only half goes to that. Half of America's use \ngoes to a myriad of products, from plastics to all kinds of related \nproducts, including many in the semiconducting industry. That comes \nfrom oil. Fifty percent of our use is for products, for agriculture, \nand all kinds of things.\n  I suggest we ought to get on with it. Maybe we learned our lesson and \nwe don't have to come down here and try to blame the President and make \nthis a political issue with reference to the White House, when, if the \nPresident wanted to go to the public every day, he could make sure they \nunderstood the truth. That is, it is our fault, not his.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/21/senate-section/article/S6252-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TUESDAY, JUNE 1, 2004 at 10 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
