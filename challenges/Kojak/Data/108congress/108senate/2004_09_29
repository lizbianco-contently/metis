Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the intelligence reform bill. As our colleagues know, \nseveral amendments are currently pending to the bill, including the \nSpecter intelligence consolidation amendment. We do hope to reach a \ntime agreement on that amendment this morning, allowing us to vote on \nthe Specter amendment. I know Senator Specter is here. I hope we make \nreal progress on that amendment this morning. Hopefully, we can have a \nvote sometime this morning. The chairman and ranking member, of course, \nwill be here to work through pending amendments as well as those that \nmay be offered today.\n  I was just talking to the Democratic leader. We are going to have \nvotes throughout the day, as we continue to move forward on this bill. \nIn addition, because of a number of amendments we know we have to \nconsider and will consider--I do not know the entire range--it is very \nlikely that we will need to continue to work throughout today, \ntomorrow, possibly Friday, and we cannot rule out having votes on \nFriday, and indeed on Monday. Many times we try to schedule votes such \nthat we pay deference to individual Senators' schedules, and we will \ntry to do that as well.\n  On the other hand, as we all know, we are going to depart on October \n8, and with that we have a huge amount of business to do, with this \nvery bill, the single greatest reform bill on intelligence in the last \n50 years, and we need to continue to work with the extensions, the \ncontinuing resolution, address transportation, address welfare, and \nhave the appropriations bills as well. So from a scheduling standpoint, \nI ask for real consideration by our colleagues in that we need to move \nexpeditiously, get the amendments to the floor, and have them \nappropriately debated.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader and I have been \ntalking the last couple days with regard to the schedule for this \nparticular bill. I would ask the majority leader if he could again \nindicate his desire, and certainly one that I can support, which would \nset in motion a series of events requiring today that all amendments be \nlisted; that is, we would have a finite list, and that by tomorrow all \namendments be filed, and that at some point in this debate, in the next \ncouple of days, all amendments be offered.\n  I think it is very important for us to have a clear understanding of \nthe universe of amendments that are there. If we get that finite list \nthis morning, or sometime through the earlier part of the day, and then \nthe order requiring that all amendments be filed so we know exactly \nwhat the language is for those amendments, and then offered, we would \nbe in that position.\n  I ask the majority leader if that is his intent. And we could work \nthrough the day with that expectation in mind.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, in response, as we \ndiscussed yesterday, if we could get the list of amendments, I think we \nsaid by about 10 o'clock this morning--and I think those lists have \nbeen coming in--and the filing deadline, let's discuss that\n\n[[Page S9868]]\n\nover the course of the morning. It would be great if we could do it \neven late today so we could work on those over the course of tonight. \nBut, again, we defer to leadership and the managers, but it would be \ngreat to have that language. That would give people from last night \nover the course of today to finalize that language. So I agree \nweakheartedly.\n  I would just suggest that maybe we could have that filing deadline \nsometime today or this evening and have staff work over the course of \nthe day rather than tomorrow. Again, it is just so that we can see what \nthe universe is and we can systematically put a little bit of a sense \nof urgency on getting people to focus on the bill itself. But I agree \nwholeheartedly, let's have a list here in the next 20 minutes or so, \nand then mutually establish a filing deadline by which we can actually \nsee the language.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would just ask the majority leader if it is his view \nas well, since these amendments require legislative drafting, that all \nSenators ought to understand that the period for drafting these \namendments could expire as early as tomorrow. So they need to get their \namendments to legislative counsel to make sure they are in concert with \nthe pending bill. I ask if the majority leader shares that view.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do. I think our colleagues can tell from \nthe dialog going on that we, as leadership, are trying to give a \nframework to accelerate the process that is currently underway in \ndiscussing a very important bill. Our colleagues have met in various \ncaucuses. I know a lot of our Members on this side of the aisle are \nmeeting right now, and we are putting forth the same message to bring \nthose amendments forward. And the managers will process those in an \norderly way.\n  Mr. President, I want to very briefly comment on the bill. We \nreceived yesterday the administration's statement of policy that is in \nsupport of the Collins-Lieberman bill. I think that was a very \nimportant statement for us to receive to show the administration's \nstrong support. In the expression of support, and support for passage \nof the Collins-Lieberman bill, there were comments made about certain \nprovisions about which they have caution flags. That will be addressed \nappropriately on the floor of the Senate.\n  So I am glad we received the letter yesterday. It allows us to \naddress many of those concerns through debate and amendment over today \nand tomorrow and the next several days.\n  The administration specifically backs the creation of a national \nintelligence director with--and I quote from the letter--``full, \neffective, and meaningful budget authorities and other authorities to \nmanage the Intelligence Community, including statutory authority for \nthe newly created National Counterterrorism Center.''\n  I mention that because it shows the huge support for reform. There is \nnothing really that new about the reform. There have been 13 reports, \nnational commissions over the last 10, 15, 20 years, 13 different ones \nurging intelligence reform. Now it is on the floor of the Senate. \nIndeed, we will accomplish that.\n  I do want to stress that we have both the reform of the executive \nbranch, which is mainly the Collins-Lieberman bill, but we also have \nthe internal reform within this body itself for oversight. Both of \nthose, of course, were recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The \nDemocratic leader and I have a task force working on the internal \nreform. Both of those elements of reform are going to be dealt with \nbefore we depart. That is a lot of business to accomplish, and that is \nwhy there is a sense of urgency in moving along.\n  Yesterday, we voted on a number of amendments, including the McCain \namendment and the Hutchison amendment. We will see more provisions of \nthe McCain-Lieberman bill come through with amendments to be addressed \non the Senate floor as they look at specific 9/11 recommendations.\n  We do want to do this expeditiously. After we pass the bill, we have \nto go to the conference with the House and work out any differences \nbetween the two bills.\n  I also want to mention briefly the news that came out regarding the \nFBI and the shortage of linguists to translate intelligence materials. \nThat sort of news is alarming. After 9/11, we know we can't be behind \nthe curve. Our enemies are smart. They are clever, resourceful. We have \nseen it time and again. We need an intelligence system that will block \nthem at every turn. It is my hope that the Collins-Lieberman \nlegislation will help address this problem. The recruitment of \nlinguists is specifically cited as one of the issues the bill seeks to \naddress.\n  Moreover, in the bill the new national intelligence director will \nhave the authority to prioritize and allocate resources appropriately. \nClearly, this issue would likely fall under that person's purview. \nWhether it is strengthening the FBI or buttressing the CIA or \nintegrating our intelligence capabilities, these are among the many \nreasons we have to move with deliberate speed to finish this \nlegislation. Nothing less than America's national security is at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9868-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The bill currently pending, managed so well by \nSenators Collins and Lieberman, and the task force and the effort to \nreorganize the legislative branch creating greater oversight and \nclearer lines of responsibility for intelligence are critical matters \nand high priorities. I hope we can continue to keep the discipline and \nfocus on this legislation until we have successfully completed it.\n  I am optimistic, given the cooperation and the degree of comity on \nthese matters, that we can complete our work, but I do believe it is \ngoing to take the kind of schedule that the majority leader and I \naddressed a moment ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9868-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9868-S9869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO AMERICA'S HEROES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, over the past 4 years, as we have watched \nthe heroism of our men and women in uniform, our Nation has gained a \nnew awareness for the service and sacrifice of American soldiers. In \ncommunities all across our country, Americans are praying for the safe \nreturn of loved ones serving abroad. They are sending letters and care \npackages and small reminders of home. But they are counting the days \nuntil they can show the thanks they feel and our soldiers deserve face \nto face.\n  Few values bring Americans more closely together than our gratitude \nand respect for the men and women who serve in uniform to protect us. \nAnd today, all America is united in gratitude for the service of our \nArmed Forces and for the many sacrifices their families must make to \naccommodate their absence.\n  Regrettably, there are troubling signs that the tremendous burdens we \nhave placed on their shoulders have begun to come at a cost. In recent \nweeks, we have learned that the National Guard and Reserves are having \ndifficulty recruiting and retaining enough soldiers to defend our \ncountry. For the first time in a decade, the Army Guard is unable to \nmeet its requirement for 350,000 soldiers. Too many soldiers are \nleaving and recruiting can't keep up.\n  A regular survey of reservists has found that the percentage of Army \nReserve members who plan to reenlist has fallen from 69 percent in May \n2003 to 59 percent in May 2004. There can be no doubt, the stress of \nlong deployments and active duty are having an effect on recruiting.\n  Increasingly, our national security is put in the hands of the \ncitizens soldiers of our National Guard and Reserve. When recruitment \nfor the Guard and Reserve falls off, it threatens to undermine the \nreadiness and the effectiveness of our Armed Forces. Let there be no \ndoubt: Now more than ever, we need our Armed Forces to be strong and \nprepared enough to meet the threats we face today and those we may see \ntomorrow.\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\n  Earlier in the week, the New York Times reported that the Army is \nconsidering cutting the length of its 12-month combat tours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan in order to relieve the stress of duty. This could be a \npositive step. Special attention also needs to be paid to considering \nnew ways to honor the service of our reservists and offer new \nincentives for signing up. The debt we owe our soldiers shouldn't be \nlimited to a welcome-home parade. It begins before we send them abroad \nand it shouldn't end when they return home. This is a debt we must \nhonor every day.\n  But consider the welcome home thousands of Guard members received \nwhen they returned stateside recently only to find they had lost their \njobs while they were fighting in Iraq. Over the past 3 years, thousands \nof Guard members and reservists have come home to find themselves out \nof work.\n  Ron Vander Wal, a member of South Dakota Guard's 200th Engineer \nCompany had to sue his employer just to get his old job back. Ron is \nnow back at work, but he never should have had to go to court to get \nwhat was rightfully his.\n  Thousands more aren't as fortunate. And every time a soldier returns \nhome to find that he has less than when he left to fight, we have \nfailed that soldier. How can we ask our soldiers to fight for us \noverseas and then force them to fight for their jobs once they get \nhome? Sadly, this is only the tip of the iceberg.\n  More than 400,000 reservists and National Guard members have been \nmobilized since September 11, 2001. They represent 40 percent of our \nforces in the region. Their bravery and professionalism have been vital \nto every aspect of our mission in Iraq. Many of them have been working \nto improve the lives and health of average Iraqis. And yet, when they \nreturn, one out of every five Guard members and Reservists--and 40 \npercent of junior enlisted personnel--will have no health insurance of \ntheir own. That is simply unacceptable.\n  This kind of neglect is regrettably reflected in our treatment of \nveterans, as well. Last month, I spoke to a woman from Hartford, SD, \nwhose father served in the Navy--in Vietnam and elsewhere. Recently, \nher father died, and in his final months the family struggled with the \nVA to get the benefits he needed. This woman became quite frustrated \nwith the VA and its ability to care for veterans. Today, this woman who \nloves her country and is proud of her father's service says she will \nadvise her children against joining the military, because she feels our \ncountry just doesn't take care of its vets in their hours of greatest \nneed.\n  That is intolerable. Not only is it morally wrong not to honor the \nservice of our veterans, but it directly affects our ability to recruit \nthe next generation of American heroes. Something needs to be done.\n  Let there be no doubt, the problems with the VA health system are not \nthe fault of the doctors and nurses and the other men and women who \nwork at VA hospitals and clinics. They are among the most talented, \nmost dedicated health professionals in this country. But they can only \ndo so much with the resources they are given. And from the first days \nof this administration, the White House has systematically tried to \nreduce veterans benefits, cut funding to the VA, and shortchange the \nhealthcare of America's veterans.\n  Over the past 4 years, the budget for veterans health has risen far \nless than has the cost of delivering health care, forcing VA hospitals \nto meet rising demand with shrinking resources. The White House's 2005 \nbudget deepens this trend by including less than a one-tenth of one \npercent funding increase, while health costs nationwide are rising at \ndouble digit rates of inflation. Overall, the White House budget falls \nnearly $4.3 billion short of veterans' needs, according to the \nindependent budget created by leading nonpartisan veterans groups.\n\n  The veterans least able to pay are being asked to pick up the \ndifference. Over the course of the last 3 years, the amount vets have \npaid toward their own care has increased a staggering 340 percent, or \n$561 million. And if the White House gets its way, vets would need to \npick up more than a half billion dollars more of their care in 2005.\n  This is wrong. Americans treasure their freedom and we treasure those \nwho have sworn to defend it. The kind of treatment our veterans and \nreservists are receiving defies the gratitude Americans feel in their \nhearts and betrays our tradition of caring for those who wore the \nuniform of their country.\n  There are two steps Congress should take immediately. First, we \nshould pass the National Guard and Reservist Bill of Rights which I \nintroduced earlier this month. This bill codifies a set of rights the \nmen and women serving in our National Guard and Reserve have earned \nwith their service to our Nation. It states that every reservist has \nthe right to straight answers about his or her deployments, and \ndeployments that are no longer than those of full-time soldiers; the \nright to the best equipment the Nation has to offer; the right to \nadequate, timely, and problem-free compensation; the right to child \ncare for his or her family; the right to quality, affordable health \ncare; the right to employment when he or she returns home; the right to \neducation benefits; the right to a fair retirement plan; and the right \nto representation at the highest levels of the Department of Defense. \nPerhaps most important, this bill of rights would ensure that the Guard \nand Reserve remain attractive opportunities for Americans who want to \nserve their country.\n  Second, it is time we made good on a simple promise to veterans: If \nyou wore the uniform of our Nation, if you fought under our flag, your \nhealth care needs will be met for life. The full funding of veterans \nhealth care should be made mandatory under law. For too long, the VA \nbudget has been subject to the give and take of budget politics. We \nneed to set things straight. The funding for the VA should no longer be \nset by political convenience, or backroom deals, or the zero-sum game \nof budget politics. One thing, and one thing alone, should govern the \ncare of our veterans; that is, the needs of our veterans.\n  How could we do otherwise? How could we let our country move forward \nand leave behind the men and women whose bravery has won our freedom \nand prosperity? Moreover, how could we let our children grow up \nbelieving that our Government fails to honor and repay those who risk \ntheir lives in service to the Nation.\n  We cannot afford to wake up one day and discover that our military \nlacks the manpower it needs to defend our country. The signs of an \nimpending recruitment crisis are all around us. We should not let this \nCongress adjourn without taking real steps to prevent this developing \nproblem from undermining the strength of our military for years to \ncome. It is time to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the leader and the leadership. I \nknow the matters we have before us are of great importance and urgency. \nSo is the matter about which I will address the Senate.\n  By any reasonable standard, our policy in Iraq is failing. We are \nsteadily losing ground in the war. Even after\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\n9/11, it was wrong for this President or any President to shoot first \nand ask questions later, to rush to war and ignore or even muzzle \nserious doubts by experienced military officers and experienced \nofficials in the State Department and the CIA about the rationale and \njustification for the war, and the strategy for waging it.\n  We all know that Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We have known \nit for more than 20 years. We are proud, very proud, of our troops for \ntheir extraordinary and swift success in removing Saddam from power.\n  But as we also now know beyond doubt, Saddam did not pose the kind of \nimmediate threat to our national security that could possibly justify a \nunilateral, preventive war without the broad support of the \ninternational community. There was no reason whatsoever to go to war \nwhen we did, in the way we did, and for the false reasons we were \ngiven.\n  The administration's insistence that Saddam could provide nuclear \nmaterial or even nuclear weapons to al-Qaida has been exposed as an \nempty threat. It should have never been used by President Bush to \njustify an ideological war that America never should have fought.\n  Saddam had no nuclear weapons. In fact, not only were there no \nnuclear weapons, there were no chemical or biological weapons either, \nno weapons of mass destruction of any kind.\n  Nor was there any persuasive link between al-Qaida and Saddam and the \n9/11 attacks. A 9/11 Commission Staff Statement put it plainly:\n\n       Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that \n     any ties existed between al-Qaida and Iraq. We have no \n     credible evidence that Iraq and al-Qaida cooperated on \n     attacks against the United States.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission Report stated clearly that there was no \n``operational'' connection between Saddam and al-Qaida.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell now agrees that there was no \ncorrelation between 9/11 and Saddam's regime. So does Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld. Nevertheless, President Bush continues to \ncling to the fiction that there was a relationship between Saddam and \nal-Qaida. As the President said in his familiar Bush-speak, ``The \nreason that I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq \nand Saddam and al-Qaida is because there was a relationship between \nIraq and al-Qaida.''\n  That's the same logic President Bush keeps using today in his \nrepeated stubborn insistence that the situation is improving in Iraq, \nand that we and the world are safer because Saddam is gone.\n  The President and his administration continue to paint a rosy picture \nof progress in Iraq. Just last Wednesday, he referred to the growing \ninsurgency as ``a handful of people.'' Some handful.\n  Vice President Cheney says we're ``moving in the right direction,'' \ndespite the worsening violence. Our troops are increasingly the targets \nof deadly attacks. American citizens are being kidnapped and brutally \nbeheaded.\n  But Secretary Rumsfeld says he's ``encouraged'' by developments in \nIraq.\n  Our colleague Senator Lindsey Graham doesn't buy that, and he has \nsaid so clearly: ``We do not need to paint a rosy scenario for the \nAmerican people.''\n  Neither does our colleague Senator Hagel, a Vietnam veteran and a \nmember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As he stated \nunequivocally last week, ``I don't think we're winning . . . The fact \nis, we're in trouble. We're in deep trouble in Iraq.''\n  The National Intelligence Estimate in July, although not yet made \npublic, made this point as well--and made it with such breathtaking \nclarity that for the good of our country, officials leaked it to the \npress. The New York Times said the estimate ``spells out a dark \nassessment of prospects for Iraq.'' The same Times report and other \nreports, the National Intelligence Estimate outlines three different \npossibilities for Iraq through the end of next year. The worst-case \nscenario is that Iraq plunges into outright civil war. The best-case \nscenario--the best case--is that violence in Iraq continues at current \nlevels, with tenuous political and economic stability.\n  President Bush categorically rejected that analysis, saying the CIA \nwas ``just guessing.'' Last week, he retreated somewhat. He said he \nshould have used ``estimate'' instead of ``guess.''\n  In other words, the best case scenario between now and the end of \n2005 is that our soldiers will be bogged down in a continuing quagmire \nwith no end in sight. President Bush refused to give the time of day to \nadvice like that by the best intelligence analysts in his \nadministration, but the American people need to hear it.\n  We learned in yesterday's New York Times that the President was also \nwarned by intelligence officials before the war that the invasion could \nincrease support for political Islam and result in a deeply divided \nsociety in Iraq, a society prone to violent internal conflict. Before \nthe war, President Bush received a report that warned of the possible \ninsurgency.\n  It is listed on the front page of the New York Times. Just to mention \npart of the story:\n\n       ``The same intelligence unit that produced a gloomy report \n     in July about the prospects of growing instability in Iraq \n     warned the Bush administration about the potentially costly \n     consequence of an American-led invasion 2 months before the \n     war began,'' Government officials said Monday. The \n     assessments predicted that an American-led invasion of Iraq \n     would increase support for political Islam and would result \n     in a deeply divided Iraq society prone to violent internal \n     conflict. The assessment also said a war would increase \n     sympathy across the Islamic world for some terrorist \n     objectives, at least in the short run.\n\n  That is the warning this President had, but he rushed headlong into \nthe war with no plan to win the peace. Now, despite our clear failures, \nthe President paints a rosy picture. Look at today's national \nnewspapers. The Washington Post, on the front page, says:\n\n       Growing Pessimism on Iraq. A growing number of career \n     professionals within the national security agencies believe \n     that the situation in Iraq is much worse, and the path to \n     success much more tenuous, than is being expressed in public \n     by top Bush administration officials. . . .\n       ``While President Bush, Defense Secretary Donald H. \n     Rumsfeld and others have delivered optimistic public \n     appraisals, officials who fight the Iraqi insurgency and \n     study it at the CIA and State Department and within the Army \n     officer corps believe the rebellion is deeper and more \n     widespread than is being publicly acknowledged,'' officials \n     say.\n       People at the CIA ``are mad at the policy in Iraq because \n     it's a disaster, and they're digging the hole deeper and \n     deeper. . . .''\n       ``Things are definitely not improving.''\n\n  When is the President going to level with the American people?\n  In the New York Times today--these are in the last 2 days, Mr. \nPresident--on the front page it says: ``Baghdad,'' and this is a \ndifferent story:\n\n       Over the past 30 days, more than 2,300 attacks by \n     insurgents have been directed against civilians and military \n     targets in Iraq, in a pattern that sprawls over nearly every \n     major population center outside the Kurdish north, according \n     to comprehensive data compiled by a private security company \n     with access to military intelligence reports and its own \n     network of Iraqi informants.\n       The sweeping geographical reach of the attacks . . . \n     suggests a more widespread resistance than the isolated \n     pockets described by the Iraqi government officials.\n\n  The outlook is bleak, and it is easy to understand why. It is because \nthe number of insurgents has gone up. The number of their attacks on \nour troops has gone up. The sophistication of the attacks has gone up. \nThe number of our soldiers killed or wounded has gone up. The number of \nhostages seized and even savagely executed has gone up.\n  Our troops are under increasing fire. More than 1,000 of America's \nfinest young men and women have been killed. More than 7,000 have been \nwounded. In August alone, we had 863 American casualties. Our forces \nwere attacked an average of 70 times a day, higher than for any month \nsince President Bush dressed up in a flight suit, flew out to the \naircraft carrier, and recklessly declared, ``Mission accomplished'' a \nyear and a half ago.\n  The President, the Vice President, the National Security Council, \nSecretary Rumsfeld, and other civilian leaders in the Pentagon failed \nto see the insurgency that took place last year and that began to \nmetastasize like a deadly cancer. How could they have not noticed?\n  Perhaps because they were still celebrating their ``mission \naccomplished.''\n  For 2 years, terrorist cells in Iraq have been spreading like cancer. \nAny doctor who would let that happen to a patient would be guilty of \nmalpractice.\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\nIn many places in Iraq today, it is too dangerous to go out even with \nguards. The streets are so dangerous that some parents are apparently \nkeeping their children home from school, afraid they will be kidnapped, \nor worse, along the way.\n  The State Department does not attempt to conceal the truth about the \ndanger, at least in its travel warnings. Its September 17 advisory \nstates that Iraq remains very dangerous.\n  At the end of August, a bloody 3-week battle in Najaf ended with an \nagreement that U.S. troops would give up the city. Fallujah and now \nother cities are no-go zones for our troops, presumably to avoid even \ngreater casualties, until after the election.\n  Those are not the only areas where we have lost control. Last Friday, \nSecretary Powell said:\n\n       We don't have government control, or government control is \n     inadequate, in Samarra, Ramadi, Erbil and a number of other \n     places.\n\n  We continue to use so-called precision bombing in Iraq, even though \nour bombs cannot tell whether it is terrorists or innocent families \ninside the buildings they destroy.\n  What is helping to unite so many Iraqi people in hatred of America is \nthis emerging sense that America is unwilling, not just unable, to \nrebuild their shattered country and provide for their basic needs. Far \nfrom sharing President Bush's unrealistic rosy view, they see close up \nthat their hopes for peace and stability are receding every day.\n  Inevitably, more and more Iraqis believe that attacks on American \nforces are acceptable, even if they would not resort to violence \nthemselves. For every mistake we make, for every innocent Iraqi child \nwe accidentally kill in another bombing raid, the ranks of the \ninsurgents climb, and so does their fanatical determination to stop at \nnothing to drive us out.\n  An Army reservist described the deteriorating situation this way:\n\n       For every guerrilla we kill with a smart bomb, we kill many \n     more innocent civilians and create rage and anger in the \n     Iraqi community. This rage and anger translates into more \n     recruits for the terrorists and less support for us.\n\n  The Iraqi people's anger is also fueled by the persistent blackouts, \nthe power shortages, the lack of electricity, the destroyed \ninfrastructure, the relentless violence, the massive lack of jobs and \nbasic necessities and services.\n  By any reasonable standard, our policy is failing in Iraq. The \nPresident should level with the American people. He should take off his \nrose-colored glasses, understand the truth, and tell the truth. The \nAmerican people and our soldiers in Iraq deserve answers to the \nquestions they have about the war: Will President Bush come to the \nPresidential debate tomorrow prepared to answer the hard questions? \nWill he admit that we are on a catastrophic path in Iraq? Will he admit \nthat we rushed to a $200 billion war with no plan to win the peace? \nWill he offer a concrete plan to correct our course?\n  We are steadily losing ground in the war. No amount of campaign spin \ncan obscure those facts. We have to do better. November 2 is our \nchance. This President had his chance in Iraq. We deserve a new call, \nand I believe we will have it on November 2.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Arizona has 14 \nminutes 15 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9871-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9871-S9873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to respond to my colleague from \nMassachusetts. He has made a pretty vicious attack, I would say, on the \nPresident of the United States, contending that he has not leveled with \nthe American people, that he has to begin telling the truth about what \nis going on in Iraq. These are very serious charges, and I would like \nto try to respond to them.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts began by a recitation of why, in his \nview, ``the outlook is so bleak,'' to use his quotation, and why he \nconcluded that ``we're losing the war,'' another quotation from the \nSenator.\n  I see in the Senator's remarks, and others that I have heard \nrecently, a steely determination to keep hopelessness alive. I do not \nthink that should be the policy of the United States. The President has \na much better vision about how to bring the war against militant Islam \nto a conclusion.\n  There were no constructive alternatives, as my colleagues will \nrecall, from the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts. There were \nno ideas about how we could do better. It was just an attack on the \nPresident and an assertion that we are losing the war, the implications \nof which were left hanging.\n  When he said the President has this attitude of shooting first and \nasking questions later, then perhaps we need to recall that we have \nalready been attacked. We did not shoot first. We were attacked \nviciously on 9/11 and it changed everything about our approach to the \nwar against militant Islam.\n  Secondly, when the Senator from Massachusetts accuses the President \nof painting a rosy picture and then refers to the National Intelligence \nEstimate that predicted some pretty dire consequences, he forgets two \nthings. First, President Bush has said repeatedly from the very \nbeginning that this would be a very long and difficult conflict. He has \nnever wavered from that. In fact, he has tried to inspire the American \npeople to continue to persevere in this war.\n  One does not inspire people by wringing their hands and talking about \nhow we are losing the war. Think about what kind of a message that \nsends to the troops and to the families who are sacrificing, to a mom \nwho gets notice that her young son has been killed in Iraq: We are \nlosing the war. It is hopeless. The outlook is bleak.\n  Well, what are we fighting for? What kind of a message does it send \nto our allies, who some people say they could convince to come into \nthis conflict, we are losing the war, now please come in? That is not \nexactly going to persuade them to come into the conflict.\n  Finally, and most importantly, what kind of a message does it send to \nthe enemy to suggest that they are winning and we are losing? Major \npolitical figures in this country argue that we are losing the war. It \ngives confidence to the enemies. That is exactly what they want to \nhear. Osama bin Laden has said we are the weak horse and he is the \nstrong horse. If we convey that message to him, we increase the \npossibility that he will continue to think he can win and that he will \ncontinue to engage in this fight.\n  We need to break his will. He is testing our will and comments such \nas this are not helpful to challenging the American people to continue \nto persevere in this contest.\n  The question is about the American will, and I do not think the \ncomments we heard from the Senator from Massachusetts are going to be \neffective in helping to sustain that will. I rather think the approach \nthat Winston Churchill took in World War II accentuating the positive, \nyes, but not ignoring the negative and challenging the British people \nand the people of the Allies to persevere in that war is the right \napproach, and that is what President Bush has tried to do.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has confused a couple of issues. \nFirst, he confuses violence in Iraq with less security at home. I do \nnot think we are less secure at home because there is violence in Iraq. \nIn fact, one of the reasons we have not been attacked at home for over \n3 years is because we have taken the fight to the enemy and we have \nlargely been successful. We have not lost a battle in this war.\n  There are battles yet to be fought, and the enemy attacks us with \nguerilla tactics, but we can persevere and win militarily. So I do not \nthink we should confuse the fact that there is violence in Iraq and \ntherefore conclude we are less secure at home. That is simply not true.\n\n  Secondly, the Senator from Massachusetts alleges that there was no \nrelationship, no connection, between the terrorists and the Saddam \nHussein regime. I want to try to debunk this myth right now, so let me \nquote from the CIA, from the 9/11 Commission, and from George Tenet's \nassessment since we are going to be quoting the National Intelligence \nEstimate. This is what the head of the CIA, George Tenet, said:\n\n       Our understanding of the relationship between Iraq and al-\n     Qaida is evolving and is based on sources of varying \n     reliability. Some of the information we have received comes \n     from detainees, including some of high rank.\n       We have solid reporting of senior level contacts between \n     Iraq and al-Qaida going back a decade.\n\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\n\n  No relationship? According to the CIA, not true.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Credible information indicates that Iraq and al-Qaida have \n     discussed safe haven and reciprocal nonaggression.\n       Since Operation Enduring Freedom, we have solid evidence of \n     the presence in Iraq of al-Qaida members, including some that \n     have been in Baghdad.\n       We have credible reporting that al-Qaida leaders sought \n     contacts in Iraq who could help them acquire WMD \n     capabilities. The reporting also stated that Iraq has \n     provided training to al-Qaida members in the areas of poisons \n     and gases and making conventional bombs.\n       Iraq's increasing support to extremist Palestinians, \n     coupled with growing indications of a relationship with al-\n     Qaida, suggest that Baghdad's links to terrorists will \n     increase, even absent U.S. military action.\n\n  No relationship? No contacts? No connection? Read the intelligence \nreports.\n  What did the 9/11 Commission say? Quoting from Thomas Kean, cochair \nof the 9/11 Commission:\n\n       There was no question in our minds that there was a \n     relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda.\n\n  Let us get the facts straight. If we are going to come to the Senate \nfloor and charge the President of the United States with misinforming \nthe American people, we need not misinform them ourselves.\n  Quoting further from the 9/11 Commission report:\n\n       With the Sudanese regime acting as an intermediary, Bin \n     Ladin himself met with senior Iraqi intelligence officers in \n     Khartoum in late 1994 or early 1995. Bin Ladin is said to \n     have asked for space to establish training camps, as well as \n     assistance in procuring weapons, but there is no evidence \n     that Iraq responded to this request . . . [but] the ensuing \n     years saw additional efforts to establish connections.\n\n  That is from page 61 of the report. From page 66:\n\n       In March 1998, after Bin Ladin's public fatwa against the \n     United States, two Al Qaeda members reportedly went to Iraq \n     to meet with Iraqi intelligence. In July, an Iraqi delegation \n     traveled to Afghanistan to meet first with the Taliban and \n     then with Bin Ladin. Sources reported that one, or perhaps \n     both, of these meetings was apparently arranged through Bin \n     Ladin's Egyptian deputy, Zawahiri, who had ties of his own to \nthe Iraqis.\n\n  From page 66:\n\n       Similar meetings between Iraqi officials and Bin Ladin or \n     his aides may have occurred in 1999 during a period of some \n     reported strains with the Taliban. According to the \n     reporting, Iraqi officials offered Bin Ladin a safe haven in \n     Iraq. Bin Ladin declined, apparently judging that his \n     circumstance in Afghanistan remained more favorable than the \n     Iraqi alternative. The reports describe friendly contacts and \n     indicates some common themes in both sides' hatred of the \n     United States. But to date we have seen no evidence that \n     these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a \n     collaborative operational relationship. . . .\n\n  That is the critical distinction. We have to be careful of our \nlanguage, especially when we are accusing the President of the United \nStates of misleading the American people. Our language matters. The \nPresident never alleged an operational link or that Saddam Hussein \nhelped to plan the 9/11 attack on the United States, but there is \nplenty of evidence of connections between bin Laden, al-Qaida, other \nterrorists and Iraq and Saddam Hussein.\n  The Intelligence Committee report in July of this year reported:\n\n       [F]rom 1996 to 2003, the Iraqi Intelligence Service \n     ``focused its terrorist activities on Western interests, \n     particularly against the U.S. and Israel.\n\n  They go on to quote the letter from George Tenet that I quoted \nbefore.\n\n       [A]ccording to a CIA report called Iraqi Support for \n     Terrorism, ``the general pattern that emerges is one of al \n     Qaeda's enduring interest in acquiring chemical, biological, \n     radiological and nuclear (CBRN) expertise from Iraq.''\n\n  This is exactly what Senator McCain talked about a few weeks ago, \nwhat the President has talked about, what the Vice President has talked \nabout, our concern of this relationship that would some day, if we did \nnot act against Iraq, blossom into fullblooded support, full-blown \nsupport from Iraq to al-Qaida.\n  Finally:\n\n       [T]he Iraqi regime ``certainly'' had knowledge that Abu \n     Musab al Zarqawi--described in Iraqi Support for Terrorism as \n     ``a senior al Qaeda terrorist planner''--was operating in \n     Baghdad and northern Iraq.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times article of June 25, \n2004, which further makes this point, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 25, 2004]\n\n     Iraqis, Seeking Foes of Saudis, Contacted bin Laden, File Says\n\n                           (By Thom Shanker)\n\n       Contacts between Iraqi intelligence agents and Osama bin \n     Laden when he was in Sudan in the mid 1990's were part of a \n     broad effort by Baghdad to work with organizations opposing \n     the Saudi ruling family, according to a newly disclosed \n     document obtained by the Americans in Iraq.\n       American officials described the document as an internal \n     report by the Iraqi intelligence service detailing efforts to \n     seek cooperation with several Saudi opposition groups, \n     including Mr. bin Laden's organization, before Al Qaeda had \n     become a full-fledged terrorist organization. He was based in \n     Sudan from 1992 to 1996, when that country forced him to \n     leave and he took refuge in Afghanistan.\n       The document states that Iraq agreed to rebroadcast anti-\n     Saudi propaganda, and that a request from Mr. bin Laden to \n     begin joint operations against foreign forces in Saudi Arabia \n     went unanswered. There is no further indication of \n     collaboration.\n       Last week, the independent commission investigating the \n     Sept. 11 attacks addressed the known contacts between Iraq \n     and Al Qaeda, which have been cited by the White House as \n     evidence of a close relationship between the two.\n       The commission concluded that the contacts had not \n     demonstrated ``a collaborative relationship'' between Iraq \n     and Al Qaeda. The Bush administration responded that there \n     was considerable evidence of ties.\n       The new document, which appears to have circulated only \n     since April, was provided to The New York Times several weeks \n     ago, before the commission's report was released. Since \n     obtaining the document, The Times has interviewed several \n     military, intelligence and United States government officials \n     in Washington and Baghdad to determine that the government \n     considered it authentic.\n       The Americans confirmed that they had obtained the document \n     from the Iraqi National Congress, as part of a trove that the \n     group gathered after the fall of Saddam Hussein's \n     government last year. The Defense Intelligence Agency paid \n     the Iraqi National Congress for documents and other \n     information until recently, when the group and its leader, \n     Ahmad Chalabi, fell out of favor in Washington.\n       Some of the intelligence provided by the group is now \n     wholly discredited, although officials have called some of \n     the documents it helped to obtain useful.\n       A translation of the new Iraqi document was reviewed by a \n     Pentagon working group in the spring, officials said. It \n     included senior analysts from the military's Joint Staff, the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency and a joint intelligence task \n     force that specialized in counterterrorism issues, they said.\n       The task force concluded that the document ``appeared \n     authentic,'' and that it ``corroborates and expands on \n     previous reporting'' about contacts between Iraqi \n     intelligence and Mr. bin Laden in Sudan, according to the \n     task force's analysis.\n       It is not known whether some on the task force held \n     dissenting opinions about the document's veracity.\n       At the time of the contacts described in the Iraqi \n     document, Mr. bin Laden was little known beyond the world of \n     national security experts. It is now thought that his \n     associates bombed a hotel in Yemen used by American troops \n     bound for Somalia in 1992. Intelligence officials also \n     believe he played a role in training Somali fighters who \n     battled Army Rangers and Special Operations forces in \n     Mogadishu during the ``Black Hawk Down'' battle of 1993.\n       Iraq during that period was struggling with its defeat by \n     American-led forces in the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when \n     American troops used Saudi Arabia as the base for expelling \n     Iraqi invaders from Kuwait.\n       The document details a time before any of the spectacular \n     anti-American terrorist strikes attributed to Al Qaeda: the \n     two American Embassy bombings in East Africa in 1998, the \n     strike on the destroyer Cole in Yemeni waters in 2000, and \n     the Sept. 11 attacks.\n       The document, which asserts that Mr. bin Laden ``was \n     approached by our side,'' states that Mr. bin Laden \n     previously ``had some reservations about being labeled an \n     Iraqi operative,'' but was now willing to meet in Sudan, and \n     that ``presidential approval'' was granted to the Iraqi \n     security service to proceed.\n       At the meeting, Mr. bin Laden requested that sermons of an \n     anti-Saudi cleric be rebroadcast in Iraq. That request, the \n     document states, was approved by Baghdad.\n       Mr. bin Laden ``also requested joint operations against \n     foreign forces'' based in Saudi Arabia, where the American \n     presence has been a rallying cry for Islamic militants who \n     oppose American troops in the land of the Muslim pilgrimage \n     sites of Mecca and Medina.\n       But the document contains no statement of response by the \n     Iraqi leadership under Mr. Hussein to the request for joint \n     operations, and there is no indication of discussions about \n     attacks on the United States or the use of unconventional \n     weapons.\n\n[[Page S9873]]\n\n       The document is of interest to American officials as a \n     detailed, if limited, snapshot of communications between \n     Iraqi intelligence and Mr. bin Laden, but this view ends with \n     Mr. bin Laden's departure from Sudan. At that point, Iraqi \n     intelligence officers began ``seeking other channels through \n     which to handle the relationship, in light of his current \n     location,'' the document states.\n       Members of the Pentagon task force that reviewed the \n     document said it described no formal alliance being reached \n     between Mr. bin Laden and Iraqi intelligence. The Iraqi \n     document itself states that ``cooperation between the two \n     organizations should be allowed to develop freely through \n     discussion and agreement.''\n       The heated public debate over links between Mr. bin Laden \n     and the Hussein government fall basically into three \n     categories: the extent of communications and contacts between \n     the two, the level of actual cooperation, and any specific \n     collaboration in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n       The document provides evidence of communications between \n     Mr. bin Laden and Iraqi intelligence, similar to that \n     described in the Sept. 11 staff report released last week.\n       ``Bin Laden also explored possible cooperation with Iraq \n     during his time in Sudan, despite his opposition to Hussein's \n     secular regime,'' the Sept. 11 commission report stated.\n       The Sudanese government, the commission report added, \n     ``arranged for contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda.''\n       ``A senior Iraqi intelligence officer reportedly made three \n     visits to Sudan,'' it said, ``finally meeting bin Laden in \n     1994. Bin Laden is said to have requested space to establish \n     training camps, as well as assistance in procuring weapons, \n     but Iraq apparently never responded.''\n       The Sept. 11 commission statement said there were reports \n     of further contacts with Iraqi intelligence in Afghanistan \n     after Mr. bin Laden's departure from Sudan, ``but they do not \n     appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship,'' it \n     added.\n       After the Sept. 11 commission released its staff reports \n     last week, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney said \n     they remained convinced that Mr. Hussein's government had a \n     long history of ties to Al Qaeda.\n       ``This administration never said that the 9/11 attacks were \n     orchestrated between Saddam and Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Bush said. \n     ``We did say there were numerous contacts between Saddam \n     Hussein and Al Qaeda. For example, Iraqi intelligence \n     officers met with bin Laden, the head of Al Qaeda, in the \n     Sudan. There's numerous contacts between the two.''\n       It is not clear whether the commission knew of this \n     document. After its report was released, Mr. Cheney said he \n     might have been privy to more information than the commission \n     had; it is not known whether any further information has \n     changed hands.\n       A spokesman for the Sept. 11 commission declined to say \n     whether it had seen the Iraqi document, saying its policy was \n     not to discuss its sources.\n       The Iraqi document states that Mr. bin Laden's organization \n     in Sudan was called ``The Advice and Reform Commission.'' The \n     Iraqis were cued to make their approach to Mr. bin Laden in \n     1994 after a Sudanese official visited Uday Hussein, the \n     leader's son, as well as the director of Iraqi intelligence, \n     and indicated that Mr. bin Laden was willing to meet in \n     Sudan.\n       A former director of operations for Iraqi intelligence \n     Directorate 4 met with Mr. bin Laden on Feb. 19 1995, the \n     document states.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I note, concluding with this point, that Abdul Yasim and Abu \nNidal were harbored in Iraq. The Taliban did not directly involve \nitself in 9/11 or have weapons of mass destruction either, but it \nharbored people like this and that is one reason we went after the \nTaliban and Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.\n  With regard to the connections between Iraq and al-Qaida, the case is \nvery clear that they were there and the President stands correct, and I \nhope the Senator from Massachusetts would stand corrected.\n  Finally, as to the suggestion that Iraq was a diversion from \nsucceeding in Afghanistan, that we have not finished the job there, we \nwere very successful in defeating the Taliban and killing a lot of al-\nQaida and capturing a lot of al-Qaida in Afghanistan, and in \nestablishing a regime there which will be holding elections. Karzai \nmade it very clear when he came to this country and expressed his \nappreciation, just as did Prime Minister Allawi of Iraq, to American \nforces for helping to provide the Afghanis with enough freedom to \ncontrol their own future. I think there is confusion that the only al-\nQaida are on the border between Afghan and Pakistan, and since we have \nnot captured every single one of them, including Osama bin Laden, \ntherefore our activities in Iraq are responsible for this fact. There \nhas been no evidence of that. As a matter of fact, our military \ncommanders make the point it is not true, that Iraq was not a diversion \nfrom anything we had to do in Afghanistan where we were very effective \nand successful.\n  To those who convey this sense of panic, that all is going bad, the \nopposite of that is not those of us who support the President's policy \nsaying everything is rosy. I do not know that anybody has ever used \nthat phrase. If they have, I would like to see it. The President has \nsaid repeatedly that this is a long and difficult war and it is going \nto require a great deal of perseverance and commitment by the American \npeople. But as contrasted by those who create the sense of panic, the \nPresident has a vision and the President's commanders have a strategy. \nWhen I saw General Abizaid on television last Sunday, he didn't paint a \nrosy picture. He painted a very realistic assessment. But he also \nportrayed a calm confidence that if we can persevere we can prevail.\n  That is what he asked of the American people, to allow the military \ncommanders as well as the Commander in Chief to carry out the vision to \ndefeat the militant Islamic terrorists wherever they are. As I said, \nthey are not only in Afghanistan; they are all over the world including \nprimarily in the Middle East. That is why this war has many fronts. It \nis not just Afghanistan. We fought simultaneously to try to gain \nsupport from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Libyan regime, and from Syria. \nWe did what we did in Afghanistan. We have done what we have done in \nIraq. There are still some places to go, but we have also been in Yemen \nand Sudan, and so on.\n  The bottom line here is you can't isolate one place in the world and \nsay we have to do that first and win every possible goal there before \nwe can do anything else anywhere else. The President has made it clear \nthat by going to one of the chief sources of terrorism, namely Iraq, we \ncan help to win this war.\n  The fact that there was such a connection between the terrorists--\nbetween al-Qaida and the Iraqi regime--is I think validated by the fact \nthat they have been able to so successfully continue to attack \nAmericans and American forces in Iraq.\n  Let's consider that the military commanders just might know what they \nare talking about, No. 1. No. 2, it does no good to wring our hands and \npaint a picture of panic. Realistic assessments, absolutely; truth to \nthe American people, absolutely; but leadership that presents a vision \nand a strategy for winning the wider war on terrorism, that is what the \nPresident has provided. That is why I am very proud to support \nPresident Bush's efforts in this regard. 3\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9873-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2845, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2845) to reform the intelligence community and \n     the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the \n     U.S. Government, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Wyden Amendment No. 3704, to establish an Independent \n     National Security Classification Board in the executive \n     branch.\n       Collins Amendment No. 3705, to provide for homeland \n     security grant coordination and simplification.\n       Specter Amendment No. 3706, to provide the National \n     Intelligence Director with the authority to supervise, \n     direct, and control all elements of the intelligence \n     community performing national intelligence missions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the debate now will resume on the \namendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. As discussed last \nnight, we have an informal agreement that Senator Roberts would be \nrecognized for--is it 25 minutes, I ask Senator Roberts?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thought the agreement was 30.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I could not hear the Senator from Maine. She \nsaid there had been an order that the Senator be recognized?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I can respond to the Democratic \nleader's inquiry, there was an informal discussion\n\n[[Page S9874]]\n\nlast night. There was not an order entered, to the best of my \nknowledge, but an informal agreement that Senator Roberts would be \nrecognized, and it was either 25 or 30 minutes. I am uncertain.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the distinguished chairman will yield, I am not sure \nof the timeframe. I think my remarks will be approximately 30 minutes. \nI hope they will not go over 30 minutes. But that would be my goal.\n  Mr. REID. My only inquiry here is, Senator Harkin wishes to speak for \n10 minutes sometime. We recognize we should have gotten to the bill \nearlier than we have, but we didn't, and now with the dialog that has \ngone on Senator Harkin believes he needs to speak, so we need to \nsomehow figure a way to allow him to do that.\n  The Senator from Maine has the floor. We understand that. But is \nthere some way between the two managers we can get Senator Harkin some \ntime here this morning? Otherwise he is just going to hang around and \ncause trouble.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I could complete my sequencing here. \nAfter Senator Roberts, Senator Levin had asked to be recognized on the \nSpecter amendment. They were both here last night, so I want to respect \ntheir requests as well.\n  I wonder if we could arrange for Senator Harkin to speak after the \nfirst series of votes today, for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. After the first vote today I ask unanimous \nconsent Senator Harkin be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Stevens to follow Senator Harkin.\n  Ms. COLLINS. As part of that sequencing, it would be 10 minutes for \nSenator Harkin and 10 minutes for Senator Stevens--oh, I am sorry. \nSenator Stevens is on the bill?\n  Mr. REID. It would be 15 minutes for Stevens, 15 for Harkin? Or \nunlimited for Stevens?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Senator Stevens is going to be speaking on the bill so \nhe has asked for an unlimited amount of time.\n  Mr. REID. We understand Senator Stevens, being the President pro \ntempore of the Senate, can speak as long as he wants. Again I repeat, \nafter the first vote Senator Harkin will be recognized for 15 minutes, \nand then Senator Stevens will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3706\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Specter \namendment. Before I begin, I would like to commend the managers of the \nbill, Senators Collins and Lieberman, for their extraordinary patience \nand their hard work as we continue working through this process. \nSenators Collins and Lieberman are very prominent and hard-working \nSenators. They have been given a very tough assignment and a limited \ntimeframe in which to complete it. Nevertheless, they have produced a \nbill which is a step in the right direction.\n  As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I look forward to \nworking with the Senators who serve on the committee of assignment by \nthe leadership as the Senate attempts to make intelligence reform a \nreality.\n  Simply put, the Specter amendment would give the national \nintelligence director, or what we call now the NID, the authority to \ndirect and supervise and control our national intelligence collection \nagencies. In doing so, it will create a clear chain of command that \nwill leave no doubt in anybody's mind that the national intelligence \ndirector is in charge and is accountable.\n  There is no rush to judgment on this issue. The debate in which we \nare currently engaged is the same debate that has been going on for \ndecades, centered on how to grant increased authority to the Director \nof Central Intelligence, or a new national intelligence director, while \nleaving undisturbed the intelligence community's structural status quo. \nTime and time again, those who have struggled with this conundrum have \nfound we simply can't get there from here under that context. In other \nwords, I believe it takes significant organizational change to overcome \nthe inherent conflicts in the current structure of our national \nintelligence community.\n  True empowerment requires a national intelligence director with both \nbudget authority and the authority to direct and control the activities \nof the intelligence collection agencies. One without the other will \nonce again leave us with an intelligence head who can neither succeed \nnor be held fully accountable.\n  Let me state that the bill reported by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee does address the question of budget authority very \neffectively. It is significant and well contained. The bill leaves \nunaddressed, however, the issue of the national intelligence director's \nauthority to direct, to supervise, and control the activities of our \nnational intelligence collection agencies.\n  In short, the bill, in my opinion, preserves divided loyalties \ninherent in the current structure. Why is it so difficult to give this \nnew NID direct control over all of the intelligence community agencies? \nIt is no secret. The issue centers on the fact that the National \nReconnaissance Office, which designs and acquires our spy satellites, \nthe National Security Agency, which collects our signal intelligence, \nand the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, which processes and \ndisseminates our satellite imagery, all fall under the direct control \nof the Secretary of Defense.\n  These agencies, while essential to the collection of national \nintelligence, have also been deemed essential to the Pentagon's ability \nto fight and to win wars. In essence, these agencies serve two masters: \nThe head of the intelligence community and the Secretary of Defense. \nThis tension has existed for decades, and it continues today. As long \nas the Secretary of Defense directs the day-to-day activities of these \nagencies, the new national intelligence director will continue to \nstruggle with a structure that undermines his ability to succeed as the \nhead of the intelligence community.\n  It appears to me that under today's bill the national intelligence \ndirector's authority concerning collection will be about the same as \nthe DCI's has been for over 50 years. I do not mean to be a pessimist, \nbut history has shown in practice that these authorities to ``establish \nrequirements,'' ``manage the collection task,'' and ``resolve the \nconflicts'' have limited ability when an agency works with the \nSecretary of Defense and not for the head of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Why has it been so difficult to streamline the chain of command in \nthe intelligence community? Because when the Defense Department comes \nup on the radar screen and announces to Congress and the media that its \nability to defend America will be undermined if it loses direct control \nover its intelligence agencies, Members of Congress rightfully pause \nand they certainly take note. This is especially true today when \nAmerican forces are engaged in combat. This, however, should not lead \nto what we call paralysis.\n  During this debate, we have heard a great deal about support to our \ndedicated, brave men and women in uniform, i.e., the warfighters. Many \nof my colleagues have argued and will continue to argue that the \nnational intelligence director must not be allowed to direct and \nsupervise the control of activities of our national intelligence \ncollection agencies. In their view, granting such an authority would \nundermine the Secretary of Defense's ability to fight and win wars. For \nthis to be true, the national intelligence director would have to deny \nour military commanders the information they need to wage war. I cannot \nconceive of any circumstance where that would be the case.\n\n  I am a member of the Armed Services Committee. I am a former Marine \nofficer. I would not sanction any legislation that I thought would \nlimit the ability of our troops to fight and to win wars. I recognize \nthe special requirements of the Department of Defense. As chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, I also know that the Department of Defense \nis only one of the major consumers of intelligence. Important, yes; \nmajor, yes; but one.\n  I often hear people referring to the Department of Defense as the \nprincipal consumer of intelligence. While the Department is a \nsignificant and important consumer of intelligence, we need\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\nto remember one thing: The principal consumers of intelligence are the \nPresident of the United States, the Congress, and the National Security \nCouncil. They are the principal consumers. The Department of Defense is \na major consumer.\n  In time, the Department of Homeland Security is likely to become a \nvoracious consumer of intelligence, perhaps on a par with the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I do not believe the defense of the homeland is any less important \nthan prosecuting the war. Consequently it does not make sense to have \n80 percent of our intelligence collection apparatus controlled by one \nconsumer, and that is the Department of Defense.\n  If we give the national intelligence director the authority to manage \nall of the national collection agencies, that will ensure one office is \nresponsible and accountable for meeting the intelligence requirements \nof all consumers including, of course, that of the Department of \nDefense. If any Cabinet member believes their intelligence requirements \nare not being met, he or she can address the issues to the national \nintelligence director. If a Cabinet member does not agree with NID's \ndecision, they can take it up with the President of the United States.\n  I also note that in testimony before Congress, the directors of two \nof the Pentagon's intelligence collection agencies--the National \nSecurity Agency and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency--stated \nthat having their agencies transferred to the control of a national \nintelligence director would not degrade their level of support to the \nmilitary.\n  Let me repeat that. The directors of two of the Pentagon's \nintelligence collection agencies--the National Security Agency and the \nNational Geospatial Intelligence Agency--stated that having their \nagencies transferred to the control of a national intelligence director \nwould not degrade their level of support to the military.\n  Additionally, some have argued that giving the national intelligence \ndirector line control of agencies with uniformed military personnel \nwould be complicated. There will certainly be some issues to be \nresolved, to be sure. But the Department of Defense regularly details \nmilitary personnel to agencies and offices outside of the Department of \nDefense. We would not be breaking new ground here. We have had civilian \ncontrol of the military since the founding of this Nation, and I don't \nsee how civilian control by a national intelligence director is \nqualitatively different than civilian control by the Secretary of \nDefense. They both work for the President.\n\n  There has been a lot of talk about that fact in regard to meetings we \nhave had with people in uniform and the Secretary of Defense and a \ncertain Senator asking, How would you feel if your budget was \ncontrolled by somebody who didn't wear a uniform? Well, the Secretary \nof Defense doesn't wear a uniform. When the military appears before the \nCongress, they don't wear a uniform. Neither does the Secretary of \nArmy, Navy, or Air Force wear a uniform.\n  Let me detail a few examples to illustrate why direct control is so \nimportant to the success of the national intelligence director.\n  As recently as last week--I would like for Members to pay attention \nto this--as recently as last week, the Senate Intelligence Committee \nreceived a very troubling briefing in closed session that clearly \ndemonstrated that even on matters relating to the terrorist threat to \nour homeland, today, now, the terrorist threat that we face, the \nintelligence agencies still stubbornly refuse to adequately share \ninformation. Why are these agencies still not sharing? Some progress \nhas been made. But why are they still not sharing? Is it because the \nDCI doesn't have adequate budget authority? No. They don't share it \nbecause they work for 15 different bosses and no one holds them \naccountable for information sharing. The national intelligence director \ncan cajole, he can plead, he can consult all he wants; he can \npromulgate policies and guidelines all day long. He can create grand, \ntrusted information networks. But without a national intelligence \ndirector with direct control, there will be no one to force adequate \ninformation sharing within the intelligence community.\n  Let us take another example.\n  We have all heard former DCI Tenet's now famous declaration of war \nagainst al-Qaida in 1998. Mr. Tenet ordered that no resource was to be \nspared in this critical effort. He declared war as a result of Osama \nbin Laden issuing fatwas to kill Americans.\n\n  What happened as a result of this bold order? Not much. The National \nSecurity Agency went its own way, saying: Thank you, Mr. DCI, for your \ninterest in national security, but we are going to retool for a threat \nthat has nothing to do with terrorism.\n  What would have happened if Mr. Tenet had the authorities granted to \nthe national intelligence director under the Collins-Lieberman bill \nwhen he made his 1998 declaration? He might have said: We are at war, \nand the NSA will see that reflected in the budget you will receive in \nthe next year or so, assuming Congress does not make any changes to it. \nThat is budget authority. That is the crowbar he would use in terms of \ninfluence. However, with the authorities to direct, supervise, and \ncontrol, which are provided in the Specter amendment, Mr. Tenet would \nhave been able to order the NSA to stop retooling for the other threat, \nget to work that day, focus their efforts on al-Qaida. In the 21st \ncentury, threats evolve too quickly to wait a year or so for the \nnational intelligence director's budget change to have any effect. The \nNID must have direct control in order to make immediate changes.\n  The bill before the Senate today is a significant step in the right \ndirection. Credit goes to Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman. There \nare many good provisions in the bill which should improve the \nintelligence community, but it is missing something very important--a \nclear chain of command and accountability.\n  As the examples I have cited demonstrate, a clear chain of command \nand accountability that comes with it are essential to real and lasting \nreform. If we do not make the hard choices now, I fear after yet \nanother series of intelligence failures--and Lord knows I do not want \nto sit as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and have any more ``Oh \nmy God'' hearings in regard to past tragedies from Khobar Towers to \nembassy bombings to the Khartoum chemical plant to the failure to even \ntry to come as close as possible to predicting the India nuclear blast, \nSomalia, the USS Cole, and obviously September 11. We do not want to go \nback down that road.\n  I fear the Senate Intelligence Committee will be right back in its \nhearing room listening to the newly minted national intelligence \ndirector testify while he enjoys a great deal of budget authority he \nstill lacks the real authority to perform the day-to-day operations of \nour intelligence agencies and therefore lacks ability to lead as we \nexpect and as he must. I urge my colleagues to support the Specter \namendment so there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the national \nintelligence director is in charge and is accountable.\n  I will take a few more moments to comment on some of the debate I \nhave heard concerning this amendment. This is not a new debate. What I \nheard in the Senate yesterday and today represents an age-old tension \nthat has existed since the intelligence community was created.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Would the Senator yield briefly for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Certainly, I would be more than happy, in the middle of \nshining the light of truth into darkness, to yield for a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I apologize for interrupting the Senator. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that the only amendments remaining to the bill \nother than the pending amendments be the two lists I now send to the \ndesk; provided further that they be subject to second degrees that are \nrelated to the subject matter of the first degree; further, that all \nother provisions governing the consideration of this bill remain in \neffect.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, would the distinguished \nchairwoman repeat that unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, basically what we have done, we now have a \nfinite list of amendments. The two cloakrooms have hotlined every \nSenator, and we have, I am sorry to say, more than 200 amendments, but \nthat is\n\n[[Page S9876]]\n\nthe finite list, and the Senator from Pennsylvania is on the list.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: For how many amendments am I on \nthe list?\n  Mr. REID. Seven.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Seven plus the pending amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, may I ask if the 21 \namendments I have drafted, amendments that would improve the nature of \nthe bill, are they included in that list?\n  Ms. COLLINS. They are indeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me to make a \nstatement as to what we are going to do here for a minute, I will be \nvery brief.\n  The two leaders have directed the two managers of the bill that the \nnext step will be to get a filing deadline. Hopefully that will be in \nthe next few hours. We may not be able to do it until tomorrow, but we \nare working as quickly as we can to make sure amendments people have \nsubmitted will be drafted.

What I heard in the Senate yesterday in regard to \ncomments on this debate represents an age-old tension that has existed \nsince the intelligence community was created.\n  Members heard numerous quotes from statutes such as title 10, title \n50. The heart of this debate, however, is whether we will give an \nindividual unambiguous control of intelligence activities in the United \nStates. We can quote from the United States Code all day. The point is \nthe laws could be changed. That is what we do in the Congress. The \ndebate today is about what the law should be, not what the law is. \nArguing the status quo is convenient, but it is not always correct.\n  This bill gives the new national intelligence director one very good \ntool. It is called budget authority. It does not give him control. The \nSpecter amendment gives the national intelligence director control, \nwhich means accountability and real reform.\n  As we have debated this issue, I have heard many Members cite the \nwords and reported opinions of the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission \nhas done a great service to this country, but the Commissioners \nthemselves have made it clear they do not have all the answers.\n  The 9/11 Commission did produce an excellent study of the failures \nleading\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\nup to the attacks of September 11. The Governmental Affairs Committee \nbill is faithful to the lessons the Commission drew from its work. It \nis an excellent report. But I remind my colleagues that the \nCommission's report was based on a single case study--the period \nleading up to the attacks of September 11. However, a broader \nhistorical examination of our intelligence community leads many--\nincluding this Senator--to the important conclusion that over the last \n50 years, the intelligence community has drifted due to the lack of or \nabsence of a clear chain of command and the lack of accountability that \na clear chain of command can bring. That clear chain of command \nrequires giving the national intelligence director the authority to \ndirect, to control, and to supervise our national collection agencies.\n  Our job is not to take the work of the 9/11 Commission as a sacred \ntext which is not to be questioned or altered; our job is to take their \nwork and integrate it with the lessons learned over the 50-plus years \nof history of our intelligence community and nearly 30 years of \ncongressional oversight by the Intelligence Committee. As the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has pointed out, his amendment incorporates many of \nthose lessons.\n  Yesterday, I also heard Members argue that the Specter amendment \nwould create confusing chains of command for the National Security \nAgency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency, and the intelligence collection elements of the \nDefense Intelligence Agency. I respectfully disagree.\n  In addition to providing the national intelligence director with the \nauthority to direct, supervise, and control these agencies, the Specter \namendment clarifies other provisions of law to specifically address \nthis concern. It amends title 10 and title 50, adds two new provisions \nto the law to specifically clarify that the Directors, again, of the \nNational Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the intelligence \ncollection elements of the Defense Intelligence Agency report directly \nto the national intelligence director.\n  While this amendment gives the national intelligence director direct \ncontrol over these agencies, they remain ``combat support agencies''--\nnobody quarrels with that--and the Secretary of Defense will still have \ninfluence over them. That is by design. No one is trying to change \nthat. I think it is much better than the bill's current language in \nwhich the Secretary of Defense has direct control of these agencies, \nand the NID only has influence and persuasion. I can tell you from past \nhistory, influence and persuasion do not get you very far at the \nPentagon.\n\n  Some have argued that only the Secretary of Defense can manage the \ncombat support agencies. Some argue that only if the Secretary of \nDefense manages the Pentagon's national intelligence collection \nagencies will the warfighter receive adequate support. This is a \nfallacy. As I said earlier, there is no reason to believe the Defense \nDepartment will not receive the support it needs if the Pentagon's \nnational intelligence collection agencies report to the national \nintelligence director.\n  The amendment provides the Secretary of Defense with important \nfeedback mechanisms to make sure the Department is getting the national \nintelligence support it needs.\n  First, the Secretary of Defense is required to provide the national \nintelligence director with some performance appraisals for the \ndirectors of the national intelligence collection agencies. Second, the \nnational intelligence director will receive recommendations from the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff based upon a biannual review of \nthe combat support plans for the National Security Agency; again, the \nNational Reconnaissance Office; again, the National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency; and the DIA, again, the Defense Intelligence \nAgency.\n  Working with the Secretary of Defense through these feedback \nmechanisms, the national intelligence director will ensure that the \nDefense Department's intelligence needs are met. Clearly, this \namendment recognizes the important support role these agencies play to \nthe Department of Defense in its role as an intelligence consumer.\n  Now, I also heard the argument yesterday that giving the national \nintelligence director direction, supervision, and control of the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is a bad idea because that \nagency is responsible for making maps. I point out that this agency \nused to be named the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, but they \nchanged its name to signal a change in the manner in which it would \nperform its mission.\n  The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or the NGA, uses \nintelligence data acquired by satellites and other means and melds that \ndata into the maps that our entire Government uses. This is what is now \ncalled geospatial intelligence. The maps we use have the full benefit \nof the intelligence data we gather all around the world. Mapmaking is \nnot inconsistent with the national intelligence director's mission.\n  Another argument heard yesterday against the Specter amendment was \nthat the 9/11 Commission had considered granting the NID direction, \nsupervision, and control authorities but rejected the idea on the \ngrounds that the duties of managing these agencies would overload the \nnational intelligence director. However, I note that the Secretary of \nDefense controls the military services, the Reserves, the unified \ncommands, the defense agencies, field activities, literally millions of \nuniformed and civilian personnel, and those who mow the yard outside \nthe Pentagon.\n  So if I understand correctly, in order not to overburden the national \nintelligence director, we will leave the national intelligence \ncollection agencies under the control of an already extremely busy and, \nI might add, effective Secretary of Defense. This logic escapes me.\n\n  I also heard an argument that the \n9/11 Commission had rejected granting the national intelligence \ndirector greater authorities because the Commissioners preferred what \nwas described on the Senate floor as a ``lean, mean modern corporate \nstructure.''\n  I ask my colleagues, What successful modern corporation would not \ngive its chairman and CEO the authority to direct, supervise, and \ncontrol every component of the organization for which he or she was \nheld accountable by the shareholders? We should not confuse direction, \nsupervision, and control with micromanagement.\n  I also heard the argument that the Specter amendment would promote \ngroup-think within the intelligence community. Well, I can tell you \nthat the Senate Intelligence Committee wrote the book on the occurrence \nof group-think in its report on the prewar assessments on Iraq's WMD \nprograms.\n  It is a problem that we on the committee watch very carefully every \nweek, almost every day. I do not believe the Specter amendment will \npromote any kind of group-think. I would be concerned about the risk of \ngroup-think if we were proposing to grant the national intelligence \ndirector the authority to direct, supervise, and control the analytical \ncontent of our national analytical agencies. That is not what Senator \nSpecter's amendment proposes. It proposes direction, supervision, and \ncontrol over the Department of Defense's national intelligence \ncollection agencies.\n  Additionally, as was seen in the committee's examination of the \nprewar assessments--as I say, it took us over a year, 22 professional \nstaff members; we interviewed over 220 analysts--the creation of a \nstrong national intelligence director will prevent group-think in the \nintelligence community. A strong director will ensure a level playing \nfield in which the analysis of all agencies will be given full \nconsideration and equal consideration based upon the quality of the \nanalysis when intelligence community assessments are being developed. \nIf anyone has studied the committee's Iraq report--and I encourage \nSenators to read it, 511 pages--they know that the lack of a level \nplaying field was a major problem.\n  Mr. President, with that I am going to conclude my remarks. I urge \nMembers to support the Specter amendment.\n  The Specter amendment has been described as a ``bridge too far.'' \nThis well-known term is a product of the tragic Battle of Arnhem, \nHolland, in 1944.\n  Many historians see the tragedy of Arnhem as a combination of errors, \ni.e., the undertaking, for some political\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\nreasons, of an ill-advised military campaign opposed by American \ncommanders; i.e., and a massive intelligence gap that failed to detect \na large concentration of German armor in the area.\n  Mr. President, the ``bridge too far'' analogy is apt, but it cuts in \nfavor of the Specter amendment. We must not, for political reasons, \nfail to make the hard decisions that are necessary to ensure a strong, \nin-charge national intelligence director.\n  These decisions are difficult. They are hard. But these decisions are \ncritically needed. The changes we make today have one overarching goal: \nto prevent another intelligence failure on the order of Arnhem and \nSeptember 11. Because of those failures, the allies suffered 17,000 \ncasualties and, obviously, on September 11, 3,000 died.\n  Failure to approve the Specter amendment may be seen by historians as \na tragic half-measure that led to another Arnhem or another September \n11.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond \nimmediately follow me in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n  I rise today to support the amendment offered by Senator Specter. \nThis amendment has the support of Senators Specter, Shelby, and \nRoberts--two former chairmen of the Intelligence Committee, as well as \nthe current chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. I \nhave had the pleasure to work closely with these colleagues, and I \nrespect their experience and their independent thinking on intelligence \nmatters.\n  This amendment is also cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators \nfrom the Intelligence Committee. This amendment establishes the goals \nset forth by 14 Senators who addressed a letter to Chairman Collins and \nSenator Lieberman on September 20, 2004, in which they sought to ensure \nthat the national intelligence director has the ability to control the \nday-to-day operations of all of our national intelligence assets.\n  I consider myself privileged to serve as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee during these difficult and historic times. Yet I can also say \nthat during these years I have heard too many excuses for intelligence \nfailures. I have seen firsthand the damage that comes when the head of \nthe intelligence community lacks the ability to effectively lead our \nnational intelligence agencies.\n  The chairman and the ranking minority member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee have taken on a monumental task, for which I am \ngrateful. They have been charged with writing a bill that modifies the \nNational Security Act of 1947, to give the national intelligence \ndirector greater budget control and stronger authority to manage the \nintelligence community. This task, as we all know, has been extremely \ncomplicated.\n  It is particularly difficult when one considers the broad authorities \nthat the National Security Act of 1947 already granted to the Director \nof Central Intelligence, as head of the intelligence community.\n  Under that act, the DCI was given substantial authority to develop a \nbudget for national intelligence activities, to set election \nrequirements and priorities, and to direct intelligence analysis. The \nIntelligence Committee has observed over time, however, that the DCIs \ncannot exercise their authorities because they do not have actual \ncontrol over the operations of the national intelligence agencies. This \nis because the National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance \nOffice, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency report \noperationally to the Secretary of Defense, and DCIs have had to \nnegotiate and cajole to ensure that their operational initiatives were \nmet. As a result, to keep from hindering this day-in/day-out \nnegotiation, DCIs were unable to effectively exercise their broad \nbudget authorities.\n  There is no greater example in my eyes--or at least modern example--\nthan in 1998, when former DCI George Tenet recognized that we needed to \ndirect all of our intelligence resources to defeating al-Qaida. This \nwas his famous ``declaration of war'' against al-Qaida, and he declared \nthat no resource of intelligence would be spared to defeat al-Qaida. He \nwas ignored by the intelligence community that he was in charge of \nleading.\n  For example, the National Security Agency retooled for a different \nsignals intelligence mission, not for the war on al-Qaida. We simply \ncannot ignore this example of unused DCI authorities. We cannot forget \nthe lessons of past intelligence failures. I am concerned that the best \nintentions of the Governmental Affairs legislation will never be \nfulfilled and that the good authorities granted to the national \nintelligence director under the legislation will never be effectively \nexercised.\n  The debate we are having today about the authorities of the national \nintelligence director versus the Secretary of Defense has occurred in \nthis town over and over again since the National Security Act was first \npassed back in 1947. As the intelligence community grew, the \nauthorities of the Director of Central Intelligence were diluted as the \nSecretary of Defense gained a greater share of control over our \nintelligence agencies.\n  We have a unique opportunity in the next few weeks to establish a \nstructure that puts someone truly in charge of our national \nintelligence mission. I think we have to take this opportunity to \nclarify the confused chains of command that have handcuffed past \nDirectors of Central Intelligence.\n  With a national intelligence director empowered to ``supervise, \ndirect and control'' our national collection assets, we will implement \nreal reform, not just establish another bureaucratic level and finally \nhave one person who is actually accountable to the President and to \nCongress. Only with the Specter amendment's clear chains of command \nwill we give the national intelligence director the authorities \nnecessary to meet his vast responsibilities.\n  Some will argue that the Specter amendment goes too far; that it is \njust too hard to separate the NSA, NRO, and NGA from the Department of \nDefense; that it will hinder intelligence support for the warfighters. \nThe argument made has not been compelling. Why are clear chains of \ncommand a bridge too far, as some have suggested? That is a clear \nimage, but it does not illuminate the argument. Why should we rely on a \nmishmash of budget and personnel controls to put a national \nintelligence director nominally in charge when we know that real \ncontrol and accountability will only come with a clear chain of command \nto the director? We have all been saying that for months and so has the \n9/11 Commission. Why are we talking about current provisions of law to \nshow that these combat support agencies can't be separated from the \nDefense Department?\n\n  Let's not let arguments about current law confuse the issue. We are \ntalking about putting a national intelligence director in charge. We \nare debating a bill that would change current law. If the Specter \namendment requires, we can accommodate other necessary provisions.\n  Finally, no one believes that the NSA, NRO, NGA, and DIA would stop \nsupporting the warfighter if this amendment is enacted. Really, does \nanybody? The answer to that is no. If I believed that, I would not \nsupport this amendment. Why would a national intelligence director turn \noff the intelligence support upon which our warfighters rely so much? I \nhave never known a DCI to do such a thing. No national intelligence \ndirector would ever shortchange the warfighter. No President or \nCongress would ever permit that. In fact, the Specter amendment \nrecognizes the unique position of the Department of Defense as an \nintelligence consumer--giving the Secretary of Defense the right to \nprepare annual performance evaluations for the Directors of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, the NRO, NSA, NGA, and DIA, and maintaining the \nJoint Chiefs biannual review of the combat support plans of the NRO, \nNSA, NGA, and DIA.\n  What the Specter amendment does not do is maintain the current \nconfused chains of command for the national intelligence collectors \nwithin the Department of Defense. The Specter amendment recognizes that \naccountability and effective management are only possible with clear \nchains of\n\n[[Page S9879]]\n\ncommand. The blunt tool of budget control is not an effective mechanism \nfor flexible midcourse corrections in intelligence collection that a \nnational intelligence director must be able to make, without having to \nnegotiate or consult for his or her priorities.\n  If the confused chains of command of the status quo are an effective \nmechanism for control, we should ask the Secretary of Defense if budget \ncontrol would be sufficient for him to ``coordinate'' a war. If the \nSecretary of Defense only controlled the Army's budget, would that be \nsufficient command of the Third Infantry Division? If he only \ncontrolled the Navy's budget, could he order an aircraft carrier from \none ocean to another and expect it to move? If the answers to those \nquestions are no, then why should we settle for anything less than full \ndirection, supervision, and control of national intelligence collection \nfor the national intelligence director?\n  I support the Specter amendment. I know everybody on this floor is \nsincerely trying to resolve these problems as best they can. I commend \nthe distinguished committee for the work it has done in bringing this \nbill to the floor and the two leaders on the floor. But I think we \nshould support the Specter amendment. I urge all my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and appreciate the words \nof my colleagues.\n  In spite of years of recognition that intelligence was in dire need \nof reform, the catalyst of this year's reform initiative was the \ntragedy of September 11, 2001. The intelligence failure of Iraq's WMD \nprograms only underscores this point.\n  I applaud many of the provisions of the Collins-Lieberman bill. \nHowever, I stand in support of the Specter amendment as a means to \nprovide absolutely essential powers to the national intelligence \ndirector. For those who may just happen to be listening for the first \ntime, the national intelligence director is now known as the NID. But \nthis NID must have powers to bring together fully and effectively our \nnational collection efforts.\n  In spite of my respect and admiration for the efforts of my \ncolleagues, I remind the Senate that now is the time for bold action. \nThis deliberative body must be prepared to stare down very powerful \nexecutive branch bureaucracies--and a few of our own--that are \ninstinctively protecting their turf. Three thousand dead Americans \nshould be a message to all of us that we must make significant changes.\n  A witness before the Senate Intelligence Committee put it well. She \nsaid:\n\n       History's lesson is to make the most of reform \n     opportunities when they arise because they do not arise often \n     and they do not last long. We have one of those rare windows \n     of opportunity now. And if the past is any guide, there will \n     not be another chance for a generation. These realities mean \n     that reforms should be sweeping because they will be lasting. \n     The choices we make will be with us for decades to come.\n\n  I fear we are not being as bold in the underlying bill as \ncircumstances demand. We all agree that the 9/11 Commission published a \ngreat report outlining in detail the events of September 11, 2001.\n  We could not and we should not detract from their efforts. However, \none fundamental concern I have in this is that it is now 3 years after \n9/11, and we are only now taking action, largely based on the \nrecommendation of a panel not specifically chartered to focus on the \nintelligence failures leading to 9/11.\n  I am concerned that a commission directed by law to investigate the \n``facts and circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001,'' has become the only basis for intelligence \nreform.\n  Well, there is a lot of work that has been going on in this body and \nin the other body about intelligence reform that is not covered in the \n9/11 report.\n  Just since the end of the Cold War, there have been many major \nstudies of intelligence reform, staffed by intelligence professionals. \nThey include the joint Senate/House inquiry into 9/11, the Aspin-Brown \nCommission, IC21 study, the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence study, the Scowcroft review, and many others.\n  As I listen to the debate on this Collins-Lieberman bill, I am \nconcerned that the truly meritorious recommendations and thoughts from \nthese other commissions have been largely disregarded. Rather, I seem \nto hear--behind most of the key provisions in the bill--the rationale \nthat ``the 9/11 Commission said so.'' Well, we do respect and take \nseriously the work of the 9/11 Commission, but we must be sure that we \nconsider the other recommendations of studies specifically examining \nthe intelligence process. I happen to think that many of those are more \naccurately reflective of the needs of the intelligence community.\n  Recommendation No. 1, from the joint Senate/House inquiry into the 9/\n11 intelligence failure was:\n\n       Congress should amend the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     create and sufficiently staff a statutory director of \n     national intelligence who shall be the President's principal \n     advisor on intelligence and shall have the full range of \n     management, budgetary, and personnel responsibilities needed \n     to make the entire U.S. intelligence community operate as a \n     coherent whole.\n\n  The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's staff study \nentitled, ``IC21,'' or ``Intelligence Community in the 21st Century,'' \nstated:\n\n       The [intelligence community] would benefit greatly from a \n     more corporate approach to its basic functions. Central \n     management should be strengthened, core competencies \n     (collection, analysis, and operations) should be reinforced \n     and infrastructure should be consolidated wherever possible.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission's Vice Chairman, Lee Hamilton, for whom I have a \ngreat deal of respect, admitted to our committee in open session that \nthey really had not even considered more bold reform. He said the \nCommission simply looked at things they thought they could accomplish. \nI believe the word he may have used was ``pragmatic.'' They simply did \nnot consider more bold reforms, so maybe we ought not to consider their \nrecommendations as final. It is up to us. We have the ultimate \nresponsibility of passing this bill. Are we going to pass what is \npragmatic, what seems to be the least upsetting to the bureaucracies or \ndo we want to be bold and pass something that will make \nthe intelligence community work? Count me in the latter category.\n\n  Yesterday, my good friend, the chairman of the committee writing this \nbill, alluded to some of the concerns I have. When responding to \nconcerns about DOD being shortchanged by the NID's budget authority, \nshe reminded us all that ultimately the President determines the \nbudget. That will always be the case. Let us not also forget that the \nbureaucracies of the OMB and many committees of the Senate and the \nHouse also determine the budget. There is simply too many ways to water \ndown the limited real authority that budgetary powers provide. More \nreal day-to-day authorities are needed, especially if we are to hold a \nNID accountable for our intelligence efforts. As bothersome as the OMB \nis in the effective operation of Government--I say that only half \nfacetiously--does anybody think the OMB runs the agencies of \nGovernment? They mess them up sometimes. There are a lot of areas I can \ntell you where the OMB has shortchanged vitally important activities. \nBut run them? I don't think so. Budgetary authority is not the same \nthing as running an agency.\n  The way I read the bill, it seems as though any agency or department \nthat didn't want to chafe under a powerful NID has found a way out. \nThis bill leaves the door open for several key agencies, such as the \nState Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, INR; major \nportions of the FBI'S intelligence operations capabilities; the \nDepartment of Energy's Office of Intelligence; the Treasury \nDepartment's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, and \nothers, to avoid the authority of a NID. So under the Governmental \nAffairs bill, a NID who declares war on al-Qaida--as referenced by \nChairman Roberts of the Intelligence Committee a few minutes ago--will \nhave even fewer troops to try to muster for this war, and little \nadditional power that doesn't already exist today.\n  Let us recall that every knowledgeable voice on this issue is \nadamant: If you create a NID, he must be given power; otherwise, you \ncreate an intelligence czar and have made the problem worse. We have \ncreated a drug czar\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\nand all kinds of czars, but they are not able to get the job done. As I \ncontinue to listen to DOD proponents, I am concerned that insufficient \nauthorities are granted in the GAC bill, and they will be even further \neroded, putting us one step closer to creating an intelligence czar \nwith a great title and very little authority.\n  One of the recurring themes we always hear on the Intelligence \nCommittee--on which I have had the pleasure to serve for only a year \nand three-quarters--is the reluctance of the agencies to share \ninformation with those who need to know. We know all too well there are \nmany legitimate reasons not to share intelligence. We understand the \nneed to protect sources and methods. We also understand that decisions \nnot to disseminate some information may rightly involve protecting U.S. \ncivil liberties. But parochialism, poor information architectures, and \nbureaucratic confusion should not be included amongst the reasons to \nsquirrel away intelligence that we need by cognizant analysts \nthroughout the community.\n  Three years after 9/11, and after dozens of hearings in which \nintelligence community management describes ``seamless'' intelligence \nsharing, we end up prying a little deeper to find out that it simply is \nnot the case. While there have been improvements in some areas of \nintelligence sharing, they are often done under duress. As soon as the \n``heat'' is off, you can bet that those parochial agencies will return \nto intelligence hoarding, not intelligence sharing. We must empower a \nNID to force appropriate intelligence sharing even in times when the \ncongressional and executive spotlights are not on the issue.\n\n  I believe it has already been referred to on the Senate floor that at \na recent hearing, the intelligence committee was truly dumbfounded as \nwe listened to different agencies talk about a specific threat. Two \nagencies had a very different view of the severity of that threat when \nthey started talking to each other at the witness table.\n  One of the agencies said: We have information that you don't have.\n  They were supposed to be working on the same threat. I asked a dumb \nquestion. I said: Why didn't you share it? They said it was sensitive \ninformation. Well, wait a minute. They were trying to give us a \nrecommendation on a very serious matter, and the two agencies that were \nsupposed to work together on this serious matter didn't want to share \ninformation with each other? I used to think when we worked on a need-\nto-know basis, if you have a sensitive collection system, you need to \nkeep the name and identity very closely guarded. They were happy to \ntell us in the Intelligence Committee the reason they were keeping a \nparticular source on another matter in confidence was because it was so \nsensitive. I will tell you one thing. If you have ever seen a sieve, it \nlooks too much like the Intelligence Committee. We don't need to know \nthe names or even the identifying features of an intelligence source in \nthe committee. But if that is the essential element on which the \nanalysts are going to determine whether this particular source is \nreliable, they ought to be sharing it on a very limited basis with all \nof the people involved in the task.\n  I understand that the information that was gathered by the Iraqi \nSurvey Group after the war was very effective because they brought in \ncollectors and analysts from different agencies who were working on the \nsame problem and they put their heads together. What a wonderful thing. \nThey must have had a table. They laid out the information on the table. \nThey did what informally is called ``red teaming'' and they came up \nwith better estimates.\n  The NID, the national intelligence director, needs to be able to take \ncare of this himself, not to negotiate with the positions with other \ndepartments or go to the White House and Congress and say, will you get \nthese guys together to talk?\n  This reluctance to share information appears to be so deeply \ningrained that only direct orders to do so are adequate, not budgetary \ninfluences.\n  Let me be candid. As a member of the Intelligence Committee I am \nconvinced that the worst offenders of not sharing intelligence are the \nCIA and the NSA, but there are others. Arm twisting that is largely \nlimited to budgetary problems and powers will not solve the problem. We \nknow getting the information shared among agencies, red teaming, as \nthey say, is very important. In other words, if the players are at the \ntable, they are going to get their best result when everybody turns \nover their cards and shows what they are holding, but right now some of \nthe agencies are going to the table and keeping their cards face down, \nsaying, boy, we know some stuff, it is in our hand, and we are not \ngoing to show you.\n  Budget authority alone is not going to get them to turn over the \ncards. Red teaming cannot be successful unless the cards are turned \nover and the red team knows what cards the CIA is holding, for example.\n  Full deference should be given to civil liberties concerns, and I \nhope that the Collins-Lieberman provisions for improving information \narchitectures within the intelligence community will allow for getting \nthe right intelligence to the right people, and in the case of very \nsensitive intelligence or any other critical, possibly damaging \nintelligence, only to the right people. But it has to be gotten to the \npeople who need it.\n  Some have argued that the Specter amendment will lead to too much \ncentralized control, therefore group-think. Not likely. Let's be clear. \nThe Specter amendment deals with national collection, entities of the \nNSA, NGA, portions of the DIA and CIA. This will help streamline \ncollection and reduce inefficiencies. It will allow the NID truly to \nharness the collection capabilities against our Nation's primary \nthreat: The terrorists.\n  This leaves capabilities organic to the DOD currently funded under \nthe Joint Military Intelligence Program, JMIP, and the Tactical \nIntelligence and Related Activities, somewhat glamorously acronymed the \nTIARA, still firmly under DOD control, as they should be. DOD will not \nbe shortchanged and our Nation will have a more effective collection \neffort.\n  Today, the DOD is the most voracious consumer of intelligence. That \nis why they have the lion's share of the intelligence budget and \nsignificant organic collection assets whose sole function is support to \nthe warfighter. However, national collectors must be unified in an \neffort to meet national needs which include those of the \nkey intelligence entities in our war or terror: DOD, CIA, FBI, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, where the appetite for terrorism-\nrelated intelligence collection will only continue to grow.\n\n  I heard debate yesterday on the combat support agencies. Nobody \ndenies that these agencies, the NRO, the NSA, and the NGA, are still \ncombat support agencies, but as their name suggests, they also serve \nnational interests. When we examine this in a larger light, we realize \nthat having these agencies report directly to the Secretary of Defense \nsolely made sense during the Cold War. However, as I mentioned earlier \nin this statement, the decisions we make today will be with us for \ndecades to come.\n  The world has changed. The war on terror is not going to go away \nsoon. While DOD is still a voracious consumer of intelligence, it is \nnow a partner with the CIA, FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, \nand others in the war on terrorism. As other agencies continue to join \nCIA and DOD as coequals, it makes sense to have a national intelligence \ndirector who can see to the needs of all of these agencies and best \nharness all national collection capabilities to meet our national \nneeds.\n  Again, we need to look decades down the road. We must recognize the \nneed to empower a NID to meet these needs. I believe Chairman Roberts \nhas already mentioned this several times, but let me state that the \nDirectors of the National Security Agency and the National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency stated that having their agencies transferred to \nthe control of a NID would not degrade their level of support to the \nmilitary. Considering their testimony, as well as other commentary and \nthe maintenance of DOD's military intelligence collections, the \nPentagon need not fear the Specter amendment in any way.\n  It so happens I have a personal interest in this. As many of my \ncolleagues know, my son is a young ground intelligence second \nlieutenant in the Marine Corps. I certainly do not want to\n\n[[Page S9881]]\n\ndo anything that would interfere with his or his comrades' ability to \nget the information, the intelligence, the estimates, and the tactical \nintelligence they need to leave them hanging out without adequate \ncover. My colleagues can bet I would never do that.\n  I conclude by giving some thoughts from Dr. David Kay, the interim \nhead of the Iraqi Survey Group, who testified before us many times and \nwho was a real bright light in gathering intelligence. He is certainly \nnot afraid to speak the truth in spite of whom he may offend. He told \nthe Intelligence Committee:\n\n       I am concerned, however, that simply creating a national \n     intelligence director, even one that seems to have--and we \n     think has--real powers . . . and we think budget and \n     personnel authority is real power, we will not end up \n     addressing the real problems . . .\n\n  Well, budget and personnel authority is some power but, as Dr. Kay \nindicated, it is not real power.\n  Dr. Kay further stated:\n\n       I think you need to place the national intelligence \n     director in charge, charged by you, Congress, with ensuring \n     that all of the collection assets of this government work to \n     support the national intelligence strategies and priorities.\n\n  Dr. Kay recognizes the need for a unified collection effort. We \ncannot afford to waste or misuse scarce collection assets. I think Dr. \nKay also knows the frustration of fragmented control quite well. He was \na DCI special adviser on Iraq and then, as I have noted, headed the \nintelligence efforts of the Iraq Survey Group, or ISG. He wrestled with \nauthorities quite frequently. In large part, this was due to the \nlimited powers of the DCI vis-a-vis other department heads, but when \nthey made progress is when they coordinated and cooperated and the \nagencies worked together.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Specter amendment. This is a key \nfix to give the NID some of the powers he or she will need if we are to \nask the NID to be accountable for our national intelligence effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Specter amendment currently pending before the Senate. However, I \nwant to first take a moment to commend Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman for their hard work and dedication to this important \nlegislation. These are difficult issues and I believe that we all \nstrive to reach the same goal--a safer, more secure America. The \nquestion before us now is how we best accomplish that goal.\n  I have long advocated for significant overhaul of the intelligence \ncommunity in order to change the way it operates and specifically who \ncontrols the community and its assets. For too long, the intelligence \ncommunity has lacked a strong leader with the ability to command and \ncontrol the multitude of agencies that operate as independent parts \nwithout a focused direction.\n  I do not believe that Congress's action in 1947 intended to create \nthe intelligence framework we currently have--a framework where no one \nhas the ability to direct the actions of the community as a whole. I \nbelieve that Congress intended to create a Director of Central \nIntelligence with clear lines of authority and accountability within \nthe intelligence community--one that is much like what we are \nattempting to create now with a national intelligence director.\n  The underlying bill does take some important steps toward the \ncreation of a national intelligence director with the power and \nauthority to chart a path for real reform within the intelligence \ncommunity. Unfortunately, I believe that the underlying bill fails to \nprovide the national intelligence director with all of the authorities \nrequired to provide the unity of leadership and accountability \nnecessary for real reform.\n  I believe that clear lines of authority between the national \nintelligence director and our national intelligence collection \nagencies, extending beyond budgetary control, are critical to our \nsuccess in countering national security threats of the 21st century. \nThe national intelligence director must have the ability to direct, \nsupervise and control the elements of the intelligence community.\n  There must be no doubt in anyone's mind that the national \nintelligence director is in charge. Without the additional authorities \nthat are provided in the Specter amendment, there will be doubt.\n  The Specter amendment seeks to eliminate any question about who is \nultimately in charge of the intelligence community. With the additional \nauthority included in this amendment, there will no longer be an \nopportunity for finger pointing and excuse making.\n  Ultimately, the national intelligence director will either be \ncongratulated for the success of the intelligence community or held \naccountable for their failures.\n  I believe that budgetary authority is an important part of the \noverall structure of a strong national intelligence director. But \nbeyond that, he or she must have day-to-day operational control of all \nelements of the intelligence community performing national intelligence \ncollection missions, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Reconnaissance Office, the National Security Agency, and the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the humint parts of the \nDefense Intelligence Agency.\n  Giving the national intelligence director budget authority but not \nday-to-day operational control will leave the intelligence agencies \nserving two masters and will inevitably maintain the status quo that \nhas continuously failed us. Fundamental change is a must if we are \ngoing to work to prevent any further attacks.\n  I believe this amendment serves as a perfect complement to the \nactions taken in the National Intelligence Reform bill. This amendment \nsimply enhances the authority of the national intelligence director.\n  I continue to believe that change for the sake of change will do \nnothing to accomplish our goal. A powerful national intelligence \ndirector is a vital part of our future fight against the terrorists \nthat have dedicated their lives for the purpose of destroying America \nand its citizens. If we truly want to create a strong national \nintelligence director who has the authorities necessary to command and \ncontrol our intelligence community and its assets, we must pass the \nSpecter amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to take advantage of this opportunity and \nsupport this amendment to ensure that true change is possible through \nthe enabling of a powerful national intelligence director.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Specter amendment and I will \ntake a few minutes to explain my opposition. I think all of us are in \nfavor of bold moves, of having a powerful new national intelligence \ndirector and having analysis that is independent and objective, much \nmore so than has been the case in the last few decades and recently, to \nhave that analysis done by a group which can bring together all of the \ninformation and come up with a coordinated position which is \nindependent and objective, and the NCTC is able to do that.\n  This amendment would place the National Security Agency and the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the NSA and the NGA, and the \nNational Reconnaissance Office, the NRO, under the direction, \nsupervision, and control of the national intelligence director and \nwould do the same for the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency \nregarding the national intelligence collection mission of the DIA.\n  In doing so, this amendment would have the national intelligence \ndirector basically be substituted for the Secretary of Defense in the \nmilitary chain of command. There are thousands of uniformed members of \nour military who are currently in those agencies.\n  To break the chain of command and to say for the first time we are \ngoing to take thousands of uniformed personnel and put them under the \nsupervision, direction, and control of a civilian agency head would \ncreate havoc inside of the military, would create a very unfortunate \nprecedent, and would in the process be creating a new agency, a new \nagency that would require a supervisory staff similar to the \nsupervisory staff that now exists in the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense for the agencies which would be transferred.\n  Those are the two major reasons I have problems. There is a third I \nwant to talk about in a moment. But the two major reasons I have are \nthat it would require the creation of a whole new supervisory \nbureaucracy for these\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\nagencies in the national intelligence director's office. You cannot \nsupervise these agencies, from the national intelligence director's \nperspective, without having people to engage in that supervision the \nway the Office of the Secretary of Defense now supervises and overseas \nthese agencies. So we would be creating a new bureaucracy.\n  We should be breaking down walls between bureaucracies, not building \nup a new bureaucracy.\n  When the 9/11 Commission reached its conclusion and when they \ntestified in front of us, they told us they decided not to create a \ndepartment. They thought that would be overcentralization. They were \nbold. I don't think anybody can successfully argue here that the 9/11 \nCommission was not bold. They were bold. They made some major shifts, \nin terms of budget execution authority and in terms of personnel \nauthority. In shifting those authorities over the agencies which we are \ndebating here to the NID, they made a major decision relative to power, \nrelative to control. But they decided they would not go toward a more \ncentralized new agency; that they would rather coordinate with the \nbudgeting personnel power in a new powerful NID but not create a new \nbureaucracy in the process.\n  There are many reasons why their decision--and I focus on the 9/11 \nCommission recommendation at our hearing--was a wise one. Their \napproach was not just bold in terms of recommending the transfer of \nbudget and personnel authority, but it was wise in not creating a new \nbureaucracy in the process.\n  The chain of command is such that we now do not put large numbers of \nour uniformed military people outside of the chain of command and under \nthe command and control of civilian supervisors. We do not do that. \nThere is a purpose for having a chain of command from your commander \ninside the military, which is clear, which you must abide by. That is \nwhat you sign up for when you join the military and that is what is so \nessential to military effectiveness, that the chain of command be solid \nand that it not be broken in the way this amendment would break a chain \nof command.\n  These agencies we are talking about today are integral parts of the \nDefense Department. They are recognized for the support they provide to \ncombat operations. Indeed, when the Congress adopted the Goldwater-\nNichols Reorganization Act of 1986, we created the concept of ``command \nsupport agencies.'' Pursuant to that legislation, the DIA and the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency have been designated by law as \ncommand support agencies. We hear that designation will continue. But \nit is pretty hard to square that with what this amendment proposes, \nwhich is that they would not be inside the military chain of command. \nThey would still have the label but not the reality. They would be \ncalled combat support agencies, but they would not be in the chain of \ncommand of the Department of Defense.\n\n  The combat support functions of the DIA and the NSA and the NGA have \nbeen recognized in law. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is \nrequired by law to evaluate periodically, and not less often than every \n2 years, the responsiveness and readiness of these agencies to support \noperating forces in the event of war or threats to national security. \nThe pending amendment would preserve the form of the periodic review. \nThat periodic review by the JCS Chairman of the combat support agencies \nof the intelligence community would be retained, but it would be a \nreport which is in form only because it is the Secretary of Defense who \nis charged with being responsible for the combat capabilities of the \nArmed Forces.\n  The NID, the national intelligence director, does not have the \nresponsibility that the Secretary of Defense has for the combat \ncapabilities of our Armed Forces. So to simply say, well, there will \nstill be a periodic review by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of the \ncombat support agencies of this community, but then to say that report \ngoes to the NID, the national intelligence director, instead of going \nto the person who we make responsible for the combat abilities of the \nArmed Forces, is a hollow gesture. It says that one thing will continue \nto be true, we will still call them a combat support agency, but when \nit comes to the real world of where that review goes, it will go to the \nperson, the national intelligence director, who is not the person \nresponsible for the combat capabilities of the Armed Forces. So we have \na break in the chain of command, which is unprecedented, which creates \nall kinds of problems inside the military in terms of military \neffectiveness, which weakens not only the power of the Secretary of \nDefense but which undermines his responsibility to make sure we have \nfull combat capability inside of the Department of Defense.\n  For these reasons, that we should not be creating a new bureaucracy, \nwe should be breaking down walls of old bureaucracies; that this \namendment would require new supervisory staff over these entities if \nthey are going to be transferred to the national intelligence director \nin order to help him perform the supervision of these agencies, which \nis now performed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense; and because \nthis would represent an unprecedented break in the chain of command \nthat now exists, and which is so critical to our military \neffectiveness, I believe the 9/11 Commission reached the right balance. \nTheir balance was one which was conscious and conscientious; it was \nbold but it was wise.\n  I have one other thought which I want to share and then I will yield. \nThese agencies now do analysis on their own. We got some very important \nanalysis before the Iraq war, in fact, from the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, analysis which was different from the analysis produced by the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. If we are serious about wanting \nalternative views relative to intelligence; if we are serious, as the \n9/11 Commission urges us to be and as I hope we are, about ending the \npoliticization and misuse of intelligence to support policy positions; \nif we are serious about promoting objectivity and independence of \nanalysis, we would want these agencies not to be shifted because their \nanalysis should not be under the control of the national intelligence \ndirector. Their analysis should be independent and objective. For these \nagencies to be shifted outside of where they now are, separate from the \nnational intelligence director, and put underneath his umbrella, is \ngoing to make us weaker when it comes to the most critically important \nreform we should be producing, which is to have objective, independent \nanalysis of intelligence which can be provided to the policymakers and \nnot shaped to support policies of the policymakers.\n  To remove these agencies that now are in a position to provide \nalternative analysis and to put them under the aegis of the national \nintelligence director will make that many fewer sources of independent, \nobjective intelligence that will be available to our policymakers. That \nis a real loss.\n  There are other provisions in this bill and other provisions I hope \nwill be added during the amendment process to promote the objectivity \nand independence of intelligence analysis.\n  We have had too much abuse in this area. We have had too much shaping \nand exaggeration, going back at least as far as the Gulf of Tonkin \nResolution, when intelligence was misused, to the Iran-Contra years \nwhen intelligence was misused, shaped, and exaggerated in order to \nsupport particular policy positions, and the same thing happened before \nthe Iraq war. We have to find ways to break down any kind of group-\nthink, any kind of a monolithic approach to intelligence, and we have \nto make it more difficult for a national intelligence director to be \ndoing the shaping, to be in total control of the analysis of \nintelligence.\n  That is why having an NCTC office separate from NID is so important. \nHaving an NCTC director who is subject to the confirmation of the \nSenate is so important. That is why some of the other provisions which \nwe were able to add in committee to promote the independence and \nobjectivity of the intelligence analysis are so important.\n  We should not be reducing the numbers of sources of independent \nanalysis of intelligence, as this amendment would do, by putting these \nagencies that now produce intelligence analysis under the aegis, \nsupervision, and operational control of the national intelligence \ndirector. It is too much concentration of that critically important \nanalysis power under one person. We\n\n[[Page S9883]]\n\nshould be wary of doing that. We should be moving in a very different \ndirection.\n  We should be finding ways to plot independence and objectivity of \nintelligence so we don't have a repeat of the fiasco we just saw where \nwe had 500 pages, according to a bipartisan Intelligence Committee \nreport, of instances where intelligence was shaped, stretched, and \nexaggerated, and they all moved in one direction. All those \nintelligence changes and all the shaping was moved in the direction of \nsupporting a particular policy of the administration. That is a great \ndanger.\n  This amendment, because it concentrates or would concentrate agencies \nthat are currently involved in intelligence analysis under the NID, \nincreases the danger rather than reduces the danger of having \nintelligence which is shaped to support policy rather than provide \nsupport for objective information and objective estimates to the \npolicymakers.\n  I oppose this amendment. I hope it will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDeWine be added as cosponsor of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am advised that Senator Shelby would \nlike to speak to the bill. He is now chairing the Banking Committee, \nwhich is hearing from the 9/11 Commission. I have talked to the manager \nof the bill. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside so we might start utilizing the time of the floor on another \namendment which I intend to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3761\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 3761.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To specify a term of service for the National Intelligence \n                               Director)\n\n       On page 10, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       (d) Term of Office; Removal.--(1) The term of service of \n     the National Intelligence Director shall be ten years.\n       (2) An individual may not serve more than one term of \n     service as National Intelligence Director.\n       (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply with respect to any \n     individual appointed as National Intelligence Director after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (4) If the individual serving as Director of Central \n     Intelligence on the date of the enactment of this Act is the \n     first person appointed as National Intelligence Director \n     under this section, the date of appointment of such \n     individual as National Intelligence Director shall be deemed \n     to be the date of the commencement of the term of service of \n     such individual as National Intelligence Director.\n       On page 10, line 17, strike ``(d)'' and insert ``(e)''.\n       On page 11, line 3, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(f)''.\n       On page 11, line 5, strike ``subsection (c)'' and insert \n     ``subsection (e)''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment would give the national \nintelligence director a 10-year term, the same kind of a term the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation now has. The debate on \nthis bill generally has stressed--and appropriately so--the need for a \nstrong, independent national intelligence director.\n  The interest of having policy determinations guide our new \nintelligence estimates has been stressed repeatedly. There is a very \nbroad, historical precedent of the desirability of taking steps to \nguarantee to the maximum extent possible that the intelligence \nestimates will be independent and will not be in line to try to promote \nsome specific policy objective.\n  The 10-year term, as I say, is modeled after the term of the Director \nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  When I offered this amendment in committee, I had a provision for \nremoval only for cause. After considering the matter, I have stricken \nthat provision because I believe it is unnecessary. I believe by \nanalogy to the FBI Director, the inference is plain that the removal \ncan be only for cause.\n  I will refer very briefly to comments by Senator Byrd on July 26 of \n1976 when the FBI Director was given the 10-year term. Senator Byrd \nsaid, ``The setting of a 10-year term of office by Congress would as a \npractical matter preclude or at least inhibit a President from \narbitrarily dismissing an FBI director for political reasons.''\n  Senator Byrd goes on to note that obviously a successor would have to \nbe confirmed by the Senate. But there could not be the removal of the \nFBI Director for political reasons. The implication is pretty clear \nthat removal can only be for cause.\n  The additional views of Senator Levin on the national intelligence \nreform bill which he submitted on September 27 contain a very good \nsummary of authorities on this proposition generally. I am going to \ncite a number of the authorities which Senator Levin referred to in \nthose additional views. I complimented Senator Levin a few moments ago \non the floor of the Senate for the quality of his views which he \nsubmitted and said I was going to quote him. He said it was \nunnecessary, but I believe in the interest of full disclosure that it \nis good to give Senator Levin that credit.\n  The references to what happened with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution \nwhere that intelligence reports were used--and inappropriately used--\nfor representations about intelligence to support the administration's \nposition are well known historically. The Secretary of Defense at that \ntime, McNamara, cited classified information to support the passage of \nthe Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which President Lyndon Johnson wanted. \nThose citations were made to support the conclusion that the Gulf of \nTonkin Resolution ought to be adopted.\n  The analyst for the National Security Archive, John Prados, said that \nSecretary McNamara used the intercepts as a ``trump card'' during the \n1964 hearings to ``silence doubters.'' According to the views of Mr. \nPrados, Secretary McNamara asserted that ``intelligence reports from a \nhighly classified and unimpeachable source reported that North Vietnam \nwas making preparations to attack our destroyers, and ``the attack was \nunderway.'' Finally, ``The North Vietnamese lost two ships in the \nengagement.'' Those materials turned out to be unsubstantiated, as a \nmatter of fact.\n  It was notorious that Central Intelligence Director William Casey \nmisrepresented intelligence during the Iran-Contra period. The \nbipartisan Iran-Contra report specified that Director Casey \n``misrepresented or selectively used available intelligence to support \nthe policy that he was promoting.''\n  In former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Robert Gates' \nmemoirs entitled ``From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of \nFive Presidents and How They Won the Cold War,'' former CIA Director \nGates said or referred to Bill Casey as a DCI who had his own foreign \npolicy agenda and had the estimating program as a powerful instrument \nin forcing the pace of the policy area.\n  Former Secretary of State George Shultz, in his memoir ``Turmoil and \nTriumph, My Years as Secretary of State,'' published in 1993, referred \nto former Director of the CIA Bill Casey, who had very strong policy \npositions and was so ideological that they inevitably colored his \nselection and assessment of materials, once again, using the position \nof intelligence director to have a determination of policy.\n\n  Former Director of the CIA and also former Director of the FBI \nWilliam Webster testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on August 16 of this year and said:\n\n       With respect to relations with the President, while the \n     leader of the intelligence community must be the principal \n     adviser on intelligence to the President, he must work hard, \n     very hard, to avoid either the reality or the perception that \n     intelligence is being framed or that is read, spun, to \n     support a foreign policy of the administration.\n\n  The 10-year term, so it does not coincide with the term of the \nPresident, is designed to give the national intelligence director the \nreality of independence and certainly to avoid the\n\n[[Page S9884]]\n\nperception that the intelligence is being spun for the interests of the \nchief executive.\n  Two days after Judge Webster testified, the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence heard from former chief weapons inspector David Kay, \nwho said:\n\n       Intelligence must serve the Nation and speak truth to power \n     even if in some cases elected leaders choose, as is their \n     right, to disagree with the intelligence with which they are \n     presented. This means that intelligence should not be part of \n     the political apparatus or process.\n\n  A 10-year term would seek to ensure, guarantee, that the national \nintelligence director was independent, and was not a part of the \npolitical process or apparatus.\n  Mr. Kay went on to say:\n\n       This is, I think, if you move forward on a national \n     intelligence director legislation, is going to be the hardest \n     thing to communicate, that the national intelligence director \n     must serve the national security objectives of the Nation, \n     and he serves whoever is the President best by giving him \n     unvarnished truth, which will often not be welcome.\n\n  Again, a 10-year term would guarantee that kind of independence to \nthe national intelligence director.\n  On the same day, former GEN Charles Boyd told the Intelligence \nCommittee of the enormous pressures that political appointees are under \nto ``give the President what he wants rather than what he doesn't want \nbut needs,'' and the upshot of what General Boyd had to say was that \nrather than seeking a special and close relationship to the President, \nGeneral Boyd articulates a standard for an intelligence director \n``ought to be his distance from the President, his independence of the \nPresident, his professionalism and be respected as such.''\n  Again, a 10-year term would promote that.\n  A few days ago, on September 21, the very distinguished Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, a group consisting of former \nSenators and former Secretaries of Defense, former Directors of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, and two former Secretaries of State, had \nthis to say:\n\n       When intelligence and policy are too closely tied the \n     demands of policymakers can distort intelligence and \n     intelligence analysis, can hijack the policy development \n     process. It is crucial to ensuring the separation that the \n     intelligence community leader have no policy role. A single \n     individual with a last word on intelligence and some policy \n     as well could be a dangerously powerful actor in the national \n     security arena using intelligence to advocate for particular \n     policy positions, budget requests, or weapon systems that \n     often lack the knowledge to challenge.\n\n  Here, again, the citation of authorities supports the concept that \nthe national intelligence director ought to be objective, ought not to \nbe seeking to promote any special policy of the chief executive and all \nof that would be enhanced by the 10-year term.\n  The amendment which I offer, I do so on behalf of the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, and myself.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I certainly understand the intent of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania in offering this amendment. Indeed, he \noffered it during the markup of the Governmental Affairs Committee. It \nwas debated at length.\n  Initially, in considering this issue, I, too, was inclined to believe \nthat the new national intelligence director should have some sort of \nterm of office. However, the testimony we heard through our eight \nhearings changed my mind in this regard.\n  Under our legislation, S. 2845, the NID serves as the principal \nadviser to the President. The individual not only manages the \nintelligence community and heads up the new national intelligence \nauthority, but serves as the principal adviser to the President. I am \nstressing that role because I believe that is key to why the director, \nin fact, should not have a fixed term. It is essential that the NID \nenjoy the full confidence and trust of the President of the United \nStates. That was a point made by the 9/11 Commission chairman, Tom \nKean, at our very first hearing on July 30. But we heard that repeated \ntime and again by our witnesses. All of the former DCIs who came before \nthe committee, representing a variety of times and administrations, \nwere unanimous in their view that the new NID should serve at the \npleasure of the President.\n  The then Acting Director of the CIA John McLaughlin made the point at \nour September 8 hearing that for the NID to successfully clarify our \nassignment of serving as the principal adviser to the President, he \nmust enjoy the President's trust and confidence.\n  Consider a situation where the Presidency changes parties during that \n10-year-period. It would be very awkward for a new President of a \ndifferent party to inherit the national intelligence director from the \nprevious administration. Their world views and philosophy may have \nnothing in common. Yet the President has to have a close and trusting \nrelationship with the national intelligence director. The President \nshould be able to choose his or her own person for that critical post.\n  Proponents of having a 10-year term have frequently compared this \nproposal to the 10-year term of the Director of the FBI. I would note \nthat I asked Director Mueller whether he thought the new NID should \nhave a 10-year term similar to his. He said he did not think a 10-year \nterm or any fixed term was appropriate for the national intelligence \ndirector. He said the role of the FBI Director is very different from \nthe role of the national intelligence director.\n  Over and over again during our hearings, Senator Lieberman and I \nraised this question with the witnesses because we, too, were trying to \nreach the right determination. Over and over again, the advice was the \nsame, whether it was the 9/11 Commission, the Acting Director of the \nCIA, the former Directors of the CIA, or Director Mueller of the FBI. \nOver and over again, they advised against setting a term.\n  So we need to create a position where the individual will enjoy the \nfull confidence and trust of the President of the United States. That \nis the only way that individual can effectively carry out the role he \nis assigned in this legislation to serve as the President's principal \nintelligence adviser.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I also rise to oppose this amendment by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania. This is, as Senator Collins has \nindicated, a matter we discussed in what I thought was a very \nthoughtful discussion in our committee deliberation on a similar \namendment.\n  There are good arguments on both sides. The objective here is to \nbalance the independence we want our national intelligence director to \nhave with the importance of having a trusting relationship with the \nPresident of the United States. In the end, I concluded it would be \nwrong to give a fixed term to the national intelligence director for \nthe reason to which I just heard Senator Collins refer.\n  Remember, we have given the national intelligence director two main \nresponsibilities. One is to administer the intelligence community. The \nother is to be the principal intelligence adviser to the President of \nthe United States. In fact, one could argue, although the national \nintelligence director as administrator has many customers, if you will, \nfor intelligence, the No. 1 customer is the President of the United \nStates as President and certainly as Commander in Chief. So that is a \nrelationship that must be a trusting relationship.\n  The danger is that an incoming President will be given someone in \nwhom he does not have that kind of confidence. Unfortunately, history--\nrecent history--gives us an example of that, without attributing blame. \nPresident Clinton and then-Director of the FBI, Mr. Freeh, had a \nrelationship that was not mutually confident, and, therefore, he had \nsomebody in that critical position who had very little contact with the \nPresident of the United States. He was Director of the FBI, not the \nprincipal personal intelligence adviser in the sense of giving advice \npersonally to the President of the United States.\n  The concern about the independence of the national intelligence \nadviser is an important one. I feel very strongly that in this bill \nSenator Collins and I offer, and our committee offers to the Senate, we \nhave done a lot to protect the independence of the national \nintelligence director.\n\n[[Page S9885]]\n\n  For instance, contrary to the original proposal of the 9/11 \nCommission, which proposed that this office of the national \nintelligence director be in the White House, we said no, that may raise \nquestions and in fact problems with regard to the independence of the \nNID if he or she is just down the hall from the President. That ought \nto be out of the Executive Office of the President and established as \nan independent agency.\n  We went well beyond that in a title particularly that was added in \nour committee, most of the work of which was done by Senator Levin, \nwhich is all about the independence of the office, the objectivity of \nthe intelligence that the adviser, the director gives to the President, \nto the country, to the agencies he serves, independence even to the \nextent that we say the national intelligence director should be like \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in this sense: that he does \nnot need administration approval to testify before Congress, does not \nneed his testimony cleared, if you will, by the OMB.\n  So there is a lot built in here that is meant to guarantee, as best a \nstatute can, the independence of this office, without hamstringing--if \nthat is the right phrase here--a President with a national intelligence \ndirector in whom he does not have trust or in whom he loses trust as \ntime goes on.\n  But this is that critical a position. I would not want to give a \nnational intelligence director a set term any more than I would want to \ngive a Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Director of OMB, or \nNational Security Adviser fixed terms. These are positions that must \nevery day be filled by people who enjoy the confidence and trust of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  For that reason, I oppose the amendment and urge our colleagues to do \nso as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think Senator Lieberman has advanced \nan argument in support of my amendment. If I could have the attention \nof Senator Lieberman, when I quote him, I want to quote him to his \nface. I want him to hear what I have to say.\n  I say to Senator Lieberman, we agree more often than we disagree, \nalthough we are at odds on two of my amendments today.\n  But when the distinguished Senator from Connecticut cites the \nrelationship between President Clinton and FBI Director Freeh, I think \nhe is supporting my argument. He is supporting my argument about the \nneed for independence. There was an investigation being conducted by \nthe FBI on campaign finance irregularities, and the President--I would \nnot call him a subject, but he was a part of those who were being \nlooked into on the soft money issue.\n  Then, without unduly belaboring the point, on this floor we had the \nimpeachment proceeding. Issues involved were obstruction of justice and \nperjury. So the kind of independence the Director of FBI had by virtue \nof a 10-year term, I think, served the Nation well.\n  Going back to the administration of President Nixon, without going \ninto any detail, you had activities by the FBI Director which led to \nthis 10-year term to insulate the Director from the appointing \nauthority by the President.\n  When the chairwoman refers to a philosophy of having the national \nintelligence director, appointed by a preceding President, serving the \nPresident, I suggest this is not like a Cabinet officer, such as the \nSecretary of State or the Secretary of Defense, who is supposed to \ncarry out the policy of the President, who is supposed to have the same \nphilosophy. Here we have a national intelligence director who is \nsupposed to tell the President what the objective facts are on \nintelligence. It is inevitable in human relations, if you know what \nsomebody wants to hear, an inclination to tell somebody what that \nperson wants to hear, especially if that person is the appointing \npower.\n  So on the question of confidence and trust, I think the American \npeople would have more confidence and trust in a national intelligence \ndirector who is independent from the President.\n  When the talk and the argument is made about an adviser, here again, \nthe national intelligence director is not an adviser like the Secretary \nof State or the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, carrying out the President's policies and seeking \nto give him advice to carry out those policies. Here we want somebody \nwho will be strong and independent and objective and tell it like it \nis, even if it is not what the President wants to hear, and even if it \ncontradicts the policies which the President wants to carry out.\n  This bill does contain some elements stressing the independence of \nthe national intelligence director such as not requiring permission to \ntestify before Congress, putting affirmative obligations on the \nnational intelligence director to keep the Congress informed as well as \nthe chief executive informed.\n  I think this is an important addition, to have a strong, independent, \nobjective national intelligence director.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, first let me say to Senator Specter \nthat he is quite right, we do, much more often than not, agree on \nmatters. Unfortunately this amendment is not one of them, \nnotwithstanding the arguments he just made.\n  There is an interesting historical note we are familiar with that \nwhen the 10-year term for the FBI Director came into effect, I was not \nhere, but I gather it was as a matter of reform as against the \neffective lifetime term that the former Director, Mr. Hoover, had. So \nthat was in that reality.\n  Here is the circumstance I am worried about. We have done everything \nwe can in this bill to create independence in the national intelligence \ndirector position and to set standards that say: You have to level with \nthe President. The worst thing that can happen is if you feel you have \nto create a good personal relationship and satisfy policy desires. In \nfact, we have language in here that is quite remarkable that says the \nnational director ``must provide intelligence to the President that is \ntimely, objective, independent of political consideration, and based on \nall sources available to the intelligence community, information that \nhas not been shaped to serve policy considerations, that comes from a \nvariety of intelligence assessments and analytical views.''\n  I am quoting directly from our proposal.\n  We have set up the office of ombudsman, a very unusual office, and, \nthanks to a combination of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Shelby, \ncreated within it an analytical review unit which will do a kind of \nquality control on the work of the intelligence director, again to try \nto ensure that there is a real independence and objectivity and \nwillingness to speak the truth.\n  The situation I would worry about, if we have a director for a fixed \nyear term of 10 years, would be that the President simply loses \nconfidence in that director for one reason or another. So on critically \nimportant questions such as we have seen in our time--do you send \nAmerican troops into combat, what foreign policy do we adopt toward \nthreatening nations such as Iran and North Korea--if you have a \nPresident lacking confidence or trust, and it could be in the \ncompetence of the individual or in his or her dispassion or \nobjectivity, you leave the President either without adequate \nintelligence advice on matters of great national importance or you \nencourage the President to end-run the national intelligence director, \ngo directly to the head of the CIA and other agencies. That is not a \nhealthy situation.\n  Of course, it totally undercuts exactly what we are trying do to do, \nwhich is to create a national intelligence director who will oversee \nthe total intelligence community. For those reasons, in this situation, \nI continue to oppose the Specter amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Specter \namendment No. 3761, regarding a 10-year term, provided that no \namendment be in order to the amendment prior to that vote. I also ask \nconsent that following that vote, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the Specter amendment No. 3706 regarding the NID \nconsolidation, again with no second degrees in order\n\n[[Page S9886]]\n\nto the amendment prior to the vote on the first degree. And finally, I \nask that the order with respect to the statements of Senator Harkin and \nSenator Stevens begin following those two votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, could we change that request \nto 2:15 p.m. rather than 2 o'clock?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would so modify the request.\n  Mr. REID. The other is in the form of a question. What could happen \nhere is one person could get the floor and keep it until 2:15. We need \nsome ability to make sure there is an equitable distribution of time \nduring the next 2 hours. I am wondering if the chairmen have an idea \nhow we can divide the time. I see a couple of Senators on the floor. \nAny one of them could get the floor and talk until 2:15.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would say to the Senator that we would welcome people \ncoming to the floor with their amendments. Generally, these amendments \nare not breaking down along party lines.\n  Mr. REID. We have two votes set at 2:15. My question, though, is, are \nwe going to divide the time prior to that or just let things happen as \nthey will? That is fine with us.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, if I may answer the question, my hope \nis--and I believe it is the chairman's hope--that we will stay on the \nbill and people will come over and introduce more amendments, that we \nhave more debate between now and 2:15.\n  Mr. REID. Is my friend saying the debate is basically completed on \nthese two amendments?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Senator Shelby and Senator DeWine wish to speak.\n  Mr. REID. If the two managers don't have a concern, I don't either. \nWhat we would do is, if the statements are completed, there would be \nnothing wrong with people setting the amendments aside and offering \nother amendments.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Absolutely.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I believe we are very near the end of the debate.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I come to the floor to support the \nSpecter amendment. I would first like to congratulate my colleague from \nMaine for the fine job she has done. This is a very difficult bill to \nput together. It has taken a lot of work. She and Senator Lieberman are \ncertainly to be congratulated.\n  I would call everyone's attention to the fact that the 9/11 \nCommission was not the first commission to point out the need for more \npower in the person who is in charge of our intelligence. Just about \nevery commission that has looked at intelligence reform has come to \nthis conclusion.\n  Beginning in 1947, the period right after World War II gave birth to \nthe modern intelligence community. Ever since then, this has been a \nproblem. There was a grand compromise that was made at that time and \nthat compromise set us on this path. The situation, though, has gotten \nworse and worse as time has gone on. And as some of my colleagues have \npointed out, we have reached the point where, when George Tenet knew \nand understood, as frankly few people in this country did, about the \nthreat from Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and declared war, he looked \naround and frankly did not have the troops. And the reason he did not \nhave the troops was he did not control the budget. He did not have the \npower.\n  He had the responsibility, but he did not have the power. So we have \na problem and everybody, I think, understands that. My concern all \nalong has been that we would create this new position, supposedly over \nthe entire intelligence community. Yet this new position would not have \nthe authority. I think Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have given \nthat person authority, but I don't think, frankly, they have gone far \nenough.\n  If you look at the language Senator Specter has included in his \namendment, it is a significant improvement over the language of this \nbill. I ask my colleagues to read the language. If you are concerned \nabout giving this person authority, the Specter language is much \nbetter. The worst thing we could do would be to create this new \nposition and think we have given him or her authority and not have \ngiven them the authority.\n  I wonder if I may get the attention of my colleague from Maine at \nthis time, if I may explore with the Senator part of this bill. Again, \nI thank my colleague for the great work she has done on this bill. I \nbelieve she has done a very good job. I am trying to understand the \nlanguage. As I have told her privately and I have told her again \npublicly, I prefer the Specter language. But I would like to clarify a \nlittle bit what this new position, the NID position--whoever occupies \nit--what he or she would be able to do under the Senator's bill. If I \nmay pose a couple of questions.\n  If we can start with the NGA and the whole issue of the satellites, \nthis has been a problem in the past. We don't have to on the floor \ntoday go over the problem of the moving of satellites. I ask my \ncolleague this. Let's say that the NID did, in fact, want to move a \nsatellite positioned on country A, and wants to get intelligence from \ncountry Z. What ability does that person have to do that? Can you point \nto the specific language in the bill that would get this done very \nquickly?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I will find the specific language to \nshow the Senator from Ohio. I have the language. The NID would \nestablish collection and analysis requirements for the Intelligence \nCommunity, determine collection and analysis priorities, manage and \nissue collection and analysis tasking, and resolve conflicts in the \ntasking abilities of the intelligence community. So the language is \nvery clear that the NID would have enhanced authority to resolve the \nkinds of conflicts that sometimes do occur now on the allocation of \nsatellite resources, for example.\n  Mr. DeWINE. So it is the Senator's feeling that--and everything is \nvery time sensitive--in a matter of hours this person could make the \ndecision and basically order this to be done?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct. Perhaps it will be of some \ncomfort to the Senator from Ohio to know that the language in this \nregard was suggested to our committee by Senator Roberts and comes from \nhis bill. There is very strong language regarding the issue the Senator \nhas raised.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that. If my colleague could answer this: In \na real-world situation, when we are dealing with satellites--and we \nwill not go into the countries on the floor--if a decision had to be \nmade in a matter of hours, if we need this information and we need to \nmove from here to there, could that be ordered? I am using the \nword ``ordered.'' I am not talking about consultation or prayer \ntogether. I am talking about ordering it. Can that be ordered? Can this \nperson order this to be done, saying it will be done, I don't care what \nanybody else says?\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. As I indicated to the Senator from Ohio--and I thought I \nwas very clear in answering his question--it says the NID can issue \ndirections in the collection and analysis tasking. I think the language \nis very clear that the answer is yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate what the language is, but I want to know, \nfor the history we are establishing today, if my colleague believes \nthat would include the term ``order.'' In other words, a direction that \nthis will be done.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The term of art is the issue. That is the correct legal \nlanguage to use. It is adopted from Senator Roberts' bill. My answer is \nyes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If the chairman will yield, these are very important \nquestions the Senator from Ohio is raising. I want to assure him, \nfirst, that we raised the same questions during our committee's \ndeliberation, including meetings with the heads of these national \nintelligence agencies that are within the Department of Defense. The \nSenator from Ohio is undoubtedly aware of the reality, which is that \nthe current Director of Central Intelligence has the authority under \nlaw to convene a committee, an interagency committee, which every day \napparently makes, as one witness said to us, thousands of decisions \nabout where our signal intelligence and image intelligence assets go. \nIn fact, one of the heads of an agency said he didn't remember a time \nwhen there was an inability to agree. There is also, clearly,\n\n[[Page S9887]]\n\nin the end, both in current law, as I understand it, and in the \nproposal we are making, if the rare situation occurs, you have to have \nsomebody in power to make that decision. Now it is the CIA. Under our \nproposal, it would be the national intelligence director.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate the response. I was just saying to my \ncolleague that my understanding of the reading of recent history has \nbeen that the power has not been adequate, with all due respect, and \nthat the history has indicated there have been times when it has not \nbeen satisfactory, the results have not been where they should have \nbeen, which would indicate to me that the status quo is not acceptable. \nThat is why I am asking whether the new language--I am trying to \nunderstand whether the new language is a significant improvement over \nthe status quo. We are on the floor under the understanding that the \nstatus quo is not acceptable. I congratulate my colleagues for trying \nto improve the status quo. I know they are working to do that. That is \nwhy I asked that question.\n  Let me move on to another question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If the Senator will yield, if I may respond. I want to \nrefer the Senator to page 14 of our bill in section 4, enumerating the \npowers of the national intelligence director. We say ``establish \ncollection and analysis requirements for the intelligence community to \ndetermine collection and analysis priorities, issue and manage \ncollection analysis tasking, and resolve conflicts in the tasking of \nelements of the intelligence community within the national intelligence \nprogram, except as otherwise agreed with the Secretary of Defense \npursuant to the direction of the President.''\n  So this is language that completely mirrors existing statute for the \nDirector of Central Intelligence. From testimony we heard, it is \nfortunately working very well that the conflicts, by the testimony of \nat least one head of one of the agencies, just do not occur; they work \nit out.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I say to my colleague that there are Members besides \nmyself who can privately tell the Senator that there is a history that \nwould indicate this does not work, that the status quo is not \nacceptable.\n  If what the Senator is telling me today is this is not really much \nchange from the status quo, then I say to my colleague that we have a \nmajor problem.\n  I reference the language in the old law. I think my colleague may be \nright, and let me read the old law, which is the status quo today, and \nthis is the power that the head of the intelligence community has \ntoday: establish the requirements and priorities to govern the \ncollection of national intelligence by elements of the intelligence \ncommunity; next, approve collection requirements; determine collection \npriorities and resolve conflicts in collection priorities levied on \nnational collection assets, except as otherwise agreed with the \nSecretary of Defense pursuant to the direction of the President.\n  Just on its face, one would think that resolving these conflicts is \nalready given to the DCI today, and that is why, frankly, I prefer the \nlanguage of the Specter amendment which talks about the director \noverseeing the execution of the national intelligence program and to \nsupervise, direct, and control the operations, which to me is the key \nlanguage.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator would yield on that point, I do not want \nthe Senator to mistakenly believe there are no changes in our bill with \nregard to current law. There is a very critical change.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I could reclaim my time, the problem is the colleague \nof the Senator just told me there was not much of a change at all, and \nthis is the problem with the language: One of the Senators saying there \nis a change and the other saying there is not much change. That is \nambiguous, which is the problem, with all due respect to both of my \ncolleagues, who are great friends. It is the language; it is not the \nSenators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Perhaps it was my language that was confusing. I do \nnot think the statutory language is.\n  The fact is, there is an addition of authority to the NID--there is \nno question about that--that the DCI does not have, and that is to \nissue and manage collection and analysis tasking.\n  What I was trying to say earlier, and I want to distinguish this, is \nthe current law enables the DCI to convene the agency representatives, \nwhich they do every day, to resolve and decide where our national \nassets go, and then to resolve a conflict, as described in the language \nthat I read from, which is what the current DCI has.\n  We have added, very importantly, and the Senator is right, the \nability of the national intelligence director additionally to issue and \nmanage collection and analysis tasking.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Reclaiming my time, so there is a change?\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will yield.\n  Ms. COLLINS. There is a very significant change, as I said to the \nSenator when he first raised this very important question. We recognize \nthat the current Director of the CIA cannot issue tasking, cannot \nrequire the collection of information, under this section of the law. \nThat is why we took language recommended by Senator Roberts, included \nit in the bill that I believe the Senator from Ohio may have \ncosponsored, which strengthened that authority by adding the language, \n``issue and manage collection and analysis tasking.'' That is not in \ncurrent law.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that. I will have to go back and study this \na little bit more.\n  I say to my colleague from Maine, I am happy with her answer when she \nresponded to my question, can this be ordered, and her response, I \nbelieve, was yes. In other words, under her bill the NID could order \nthe satellite to be moved. Because I think there is a problem.\n  The evidence is that in the past there have been some problems--I am \nnot saying it is a problem that occurs all the time; it probably gets \nworked out most of the time--but there have been some problems and I \nthink this needs to be a situation where there has been a problem or \nthere might be a problem, be ordered, it has to be. So I certainly \nappreciate the response.\n  Let me ask another question, if I could. Moving to the area of signal \nintelligence, NSA, let us say the NID, under the Senator's bill, \ndecided it was in our national interest to move the assets, move the \nresources, from listening to country X to terrorist Y organization. It \nis the same type of issue but again a real world issue. We are moving \nour assets; we have to make this decision very quickly in the real \nworld. Could that person order that to be done?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator would yield for a response.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield.\n  Ms. COLLINS. My answer would be the same. The NID has the authority, \nhas the power, to use the words of Senator from Ohio, to issue these \norders, to task these agencies to carry out these directives.\n  I note that because the NID has the authority to manage the budgets \nof these agencies, he has a pretty big stick to use as enforcement.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If we can just talk back and forth a minute, let me \ninterject and then the Senator can respond. I appreciate the progress \nthe Senator has made in regard to the budget, and I think that is very \nimportant, but we have seen from our work on the Intelligence \nCommittee, in looking at the intelligence community, a lot of these \ndecisions that are being dealt with in the real world, are very time \nsensitive so when a budget change is made, we are talking about the \nnext year or 2 years. Those are very important. They are changing \ndirections. That is important. So I congratulate the Senator for making \nthat change.\n  I am not concerned that the Senator has not done that in her bill. \nThe Senator has done that. What I am concerned about is the execution. \nFor example, I see in the Specter language: direct, oversee, execute \nthe national intelligence program. Then he goes on to say: supervise, \ndirect, and control the operations of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nthe National Security Agency, et cetera.\n  So what I see in the Specter language that gives me a great deal of \ncomfort is\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\n``supervise, direct, control operations.'' To me, ``operations'' is the \nkey language because now we are dealing with things that are very time \nsensitive.\n  What I worry about is not the long-term planning. I am convinced that \nthe Senator has taken care of that and I congratulate her for that. \nWhat I worry about is real world examples that I have now, such as we \nare listening to one country, or we have assets over here that we need \nto move very quickly over here and target a terrorist organization, and \nsay we have limited assets, can we do that. It is a hypothetical, but \ncould that decision be made?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I think the Senator from Ohio is \nraising excellent, important questions in this debate, but he is \ncreating a misimpression of what the bill does with regard to budget \nauthority.\n  This is not 1 year off or 2 years off. The NID has budget execution \nauthority, not just putting the budget together for presentation and \nrecommendation to the President; he executes the budget as the year \ngoes by. He has strong authority to reprogram funds with congressional \napproval and notification, I hasten to say, and to transfer funds.\n  He has extensive authority to transfer personnel. He has the right \nunder our bill to appoint the heads of these agencies with concurrence \nfrom the Secretary of Defense. That is a major change from current law.\n  If the Senator from Ohio is saying, as he is, that the NID should \nhave direct line authority over the day-to-day operations of these \ncombat support agencies, I disagree with the Senator from Ohio. I \nbelieve it does not make sense and, in fact, the NID could not handle \nrunning these agencies day to day. As Senator Levin indicated earlier, \nyou would have to create an enormous supervisory staff within the \noffice of the NID if you were going to transfer that authority from the \nSecretary of Defense. Clearly, the NID has the authority to direct the \ncollection and analysis of information by the heads of these agencies, \nbut I do not think he should be running them day to day.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I could follow that up with a question, since the \nSenator raised it--and I think I know her answer, but I want to make \nsure I do understand her answer--talking about moving people around, \naccording to the newspapers--this is what is published in the \nnewspapers--there is a problem with a backlog apparently in listening \nto tapes of intercepts, at least that is what has been in the \nnewspaper. Would the NID have the authority to move linguists from one \nagency to another to correct that problem? For example, if they had to, \nthey could move them from the DIA to the CIA?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DeWINE. This person, he or she, could pick up the phone and say: \nWe are going to move 50 people, 100 people from over here to over \nthere?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DeWINE. This person does not have to call the SECDEF, does not \nhave to do anything?\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will yield so I can respond to his \nquestion.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Surely.\n  Ms. COLLINS. There is very strong authority for the NID to transfer \npersonnel who are working within the national intelligence program \nthroughout the Federal Government and, indeed, I would envision the \nstaffing of the National Counterterrorism Center would come from the \nNID taking linguists, analysts, operatives, collectors--all sorts of \nexpertise--from the various intelligence agencies. And I know for a \nfact we need to give the NID that power because I visited with the head \nof the Terrorist Threat Integration Center who does not have that power \nand finds it very difficult to get the personnel resources he needs.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate the answer. So the Senator is saying this \nperson can actually go in to DIA and say: I want those people. I want \nthem. We are going to take them from DIA, and we are going to put them \nover here at CIA because I know best what the priorities need to be, \nand this is national security, and we are going to get it done.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator yield for a response?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I certainly will.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The DIA employees who are part of the national \nintelligence program, yes, the answer is yes. DIA employees who are \npart of DOD's tactical intelligence programs, which are outside the \nscope of the authority of the NID, the answer in that case would be no. \nSo it depends. But if they are part of the national intelligence \nprogram, which thousands of DIA employees are, the answer is yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that. What I do not understand, though, is \nwhat I thought I heard earlier on about the Senator's distinction \nbetween tasking and control. That does sound like control to me. The \nSenator from Maine is saying they can task but they cannot control. \nBasically, that sounds like control to me if you can move someone.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I disagree with the Senator, so I do not know how to \nrespond. I was saying the NID does not run the day-to-day, daily \noperations of the NSA, for example.\n  Mr. DeWINE. And I appreciate that. But in direct response to my \nquestion, the Senator is saying that person could, in fact, make that \ncommand decision, pick up the phone and say, ``We are moving 50 \npeople,'' and that would be done, and that would be it. I want to make \nsure on the record because I think it is going to be very important 2 \nyears from now or 18 months from now, and I would hate for the NID \nperson to come before our committee and say: ``I can't move people \naround.''\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will yield for a response.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I direct the Senator from Ohio to the \nexact language in the bill. On page 27, starting on line 21:\n\n       (C) in accordance with procedures to be developed by the \n     National Intelligence Director, transfer personnel of the \n     intelligence community funded through the National \n     Intelligence Program from one element of the intelligence \n     community to another element of the intelligence community;\n\n  I think that language is crystal clear that the NID could, indeed, \ntake a linguist from the counterterrorism division of the FBI and \ntransfer that individual to the National Counterterrorism Center, or an \nanalyst from DIA who is funded through the national intelligence \nprogram and shift that individual to the counterterrorism center. I \nthink it is very clear.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from Maine for answering these \nquestions. As always, she is very eloquent and has been very thoughtful \nin her questions and her work on the bill. I congratulate her for the \ngood work she has done.\n  Madam President, I do appreciate my colleague's answers. I will be \nvoting in favor of the Specter amendment simply because I think it is \nmore clear. I think it adds something to this bill. I think it makes it \nmore specific. It is clear. When we are done with our work, then it \nwill be up to the great bureaucracy, the men and women who are out \nthere to defend us--and I do not use ``bureaucracy'' in a derogatory \nway at all; these are great people doing wonderful work out there who \nare defending us--it will be up to them to make this work. We have an \nobligation to do our best to give them something that will work and to \ngive them the language that will allow the clearest lines of authority.\n  I believe if you take the Collins-Lieberman bill, which is good work, \nand you then add the Specter amendment, the Specter amendment makes it \nclearer, makes it more precise, and makes the lines of authority much \neasier to understand.\n  I believe it also will deal with a concern I have had for a long \ntime, as we saw this reform coming, and that is my fear that we would \ncreate this new position, give them authority, and do a pretty good \njob, but not quite give them all the authority this person needs.\n  We have had the opportunity in the Intelligence Committee to listen \nto some of the things that have gone wrong for the last few years, and \nthere have been a lot of things that have gone wrong. It is not only \norganization. It is not only line authority. It is not only the fact \nthat the DCI did not have enough power, but that is part of it. This \nbill goes a ways to deal with that. I believe the Specter amendment \nimproves it further and makes it clearer, and is the right way to go.\n  Somebody has to be in charge. The buck has to stop somewhere. Never\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\nagain do we want to be in a position where it is not clear who is in \ncharge. Never again does this country want to be in a position where \nthe top person in intelligence doesn't have all the authority he or she \nneeds to protect us, to protect our children, to protect our families. \nThe Specter amendment will make it very clear where the buck stops. The \nbuck will stop with this person whom we are now calling the NID and who \nis called the NID under the Collins-Lieberman bill. So I will vote in \nfavor of the Specter amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Ohio would address a question \nwhich his question raised in my mind, having spent a lot of time trying \nto figure out what the line is, in terms of supervision and control. \nLet me put the hypothetical this way. I would also appreciate the \nmanagers perhaps listening to it as well.\n  We have a new national intelligence director. The first question the \nSenator from Ohio asked, the first that I heard, at least, was: Can \nthat director direct, order--in the words of the chairman, ``task''--\nthe collection, let's say, of signals intelligence in Iraq instead of \nAfghanistan? Can he or she make that decision?\n  We only have certain resources. We have to allocate them. Can that \ndirector, after consulting, presumably--because these are day-to-day \nconsultations, as the Senator from Connecticut says; these go on every \nsingle day, these decisions on allocations and priorities. But \nhopefully, after going through that process, can that NID, that \ndirector, say: OK, folks, I have heard it; we have to make a decision. \nWe are collecting signals in Iraq; we are not going to do it in \nAfghanistan.\n  The chairman's answer was ``yes.'' It seems to me that ought to be \nvery reassuring to folks.\n  The next question is, should that director be responsible for \ndeciding which airplane it is that is going to do the collection? My \ngood friend from Ohio says no, I think, shaking his head no. But that \nis what is left to the day-to-day operations. That is why you need to \nleave that decision on which airplane is going to go over Iraq to the \nday-to-day operational decisions inside of that agency. You can't \ntransfer all of those decisions to a NID. That is where I think the \nSenator from Ohio would draw the line, I hope. That is clearly where I \ndraw the line.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I could respond?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DeWINE. My colleague and I have, I think, the same objectives. My \ncolleague from Maine and I have the same objectives. I think our \ndifferences are, frankly, down to what language accomplishes this. I \nthink, also, I have more skepticism and bring to the table maybe more \nskepticism about how the world works. I am usually the optimist. But on \nthis I am skeptical about the ability of this new position, someone \nwhom we are now throwing into a newly created position, to be able to \ndrive his or her agenda. I am concerned about it. I think it is a \nconcern based on reason. There is a reason to be concerned about it, \nknowing the bureaucracy and how it works.\n  I think the Specter language is more clear, it is more precise: \nSupervise, direct, control operations. That doesn't mean picking planes \nor worrying about the day-to-day activities. That is not how I \ninterpret it. It is not how I interpret it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I don't know any other way you \ncan.\n  Mr. DeWINE. It is your time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield to respond, and I don't want to \ninterrupt, but that is exactly what the words ``controlling \noperations'' mean. That is what the word ``operations'' means.\n  I think the Senator from Ohio is correct in pressing for clear \nanswers to the wording in the bill. There are plenty of places where I \nhave some similar questions which I will be raising by amendment, but I \ndon't think this is one of them. I don't think this is one of the \nplaces. Because I think the bill is clear here that when the NID issues \ncollection tasking, that is exactly what the Senator from Ohio wants, \nis to issue collection tasking, I believe.\n  But what I believe the Senator from Ohio does not want is to control \nthe day-to-day operations as to how that task will be carried out. Yet \nthat is what the Specter language results in.\n  Rather than clarifying this issue as between the order or the task, \nand how you are going to carry it out, it blurs the issue. Because once \nthe Senator from Ohio says it is not his understanding of the Specter \nlanguage that the operations which will now be assigned to NID include \nthe day-to-day operations, then where is that line drawn? If it is not \nthe day-to-day operations, if you are truly shifting those agencies to \nthe responsibility and control of the NID, of course he is responsible \nfor the day-to-day operations. Where is the line, where is the \noperations point divided between the NID who controls operations under \nSpecter and the operations not controlled by the NID, under your \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I can respond, I understand my colleague's point. It \nstrikes me that we have come a long way in this debate and the \nevolution of this bill. I think we have gone in the correct direction. \nI look at where we were 2 months ago or 3 months ago in this debate--it \nis all for the good. When every one of us speaking on the Senate floor, \nall four of us who are down here at this moment are basically saying we \nwant the same thing and what we are now debating, I believe, is the \nlanguage to get there. I think my colleagues, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Collins, my colleague from Michigan, would agree we are saying \nbasically we want the same thing. I think that is good.\n\n  We are going to vote different ways on the Specter amendment, but I \nthink this is progress because there is a consensus that has emerged \nthat we want this head of intelligence in this country to be \naccountable, to have the control that person lacking them has, so the \nbuck will stop with that person, so when they come in front of our \ncommittee we can't hear the excuses. It is going to be a great \nimprovement.\n  I congratulate my colleagues for the great work they have done. I \nthink this debate we have had here for the last 45 minutes has been a \nvery good one. I think we have clarified some things and we clearly \nclarified, at least in my mind, the intent of the authors of this bill.\n  I think we created some interesting legislative history about what \nthe power of this person should be. There should be no doubt in any \nperson's mind in the future, NID or anyone who has to deal with him, \nwhat their powers should be in this area. I think that is all for the \ngood.\n  I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Ohio.\n  In closing, I do have some questions about certain words in this \nparticular paragraph which I will raise later on the floor, relative \nparticularly to the establishment of requirements, because I think the \nconsumer must establish the requirements and not the NID. I think there \nis also an issue about analysis, because I think we ought to be \npromoting greater numbers of analyses, and not getting into group-\nthink. We should be promoting independent, objective analysis and I \nthink this wording probably or unintentionally could concentrate or \ncentralize that in a NID.\n  I think that is an unintended result, but we can discuss that later. \nBut on this one issue that is raised in this amendment, it seems to me \nthis amendment goes exactly in the direction all of us want, which is \nwe need somebody to make a tasking decision, to have that power, and to \ndo it exactly as our friend from Ohio said. You can't at a critical \nmoment have that confused or diffused or uncertain. If something has to \nbe done quickly, someone has to make a decision, and the person who \nmakes a decision in this bill is clearly the NID on the tasking of the \nintelligence. That is where the decision, it seems to me, has to \nreside.\n  But again, I think the Specter amendment, because it goes into the \noperational side after the task is issued, goes too far, and rather \nthan clarifying an issue will put the responsibility purportedly on \nsomebody who can't handle that responsibility, who doesn't have the \nhorses to handle that responsibility inside of his agency, unless you \nrecreate the entire Department of Defense almost inside the NID\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\nin order to carry out those day-to-day operations to effectuate the \ntask collection which properly belongs with the NID.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, before the Senator from Ohio leaves \nthe floor, I want to thank him. Although we disagree on the Specter \namendment, his questions have illuminated the details of the underlying \nGovernmental Affairs Committee proposal in a way that I as one of the \nsponsors feel shows a balance, which is we are trying to do something \nthe 9/11 Commission says we urgently and desperately need to do, which \nis to fill the gap where the Commission said there is no one in charge \nof America's intelligence today--a lot of great assets but no one in \ncharge. It is like an army without a general or a football team without \na quarterback.\n  So we are creating a national intelligence director. We are giving \nthat position, that strength, which the current director of Central \nIntelligence doesn't have. We are separating that position from the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency. But we are not giving the \ndirector line authority over the constituent agencies. He is going to \nbe there to call the plays, if you will, to resolve conflicts, to make \nsure all the assets of the intelligence community--here we do have \ntotally shared goals--are serving the national interest and all of the \ncustomers of the intelligence community and, most importantly, serving \nthe President of the United States who represents the national \ninterest, but not in control with line authority over the constituent \nagencies.\n  As has been said, we think that will make, and the 9/11 Commission \nsaid it will create, a top-heavy organization. We don't need to do it.\n  I am quoting Secretary of State Powell's statement which he made to \nus on September 13 when he testified at a hearing. He said:\n\n  The director of central intelligence was there before but the DCI did \nnot have that kind of authority.\n  I add parenthetically that is the authority we are giving the \nnational intelligence director.\n  Colin Powell said:\n\n       In this town, it is budget authority that counts. Can you \n     move money? Can you set standards for people? Do you have the \n     access needed to the President? The NID will have all of \n     that. I think this is a far more powerful player, and that \n     will help the State Department.\n\n  There is a substantial transformation of what exists now. But it \ndoesn't remove day-to-day control over operations from the individual \ndepartments. It is that balance that is part of the strength of our \nproposal, I submit to my colleagues. There are those on both sides who \nare unhappy about our balance. Senator Specter is stating it much too \nsimplistically and we didn't go far enough to give power to the NID, so \nhis amendment would effectively create a secretary of intelligence with \nline control over all the constituent parts of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  There will be other amendments from people who feel we have gone too \nfar, particularly with regard to the Department of Defense, because in \nfact we do change budget control authority from the Department of \nDefense to the national intelligence director, to strengthen that \nposition for exactly the reason Secretary Powell says, acknowledging \nthat the intelligence director serves the President and the entire \nGovernment insofar as Government agencies need good intelligence, \nincluding the State Department. And the Secretary effectively said to \nus, he explicitly said, he is confident that the State Department will \nget more and better intelligence which it needs to advise the President \non the conduct of our foreign policy. It is critical. Obviously, the \nneeds for the Defense Department and warfighters are also critical, but \nthey are not the only ones who need intelligence in our Government. The \nnew director will, I think, better be able to satisfy all of those \ncustomers for the best possible intelligence.\n  I think it has been a helpful debate. I hope our colleagues who are \nnot on the floor are keeping an ear to the debate, or at least their \nstaff is, because it reminds me of some of the debates we had in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee which ultimately led us to a point where \nthere were many disagreements along the way, with almost 50 amendments \nfiled, where the bill was reported out of committee on a nonpartisan \nvote, unanimous vote.\n  I don't have explicit hopes that will happen in the full Senate, but \nI look forward to as thoughtful an exchange as we have just had, \nleading to a resounding vote for the kind of transformational reform of \nour intelligence community that the 9/11 Commission recommends, which \nwe all know is desperately needed as soon as possible to better protect \nthe American people from the clear and present danger of terrorist \nattacks.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there any time limit on speaking right \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is a vote set for 2:15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the Senate to make extensive \nremarks on this bill. I do so with the full realization that my \nschedule prevented me from attending the hearings of the committee on \nwhich I am a member, chaired by Senator Collins and the ranking member, \nSenator Lieberman. I commend them for their activities through July and \nAugust with the hearings they conducted. During that period of time, \nthe Senator from Hawaii and I were in a parliamentary conference with \nthe Chinese National Peoples Congress, and we had other events that \nprevented us from being in Washington while they conducted the \nhearings.\n  I preface this to say I voted for the bill to come out of the \ncommittee, but at the time I stated specifically to the managers of the \nbill that I would have some amendments in the Senate and whether I \nvoted for the final passage of this bill would depend upon the outcome \nof some of those amendments.\n  Let me also say in this preface to my comments that as the staff \nreports were prepared by the 9/11 Commission, and my staff delivered \nthose to me from the Internet and I read those--I also read the report \nwhen it first came out--and then, on the increased pressure that came \nfrom the members of the former 9/11 Commission to have early \nconsideration of this subject, I reread the report and formed some very \nfixed opinions about this subject.\n  I have never seen members of a Commission, which went out of \nexistence upon delivering the report, lobby the Congress so hard. My \nunderstanding is they raised a considerable amount of money, rehired \nsome of their staff, and are currently lobbying the Congress. I do hope \nthey have complied with the lobbying laws. In any event, this pressure \nhas been significant and it is compelling the Congress to judgment in a \nvery short period of time, in my judgment.\n  As I said, I have read and reread the 9/11 Commission Report. Last \nweek, our Appropriations Committee held hearings on the report \nrecommendations. We did that because when I returned to Washington I \nfound there was a series of people who indicated they had not been \nheard by the Governmental Affairs Committee who wanted to have an \nopportunity to present testimony to the Congress.\n  We heard from Dr. Henry Kissinger; from three former military \ncommanders in chief: GEN Joe Ralston, U.S. Air Force, retired, former \ncommander of the U.S. European Command and supreme allied commander of \nEurope and NATO; ADM Dennis Blair, U.S. Navy, retired, former commander \nof the U.S. Pacific Command; ADM James Ellis, retired, former commander \nof the U.S. Strategic Command. Our committee also heard testimony from \nDr. John Hamre, president and CEO of the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies and former Under Secretary of Defense. We heard \nfrom Judge Richard Posner of the Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit, and Dale Watson, former Executive Assistant Director \nof Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence for the FBI.\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\n  Our committee spent 2 days listening to the testimony on the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations. Each witness who appeared was an expert \nin his field with years of dedicated service to the Nation. After \nlistening to their thoughts and suggestions, I have come to the \nconclusion we have only begun to scratch the surface for what needs to \nbe considered by the Congress before we finally act on this subject.\n  Copies of the hearings we held before the Appropriations Committee \nhave been given to every Senator and to all intelligence-related staff \nof the Senate. They are available to anyone who wishes. They were \nprinted as a public document.\n  Since the passage of the National Security Act in 1947, at least 19 \ncommissions, committees, and panels have made recommendations aimed at \nreorganizing our Nation's intelligence community. Those proposals have \nled to changes in internal agency direction, precedence, or directive, \nand to new statutes, but none of those reports were adopted in their \nentirety or in this type of timeframe or context.\n  During last week's hearings before our committee, Senator Inouye \nasked whether it would be wise for Congress to make a decision about \nrestructuring the intelligence community in the next 2 weeks. Judge \nPosner, who is a very erudite professor of law at the University of \nChicago in addition to being a Federal circuit judge--he also recently \nauthored a very thoughtful article on intelligence reform in the New \nYork Times--testified he thought it would be ``unwise and most \nunfortunate.'' He expressed doubts that the analytical problems could \nbe resolved in that timeframe and expressed concerns that the \nPresidential campaign and politics should not be the right setting for \nthis reform.\n  I agree with Judge Posner. However, I have approached this \nlegislation as a committee member with an open mind, and I am hopeful \nthat the Senate will move forward on some reforms during this year.\n  I do have concerns about current efforts to restructure the Nation's \nintelligence community. For starters, the witnesses I heard last week \nrevealed serious issues with the underlying document for these efforts. \nThat was the \n9/11 Commission Report. The Commission's recommendations do not reflect \ntheir own account of what happened on September 11. As Judge Posner \nsaid before our committee:\n\n       The first 338 pages of the commission's report are an \n     extremely detailed and thorough narrative of the background \n     to the attacks themselves, and the immediate response.\n       It is a very fine job. . . . Then after that, the \n     commission goes off on what is really a different tangent in \n     considering organizational change because it is not clear, \n     from reading their narrative, that the problems were \n     organization[al] problems for which organization[al] \n     solutions or reorganization would be indicated. So I think \n     there is a mismatch between this very detailed narrative and \n     a rather more summary discussion of organizational change \n     that really does not match the problems that the report \n     itself had identified.\n\n  That is the end of Judge Posner's quote.\n  Because the Commission's recommendations are somewhat divorced from \nits own account of what happened on 9/11, the Commission adopts, in my \nview, a flawed vantage point from which to suggest reforms. For \nexample, one of the concerns Judge Posner expressed in our hearings \nlast week was that the report--and again I quote--\n\n       . . . really is oriented toward preventing not new threats, \n     but a repetition of 9/11. Now, an exact repetition of 9/11 is \n     extremely unlikely because that has already happened. We know \n     about that. What I think we have to worry [more] about [is \n     the threat of] biological terrorism, nuclear terrorism, \n     agricultural terrorism because, you know, destruction of \n     agriculture by biological weapons could be as destructive as \n     biological warfare against people. So we ought to try to \n     think about the disasters that have not happened, but that is \n     very difficult to do, so we tend to think about what has \n     already happened.\n\n  That is the end of Judge Posner's comments about that.\n  As we debate this legislation, one of the things we must keep in mind \nis there have been substantial changes in our intelligence-gathering \nmethods and operations since 9/11. We personally witnessed those on \ntrips to Afghanistan and Iraq during this past year. The situation we \nfaced in the morning of 9/11 is not the situation we face today, and \nthe threats, although related, are not identical. Efforts to reorganize \nthe intelligence community must take into account the current state of \noperations and the broad scope of the risks we face. We cannot be \nmesmerized by just one threat.\n  As I said, I am not opposed to intelligence reform. But any changes \nshould reflect the current context of intelligence. Since 9/11, many \nmembers of the intelligence community have testified before Senate \ncommittees, and they have told us they are doing things differently, \nthat today there is a free flow of ideas that did not exist before 9/\n11. Congress should not take any action that might--intentionally or \nunintentionally--stifle that progress.\n  I support many aspects of this legislation. I am in favor of the \ncreation of a national intelligence director who can serve as the \nPresident's primary intelligence adviser. I also support the creation \nof a national counterterrorism center. However, I am very concerned \nabout the way the NID's role is defined in this legislation. I urge \nMembers to read it. Read it. Look at the pages. There are nine and a \nhalf pages that describe the powers of this person. It would do well \nfor people to understand what it says, what the real context of this \nis. This person is going to be a very unique individual. What I fear \nis, this person is going to assemble underneath the NID a series of \nstaff people who will be telling other people what to do based upon \ntheir understanding of what the director of NID intended to do. Quoting \nfrom the bill:\n\n       The National Intelligence Director shall--\n       determine the annual budget for the intelligence and \n     intelligence-related activities of the United States by--\n       providing to the heads of the departments containing \n     agencies or elements within the intelligence community and \n     that have one or more programs, projects, or activities with \n     the National Intelligence program, and to the heads of such \n     agencies and elements, guidance for development [of] the \n     National Intelligence Program budget pertaining to such \n     agencies or elements. . . .\n\n  It goes on, all the way through. The national intelligence director \nis in charge of preparing the annual defense budgets, including those \nfor the Department of Defense related to military intelligence \nprograms, with the concurrence of the Secretary. He would be in charge \nof ``collection and analysis requirements'' for the entire intelligence \ncommunity. He is going to have to ``provide advisory tasking on the \ncollection of intelligence to elements of the United States Government \nhaving information collection'' activities. He will have the right to \ngo to any Department or agency of the Federal Government and say, \n``What are you doing?'' and have access to their information. He will \n``manage and oversee the National Counterterrorism Center,'' which, \nagain, I say, I do believe in that type of center, but can he manage \nthat and be a director at the same time?\n  I urge the Senate to look at the job description of this one person. \nNo person on Earth can do all those things. What he is going to do is \nassemble a whole series of subordinates who will tell the existing \nagency heads, many of whom are constitutional officers, Secretaries, \nconfirmed by the Senate, to perform the functions of their Department. \nBut this person is going to have assistants telling those Secretaries \nwhat to do and demanding they have access to information those \nSecretaries have collected through their own processes. Now, I think, \nif you read this, this is an enormous task for any individual. An NID \nis needed, but that type of bureaucracy that is set up by this bill is \njust overwhelming.\n  He also ensures ``that appropriate officials of the United States \nGovernment . . . have access to a variety of intelligence assessments \nand analytical views,'' protecting ``intelligence sources and \nmethods,'' establishing ``requirements and procedures for the \nclassification of intelligence.''\n  He is a czar, one person. Now, we know not one person can do all \nthose things. This means to me a new level of bureaucracy, an appointed \nlevel, not described in this bill at all. But he is going to have a \nseries of people working for him. I am told there will probably be 800 \npeople in this office of national intelligence director. There is the \nflaw. There is the flaw, and the President's letter yesterday mentioned \nit.\n  This legislation also gives the NID authority to set security, \npersonnel, and informational technology standards all the way across \nthe intelligence\n\n[[Page S9892]]\n\ncommunity. In other words, no matter whether you are the FBI, CIA, or \nDIA, you must follow the standards set by the NID to do your business. \nUnheard of, just unheard of.\n  This also includes the establishment and direction over information \nsharing. This person alone will determine who shares what information. \nNow, I believe this effort will create more problems than it solves. \nJudge Posner, again, addressed this in his testimony to our committee \nlast week. He said:\n\n       The commission thinks the reason the bits of information \n     that might have been assembled into a mosaic spelling 9/11 \n     never came together in one place is that no one person was in \n     charge of intelligence.\n\n  He means at that time. But he said:\n\n       That is not the reason. The reason, or rather, the reasons \n     are, first, that the volume of information is so vast that \n     even with the continued rapid advances in data processing it \n     cannot be collected, stored, and retrieved and analyzed in a \n     single database. . . .\n\n  That is an objective of this bill. Anyone in the industry will tell \nyou it is not possible yet.\n\n       Second, legitimate security concerns limit the degree to \n     which confidential information can safely be shared, \n     especially given the ever-present threat of moles like the \n     infamous Aldrich Ames.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, still quoting Judge Posner:\n\n       And third, the different intelligence services and the \n     subunits of each service tend, because information is power, \n     to hoard it. Efforts to centralize the intelligence function \n     are likely to lengthen the time it takes for intelligence and \n     analyses to reach the President, reduce diversity and \n     competition in the gathering and analysis of intelligence \n     data, limit the number of threats given serious consideration \n     and deprive the President of a range of alternative \n     interpretations of ambiguous and incomplete data--and \n     intelligence data will usually be ambiguous and incomplete.\n\n  That is, again, the end of Judge Posner's comment.\n  Giving the NID information-sharing authority may actually prove to be \ncounterproductive. The implications Judge Posner raises need full \ndebate and discussion. I hope we will have some of that today. At the \nvery least, we cannot assume that Congress has rectified this problem \nby simply vesting information-sharing authority in one individual, only \none individual, because that is the process for information sharing.\n  What if, in a later administration, the NID wants more centralized \ncontrol? What if that person shares the viewpoint of the prior \nadministration that there should be walls between these agencies? He \nwill determine when they learn what is going on between one agency and \nanother. That is the implication of what we are hearing here. We took \ndown the walls with the PATRIOT Act. We said no more walls. Yet here is \none person who determines the total rules for sharing. And probably \nunder the current atmosphere, the return to the walls is impossible, \nbut this authority does not prevent walls.\n  There is no limit on the NID's concept of sharing. That person alone \nwill determine what sharing is between agencies and who gets the \ninformation and who has access to it.\n  I am also concerned about the language in this legislation concerning \nthe structure of the office of NID. I mentioned that before. We don't \nneed to create a new bureaucracy here, and it seems to me this \nlegislation risks doing just that. We need to delete or significantly \nrevise the parts of this bill that delve into unnecessary or excessive \ndetail about the organization of the office of NID. Again, I call the \nattention of Senators to the bill itself. It has greater detail \nconcerning specific authority for one individual than I have ever seen.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy, dated September 28, \nspecifically addressed this issue of creating ``a cumbersome new \nbureaucracy'' or ``legislated mandated bureaucracy will hinder, not \nhelp, in the effort to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to \npreserve our constitutional rights.''\n  Continuing from the administration's letter:\n\n       The Administration urges the Senate to delete or \n     significantly revise these problematic provisions.\n\n  We will have amendments to do just that at a later time.\n  I believe we must take time to carefully consider the people in the \nfield now and how this legislation will impact them. I recently had \noccasion to meet with the chiefs of station of the CIA from around the \nworld. I was most impressed with what they said about how long it takes \nto establish a position as a chief of station and how long it takes to \ndevelop assets who have the willingness and the ability to go into a \nneighboring country or in the same country they are in and try to \nobtain the information we need about developments that might threaten \nour future.\n  Currently there are 175,000 persons working in the intelligence \ncommunity. One hundred fifty thousand of them are military personnel \ntoday. They do an incredible job with much personal sacrifice, many \nunder difficult circumstances and far away from their families for \nyears. The creation of the NID will have serious consequences for them \nand the Department of Defense intelligence personnel. The consequences \nfor the Department of Defense intelligence personnel must be carefully \nconsidered as we adopt these reforms.\n  I don't believe you can alter one piece of this puzzle without having \nan impact somewhere else. I am concerned not only about the impact the \nlegislation will have in terms of unintended consequences of the big \npicture but also the impact it will have on our career intelligence \noperatives who are working out in the field today.\n  I hope to go on to that later. We had a gap in our development of \nhuman intelligence, and it was a serious gap for a series of years. It \ntakes more than 5 years to develop one of these people. Now we are \noperating with a group of human intelligence experts which is very \nlimited.\n  This legislation says the NID will ``establish intelligence \ncollection and analysis requirements for the intelligence community.'' \nThis arrangement will centralize the prioritization and control of \nintelligence and, I believe, could detrimentally affect military \nleaders outside Washington, DC.\n  The NID would inevitably focus on the current crisis in Washington--I \nassume, this doesn't say anywhere, that NID will be here, somewhere \nnear the President--possibly shortchanging the long-term collection and \nanalysis needed for intelligence preparation for battlefields in \ndistant regions.\n\n  Currently there is a diversity within intelligence. I do believe in a \nNID, but I believe in more of a coordinator than a commander. This \ncreates a new commander in chief of intelligence. The Constitution \ndidn't create one. I do believe this is a very difficult proposition \nthe way it is described, what the powers and authorities will be.\n  When combat occurs, intelligence could swing into full force to \nsupport the troops, but by then it would be too late. We need a \nconsistent peacetime intelligence effort to ensure that we can either \navoid conflict or give U.S. forces high-quality information when they \nmust engage an enemy.\n  I am also concerned about the nature of the NID position. Right now \nwe have one agency that deals with domestic threats and another that \ndeals with foreign threats. There are reasons for this division.\n  Domestic and international threats are distinct and require different \nintelligence tactics and strategies. The NID collapses international \nand domestic intelligence concerns into one position, one control, one \ndefinition authority, and one access authority. I do believe that this \nis the kind of situation Judge Posner warned us about last week where \nwe would have an intelligence community that is too rough on our \ncitizens or too gentle with foreign threats because it needs to adhere \nto uniform policies across the domestic and international context. If \nthat is not the intent, the bill should so state.\n  There is a reason for different approaches to foreign threats than \nthose that are internal within our constitutional authorities. I \nbelieve Judge Posner's warning ought to be listened to by the Senate. \nWe do not need an intelligence community that is too rough on our own \ncitizens and too gentle with foreign threats.\n  I believe the NID position should reflect what Dale Watson, another \nwitness before our committee, recommended last week. He has a long \nservice in the FBI intelligence division. This was his judgment:\n\n       This position must be a job and not a position. The \n     individual who has this responsibility of being the NID needs \n     to work within the NID and within the intelligence community. \n     The NID should not be a public relations job. The NID should \n     not be on the\n\n[[Page S9893]]\n\n     speaking circuit or conducting liaison. The NID should be a \n     central-focused individual that looks at where [we] are \n     across the board in all areas. . . . I think the NID ought to \n     be a term appointment. I think the NID has to have the \n     responsibility and be able to do the task.\n\n  What we are really saying is, Congress should not rush to implement \nthe recommendations put forth in the 9/11 Commission report. For my \npart, I hope to spend more time in the Chamber listening to my \ncolleagues and exchanging views on this legislation.\n  As of now I am inclined to support a course that creates a national \nintelligence director and a national counterterrorism center, gives \nthem 6 months to get up and running, and then invites them to come and \ntell those of us in Congress who must make the final decision what \nadditional authorities and changes they actually need. This director \nought to become familiar with what we have now before he tries to fix \nit.\n\n  That is one of the things we learned as young men, I thought. If the \nwatch is running and it works, you ought not to try to fix it until you \nknow that there might be some way you can improve it.\n  This situation is just the opposite. I do think we ought to look \nforward in this week to a debate that is one that will be productive so \nthat the changes in the administration's letter we received yesterday \nare not only listened to but they are accommodated to the maximum \nextent possible.\n  I have a series of questions that I want to read into the Record. \nThese are questions I intend to ask the managers of these bills as we \ngo through this process. It is a long list of questions, I will say. \nThe first is in regard to military personnel.\n  Based on the fact there is no differentiation between civilian and \nmilitary personnel in your bill, could the NID have the power to hold \nmilitary personnel for more than their stated rotations, more than \ntheir career path that they are on? For example, could they hold a \nmilitary person at the National Counterterrorism Center longer than is \ndetailed from the Department of Defense? If they could, what is the \neffect on their ability for promotion in the future? If needed for a \nmilitary mission, how would the Secretary of Defense or one of the \nservice chiefs be able to have that military individual returned to a \nnonintelligence program or position?\n  Is it true that once in the NID, the NID has control over the \nindividual person's future, particularly when, I remind the Senate, \nagain, 80 percent of the people we are talking about are Department of \nDefense people, most of whom have career programs, are on a career \npath, and part of that path involves being an intelligence official for \na period of time?\n  Also, based on the educational requirements designated for personnel \nin the national intelligence program by the national intelligence \ndirector, how would this be reconciled for those military personnel who \nmust complete military education courses for the advancement of their \ncareers?\n  Periodically, particularly the officers, and some noncommissioned \nofficers, must complete additional military education courses in order \nto move upward, have upward mobility in their particular service.\n  Also, how much control would the DOD have over military personnel \nassigned to the NID? Would the NID control their assignments and their \ncareers? How would the NID ensure that they have the requisite training \nand assignments to remain competitive for promotion within their parent \nmilitary service? What role does the Secretary of Defense have in \nmeeting the statutory responsibilities in title 10 and title 5 for the \nArmed Forces personnel?\n  I have heard comments that this new national intelligence director \norganization could, as I said, be in excess of 800 people. If that is \ntrue, it would seem that this legislation will create a new bureaucracy \nto deal with intelligence.\n  So I asked the managers directly, how large will the national \nintelligence director organization be? Does the NID have unlimited \nability to hire people? Where would the personnel for such a structure \ncome from? There is already a shortage of intelligence people in the \nintelligence community. Where are these people going to come from? Is \nhe going to take them from the CIA or the DIA? And if he does, do they \nlose their career path? Is everybody subject to the control of the NID? \nCan he tell them you must come? I thought intelligence was a volunteer \norganization. I think it must be if we are to be successful.\n  Why does this legislation single out the FBI for the NID's ability to \nfix the rate of pay? This bill gives only the NID the power to fix the \nrate of pay for the FBI and the intelligence section. Why doesn't it \nextend this to all personnel involved if he is to be so powerful? It \nseems to be a very strange section.\n  The number of qualified personnel in the intelligence field is fairly \nlimited. Will the creation of the NID and this organization dilute the \nnumbers? How long would it take to build and to grow the additional \nnumbers if they are required in order to create and fulfill the \nobligations of the director under this reorganization?\n  I have some questions about the Department of Defense directly. If \nthe national intelligence assets are transferred to a new national \nintelligence director, how do we ensure to our military commanders that \nnational assets will be reliably available to them before a conflict? \nThey have control under this bill when the conflict comes, when they \nhave the right to obtain their own intelligence. How will the \nDepartment of Defense relate to its defense support agencies, such as \nthe NRO, National Reconnaissance Agency, or NSA, or the National Geo \nspatial-Intelligence Agency, NGA, if they are effectively under the \nnational intelligence agency? Will they still be combat support \nagencies, subject to the military leaders, as they are now--the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense? Where does this fit in? \nWill the NID have the power to convert current military positions into \ncivilian positions? Where does he recruit from?\n  Within this bill, I would like to have an answer as to whether you \nhave altered the definition of ``joint military intelligence \nprograms.'' I do not see such a definition, but it is a very important \nsegment of intelligence.\n  As to the budget, am I correct in understanding the NID controls the \nbudget of the NSA, NGA, NRO, and that the NID recommends nominees to be \ndirectors of these entities, with the concurrence of the Secretary of \nDefense? What happens to the current directors? Is this some time off \nin the future? Can he immediately clear the deck and put new people in \ncharge of the agencies? These agencies, along with DIA, are both \nnational and combat support agencies. How will the proposed bill ensure \nthese agencies remain responsive to the military forces they support if \ntheir funding and personnel are controlled by another department?\n\n  How does the National Security Advisory and Office of Management and \nBudget fit into the overall role of coordination or budget coordination \nenvisioned by this legislation?\n  Particularly, how would the national intelligence director, with \nstrong budgetary and personnel authority and the ability to control the \ndollars, 85 percent of which are now controlled by the Department of \nDefense, still maintain a relationship with the DOD? Does it control \nthe whole 85 percent or just the part that is related to the defense \nagencies specifically mentioned? Currently, I assume the committee \nknows that the payroll for all of those people comes through the \nDepartment of Defense. This assumes, I take it, that the payroll will \nnow come through the budget of the NID. Which ones are you going to \npay? Who will make the separation, the Secretary of Defense or NID, as \nto which ones NID pays and which ones the Department of Defense pays? \nThat is going to be a headache, in my opinion.\n  The bill provides the national director, in terms of an organization, \nwith the power to reach into other departments to manage personnel, \nbudget, and acquisition programs. Is this on a day-by-day basis, or on \nthe basis of a plan or the formation of a divide-and-command authority? \nIt seems to be that. It seems to be an invitation for turmoil that will \ncause operational problems as soon as it is created. He is supposed to \nreach in and tell them I will manage your personnel, your budget, and \nyour acquisitions? A series of things is on the books that envisions \nparticular acquisitions by various agencies over the period ahead. Some \nof those laws, apparently, will have to\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\nbe changed if this person's authority is to be effective, because it \nwill conflict with existing laws, if they are not changed.\n  How do the benefits of centralization of the intelligence function \nimpact the benefits of diversity and competition in the production of \nuseful intelligence? Does the committee believe that diversity in \ncompetition is not needed and that is intended by this bill?\n  Is it possible to link the national intelligence director to the \nNational Security Council and place it under the control of the \nnational security adviser? Is that possible? Today, the President is in \ncontrol of those entities within the executive branch, and they are \npersonally responsible to him. That is what the letter we received \nyesterday says. I hope we think twice about the lines of authority and \nwhat are the prerogatives of the President as Commander in Chief and as \nPresident of the United States under the Constitution.\n  Currently, national intelligence priorities are established by the \nPresident and the National Security Council. Does a national \nintelligence director with such powers weaken the NSC process and the \nroles of the National Security Adviser and the Secretary of State? Will \nthey still have the same role, notwithstanding this national \nintelligence director is going to have the authority to tell them and \nmake the decisions on what intelligence they need in carrying out their \nauthorities as constitutional advisers to the President?\n\n  Could some of the objectives sought by the reorganization be achieved \nby strengthening the existing institutions? I am not sure that has been \nconsidered adequately. That seems to be the compelling rush of the 9/11 \nCommission--throw everything out and set up something new. There is not \neven a period for transition in this process. This cannot happen \novernight. The reorganization proposed by this bill would take at least \na year. During that process, what happens to careers and to people's \nmorale? Why can we not build on what we have, rather than creating \nsomething so new that has the extreme power to invade every agency that \neven touches any piece of intelligence?\n  Does this legislation create a system in which intelligence is \nreported to two masters? For example, would the members of the \nintelligence community be under the control of the national \nintelligence director and their own agency bosses? I assume that is the \ncase. How does it work on a day-to-day basis if they are not? I assume \npersons employed by one agency are responsible to the person who hired \nthem. This bill now envisions, I take it, that the NID has the right to \nhire and fire in any of the agencies involved.\n  Will the system envisioned by this legislation create conflicts in \ncollection and analysis tasking? Currently, there is a working \nrelationship between these agencies as to who is going to pursue one \nsubject or another, as they task the analysis of information coming in \non a daily basis. I don't see why the system creates other conflicts in \nthat process.\n  The 9/11 Commission report highlighted that there was a lack of \ninformation sharing within the intelligence community. But evidence \npoints out this was just as serious within agencies as it was across \nagencies. How can problems of sharing within agencies be solved by \nlayering another set of controls over all of the agencies?\n  We ought to think about what happens to the agencies that exist now \nand how they should transition into this national intelligence director \nrealm, and not assume it is automatically created as soon as the bill \nis passed.\n  Would the national intelligence director's role in crafting \nintelligence policy supplant that of other Cabinet Secretaries? Under \nthis bill, would the Cabinet Secretaries lose their own organic \ncapability to do intelligence analysis? Are we telling the Secretary of \nState he cannot hire somebody to do intelligence that he thinks he \nneeds? If so, would this undercut Cabinet Secretaries who are \nconstitutional officers of the Government charged with managing the \ninstruments of foreign and security policy for the country?\n  I do not think we should proceed to create a national intelligence \ndirector that has the power to tell those Cabinet Secretaries what they \ncan do in terms of gathering intelligence and analysis.\n  How would these same Cabinet Secretaries fulfill the constitutional \nauthority vested in them by Congress unless they have the power to make \nan independent judgment about what is the proper conclusion from the \nintelligence available to them?\n  Could the national intelligence director function without having the \nanalytical branch of the CIA placed under his or her direction? I say \nthat again, the only analytical branch we really have is the CIA, and \nthis bill seems to say that the NID gets that analytical branch of the \nCIA. If it does not, will we have duplicate analytical branches? What \nis the role of CIA under this concept, as far as analysis is concerned?\n  If the essential relationship between analysts and operators is \nweakened, does the operational branch become rudderless and the \nanalytical branch too academic? Would the CIA become an organization \nfor conducting clandestine activities only?\n  I do not think this bill tells us what we expect from CIA in the \nfuture. It says what we expect the NID to do, but it really does not \nreaffirm the role of any existing agencies that I have defined.\n  Creating an intelligence czar with domestic surveillance authority \nthat is not under the Attorney General, and measures that separate \ndomestic intelligence from law enforcement, go against all the lessons \nlearned by democratic governments the hard way. What are the concerns \nand dangers of merging domestic and foreign counterterrorism operations \nunder one organization?\n  Again, I refer to extensive comments Judge Posner made to us before \nour committee. How will competing views on intelligence be brought to \nthe President's attention? Indeed, how will competing views merge at \nall in a structure that is so centralized and under the control of the \nNID?\n  Much of the bill which stems from the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission report seem to be directed only to the threat of Islamic \nterrorism, which I agree is a tremendous threat. But does this \nlegislation enable us to better deal with the growing worldwide threats \nof proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other very serious \nproblems in terms of intelligence gathering and analysis?\n  How much will congressional oversight be reduced if this bill becomes \nlaw? It appears to point toward one committee but has total budget \nauthority, total reorganization authority dealing with one person who \nhas total authority in the intelligence community. It eliminates \ndiversity. It eliminates even the opportunity for a separate think. It \nis going to be a two-group thinks, and if they work together, where is \nthe diversity in this community? Where do we get accurate analyses if \nwe can have only the one that is made by the NID?\n\n  We created the Department of Homeland Security in an election cycle. \nI think the experts are telling us now that the transition has not been \nsuccessful, and the current organization falls short of its goals, as \nfar as homeland security. But isn't that the same environment we face \nright now, Mr. President? Can we avoid some of the same mistakes we \nmade and have experienced through the Department of Homeland Security \nand its legislation and development of this legislation?\n  Would the National Counterterrorism Center be involved in operations? \nWhy would there be a director of operations listed in this organization \nunless it is involved in operations? If it is, doesn't that complicate \nplanning for operations that currently go on within the Department of \nDefense, CIA, FBI, and other agencies? Are they all subject to the \ncontrol of the NID, even in terms of operations?\n  I do not think that is the intent, but again I do not think it is \nclear. It is my understanding that the inspector general would have \nauthority to conduct investigations of the relationships among elements \nof the intelligence community within the national intelligence program \nand the authority to investigate relationships among elements of the \nintelligence community within the national intelligence program and \nother elements of the intelligence community.\n  If a close reading of this bill grants authorities to the inspector \ngeneral of this community far greater than other\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\ninspectors general--I was asked that question once and was told it is \njust the same as the others; that it was just the same. I challenge \nthat now because I do not think other inspectors general have the \nauthority to investigate relationships between the communities, nor do \nI think the inspector general should have the authority to audit \ninteragency processes in addition to the programs and operations within \nthe national intelligence authority. It presumes we can find an \ninspector general and his staff that will have the right to complete \naccess of all the intelligence to which the national intelligence \ndirector has access. I seriously question that in connection with \nintelligence.\n  Does the authority to investigate interagency processes create a \ntension between the inspector general of the NID and inspectors general \nof other agencies? I do not see anything that says the Department of \nDefense inspector general or all of the inspectors general in the \nintelligence community--and they all have them--is subordinate to all \nof them, yet this person has authority to investigate interagency \nprocesses that are really relationships between agencies, not how the \nagencies function, not whether something is going on, but whether they \nare getting along. Who is getting along with whom? What are you going \nto do with existing IGs? What is their role under this bill?\n  I do not think it is spelled out at all. I think the bill authorizing \nthe inspector general of the NID to provide policy direction to improve \nthe effectiveness of interagency process, without consulting the \nSecretaries of Cabinet departments, without consulting agency heads, \nand without consulting the inspectors general in the agencies \nthemselves, has not been thought through at all.\n  I do believe the authority to provide policy guidance politicizes the \nposition of inspector general to NID and it would endanger the IG's \nindependence, which I believe is critical to conducting fair and \nunbiased audits in investigations. I also think there ought to be some \nstatement of the relationship we expect to exist between the NID and \nthe inspector general and the inspectors general of individual agencies \nthat are subordinate to the NID.\n  Those are just a few of the questions that came to my mind as I read \nthrough this bill and report and the comments that have been made. I do \nhope we have time to explore some of those questions because I think \nthey need to be answered. I do think we need to take care of what the \nrelationship is between this NID and particularly the Department of \nDefense.\n  I hope we can work together and find a way to answer the requests \nmade by the administration that were stated yesterday.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To specify that the National Intelligence Director shall \n           serve for one or more terms of up to 5 years each)\n\n       On page 10, line 2, insert ``(1)'' after ``Director.--''.\n       On page 10, line 5, insert ``, for a term of up to 5 \n     years'' after ``Senate''.\n       On page 10, after line 5, insert the following:\n       (2) The National Intelligence Director may be reappointed \n     by the President for additional terms of up to 5 years each, \n     by and with the consent of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I commend the chairman of the \ncommittee and our esteemed ranking member and say I am pleased to see \nthat we have a chance to wrap up discussion on this reform attempt in \nthe time we are presently allowing.\n  I offer an amendment to establish a 5-year term for the national \nintelligence director. Our colleague from Pennsylvania has put forward \nan amendment to extend the term for the national intelligence director, \nto put in place a term that is 10 years in length, and I salute the \nSenator's attempt to try to assure objectivity for the new intelligence \nchief. The Senator from Pennsylvania and I share the same goal and that \nis to do all we can to make sure the national intelligence director is \nas independent and nonpartisan as possible.\n  My specific proposal differs from the approach used by the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. Mine would establish a 5-year term, not a 10-year \nterm, for the national intelligence director. Under my amendment, if \nthe President wants to reappoint that person, he could, as long as he \nsends the nomination to the Senate and we confirm him or her.\n  Under Senator Specter's amendment, the director's term would be \nlimited to a single 10-year term. I think a formula of 5-year terms \nthat could be renewed is more practical. If we are serious about \nobjective intelligence, then we have to provide a national intelligence \ndirector with as much independence as we can, that allows him to tell \nthe President things the President may not generally want to hear. The \nNID should be able to provide information and analysis to the President \nwithout necessarily worrying about job security.\n  During one of our hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee on \nintelligence reform earlier this month, I asked interim CIA Director \nJohn McLaughlin what he thought of a limited term for the national \nintelligence director. His response was that it may be yet another way \nto ensure the objectivity and nonpolitical character of whoever holds \nthat office.\n  Interim Director McLaughlin is on target. A term for the national \nintelligence director will bolster objectivity and help keep politics \nout of our intelligence data.\n  Some of my colleagues have voiced concern that they want to make sure \nthe director is someone the President trusts, and I wholeheartedly \nsupport that. I agree it is critical that the individual and the \nPresident have a relationship built on trust. I believe my amendment \nbolsters that trust. With an independent, objective national \nintelligence director, the President can trust that the data he gets is \nobjective.\n  When it comes to intelligence data, a President surely does not want \na simple yes-man. The President needs independent, clean, quality \nanalysis.\n  Unlike the amendment that has been proposed, my amendment does not \nrestrict the director to only one term. If the President wants to \nrenominate the same person to serve in the post again, then he may do \nso, and the Senate will then decide whether to confirm the person for \nanother term.\n  I want to be clear that while the amendment provides a degree of \nindependence to the NID, it is not absolute. Under my amendment, the \nPresident could certainly dismiss the NID if he\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\ndid not have further confidence in his ability to perform. In fact, all \nit takes for the President to remove the director is the will to do so. \nSo I believe my amendment will help improve the quality of nominees for \nthe position of national intelligence director. With a 5-year term in \nplace, there will be an expectation that the individual serve both \nDemocrats and Republicans. Given what I hope will be a nonpartisan \nmandate, we will see much more objective and nonpartisan nominees.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Arizona is in the \nChamber to offer his amendment so I will speak only very briefly. \nSenator Lautenberg's amendment is an improvement over the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania because it is a shorter term \nand it does allow the President to remove the NID without specifying a \ncause, but I still find it problematic.\n  We are talking about the individual who is going to be the principal \nadviser to the President. The witnesses were virtually unanimous in \nadvising us that that individual has to have the trust and confidence \nof the President and that it would be a mistake to set a term.\n  I argue further against this amendment in the context of the Specter \namendment. In light of the fact that the Senator from Arizona is \nwaiting, I will not repeat those arguments at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe under the previous unanimous \nconsent agreement that Senator Lautenberg's amendment will be set aside \nand we will return to the consideration of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I also understand that at 2:15 there will be votes as \npreviously ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote will occur \nat 2:15 in relation to the Specter amendment No. 3761.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3766\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to use the time between now \nand the time the vote is ordered to briefly talk about the amendment, \nbut before I do I will say I understand there is controversy associated \nwith this amendment. I do not intend, nor do I believe, that we should \nhold up the progress of this legislation and I would be more than \nwilling to agree to a time agreement immediately upon completion of the \npending votes to give the opponents of this amendment time to consider \nthat.\n  I would also point out to both proponents and opponents of this \namendment this issue is very well known. There may be some Members who \nare not that familiar with this amendment, but it goes all the way back \nto 1997 when we had hearings before the Commerce Committee on May 15, \n1997, where following the Oklahoma bombing there was, in the view of \nthe witnesses, an urgent requirement to get spectrum to the public \nsafety community as quickly as possible. That was 7 years ago. The same \narguments are being used today as were used 7 years ago after the \nOklahoma tragedy. So I believe this amendment addresses, as Senator \nLieberman and I had committed to do to the families and to the members \nof the 9/11 Commission, the fact that we would act one way or another \non all 41 of their recommendations.\n  This addresses the following recommendation made by the 9/11 \nCommission:\n\n       Recommendation: Congress should support pending legislation \n     which provides for the expedited and increased assignment of \n     radio spectrum for public safety purposes. Furthermore, high-\n     risk urban areas such as New York City and Washington, D.C., \n     should establish signal corps units to ensure communications \n     connectivity between and among civilian authorities, local \n     first responders, and the National Guard. Federal funding of \n     such units should be given high priority by Congress.\n\n  What we are talking about is not only addressing the expedited aspect \nof their recommendation but also increased assignment. That is why, in \nthis legislation, all of those who are presently using analog spectrum \nwould be required by a date certain, December 31, 2008, without \nexception, without loophole, to move off of the analog to digital \nspectrum.\n  To take care of those who are still using over-the-air broadcasting, \n$1 billion would be set aside from the auction of this spectrum in \norder to provide the provision of set top boxes for those Americans who \nare still using over-the-air television as their primary way of \nreceiving television signals. This is a small amount compared to the \nimmense value of the spectrum itself.\n  This amendment is supported by the 9/11 Commission. I have a letter \nfrom them and statement in support of it.\n  It says:\n\n       We write in support of your amendment to S. 2845 regarding \n     public safety spectrum. Your amendment provides for the \n     expedited and potentially increased assignment of spectrum \n     for public safety purposes. By creating a funding mechanism \n     to aid first responders in the purchase of new equipment, it \n     also recognizes that spectrum alone is insufficient to \n     address the deficiencies in public safety interoperability. \n     In this way, your amendment squarely addresses the needs of \n     public safety cited in the 9/11 Commission report.\n       We urge your colleagues to support this amendment, because \n     it takes significant steps to addressing the urgent needs of \n     police, fire, emergency medical, and other public safety \n     agencies. By establishing a firm date of December 31, 2007, \n     for the return of spectrum long promised to public safety, \n     your amendment provides much-needed certainty with respect to \n     access to this spectrum. And by establishing a firm date of \n     December 31, 2008, for completion of the digital television \n     transition nationwide, your amendment creates an essential \n     funding mechanism for the purchase of public safety equipment \n     using proceeds from the auction of the broadcast analog \n     spectrum. This latter deadline also ensures that the return \n     of broadcast spectrum for public safety occurs with minimal \n     risk of litigation, minimal impact on consumers, and with \n     maximum flexibility of the Congress to allocate additional \n     spectrum to public safety if it concludes such an allocation \n     is necessary.\n       Finally, we urge the Senate to reject efforts to weaken \n     your amendment by adding loopholes purporting to offer \n     ``flexibility'' to the assignment of spectrum to public \n     safety entities. The need for this spectrum is too great; the \n     stakes are too large; and the time is too pressing to succumb \n     to efforts to delay these critical measures for first \n     responders everywhere.\n\n  I will talk about the successful efforts orchestrated by the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters to delay indefinitely the transition from \nanalog to traditional spectrum. Now that my friend from Montana is in \nthe Chamber, I will quote from a speech he made in 1997, 7 years ago, \nwhich basically lays out the same concerns he and the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters have today.\n  It is time we acted. It's time we gave these people the spectrum they \ndeserve. We can do that, along with providing those who are now and \nwill only receive over-the-air television a set top box, which will \nallow them to receive digital television signals.\n  Mr. President, I think we are close to 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has half a minute remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand, as I said before, that there is controversy \nassociated with this. I will be more than happy to agree to a time \nagreement, a very reasonable time agreement to debate this issue and \nvote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided between the two votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. There will be 2 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Between the votes. Not on the first amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3761\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, under the previous order we are now going \nto proceed to a vote on Senator Specter's amendment, No. 3761. That is \nthe amendment that would set the 10-year term for the national \nintelligence director. I move to table the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

There will \nbe 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would like to split the 1 minute on the \nopponents' side, 30 seconds for myself and 30 seconds for the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, do you want to go \nfirst?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment gives the national \nintelligence director authority to supervise, direct the kind of \nmanagerial authority which is indispensable if the national \nintelligence director is to be effective.\n  Of those of us who have dealt with the Central Intelligence Agency, \nSenator Roberts, the current chair of the committee, is forcefully in \nfavor of this amendment, as is Senator Shelby, former chairman of the \ncommittee, as am I. Very forceful arguments were made today by members \nof the committee--Senator Hatch, Senator Bond, Senator DeWine.\n  But if we are really to bring the intelligence community under \nmanagement, if we are really to have the kind of coordination, to have \nall of the information in one locale, where 9/11 could have been \nprevented, and to have accountability, it is indispensable to do more \nthan give budget authority, which is all the committee bill does, but \nto give the national intelligence director the authority to supervise, \ndirect real management authority to get the job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in deciding to keep the NSA and the NGA \nwithin the Department of Defense, we were mindful of the fact that \nthese agencies are combat support agencies. We do not want to sever the \nlink between these agencies and the Secretary of Defense. We have \nalready given the NID strong power in terms of budget, in terms of \nappointing the heads of these agencies, with concurrence from the \nSecretary of Defense. I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I also urge opposition to the Specter \namendment. The fact is, our committee has found a balance. We have \ncreated someone in charge of the intelligence community who is not \nthere now, giving that person the authority Senator Collins has \nreferred to, but leaving line control over the agencies of the \nintelligence community, including the Department of Defense, within the \nDepartment of Defense and those existing agencies.\n  The fact is, this amendment goes too far and goes too far politically \nbecause if this amendment should pass, this bill is not going to go \nanywhere in the House, and we will end up leaving ourselves vulnerable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Iraq and al-Qaida\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is no longer any doubt about \nPresident Bush's reelection strategy. It is the same strategy that was \nused in the election 2 years ago: They invoke the images of the 9/11 \nattacks and warn that new terrorist attacks are imminent. They stoke \nAmericans' fears and anxieties. And, of course, they accuse their \nopponents of being weak on terrorism, not willing to defend America.\n  The events of 9/11 were traumatic, and we all understand Americans' \nfear\n\n[[Page S9898]]\n\nof a new terrorist attack. But it is despicable to politicize this \nfear. It is despicable to exploit people's anxieties for political \nadvantage. But this administration has done this again and again.\n  This is exactly what Vice President Dick Cheney was up to when he \nwarned that if John Kerry is elected President, then ``the danger is \nthat we'll get hit again, that we'll be hit in a way that will be \ndevastating.''\n  You have to appreciate the pure Orwellian beauty of that statement. \nIt was on President Bush's watch that we suffered the September 11 \nattack, a real attack, not a hypothetical one, and that attack happened \ndespite multiple warnings to Mr. Bush from the CIA that al-Qaida was \nplanning to attack America. Yet now his attack dog Vice President has \nthe gall to warn that if John Kerry is elected President, the \nterrorists will hit us with a ``devastating attack.''\n  As I said, this is the administration's reelection strategy: Fear and \nsmear; politicize the terrorist threat; exploit people's fears and \nanxieties for political advantage.\n  Late last week, President Bush and his allies escalated this strategy \nto a new level. They are now saying, in effect, that Senator Kerry is \ngiving aid and comfort to the terrorists, and that as Republican \nRepresentative Tom Cole crudely put it:\n\n       If George Bush loses the election, Osama bin Laden wins the \n     election.\n\n  Last Tuesday, the senior Senator from Utah, and a good friend of \nmine, Senator Hatch, said that terrorists ``are going to throw \neverything they can between now and the election to try and elect \nKerry.''\n  Last Monday, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage said \nterrorists in Iraq ``are trying to influence the election against \nPresident Bush.''\n  Last Thursday, President Bush said Senator Kerry's statements on Iraq \n``can embolden the enemy.''\n  And Vice President Cheney called Senator Kerry ``destructive'' to the \nwar on terrorism.\n  This morning our colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, criticized an \nearlier floor statement by Senator Kennedy. Senator Kyl said that \nSenator Kennedy's criticisms of the President's policy in Iraq were \n``giving confidence to the enemy.'' That was said just this morning on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  This is disturbing. Since when is an entirely legitimate and \njustified criticism of the President's policy in Iraq ``giving \nconfidence to the enemy.'' This is an outrageous accusation. It has no \nplace on the Senate floor for legitimate debate.\n  I remind the Senator from Arizona of the wise words of President \nDwight Eisenhower who said that criticism and dissent are the bedrock \nof democracy. This is what President Eisenhower said in 1954 at \nColumbia University:\n\n       Here in America, we are descended in blood and in spirit \n     from revolutionists and rebels--men and women who dared to \n     dissent from accepted doctrine. As their heirs, we may never \n     confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion.\n\n  That was President Dwight Eisenhower.\n  So we will not be silenced by accusations of disloyalty or \naccusations that we are helping the enemy or giving confidence to the \nenemy. Is all we are supposed to do hush up and allow Mr. Bush's \nreckless policies to lead us deeper and deeper into the quagmire?\n  These gentlemen claim to have such excellent access to the \nterrorists' thoughts. It would be nice if they would turn that \nknowledge into an effective policy against the terrorists. Instead, at \nkey junctures, this administration has made disastrously wrong choices \nand repeatedly these decisions have played into the terrorists' hands. \nLook at the record.\n  It is a fact that the September 11 attacks happened despite repeated \nwarnings to the President from the CIA that al-Qaida was planning to \nattack America. Those warnings included an August 8, 2001, President's \ndaily briefing which he received when he was on vacation in Crawford, \nTX, titled ``Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.'' That is not a \nsubhead or a sentence in the memo; that is the title of the memo: ``Bin \nLaden Determined to Strike in U.S.''\n  Let's look at the rest of the record.\n  President Bush botched the single best opportunity to capture bin \nLaden when we had him cornered in Torah Borah in Afghanistan, and yet \nthe President removed intelligence personnel and predator aircraft from \nAfghanistan to put them in Iraq.\n  It was President Bush who 3 years ago pledged to smoke bin Laden out \nof his cave but has utterly failed to do so. Instead, by successfully \ndefying the President, because we have been so bogged down in the \nquagmire of Iraq, bin Laden has become a folk hero across much of the \nMuslim world. He has attracted not only thousands of new recruits but \ndozens of imitators, new bin Ladens, forming their own terrorist \norganizations to attack America and Americans.\n  It was President Bush who diverted, as I said, our military and \nintelligence resources from the hunt of bin Laden in order to attack \nIraq.\n  It was President Bush whose taunt of ``bring it on'' did indeed bring \nit on--a nationwide insurgency in Iraq, an urban guerrilla that has \ntrapped our Armed Forces, as I said, in a quagmire.\n  It was President Bush whose unilateral approach on Iraq served to \nalienate many of our oldest allies and to turn world opinion against \nthe United States.\n  It was President Bush whose invasion and occupation of the second \nlargest Arab country has outraged much of the Muslim world and has been \na recruiting bonanza for terrorism. Indeed, George W. Bush's policies--\nreckless and wrong--have been the best recruiting tool imaginable for \nal-Qaida.\n  This is an astonishing record of mistakes, misjudgments, \nmiscalculations, and mismanagement. It is an astonishing record of \nGeorge W. Bush again and again playing into Osama bin Laden's hands. It \nis sort of like watching the cartoon of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road \nRunner, only it is not funny. It is a colossal tragedy that has put our \nNation at even greater risk.\n\n  Ironically, President Bush's father, the first President Bush, warned \nagainst the folly of invading and occupying Iraq. On February 28, 1999, \nspeaking to a group of Desert Storm veterans at Fort Myer, VA, he said:\n\n       Had we gone into Baghdad--we could have done that, you guys \n     could have done it, you could have been there in 48 hours--\n     and then what? Whose life would be on my hands as the \n     Commander in Chief because I unilaterally went beyond \n     international law, went beyond the stated mission and said \n     we're going to show our macho? We're going into Baghdad. \n     We're going to be an occupying power--America in an Arab land \n     with no allies at our side. It would have been disastrous.\n\n  That is not this Senator saying that; that is former President Bush \nin February 1999.\n  Now, of course, we heard the same pathetic warnings from Brent \nScowcroft, James Baker, and other foreign policy specialists, but this \nPresident and his partner Dick Cheney and their posse of \nneoconservative intellectuals thought they knew better. They reveled in \nwords like ``slam dunk'' and ``cakewalk.'' And so now the disaster Bush \n41 warned against has become a reality under Bush 43.\n  President Bush repeatedly says that his No. 1 job is to protect the \nAmerican people. But the view of professionals on the front line is \nthat he has failed to do so.\n  The Iraq invasion has set back, rather than advanced, the war on \nterrorism and al-Qaida. Osama bin Laden remains at large. Our Armed \nForces are bogged down in Iraq with casualties rising above 8,000 and \nare not available to respond to real threats to the United States. In \nthe wake of the Abu Ghraib prison scandals, our moral authority and \ncredibility on the world stage are at rock bottom.\n  I was watching former President Jimmy Carter, winner of the Nobel \nPeace Prize, at the Carter Center just a few days ago saying that he \nhas visited 120 countries around the world, and he believes that at no \ntime in the history of our country has our esteem, credibility, and \nmoral authority been at such a low point.\n  Despite President Bush's loud threats toward the so-called ``axis of \nevil'' on his watch, North Korea has acquired nuclear weapons. Iran \nappears to be proceeding with impunity to develop its own nuclear \narsenal. Again, this is an extraordinary record of mistakes, \nmisjudgments, miscalculations, and missed opportunities.\n  As a consequence of the choices made by this President over the last \n4 years, I believe today America is weaker, less\n\n[[Page S9899]]\n\nsecure, and more vulnerable. It is indeed time, past time, to change \nthese policies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the termination of my remarks, two \narticles, ``Growing Pessimism on Iraq,'' Wednesday, September 29, \nWashington Post, and an article appearing on September 28 in the New \nYork Times, ``Iraq Study Sees Rebels' Attacks as Widespread,'' be \nprinted in their entirety in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 3 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to correct one other thing that was said this \nmorning by the Senator from Arizona. He talked about the connections \nbetween al-Qaida and Iraq. He quoted Mr. Tom Kean speaking about that \nrelationship, and I will quote, in its entirety, from page 66 of the \nreport:\n\n       The reports describe friendly contacts and indicate some \n     common themes in both sides' hatred of the United States. But \n     to date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier \n     contacts ever developed into a collaborative operational \n     relationship. Nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq \n     cooperated with al-Qaida in developing or carrying out any \n     attacks against the United States.\n\n  Sure, it is true that al-Qaida had relationships with Iraq. They had \nrelationships with Saudi Arabia. They had relationships in Egypt. They \nhad relationships in a lot of countries. But as the report clearly \nshows on page 66, there was no operational relationship between al-\nQaida and Iraq as determined by the Commission.\n  I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 29, 2004]\n\n                       Growing Pessimism on Iraq\n\n                  (By Dana Priest and Thomas E. Ricks)\n\n       A growing number of career professionals within national \n     security agencies believe that the situation in Iraq is much \n     worse, and the path to success much more tenuous, than is \n     being expressed in public by top Bush administration \n     officials, according to former and current government \n     officials and assessments over the past year by intelligence \n     officials at the CIA and the departments of State and \n     Defense.\n       While President Bush, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld \n     and others have delivered optimistic public appraisals, \n     officials who fight the Iraqi insurgency and study it at the \n     CIA and the State Department and within the Army officer \n     corps believe the rebellion is deeper and more widespread \n     than is being publicly acknowledged, officials say.\n       People at the CIA ``are mad at the policy in Iraq because \n     it's a disaster, and they're digging the hole deeper and \n     deeper and deeper,'' said one former intelligence officer who \n     maintains contact with CIA officials. ``There's no obvious \n     way to fix it. The best we can hope for is a semi-failed \n     state hobbling along with terrorists and a succession of weak \n     governments.''\n       ``Things are definitely not improving,'' said one U.S. \n     government official who reads the intelligence analyses on \n     Iraq.\n       ``It is getting worse,'' agreed an Army staff officer who \n     served in Iraq and stays in touch with comrades in Baghdad \n     through e-mail. ``It just seems there is a lot of pessimism \n     flowing out of theater now. There are things going on that \n     are unbelievable to me. They have infiltrators conducting \n     attacks in the Green Zone. That was not the case a year \n     ago.''\n       This weekend, in a rare departure from the positive talking \n     points used by administration spokesmen, Secretary of State \n     Colin L. Powell acknowledged that the insurgency is \n     strengthening and that anti-Americanism in the Middle East is \n     increasing. ``Yes, it's getting worse,'' he said of the \n     insurgency on ABC's ``This Week.'' At the same time, the U.S. \n     commander for the Middle East, Gen. John P. Abizaid, told \n     NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that ``we will fight our way through \n     the elections.'' Abizaid said he believes Iraq is still \n     winnable once a new political order and the Iraqi security \n     force is in place.\n       Powell's admission and Abizaid's sobering warning came days \n     after the public disclosure of a National Intelligence \n     Council (NIC) assessment, completed in July, that gave a \n     dramatically different outlook than the administration's and \n     represented a consensus at the CIA and the State and Defense \n     departments.\n       In the best-case scenario, the NIC said, Iraq could be \n     expected to achieve a ``tenuous stability'' over the next 18 \n     months. In the worst case, it could dissolve into civil war.\n       The July assessment was similar to one produced before the \n     war and another in late 2003 that also were more pessimistic \n     in tone than the administration's portrayal of the resistance \n     to the U.S. occupation, according to senior administration \n     officials. ``All say they expect things to get worse,'' one \n     former official said.\n       One official involved in evaluating the July document said \n     the NIC, which advises the director of central intelligence, \n     decided not to include a more rosy scenario ``because it \n     looked so unreal.''\n       White House spokesman Scott McClellan, and other White \n     House spokesmen, called the intelligence assessment the work \n     of ``pessimists and naysayers'' after its outlines were \n     disclosed by the New York Times.\n       President Bush called the assessment a guess, which drew \n     the consternation of many intelligence officials. ``The CIA \n     laid out several scenarios,'' Bush said on Sept. 21. ``It \n     said that life could by lousy. Life could be okay. Life could \n     be better. And they were just guessing as to what the \n     conditions might be like.''\n       Two days later, Bush reworded his response. ``I used an \n     unfortunate word, `guess.' I should have used `estimate.' ``\n       ``And the CIA came and said, `This is a possibility, this \n     is a possibility, and this is a possibility,''' Bush \n     continued. ``But what's important for the American people to \n     hear is reality. And the reality's right here in the form of \n     the prime minister. And he is explaining what is happening on \n     the ground. That's the best report.''\n       Rumsfeld, who once dismissed the insurgents as ``dead-\n     enders,'' still offers a positive portrayal of prospects and \n     progress in Iraq but has begun to temper his optimism in \n     public. ``The path towards liberty is not smooth there; it \n     never has been,'' he said before the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee last week. ``And my personal view is that a fair \n     assessment requires some patience and some perspective.''\n       This week, conservative columnist Robert D. Novak \n     criticized the CIA and Paul Pillar, a national intelligence \n     officer on the NIC who supervised the preparation of the \n     assessment. Novak said comments Pillar made about Iraq during \n     a private dinner in California showed that he and others at \n     the CIA are at war with the president. Recent and current \n     intelligence officials interviewed over the last two days \n     dispute that view.\n       ``Pillar is the ultimate professional,'' said Daniel Byman, \n     an intelligence expert and Georgetown University professor \n     who has worked with Pillar. ``If anything, he's too soft-\n     spoken.''\n       ``I'm not surprised if people in the administration were \n     put on the defensive,'' said one CIA official, who like many \n     others interviewed would speak only anonymously, either \n     because they don't have official authorization to speak or \n     because they worry about ramifications of criticizing top \n     administration officials. ``We weren't trying to make them \n     look bad, we're just trying to give them information. Of \n     course, we're telling them something they don't want to \n     hear.''\n       As for a war between the CIA and White House, said one \n     intelligence expert with contacts at the CIA, the State \n     Department and the Pentagon, ``There's a real war going on \n     here that's not just'' the CIA against the administration on \n     Iraq ``but the State Department and the military'' as well.\n       National security officials acknowledge that the upcoming \n     presidential election also seems to have distorted the public \n     debate on Iraq.\n       ``Everyone says Iraq certainly has turned out to be more \n     intense than expected, especially the intensity of \n     nationalism on the part of the Iraqi people,'' said Steven \n     Metz, chairman of the regional strategy and planning \n     department at the U.S. Army War College. But, he added, ``I \n     don't think the political discourse that we're in the middle \n     of accurately reflects anything. There's a supercharged \n     debate on both sides, a movement to out-state each side.''\n       Reports from Iraq have made one Army staff officer question \n     whether adequate progress is being made there.\n       ``They keep telling us that Iraqi security forces are the \n     exit strategy, but what I hear from the ground is that they \n     aren't working,'' he said. ``There's a feeling that Iraqi \n     security forces are in cahoots with the insurgents and the \n     general public to get the occupiers out.''\n       He added: ``I hope I'm wrong.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 2004]\n\n             Iraq Study Sees Rebels' Attacks as Widespread\n\n                   (By James Glanz and Thom Shanker)\n\n       Baghdad, Iraq, Sept. 28.--Over the past 30 days, more than \n     2,300 attacks by insurgents have been directed against \n     civilians and military targets in Iraq, in a pattern that \n     sprawls over nearly every major population center outside the \n     Kurdish north, according to comprehensive data compiled by a \n     private security company with access to military intelligence \n     reports and its own network of Iraqi informants.\n       The sweeping geographical reach of the attacks, from \n     Nineveh and Salahuddin Provinces in the northwest to Babylon \n     and Diyala in the center and Basra in the south, suggests a \n     more widespread resistance than the isolated pockets \n     described by Iraqi government officials.\n       The type of attacks ran the gamut: car bombs, time bombs, \n     rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades, small-arms fire, \n     mortar attacks and land mines.\n       ``If you look at incident data and you put incident data on \n     the map, it's not a few provinces,'' said Adam Collins, a \n     security expert and the chief intelligence official in Iraq \n     for Special Operations Consulting-Security Management Group \n     Inc., a private security company based in Las Vegas that \n     compiles\n\n[[Page S9900]]\n\n     and analyzes the data as a regular part of its operations in \n     Iraq.\n       The number of attacks has risen and fallen over the months. \n     Mr. Collins said the highest numbers were in April, when \n     there was major fighting in Falluja, with attacks averaging \n     120 a day. The average is now about 80 a day, he said.\n       But it is a measure of both the fog of war and the fact \n     that different analysts can look at the same numbers and come \n     to opposite conclusions, that others see a nation in which \n     most people are perfectly safe and elections can be held with \n     clear legitimacy.\n       ``I have every reason to believe that the Iraqi people are \n     going to be able to hold elections,'' said Lt. Col. William \n     Nichols of the Air Force, a spokesman for the American-led \n     coalition forces here.\n       Indeed, no raw compilation of statistics on numbers of \n     attacks can measure what is perhaps the most important \n     political equation facing Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and the \n     American military: how much of Iraq is under the firm control \n     of the interim government. That will determine the \n     likelihood--and quality--of elections in January.\n       For example, the number of attacks is not an accurate \n     measure of control in Falluja; attacks have recently dropped \n     there, but the town is controlled by insurgents and is a ``no \n     go'' zone for the American military and Iraqi security \n     forces. It is a place where elections could not be held \n     without dramatic political or military intervention.\n       The statistics show that there have been just under 1,000 \n     attacks in Baghdad during the past month; in fact, an \n     American military spokesman said this week that since April, \n     insurgents have fired nearly 3,000 mortar rounds in Baghdad \n     alone. But those figures do not necessarily preclude having \n     elections in the Iraqi capital.\n       Pentagon officials and military officers like to point to a \n     separate list of statistics to counter the tally of attacks, \n     including the number of schools and clinics opened. They cite \n     statistics indicating that a growing number of Iraqi security \n     forces are trained and fully equipped, and they note that \n     applicants continue to line up at recruiting stations despite \n     bombings of them.\n       But most of all, military officers argue that despite the \n     rise in bloody attacks during the past 30 days, the \n     insurgents have yet to win a single battle.\n       ``We have had zero tactical losses; we have lost no \n     battles,'' said one senior American military officer. ``The \n     insurgency has had zero tactical victories. But that is not \n     what this is about.\n       ``We are at a very critical time,'' the officer added. \n     ``The only way we can lose this battle is if the American \n     people decide we don't want to fight anymore.''\n       American government officials explain that optimistic \n     assessments about Iraq from President Bush and Prime Minister \n     Allawi can be interpreted as a declaration of a strategic \n     goal: that, despite the attacks, elections will be held. The \n     comments are meant as a balance to the insurgents' strategy \n     of roadside bombings and mortar attacks and gruesome \n     beheadings, all meant to declare to Iraq and the world that \n     the country is in chaos, and that mayhem will prevent the \n     country from ever reaching democratic elections.\n       In a joint appearance last week in the White House Rose \n     Garden, Mr. Bush and Dr. Allawi painted an optimistic \n     portrait of the security situation in Iraq.\n       Dr. Allawi said that of Iraq's 18 provinces, ``14 to 15 are \n     completely safe.'' He added that the other provinces suffer \n     ``pockets of terrorists'' who inflict damage in them and plot \n     attacks carried out elsewhere in the country. In other \n     appearances, Dr. Allawi asserted that elections could be held \n     in 15 of the 18 provinces.\n       Both Mr. Bush and Dr. Allawi insisted that Iraq would hold \n     free elections as scheduled in January.\n       ``The question is not whether there are attacks,'' said one \n     Pentagon official. ``Of course there are. But what are the \n     proper measurements for progress?''\n       Statistics collected by private security firms, which \n     include attacks on Iraqi civilians and private security \n     contractors, tend to be more comprehensive than those \n     collected by the military, which focuses on attacks against \n     foreign troops. The period covered by Special Operations \n     Consulting's data represents a typical month, with its \n     average of 79 attacks a day falling between the valleys \n     during quiet periods and the peaks during the outbreak of \n     insurgency in April or the battle with Moktada al-Sadr's \n     militia in August for control of Najaf.\n       During the past 30 days those attacks totaled 283 in \n     Nineveh, 325 in Salahuddin in the northwest and 332 in the \n     desert badlands of Anbar Province in the west. In the center \n     of Iraq, attacks numbered 123 in Diyala Province, 76 in \n     Babylon and 13 in Wasit. There was not a single province \n     without an attack in the 30-day period.\n       Still, some Iraqis share their prime minister's optimism \n     when it comes to the likelihood that elections, and a closely \n     related census, can be carried out successfully amid so much \n     violence. ``We are ready to start,'' said Hamid Abd Muhsen, \n     an Iraqi education official who is supervising parts of the \n     census in Baghad. ``I swear to God.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Democratic leader, the managers of the \nbill, and the leadership on both sides have been in conversation over \nthe last 30 minutes or so looking at the schedule for the bill that is \non the Senate floor. It is a critically important bill. We have made \ngood progress, and if we look at the way the day has been spent, it has \nbeen spent on very significant legislation. But if we project that out \nand look at the reality, we have 300 amendments that have been given to \nthe managers and to leadership on a bill that we absolutely will finish \nbefore we depart.\n  We will finish reform of the executive branch, which is on the floor, \nand reform of the Senate, before we leave on October 8. There is also a \nlot of other business--the appropriations, the continuing resolutions, \nand the extensions.\n  With that recognition, we have 300 amendments. In a little bit, the \nDemocratic leader and I will have a unanimous consent for a filing \ndeadline tomorrow during the afternoon so that everybody will, as we \nsaid earlier this morning and late last night, get their amendments in, \nand language so that we can fully assess how many amendments we are \ngoing to really have to deal with. Our deadline that we set this \nmorning at 10 did generate 300 potential amendments.\n  It is clear we are going to have to pick up the pace on issues that \nhave been discussed thoroughly in committee. We are going to have to, \nin a very efficient way, have our managers deal with them on the Senate \nfloor and go through the amendments in an orderly way. At some point it \nmay be necessary for us to file cloture. It is not something we want to \ndo, but if we file cloture we would still be able to have germane \namendments introduced. That is not the intent, but unless we can work \nthrough the amendments, have the amendments submitted, have people come \nto the floor today, tonight, tomorrow, Friday, and Monday, it is \nsomething that at least we will have to consider. I say that, again, to \ngive some sense of urgency that we need to have these amendments come \nforward. We need to see them, and we need to have the managers have the \nopportunity to debate them and vote on them expeditiously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I add my voice of support for what the \nmajority leader said. We want Senators who have amendments to come to \nthe floor to offer them. As we get this filing deadline agreement, we \nare also going to ensure that Senators are protected. We know there is \na backlog with the legislative counsel and that it will take a little \ntime to draft them. So we will accommodate Senators with that practical \nconsideration in mind, but we hope that Senators understand Friday is \ngoing to be a full day of work, and we need a lot of amendments offered \non Friday.\n  We are going to have to have all of these amendments debated, and we \nwill look at the circumstances at some point. I will support the \ncloture motion if we are not making adequate progress. So Senators need \nto offer their amendments, agree to time limits, and move this \nlegislative process along.\n  We will get that filing agreement this afternoon, and Senators then \nwill have the opportunity to be clearer as to their intention with \nregard to these amendments. It is not our desire to hold them precisely \nto the language of the amendment, but we need to know how many real \namendments there are.\n  I support the majority leader's commitment to both the bill pending \nas well as to the organization of the legislative branch prior to the \ntime we leave. Both of these matters have to be addressed, and I think \nas we continue to work as successfully as we have, we can accomplish \nthis work before we leave. We just need the cooperation of all Members \nin that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are making good progress. We will \ncontinue to come to the floor to give a perspective given the fact that \nwe have so little time before we depart. Again, we are going to finish \nboth the internal oversight as well as the external oversight before we \nleave because we need to keep working in an efficient, rapid, but \nobviously deliberative way. We both thank the managers for their \ntremendous job and leadership thus far.\n\n[[Page S9901]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                   American Cannot Go Wobbly on Iraq\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know we are in a political season, and \nI suppose that will impact our business in the Senate as we address the \nmany issues that are before us. But the Senator from Iowa just made \nsome comments about where we are in the war on terror that I think need \nto be discussed.\n  First, I remember when former President Bush called Maggie Thatcher \nto ask for her support for his action during the first gulf war. Saddam \nHussein had invaded Kuwait and he asked for her support.\n  Maggie Thatcher said: Of course, Mr. President. Just do not go wobbly \non me.\n  That phrase was discussed quite a lot at the White House. Everyone \nunderstood that once a commitment is made to do something like confront \na tyrant like Saddam Hussein after he invaded the sovereign nation of \nKuwait, that you could not go wobbly once action was undertaken.\n  Secondly, we spent weeks and months in this body discussing the \nproblem of Saddam Hussein. I know my distinguished friend from Iowa was \na military pilot and can appreciate the fact that our aircraft were \nbeing fired on over a thousand times as they enforced the no-fly zones \nover Iraq related to the U.N. resolutions that arose after Hussein's \nattack on Kuwait.\n  We were spending billions of dollars maintaining our aircraft in the \nregion because we were concerned about Saddam Hussein. He was in \nviolation of 16 U.N. resolutions, and we urged him to come clean \nseveral times. We gave him one last chance to join the civilized \nnations of the world. He was given those warnings in clear and \nunequivocal ways. This Senate discussed it and voted on it. We voted \nwith a three-fourths majority to support the President and to authorize \nthe President to make one final demand on Iraq and Saddam Hussein to \nrenounce their weapons of mass destruction, to renounce their \nactivities in violation of the U.N., and to demonstrate that he had \ncomplied with the demands of the civilized world.\n  Saddam Hussein rejected that opportunity, and we knew at the time if \nhe did not comply, that hostilities would begin.\n  We are all grownups in this body and we knew what it meant when we \nvoted. At the time, the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts \nand now the Democratic nominee for President voted for the resolution \nthat authorized the President to commence hostilities. Now some want to \ngo wobbly. They say that things are not going perfectly. Since we have \nan election cycle on, they believe they can just say anything they want \neven if it undermines our soldiers in the field or if it encourages the \nenemy. And I would add that these detractors will say that if anybody \naccuses them of harming the effort to defeat terrorism or complains \nabout the impact to the morale of our troops in the field, why, they \nwill just say it is free speech. They believe they can say whatever \nthey want to.\n  Of course there is free speech. Any Senator in this body can come \nforth and say whatever they want to. I do not intend to impugn the \nmotives of any who express their views about the hostilities in Iraq at \nthis point. But I would just say this: Some things can hurt. When we \nhave a Senator in an official hearing or on the floor of the Senate \nmake statements before the world such as that the misbehavior that \noccurred and the illegalities that occurred in Abu Ghirab prison \nindicated that Saddam Hussein's prison had been ``opened under new \nmanagement,'' I suggest to you that Senator is subject to being \ncriticized for it. That is because he was wrong, No. 1, and No. 2, it \nencouraged and gave fodder for those who want to complain that the \nUnited States is on a mission to harm the Iraqi people and not to \nestablish a sovereign, free, prosperous government, which is what we \nwant to do. That is our goal.\n  So it is legitimate that we express concerns about some of the \nstatements made by colleagues. That is an honest debate. If people, in \neffect, think we have Saddam Hussein's prisons under new management, \nthey have a right to say so. But I submit we have had hearing after \nhearing, and the evidence clearly shows it is not true. It is not \ncorrect. We ought not be saying such falsehoods on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  They say things are so bad in Iraq and we are worse off at home. \nHowever, Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi recently said:\n\n       ``It's very important for the people of the world really to \n     know what we are winning. We are making progress in Iraq. We \n     are defeating terrorists. Najaf, Samarra, Mosul, Basra are \n     all live examples that a lot of progress has been made. And \n     this is all because of the determination of the Iraqi \n     people.''\n\n  They say that the elections can't be held in Iraq. We have heard that \nargument. This is what Prime Minister Allawi said:\n\n       ``We are definitely going to stick to the timetable of \n     elections in January of next year. We are doing our best to \n     ensure that we meet the time of the elections. We are adamant \n     that democracy is going to prevail, it is going to win Iraq. \n     We are going to stick to this time, and I call upon the \n     United Nations to help us in providing whatever it takes to \n     make the elections a success in Iraq. January next, is going \n     to be a major blow to terrorists and insurgents. Once we go \n     through the democratic process, once we achieve progress \n     towards democracy, the terrorists will be defeated.''\n\n  So said Prime Minister Allawi.\n  Here is what the Iraqi people say. An International Republican \nInstitute poll in Iraq showed this: 87 percent of Iraqis polled \nnationwide indicated they plan to vote in the January elections. \nEighty-seven percent planned to vote!\n  Most observers understand that it is not good if people won't \nparticipate in an election. You would rather have them vote. Whichever \nside of an issue you prefer, you still want to vote. But a massive \nboycott of an election would be something that would be serious and \ncause us concern if people weren't interested in an election. But 87 \npercent said they intend to vote. Seventy-seven percent said that \n``regular, fair elections'' were the most important political right \nfor the Iraqi people. Seventy-seven percent said that.\n\n  Here is what the critics say: The U.S. went to war without a ``broad \nand deep coalition,'' and this has ``divided our oldest alliance, \nNATO.''\n  But here are the facts. There are more Iraqi and non-U.S. soldiers on \nthe ground stabilizing Iraq than there are U.S. forces. Besides the \nUnited States, there are 32 countries contributing approximately 25,000 \nsoldiers to the coalition operating in Iraq; 15 of the 26 NATO \ncountries have troops on the ground in Iraq. The Iraqi Government has \napproximately 154,500 soldiers and police forces on hand to provide \nsecurity and stability throughout the country.\n  On 22 September, our NATO allies agreed to further implement the \ndecision by the heads of state and government to increase the \nassistance to the Government of Iraq with the training of its security \nforces. General Patreus, commander of the 101st Airborne, is over there \nnow. Actually, he was formerly the commander of the 101st. He led them \nin northern Iraq and Mosul, and he has now gone back to train Iraqi \nforces. He is a remarkable general with incredible capacity for work, \nand energy. I am confident that he will be successful.\n  I know there is much to be accomplished. We have a lot of high goals \nin Iraq. It is not an easy matter. It is going to be a tough battle, \nbut we are making progress. We will prevail, and we must not go wobbly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3766\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator, No. 3766, is the \npending business.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss my amendment. We \nare in some discussions right now with other staffs, and hopefully we \nmay have an agreement that would then allow us to agree by voice vote \nto this amendment. But I want to talk about it because it is a very \nimportant issue. It is important to our first responders. It is \nimportant to our broadcasters. It is important to public safety.\n  There is a long history, going back at least to Oklahoma City, that \nthe failure to have the ability to communicate costs the lives of \ninnocent Americans. It really is not any more complicated than that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from the Association of \nPublic-Safety Communications Officials-\n\n[[Page S9902]]\n\nInternational, the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Major \nCounty Sheriffs' Association, and the National Sheriffs' Association be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 28, 2004.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain, we are writing to express our strong \n     support for your proposed amendment to S. 2845, the \n     ``National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004,'' to establish a \n     firm date to provide additional radio spectrum for our \n     nation's first responders.\n       As you know, police, fire, emergency medical and other \n     public safety agencies face severe shortages of radio \n     spectrum in much of the nation, and are often forced to \n     operate on crowded radio frequencies that are incompatible \n     with their neighboring agencies. Additional public safety \n     spectrum would enhance our homeland security by promoting \n     more interoperable radio communications, alleviating \n     dangerous congestion on existing radio systems, and allowing \n     for the implementation of state-of-the-art communications \n     technologies to protect the safety of life and property.\n       In 1997, Congress required that certain television \n     broadcast spectrum be reallocated for public safety use, but \n     limited access to that spectrum until the uncertain end of \n     the digital television (DTV) transition. Your amendment would \n     establish a firm date of January 1, 2008, to make that \n     already allocated public safety spectrum available \n     nationwide, and end the DTV transition overall as of January \n     1, 2009. The amendment would also provide a source of funding \n     for future interoperable radio communications, and create an \n     opportunity for further public safety spectrum allocations.\n       We urge the Senate to reject amendments to your proposal \n     that would add uncertainty for public safety spectrum \n     availability. Without a firm date, state and local \n     governments will not be able to proceed to plan, fund, or \n     construct new interoperable radio communications systems.\n       Thank you for your continued support of our nation's first \n     responders.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gregory Ballentine,\n       President, Association of Public-Safety Communications \n     Officials-International.\n     Steve Edwards,\n       Chairman, Congressional Fire Services Institute.\n     Chief Joe Polisar,\n       President, International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n     Chief Robert A. DiPoli,\n       President, International Association of Fire Chiefs.\n     Chief Harold Hurt,\n       President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n     Sheriff Margo Frasier,\n       President, Major County Sheriffs' Association.\n     Sheriff Aaron D. Kennard,\n       President, National Sheriffs' Association.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will quote from some of the letter. It \nsays:\n\n       We are writing to express our strong support for your \n     proposed amendment to S. 2805 . . . to establish a firm date \n     to provide additional radio spectrum for our Nation's first \n     responders.\n\n  What is the situation today? The situation today is that there are \ntelevision stations that are on frequencies, channels 60 through 69, \nthat will remain there forever under the present situation. In other \nwords, in an appropriations bill--not through the Commerce Committee \nbut in an appropriations bill--language was included that said that the \nbroadcasters do not have to achieve a transition from analog to digital \nuntil 85 percent of the viewing audience in America had access to HDTV.\n  In testimony before the committee, Chairman Powell of the Federal \nCommunications Commission said that is never. That is never, he said--\nor decades. We have to get this spectrum freed up so we will have it \navailable for all of our first responders so in the case of a disaster \nor an attack, they will have the ability to communicate with each \nother.\n  As the letter points out, in 1997, and that was 7 years ago:\n\n       . . . Congress required that certain television broadcast \n     spectrum be reallocated for public safety use, but limited \n     access to that spectrum until the uncertain end of the \n     digital television transition.\n\n  The problem is, for 7 years, since we assigned that date, we have not \nmade that transition and, as I stated, if Chairman Powell is correct, \nwe will never make that transition to the point where the analog \nspectrum would have to be returned.\n  The letter from these public safety and first responders states:\n\n       We urge the Senate to reject amendments to your proposal \n     that would add uncertainty for public safety spectrum \n     viability. Without a firm date, State and local governments \n     will not be able to proceed to plan, fund or construct new \n     interoperable radio communications systems.\n\n  That is the heart of it.\n  I repeat that the reason I am proposing this amendment is because the \n9/11 Commission stated this as one of their urgent recommendations that \nneeded to be acted upon.\n  I have been made painfully aware over the years of the power and \ninfluence of the National Association of Broadcasters. In 1997, they \ngot billions of dollars worth of digital spectrum. They have sat before \nour committee and promised that by 2003 or 2004 all of it would be \nreturned--all of their analog spectrum would be returned. And, of \ncourse, they were able to prevail time after time. I am not going to \nwaste the valuable time of this body describing how they were able to \ndo that. But we are now facing a situation where we have to get this \nspectrum freed up. We have to do it.\n  Some will argue it is not enough. We have had testimony before our \ncommittee that we need more spectrum for public safety; that we need \nmore for first responders. But right now we don't have enough. Right \nnow. We need to clear this up.\n  Let me also point out who is sitting on the spectrum channels 60 to \n69. Unfortunately, a lot of it is Hispanic television. Some of it is \nreligious broadcasters, and by moving them off that spectrum it \nobviously would be somewhat discriminatory. The spectrum is being used, \nas I mentioned, in television broadcasting. This amendment would \nauthorize auctioning off the analog spectrum that is not used and the \nproceeds from that would be used to purchase set-top boxes for those \nindividuals or families who are still only receiving over-the-air \ntelevision.\n  I remind you again why the spectrum is so critical. It is not a new \nissue. In 1995, the Federal Communications Commission and the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration established a Public \nSafety Wireless Advisory Committee to evaluate the needs of Federal, \nState, and local public safety officials through the year 2010. The \ncommittee included distinguished experts from public safety agencies, \nequipment manufacturers, commercial service providers, and the public \nat large. This organization filed its report on September 11, 1996, \nmaking key recommendations. The first recommendation was stated quite \ndirectly: ``More spectrum is required.''\n  The committee explained, ``In the short term''--talking about 5 \nyears, talking about 1996 when their report was issued--``approximately \n25 Megahertz of new Public Safety allocations are needed. The present \nshortages can be addressed by making part of the spectrum presently \nused for television broadcast channels 60-69 available as soon as \npossible.''\n  That was back in 1996.\n  Among other recommendations, the PSWAC noted, ``Funding limitations \nwill remain a major obstacle in the adoption of needed improvements in \nPublic Safety communications systems. At a time when government budgets \nare tight, alternative methods of funding future Public Safety \ncommunications systems must be identified. Otherwise the substantial \nbenefits afforded by technology will not be realized.''\n  The recommendations of this distinguished commission are as true \ntoday as they were 7 years ago. And yet we have continued to fail to \ndeliver this spectrum to public safety.\n  In 1997, I chaired a hearing examining public safety spectrum issues. \nMy committee heard first-hand accounts of the troubles experienced a \nthe Oklahoma City bombing. We heard chilling testimony from Oklahoma \nCity Council Member Mark Schwartz about the day of the bombing. He \nsaid, ``We had our trailer command post, the State, the\n\n[[Page S9903]]\n\ncounty, the Feds: We were next door to one another, because we could \nnot communicate in any other way in our crisis.'' He told the story of \nstanding with an FBI agent whose cell phone was not operating. The only \nway the agent could communicate with Washington was through a friend of \nMr. Schwartz in Florida who had two phone lines in his house. The \nfriend used one line to talk to Oklahoma City and the other line to \ntalk to the FBI in Washington. Mr. Schwartz explained, ``You could not \nuse your cell phones, because they were jammed. Southwestern Bell at \nthis time went down. . . . This is why this additional public safety \nspectrum has to be in place. Because it means saving lives. And I do \nnot care where it is in this country, the public is entitled to it.''\n  That hearing was 7 years ago. We are no better off today. The 9/11 \nCommission report made the following observation: ``The inability to \ncommunicate was a critical element at the World Trade Center, Pentagon, \nand Somerset County, crash sites, where multiple agencies and multiple \njurisdictions responded. The occurrence of this problem at three very \ndifferent sites is strong evidence that compatible and adequate \ncommunications among public safety organizations at the local, State, \nand Federal levels remains an important problem.'' Nothing has changed.\n  What happened during those 7 years? Congress got the message, at \nleast partially, following the PSWAC report. In the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997, Congress allocated 24 megahertz to public safety. Big win for \npublic safety, right? Wrong. The 24 megahertz was just an empty \npromise. Why? Because broadcasters insisted on an exception to this \nrequirement. That exception continues to exist today with no end in \nsight. Under current law, public safety will not receive access to the \nspectrum until completion of the digital television transition. I asked \nFCC Chairman Powell at a hearing earlier this month, ``if neither the \nFCC nor Congress took any further action, when do you think the digital \ntelevision transition would be complete? He replied, ``decades.''\n  We cannot wait decades. We cannot stand by while another Oklahoma \nCity or Pentagon or New York incident occurs hoping for broadcasters to \nact in the best interests of the public rather than the best interest \nof themselves. We must act now.\n  The Wall Street Journal characterized the issue quite well on Monday: \n``You would think that these days, Congress would be on a terrorism \nhigh alert, paying any price to keep the homeland secure. But there's \nat least one chink in Washington's antiterror resolve, as was evident \nin the U.S. Senate last week. It involves the broadcasting lobby and \nthe high-stakes politics associated with the transition to digital TV. \nMost people have heard about big D.C. lobbies like the ones for tobacco \nand guns. Compared with the broadcasters, though, they're but a few \nsuburban moms writing letters. Multichannel News, a trade paper, says \nthe broadcast industry is `so potent it's considered immune from the \nlaws of political physics.' ''\n  The article proceeds to describe the SAVE LIVES Act calling it ``an \neasy and obvious solution.'' But the article aptly describes the fate \nof the bill last week in the Senate Commerce Committee: ``But the \nbroadcasting lobby liked virtually nothing about the bill, and senators \ncouldn't muscle up the political will to pass it. The Commerce \nCommittee voted 13-9 against the McCain proposal, approving a vastly \nwatered-down alternative. Only four channels would have to be returned \nby 2008, and even that handover could be delayed indefinitely if \nbroadcasters could persuade the FCC that doing so would cause \n``consumer disruption.'' The National Association of Broadcasters, the \nmain lobby group, says it is only concerned about preserving the \nability of millions of Americans to watch free broadcast TV; it also \nsays it is moving as quickly as it can toward digital television. \nMaybe. It's also possible that Congress, in doing the broadcasters' \nbidding, has managed a striking bifecta: a ridiculous technology policy \nthat leaves it open to the charge of being soft on terrorists.\n  I ask my colleagues: If there is another disaster--and I pray every \nsingle night that there never is--whether it be a terrorist attack, \nwhether it be a natural disaster, with which we are now becoming \nunfortunately more and more familiar, will we be able to tell the first \nresponders that we have taken every possible action to give them the \nability to communicate with one another to save lives?\n\n  I hope I can work out an agreement with my friend from Montana, who \nhas a different philosophical view on this issue, which I respect. I \nhope I can work out an agreement with him so that we can move forward \nand close this loophole that has been created, at the same time \nunderstanding there are legitimate concerns that broadcasters have in \narranging for this transition to take place. But we cannot have it be \nendless.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada has asked for 5 \nminutes. I will let him have his 5 minutes now and I will follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, is \nthat 5 minutes on the amendment or on another matter?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. On the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, very briefly, I rise in strong support of \nwhat Senator McCain is trying to do. This underlying bill is acting on \na lot of the proposals the 9/11 Commission has brought forward. It has \nrecognized some serious problems we face in this global war on \nterrorism and has asked Congress to address those--at least some of \nthose problems--in this bill. Senator McCain has tried with this \namendment to address some more of those problems.\n  Frankly, we do have a problem with first responders. They do not have \nthe spectrum they need to be able to communicate properly during \ndisasters. We have seen that a few times in the past. The 9/11 \nCommission has strongly recommended we take the kind of action Senator \nMcCain is trying to take today and free up the spectrum from the \nbroadcasters, the spectrum they have agreed to give up next year--\nfrankly, the hard deadline Senator McCain has put forward is actually \nyears out from that--and the broadcasters are now saying they cannot do \nthat. It would be too expensive for them and cause all kinds of \nproblems.\n  The broadcasters have had this spectrum for free for a long time. In \nthe agreement--forgetting the digital spectrum--they were supposed to \nget off of the analog spectrum, which is part of the spectrum we want \nto give to some public safety groups for better communication.\n  This is not just a question of radios being able to work. In the \nfuture, with the technology that is out there, we are talking about \nvideo, about broadband over some of this spectrum that will make our \nfirst responders much more effective in the jobs they are doing.\n  The amendment Senator McCain has brought forward will not only help \nfirst responders in the case of a terrorism attack, but it will also do \na lot of good things for our economy. Freeing up this much spectrum \nwill probably raise, according to estimates I have seen, around $50 \nbillion for the U.S. Government to help with the deficit. It will \nstimulate investment in America. It will create jobs.\n  There will be incredibly exciting new technologies brought forward \nthat we cannot imagine today if this spectrum is freed up.\n  It also goes to the heart of American competitiveness. We are falling \nbehind on a technology front from the rest of the world. We have to \ndeploy broadband widely across America. Spectrum is a very important \npart of deploying broadband, and it is critical that we move this \nprocess forward, that we not let a special interest group block what \nwill benefit virtually every American.\n  I rise in strong support of the McCain amendment. I am hopeful we can \nget this worked out, if not on this bill, on a bill in the near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\n                Amendment No. 3773 to Amendment No. 3766\n\n (Purpose: To ensure the availability of electromagnetic spectrum for \n                        public safety entities)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we do not want to prolong this debate \nbecause we have already discussed it in the Commerce Committee. I have \na second-degree amendment that tightens that loophole down a little \nbit, but I want to set the record straight.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommendation read this way:\n\n       Congress should support pending legislation which provides \n     for the expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum \n     for public safety purposes.\n\n  That is all it said. There is spectrum available if the FCC would \nonly assign it.\n  When we accelerate the transition to digital we are taking the small \nmarket television people almost off the air. In fact, some would say \nthat we are turning off about 73 million TV sets. As long as you set a \nhard date on a transition, those who would supply the equipment for \nthat transition that you have to have, it seems as though the prices \nnever come down.\n  I have been in the market a little bit. I might have rode in town on \nthe last load of pumpkins, but I didn't fall off the load and break my \nhead. As long as there is a date there, the price will stay high and \nsome of the little stations will never be able to make the transition.\n  I have the smallest TV market in the United States called Glendive, \nMT. It is 258th in all the markets. They cannot afford that. In 1998, I \nsent a check down there to buy the time when I was running for the \nSenate, and the buy was the biggest buy they had all year. They called \nme back and wanted to know if I wanted them to send the deed to the \nstation. They thought I had bought the station.\n  That is what we are looking at. Do we want to take off these little \nstations? We are talking about public safety--free over the air. \nTelevision does weather, a lot of announcements and public service in \nour local news. How many people could not take their eyes off the \ntelevisions in this market whenever these twisters were going around in \nadvance of and behind all of the hurricanes and the leftover hurricanes \nthat come through this area. Do we want to lose those free over-the-air \nbroadcasters? I don't think so, not with the service they provide to \nour local communities.\n  We have talked with the first responders, and we have done a lot of \nwork with the first responders. We have a bill on the Senate floor \ntoday called E 9-1-1, and the heart of that bill is to make sure that \nevery time you pay your phone bill you pay a little tax, and that money \ngoes to the States so that these communication centers can upgrade, \nmodernize. When you dial 9-1-1 on your cell phone, they can locate you \nas if you dialed in on a wired line.\n  I think that is a no-brainer. It only took 4 years to pass the \noriginal bill. Now we have to make sure the money goes to the right \nplace. Senator Clinton of New York and I have been working on that for \n2 years. And it still hasn't passed.\n  This underlying bill we are talking about, as recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission, this legislation should not even be on this bill because \nthey are talking about intelligence. They are talking about if \nsomething bad were to happen in this country. We are talking about \nafter it happens, and that is a whole new kettle of fish.\n  I am offering a second-degree amendment in the form of a substitute. \nBasically, it tightens up the loophole that the Senator from Arizona is \nso concerned about.\n  I will read it into the Record:\n\n       (B) to the extent necessary to avoid customer disruption \n     but only if all relevant public safety entities are able to \n     use such frequencies free of interference by December 31st, \n     2007, or are otherwise able to resolve interference issues \n     with relevant broadcast licensee by mutual agreement.\n\n  That is what we are saying, that the first responders have to ask for \nit. I will tell you, and I agree with the Senator from Arizona, we are \ngoing to lose some stations--and those channels, some of them are \nminority stations--as a result of this legislation.\n  I appreciate where the Senator from Arizona wants to go, but I will \ntell you, market forces usually do a better job in transitioning us \ninto a new era than hard and fast dates do. They do it in an economical \nsense and let everybody, all competitors, compete and survive in the \nmarketplace.\n  We know there is going to be demand for high-definition television. I \ncan remember, in 1991, going to the Consumer Electronics Convention in \nLas Vegas. Do you know what they wanted to do? They wanted the \nGovernment to set the standards of high-definition television. My \nmessage then was: You do not want the Government to set standards, \nbecause when we put them in law, they are there for a long time. Your \ncompetition is international. You set the standards. The industry sets \nthe standards, the standards in which they can compete and still make \nthe transition to and use the new technologies that are to come.\n  That is basically what we are talking about. So I offer this \namendment in the form of a substitute and ask for its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I presume we are about ready to perhaps \ndispose of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Montana sending an \namendment to the desk?\n  Mr. BURNS. I can do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while the amendment is being sent to the \ndesk, let me say I appreciate the way these two Senators and all \ninvolved have worked this out. I think this is a suitable arrangement. \nThe spectrum issue and its availability to first responders is very \nimportant. But this loophole was an opportunity for the spectrum issue \nto be avoided, perhaps in perpetuity.\n  I think the language we have here is reasonable language. I commend \nmy colleagues for being willing to work through it where we will not \nhave an extended debate through the afternoon, which is the right thing \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from \nMississippi in thanking and congratulating Senator McCain and Senator \nBurns for this agreement. I also thank Senator Lott for his part in \nsecuring this agreement. I know he was very helpful. They really \nreached not only an amicable but a meaningful compromise on how to \naccomplish one of the goals of the 9/11 Commission, which in its report \ndescribes the consequences of the inability of public safety officials \nto communicate at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and in \nPennsylvania.\n  The Commission recommended, specifically, that the Congress ``support \npending legislation which provides for the expedited and increased \nassignment of radio spectrum for public safety purposes.''\n  Senator McCain offered an amendment. The potential existed not only \nfor disagreement about it but for very long debate which would have \nmade it hard for the Senate to move forward expeditiously on the urgent \nunderlying legislation. Senator Burns and Senator McCain have reached \nan agreement which is meaningful. It gets something done. I might say, \nI hope and believe that it may set a precedent for other amendments \npending.\n  There are a lot of people who have said we face some intractable \nissues on this bill, but here we see clear evidence we can work through \nthese issues and, in that sense, set a precedent for how we can work \nthrough the other pending issues on this bill.\n  I thank everyone involved. I will strongly support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Burns \namendment be proposed as a second-degree perfecting amendment to the \nMcCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think that clears up the parliamentary situation. So we \nare now considering the Burns second-degree amendment to the McCain \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3773 to amendment No. 3766.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. That clears up the parliamentary situation.\n  I thank my friend from Montana. I know how involved he has been on \nthis issue. I was referring back to a hearing we had in 1997 on this \nissue. I do thank him. This compromise is certainly not what he wanted \nand it is not what I wanted. I also thank Senator Lott for his good \noffices in helping, as well as the cooperation of the staffs, as well \nas that of Senator Hollings and his staff.\n  Again, this is not what I wanted. This is not what Senator Burns \nwanted. But this is a way to achieve the primary recommendation of the \n9/11 Commission, which is to free up spectrum for first responders.\n  I will not quote again because I do not have it right here, but it is \nimportant we get this spectrum to our public safety and first \nresponders so they will be able to communicate in case of a disaster or \nattack.\n  The compromise amendment modifies my proposal by eliminating the \nrequirement that all broadcasters vacate the analog spectrum by a date \ncertain. Significantly, this compromise still provides the certainty \nthat public safety was seeking, that they will receive the spectrum \nthey were promised in 1997 by January 1, 2008.\n  This was not my preference on how to proceed. I never believed in \ntreating broadcasters differently. However, this amendment does so by \nrequiring broadcasters on channels 62 through 69 to vacate their \nspectrum if there is a bona fide request made by public safety. The NAB \nis supporting this amendment and has decided to treat its members \ndifferently.\n  This approach has been agreed to by Senators Burns, Hollings, and \nmyself. Again, it was not my preference to proceed in this \ndiscriminatory manner, but in the interest of ensuring passage this \nyear, I thought this was a positive step for public safety. However, I \nremind my colleagues this disparate treatment should be reviewed by the \nFCC this year.\n  The FCC can remedy this discriminating treatment by completing its \nwork toward ending the DTV transition. I urge the FCC to do so. I also \nurge the incoming chairman, Senator Stevens, and Chairman Barton of the \nCommerce Committee in the House to review this discriminatory treatment \nand the DTV transition upon Congress's return in January.\n  Lastly, I remind my colleagues that this approach does not provide \npublic safety the much needed money for equipment or consumers, a \nsubsidy to ensure all over-the-air viewers can continue to view \ntelevision. It was not my preference to strand public safety or \nconsumers in this manner. I hope in the near term Congress will \nreaddress this need to support public safety equipment funding. I thank \nmy colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe there would be any further debate. I \nthink the Senator from Montana would agree to have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona, the \nSenator from Montana, and the Senator from Mississippi for working on \nthis issue. I very much appreciate that. I urge adoption of the \namendment by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If there is no further debate, without objection, the second-degree \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3773) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 3766, \nas amended?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3766) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3774\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 3774.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Lieberman \nI propose an amendment that includes a number of the national \npreparedness provisions recommended by the 9/11 Commission and is \nsimilar to the related proposal we introduced as part of S. 2774 on \nSeptember 7. It does not address the issue of homeland security grants \nor spectrum allocation, as those issues will be addressed separately. I \nbelieve that this amendment will be non-controversial, and I hope that \nmy colleagues will support it.\n  One of the lessons that we learned from the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11 is that not only was our country not prepared to prevent \nthe terrorist attacks, but we were not adequately prepared to \nimmediately respond to the attack. One of the fundamental lessons \nlearned is that we need to do more to prepare our first responders and \nthe general public to respond to a terrorist attack.\n  The stories of the New York City Police Department not being able to \ncommunicate with the New York City Fire Department have led serious \nefforts to increase the amounts of money devoted to increasing \ninteroperability. Lives of the brave men and women of the fire \ndepartment and the people working at the World Trade Center were lost \nduring the terrorist attacks due, in part, to a lack of communication \nand the lack of a coordinated strategy to respond to large scale \ndisasters. We must continue to work to ensure that we equip our first \nresponders with the equipment and training necessary to ensure both \ntheir safety and their ability to carry out their critical missions.\n  The Commission's report emphasizes the importance of teamwork, \ncollaboration, cooperation, and the involvement of key decisionmakers. \nTheir recommendations build upon these themes. The report recommends \nthat emergency response agencies nationwide should adopt the Incident \nCommand System to ensure that there is a command structure in place \nwhen responding to an emergency. This amendment expresses the Sense of \nCongress that the Secretary for Homeland Security require homeland \nsecurity grant applicants aggressively implement the ICS and unified \ncommand systems. The amendment also would follow the Commission's \nrecommendation to remedy the long-standing liability and \nindemnification impediments to the provision of mutual aid in the \nNational Capital Region.\n  Consistent with the recommendations, the amendment also would direct \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to work with the Federal \nCommunications Commission, the Secretary of Defense, and State and \nlocal government officials to encourage and support the establishment \nof consistent and effective communications capabilities in the event of \nan emergency in a high-risk urban area. The Secretary is also directed \nto work with the Secretary of Defense to plan for supplying additional \nback-up communications support in the event of an emergency.\n  As pointed out by the 9/11 Commission, the private sector controls \napproximately 85 percent of the critical infrastructure in the Nation, \nand the report therefore places particular emphasis on the importance \nof private sector preparedness. The Commission report endorses the \nAmerican National Standards Institute, ANSI, and National Fire \nProtection Association, NFPA, voluntary Standard on Disaster/Emergency \nManagement and Business Continuity Programs. The amendment would direct \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a program to promote \nprivate sector preparedness for terrorism and other emergencies, \nincluding urging companies to adopt this ANSI/NFPA standard.\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\n  In striving to protect our Nation from the threat of terrorism, we \nmust continuously analyze our weaknesses and prepare for the threats of \nthe future. This amendment directs the Secretary of Homeland Security \nto fulfill this important responsibility by reporting to Congress \nregularly on his work to complete vulnerability and risk assessments, \nand the adequacy of the government's plans to protect our Nation's \ncritical infrastructure.\n  As our Nation continues to stand vigilant against the threats of \nfuture terrorist attacks, this amendment takes on additional meaning. \nDespite all the work done since September 11, it is likely that we will \nbe struck by terrorists again. We must continue to work to ensure that \nwe are ready to respond to any attack. This amendment strives to get us \ncloser to that goal.\n  Again, I believe that this amendment should be noncontroversial, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arizona for \nhis amendment. It would implement five important recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission that would improve our national preparedness. This \namendment would support efforts underway to ensure that Federal, State, \nand local entities all use what is known as the incident command \nsystem. I know that our first responders in Maine are leaders in the \nNation in using and training with this system. They have told me how \ncritical it is for effective response to terrorist attacks for there to \nbe a working command structure in place. This can only be accomplished \nwith training and organization before an attack or other such \nemergency.\n  Senator McCain's amendment would enable the first responders \nprotecting our Nation's Capital to save lives regardless of which side \nof the Potomac they happened to be on. It does that by establishing an \ninterstate mutual aid compact in the Washington, DC area. It would \nencourage coordination and communication in urban areas. It would \nencourage private sector preparedness and help private industry to be \nbetter prepared for an attack as well. It would ensure that a \nnonregulatory, voluntary program be established to promote preparedness \nwithin the private sector, using a consistent methodology to address \npreparedness.\n  Finally, it encourages the Department of Homeland Security to take a \nhard look at critical infrastructure, which the Department is already \ndoing, and report to Congress about its findings.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \namendment with Senator McCain. It is part of legislation that we \nintroduced early in September, along with Senators Specter and Bayh and \nothers, to implement all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nThis definitely complements the core of the proposal that Senator \nCollins and I and the members of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nmade to the full Senate.\n  The underlying bill would make historic changes to reform our \nintelligence community to do the best job we possibly can of knowing \nwhere our terrorist enemies are, what they are planning, and to strike \nat them before they can strike at us based on that intelligence.\n  We have to be prepared for occasions when terrorist attacks may \nsucceed. That is exactly what this measure is all about. It is \npreparing our local communities to join in the prevention of attacks \nand then to improve the public and private infrastructures to be ready \nto respond in the best possible way.\n  The 9/11 Commission recognized that even big cities with first \nresponders and public service systems that are highly well regarded can \nbe overwhelmed by a terrorist attack as we saw on September 11. That is \nwhy this amendment would encourage people to come together, to work \ntogether to coordinate the capabilities of each of their communities \ninto a greater unified force.\n  This amendment would, therefore, help promote integrated emergency \ncommand systems that give an array of response agencies at the local \nlevel clear roles and leadership in the event of a crisis.\n  Specifically, it encourages the Department of Homeland Security to \ncondition its terrorism preparedness grants on evidence that the \ncommunities are adopting a so-called incident command system, a \ncoordinated system which I have seen in effect in communities in \nConnecticut and around the country.\n  The amendment also calls on the Department of Homeland Security to \nhelp create emergency community capabilities in urban areas that are \nmost likely to be targeted for terrorist attacks. This is the \ncomplement to the agreement between Senators McCain and Burns we just \nadopted.\n  Finally, the amendment urges the Secretary of Defense to regularly \nreport on the plans and strategies of NORTHCOM, the northern command, \nthe new command designed to defend, through the military, the U.S. \nhomeland. We want to know more about the role envisioned for NORTHCOM, \nto ensure that the unique capabilities of the DOD are well organized, \nprepared, and available should the President need to activate them for \nthe defense of our homeland.\n  Together these provisions are going to bolster our defenses against \nterrorism, even as the underlying bill--if I can put it this way--works \nto strengthen our offense, which is the offense of the best, most \ncoordinated intelligence system we can have.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Before I yield the floor, if there is no further debate, I believe \nthis is a noncontroversial amendment, though a substantial one, and I \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3774) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to address the \nquestion of intelligence reform and the future of our national security \nestablishment.\n  I believe this is the single most important issue to be addressed by \nthe Congress this year. Today, the Senate is considering legislation \nwhich would overturn the current structure of the intelligence \ncommunity, primarily in response to the recommendations of the \nCommission established to review the tragedy of 9/11.\n  While I agree that improvements are needed, I urge all of my \ncolleagues to approach this matter very cautiously. We live in \ninteresting and very dangerous times. Many felt that with the collapse \nof the Soviet Union we had entered into a new era of world peace. I \nthink most of us here recall that we, the President and the Congress, \nimmediately proceeded to claim a peace dividend, and we sought to reap \nits benefits by cutting back on national security spending. Perhaps it \nwas the right thing, in a world that had indeed fundamentally changed, \nto reduce our national security spending. Important programs in both \ndefense and intelligence were curtailed.\n  In hindsight, some now question why certain areas of the budget were \nreduced. As the Cold War ended, it was clear we needed to review our \nnational security programs. For 45 years, our defense and intelligence \ncapabilities had keenly focused on the Soviet Union. We had devised \nweapons systems, strategies, and intelligence capabilities, all \ndesigned to counter that threat. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, our \nleaders have been working to adjust the focus of our national security \napparatus to de-emphasize certain elements of our strategy and \naccentuate others. These changes have taken a long time and some have \nmet resistance. Those of you who know the military history might recall \nthat during World War I, with the advent of tanks and other motor \nvehicles, it became apparent that the horse cavalry was obsolete; it \nsimply had no place on the 20th century battlefield. Yet while that war \nended in 1917, it took until the 1930s for the Army to completely \neliminate the horse cavalry from its ranks.\n  In his highly acclaimed account of the Cuban missile crisis, ``The \nEssence of Decision,'' Graham Allison explains how President Kennedy \nwas surprised when Khrushchev wanted to negotiate the removal of our \nmissiles from Turkey, while he removed missiles from\n\n[[Page S9907]]\n\nCuba, but President Kennedy had already directed that the Turkish \nmissiles be removed.\n  After 42 years in the Senate, I am aware of how frustrating it can be \nto change the massive national security bureaucracy. It has frustrated \nthe reformers in those agencies who recognize what needs to be done. \nEach Secretary of Defense and CIA Director since 1990 has worked to \nchange the emphasis of these agencies from a Cold War focus, and they \nare succeeding, albeit very slowly.\n  The Congress can legislate changes, but that is only half the battle. \nAs President Kennedy discovered, those who have to implement these \nchanges must do so. We should not be fooled into thinking this bill \nwill be fully implemented, unless it does right by the agency it seeks \nto change and is supported by them. As written, I do not believe this \nbill meets that test.\n  It is clearly our responsibility to make constructive recommendations \nthat can lead to improvements in our national security bureaucracy. \nThat is what the people expect of us. We must be sure that the bill we \npass is in fact constructive and will not create greater problems than \nit solves. If we pass legislation that fundamentally alters the current \nintelligence structure, we can ensure that it will lead to a period of \nseveral years during which the new intelligence community will \nexperience growing pains.\n\n  Furthermore, if, in our attempt to strengthen the control of the head \nof intelligence, we disenfranchise those it is supposed to support, the \nimpact of this bill will clearly be adverse. I understand the \nfrustrations of my colleagues and of all Americans who suffered because \nof 9/11--those who lost loved ones in particular, but in reality all \nAmericans because our lives were changed by that tragedy.\n  Every Member of Congress wants to improve our defenses against any \nfurther terrorist attack. I say to each of my colleagues again, what is \nmost important, what is absolutely critical is that we make changes \nthat are positive, that improve our national security structure, and \nthat do not have unintended consequences that could jeopardize our \nsecurity.\n  We all recognize that we face a new enemy, one that knows no borders \nand operates beyond the norms of civilized society, but we also know \nthat we have 130,000 troops standing in harm's way, who face a threat \nsignificantly different than the one we face here at home.\n  The new national security system we create must allow us to meet both \nof these challenges, as it must be able to protect us from the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and from the threats of \nnations that might seek to harm us, our allies, or our interests around \nthe world.\n  I often remark that we have the greatest military in the world, \nperhaps in the history of mankind. Our young men and women who put on \nthe uniform of this country serve us magnificently. Let me remind you \nthat it is only 1 percent of our citizens who serve in our Armed Forces \nto protect the remaining 99 percent of us. We are truly in their debt.\n  It is for them that I strongly support a robust budget to strengthen \ndefense every year. It is also for them that we must ensure we do \nnothing to weaken the support they get from the intelligence community.\n  I would like to note that, in addition to our military, our Nation is \nlucky to be served by the men and women in our intelligence community.\n  They represent the best in public service. There are those who have \ncriticized our intelligence community since 9/11, but the men and women \nin this field are truly dedicated, patriotic Americans. In seeking to \nchange how we manage intelligence we must be sure that we remember \nthose who serve in both of these communities.\n  We are focusing on intelligence reform in this bill because there is \nneed for further improvement. The tragedy of 9/11 and the faulty \nintelligence which had many believing that Iraq had weapons of mass \ndestruction demonstrate that our system is not perfect. It was exactly \nthese problems which led the 9/11 Commission and many others to call \nfor reforming intelligence.\n  Like all Americans I commend the Commission for its work. It did a \nmasterful job of reviewing the facts, combing through the massive data, \nand presenting the results in clear and concise prose. Their report \nprovides a great reconstruction of the events of 9/11 and why it \noccurred. However, some not that the conclusions they draw may not be \nfully justified by the facts they uncovered.\n  Last week, the Appropriations Committee received testimony from \nseveral expert witnesses. We heard from a distinguished jurist, Judge \nRichard Posner, who studied the 9/11 Commission report and was \ndisturbed by its recommendations. He concluded that the Commission went \nway beyond the evidence presented.\n  The Commission contends that we had an intelligence failure, that it \nwas a systemic problem as opposed to several mistakes being made by our \nintelligence community. They blame it on a failure to connect the dots \nand a lack of imagination.\n  In their analysis, and also cited by the Committee, for example, they \nnote that several terrorists met in Malaysia and that a few proceeded \nfrom there to the United States and took part in the attack on 9/11. \nThey conclude with hindsight that the CIA should have recognized that \nthese terrorists were linked to the bombing of the USS Cole and should \nhave informed the FBI and the State Department about the meeting.\n  It is this type of evidence which the Commission and the Governmental \nAffairs Committee both cite as the justification for an overhaul of our \nintelligence infrastructure.\n  We all wish that our analysts would have been prescient enough to \nrecognize the relationship among these terrorists, and their connection \nto the Cole bombing, and the importance of the Malaysian meeting.\n  We all wish that these same analysts would have made that information \navailable to the FBI and State Department where there exists a \npossibility that it would have triggered an investigation of their \nmovements here. But I for one believe it would have taken a lot of luck \nfor that to have happened--more than simply connecting the dots or \nhaving better imagination.\n  Consider this point. It has been more than 3 years since the attack \non our Nation. In that time, we have devoted billions of dollars and we \nhave sacrificed many young lives in the war on terrorism, but as far as \nwe know, Osama bin Laden remains hidden from view directing the \nfarflung al-Qaida network.\n  Would anyone seriously claim that we have not worked hard enough to \nconnect the dots since 9/11?\n  Intelligence is a tough business. Like me, many of our colleagues \nhave been involved in intelligence oversight for the Congress. I am not \ntelling them something new.\n  We have witnessed advances in communications and in command and \ncontrol and other technologies which have revolutionized intelligence. \nBut, with all the highly sophisticated tools in our arsenal, we still \ncan not find Osama.\n  Earlier this year, former CIA Director Tenet testified to the \nCongress that it would take another 5 years before we had successfully \nrebuilt an inadequate human intelligence capability in the war on \nterror. Some immediately held up the Director's statement as an \nindication that we have not addressed human intelligence requirements. \nAnd that is simply not the case.\n  For 50 years we promoted human intelligence, but our focus was on \ndefeating international communism in places where it was taking root, \nprimarily in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In some cases it takes a \ngeneration to build a human intelligence network. When we took our \npeace dividend, we set back the efforts to refocus human intelligence \non newer threats.\n  When the Director says it will take another 5 years, it is not \nbecause we haven't been responsive since the rise of al-Qaida. Should \nwe have been working on this more vigilantly? Maybe. But I ask you: Who \namong us knew at the end of the Cold War that the greatest challenge we \nwere likely to face in the future would come from the son of a Saudi \nconstruction magnate?\n  Had we known that at the time of Desert Storm, could we have \nconvinced all of our colleagues that there should be no peace dividend \nbecause we needed to prepare for al-Qaida? We all know the answer to \nthat.\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\n  So I ask you: How will changing the intelligence structure solve this \ndilemma? Will it allow us to grow our human intelligence capability \novernight? Obviously not, but it could distort the working relationship \namong the various agencies so that intelligence support is harder for \nthe agencies, such as the Defense Department, to get.\n  That could lead agencies with the financial wherewithal to provide \nthat capability internally. That outcome would be expensive and very \nharmful.\n  The Commission looks at this issue only through the lens of \nterrorism, and seeks to ensure better coordination within the \ncommunity.\n  In so doing, it fails to consider the varied responsibilities and \nneeds of all the actors which depend on intelligence.\n  As you know, as ranking member of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have access to virtually all of our Nation's secrets, \nincluding those in the Defense Department and in intelligence programs \nas well.\n  Over the past 3 years our Committee has been informed of multiple \nthreats, most of which have never been publicized. The intelligence \ncommunity must treat each warning with utmost care. They must research \nand investigate each one to determine its veracity, and then respond \nappropriately to those incidents which are deemed credible.\n  In many cases what some call connecting the dots is really like \nsearching for a needle in a haystack. And, just to make it more \ndifficult, there are many hay stacks to examine and in some cases the \nneedle looks exactly like hay. Sure the needles are there and \ntheoretically they could be found, but should we really expect our \nanalysts to find them every time?\n  Furthermore, I want everyone to realize that we are not standing \nstill. We have come a long way in improving intelligence cooperation.\n  We created the Terrorist Threat Integration Center to bring analysts \nfrom various parts of the community to work together.\n  The enactment of the PATRIOT Act brought down a wall which had \npreviously blocked information sharing between various parts of the \nintelligence community and the FBI. Our defense and intelligence \nleaders are working to break stovepipes and to ensure that information \nsharing is working.\n  Certainly more improvements are needed in intelligence cooperation \nand in new technology to improve information sharing.\n  Our Nation has the finest national security apparatus--defense and \nintelligence--in the world. It is not perfect and it never will be. \nSome areas can be improved. But it is a critical capability.\n  Our warfighters--our young men and women who, as we speak, are \nserving in harm's way--depend on seamless intelligence. It is our \nsolemn duty to ensure that we can continue to provide them the best. We \nmust make sure that we do not inadvertently take actions which could \nsever the link between our defense capabilities and intelligence \nsupport.\n  We cannot take the Secretary of Defense out of the loop simply \nbecause we seek to strengthen the head of the intelligence community.\n  So what changes shall we make to improve the intelligence capability \nof this country?\n  First, I would suggest, as recommended by the Commission and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, that we establish a national \ncounterterrorism center.\n  The one real failing of the intelligence community in preparing for \n9/11, be it in the FBI, the CIA, the NSA or other organizations was the \ninability or unwillingness to share terrorist intelligence and analysis \ncompletely and seamlessly among the disparate parts of this community.\n  Many improvements have already been made, but the one reform that \ntruly can respond to the cries from the families of 9/11 victims is to \naddress this issue, and to address it now. This is the most critical \nchange that needs to be legislated and our Intelligence and Armed \nServices Committees need to follow up to make sure it is implemented \nand is effective in conducting it mission.\n  That center needs to be the clearing house for all intelligence on \ncounter-terrorism, both foreign and domestic. It needs to work across \ndisciplines and agencies, and it needs to have the support of all of \nthe intelligence community. It needs to be the analytical capability \nfor the community in the field of counterterrorism.\n  We need to join foreign and domestic analysis together to be sure \nthat we get the full intelligence picture. However, because this Nation \nbelieves that foreign and domestic intelligence programs must be \nseparated to ensure that civil liberties and the rights of all \nAmericans are safeguarded, I would urge my colleagues not to give this \norganization any operational role.\n  It certainly should conduct analysis and strategic planning, but \noperational planning and operations should continue to be handled as \nthey are today through other parts of the intelligence community \nworking with the Defense Department overseas and the FBI working here \nat home in conjunction with other relevant domestic agencies.\n  I believe that as we establish this new organization, the national \nintelligence director's charter should ensure that this national \ncounterterrorism center receives the resources it needs and that the \ndirector should focus his efforts on this one challenge in its first \nyear of existence.\n  I agree with the managers of the bill that other intelligence centers \nmay need to be created, but I believe the decision to do so should come \nfrom the President based on the recommendation of the national \nintelligence director with the concurrence of the National Security \nCouncil and the Congress.\n  Most important, we have to make sure we come up with the right \nsolutions for the rest of the intelligence community. What may be right \nfor counterterrorism may not be the solution that best serves our \nintelligence needs for weapons proliferation or for our military. For \nthose reasons, I am not comfortable with rushing this process.\n  Some criticize the community for a ``group think'' outlook. They say \nthat the analysis that indicated that in all probability Iraq was in \npossession of weapons of mass destruction is an example of group think. \nI am one who questioned the results of that analysis.\n  With hindsight, I speculate that the community failed because it \ntried to provide policy makers the answer they wanted rather than a \nfair interpretation of the facts. Nonetheless, if group think was a \nproblem, how will that be improved by greater centralization of the \nanalytical capabilities in the community? Won't that only exacerbate \nthat problem?\n  And by creating a more powerful intelligence director with a closer \ntie to policy making, won't that likely lead to more attempts to sway \nanalysts to reach politically acceptable conclusions?\n  These are the troubling facts that were not addressed by the 9/11 \nCommission and are not adequately considered in this bill.\n  Last week, the Appropriations Committee received testimony from seven \nwitnesses, all of whom are experts in the field of national security \nand counterterrorism. Included among them were Dr. Henry Kissinger, the \ncurrent head of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and \nformer Deputy Secretary of Defense, Dr. John Hamre.\n  I do not believe I would be overstating their views to say they were \nquite concerned with the legislation being proposed by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  Their counsel was to be cautious. Dr. Kissinger recommended that \nCongress study this issue more carefully.\n  He urged us to take another 6 months before we moved forward on what \nis the most significant Government overhaul since the National Security \nAct of 1947.\n  Last week, noted experts in national security, including former \nSecretary of State George Shultz, former CIA Director William Gates, \nformer Secretaries of Defense Bill Cohen and Frank Carlucci, and former \nSenators Nunn, Hart, Bradley, Rudman and Boren, all recommended that \nthe Congress proceed cautiously. They urged all of us to remember the \nold medical adage: First, do no harm.\n  This is a most important debate and a most important issue. I know \nsome of my colleagues worry that if we do not\n\n[[Page S9909]]\n\nact now we will lose the opportunity for significant change. I \nrecognize this concern. But enacting bad legislation in haste because \nthere is a popular demand to act is not the proper way for this body to \nrespond.\n  The Senate was created to cool the passions of the people. Our \nhistory, our culture, even our rules are all deeply instilled with the \nconcept of proceeding cautiously.\n  I urge my colleagues to agree with those of us who recommend \nbeginning the process of reform by establishing a new central authority \nfor intelligence, a national intelligence director, any by responding \nto the specific challenges raised by the events of 9/11 with the \ncreation of a national counterterrorism center.\n  But I believe we need to give a new administration and Congress more \ntime to determine how the rest of the national security apparatus will \nbe structured. Let us use the coming year to determine how we balance \nthe additional responsibilities and share power among the various \ncomponents of our national security agencies.\n  This matter is too important to rush through in 2 weeks in the heat \nof a Presidential campaign. Please let us act responsibly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to give my colleagues an update on \nan amendment that was offered yesterday. It is an amendment that was \noffered by Senator Wyden on behalf of himself, Senator Snowe, Senator \nGraham, and Senator Lott. I believe we have reached an agreement on a \ncompromise to that amendment, which deals with declassification. \nActually, I recall the Presiding Officer, Senator Cornyn, is also a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  We have been able to work out an alternative to the amendment. We are \njust waiting for language to come from legislative counsel. It is my \nhope, and I believe the hope of Senator Lieberman, that we will be able \nto dispose of that amendment this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. That is certainly \nmy hope. I am grateful that all the parties have come together about \nthis amendment. I think we have a solution that doesn't create another \nboard but does realize the goals that Senator Wyden and the other \nbipartisan sponsors of the amendment have, to have a reasonable means \nof asking for a second look, if I can put it that way, at a \nclassification decision made by the executive branch with regard to \ncongressional access to intelligence information. I am very pleased \nabout that and I hope we can get the language here and do it this \nafternoon.\n  I also say to our colleagues how important is the announcement made \nearlier today by the bipartisan leadership, Senator Frist and Senator \nDaschle. I hope people will respond to it. First, I thank the two of \nthem for the extent to which they have worked in support of the effort \nSenator Collins and I are making and that they are together in support \nof the effort, which is exactly the standard that needs to be set as we \nwork on this critical national security matter.\n  Second, there is a clear message, which is that Senator Frist and \nSenator Daschle may together move to invoke cloture unless there is a \nsteady movement of Senators to the floor introducing their amendments, \nbecause there is an excessive--there is an indication of an intention \nto file over 200 amendments. Senator Frist has made clear that we are \nnot going to depart from Washington until we finish this bill and take \naction on the report of the working group, led by Senators McConnell \nand Reid, with regard to reform of congressional oversight of \nintelligence, as urged on us by the 9/11 Commission.\n\n  I am very grateful for that statement of policy by the leadership. We \nought not leave here until the Senate completes its work on these two \ncritically important matters. These are urgent. There would simply be \nno excuse to our constituents, to the American people at large, to have \nleft for political campaigns while the Nation is under clear and \npresent danger of terrorist attack, with a certain unsettling imminence \nsuggested as we lead up to our national elections.\n  I join with Senator Collins in thanking our colleagues who have come \nto the floor with amendments; those, as was the case with Senators \nMcCain and Burns, who worked out a very significant and real compromise \non what could have been a long distraction on the road to adopting our \nproposal.\n  I hope people will now come to the floor. We will be here for a while \nmore today. Obviously, we will be here tomorrow. Leadership told us we \nwill be here Friday and Monday. The sooner we get these amendments in \nand consider them and dispose of them, the sooner we are going to pass \nthis bill, move on to legislative reform, and recess.\n  With thanks for the pace we are setting so far and for the support we \nare receiving, I urge Members who have amendments to come to the floor \nand offer them at this time. We are open for business.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized as \nin morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 2 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Commodity Check-Off Program\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think we are all familiar with what the \nCommodity Check-Off Program is. It is a program that is voluntary in \nall commodities. It allows people to donate to the USDA a small \npercentage of profits in order to promote their product. This is \nsomething that has worked especially well, and something we are having \na little problem with now because the USDA says if they change this \namount, they do not have the authority to do it.\n  I will introduce a bill that will give them that authority. It is \nsupported by all farm organizations, by the administration, by the Farm \nBureau, by the Farmers Union. There is no opposition. I anticipate that \nit will be taken up on the floor, and I will introduce it in time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have asked the two managers of the bill \nif I might speak in morning business for a few minutes. Let me ask for \n7 minutes, and if they need the floor to do business on the 9/11 \nCommission bill, I will give up the floor. I want to speak of something \nI think is very important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Disaster Aid\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first I will talk about disaster aid. I \nwill talk specifically about disaster aid for family farmers in the \nnorthern Great Plains who have been hard hit.\n  We have been talking a lot about disaster aid for people who have \nbeen victims now of four successive hurricanes in the Southeast. God \nbless those people who have been victims of the hurricanes. They have \nhad a difficult time. Perhaps none of us can understand how\n\n[[Page S9910]]\n\nawful it has been for them. Those storms have swept a wide tract across \nthe southeastern corner of the United States.\n  I have always believed, in my service in the United States Congress, \nthat for those who need help because of natural disasters, the Congress \nshould help. I have always voted for assistance, when I served in the \nboth the House and the Senate. The people who await the aid need to \nunderstand we want to make certain we provide this assistance during \nthis difficult time.\n  In recent days, I have been reading reports about the disaster aid \nthat the Senate included in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. \nIn that bill, the Senate included legislation dealing agricultural \ndisaster assistance for family farmers around the country, not just in \nthe Southeast. Now some are saying maybe the disaster aid we put in the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill will have to be stripped out. I \nwant to talk about that for a moment.\n  It is critically important that we provide disaster aid not only for \nthose people and those farmers in the Southeast, but also for other \nfarmers around the country who have lost their entire crops due to \nweather-related disasters.\n  I was reading an e-mail from a young woman. She wrote an e-mail that \nI will paraphrase. It describes the culture of family farming and \ndescribes why I care so much and why some of my colleagues are so \npassionate about this issue. Her name is Annie. She writes that her dad \nis a farmer and was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor that \nproved to be cancerous. He has now been taking aggressive treatment. \nThe prognosis is not great. She said: When we found out about dad's \ncancer, our neighbors told us not to worry about the farm. She said: \nMy youngest brother was trying to manage the farm on his own this \nsummer, but on August 25, 100 neighbors showed up at the farm with \ncombines, grain carts, trucks, and semis to harvest the wheat. The \nlocal Case dealership donated some manpower and some machinery. The \nlocal crop insurance agency catered an outdoor barbecue to feed 150 \npeople who worked.\n\n  She sent pictures of her dad, who is suffering from a brain tumor, \nbut more importantly a picture of all the combines that came over, all \nthe trucks, all donated, all from folks who showed up because they knew \na neighbor was in trouble. It is part of the culture and the value \nsystem of family farming. The network of farms that dots the prairies \nin this country, especially in the northern Great Plains that I know so \nmuch about in terms of family farming, is part of the culture of this \ncountry.\n  A wonderful author named Richard Critchfield talked of the origin of \nfamily values that originated on family farms, and moved to small towns \nand big cities to refresh and nourish family values in this country. \nThat is why family farms are so critically important.\n  In my part of the country this year we did not have hurricanes, but \nin the spring we had torrential rains. These are pictures of the same \nState. This is the southwestern corner of my State. It looks exactly \nlike a moonscape, or perhaps the surface of Saturn, as we have seen in \npictures. There is no vegetation, nothing growing. There has been a \nprotracted drought. I had people tell me north of Hettinger, North \nDakota, they had 2.2 inches of total moisture from January 1 to July \n1--6 months, 2.2 inches of total moisture. Their land was destroyed; no \nvegetation at all.\n  This picture is the same State, the State of North Dakota, with a \nfarmer standing in his field inundated by water. There were 1.7 million \nacres in North Dakota not planted this year. Let me say that again: 1.7 \nmillion acres could not be planted. Farmers like this farmer standing \nin the middle of his field risk everything. When they cannot plant \ntheir entire farm, they will go broke if they do not get some help. \nDrought and inundated by torrential rains, they could not plant 1.7 \nmillion acres, and in August, when the corn and beets needed heat units \nto grow, we had a freeze. It was a very unusual occurrence in North \nDakota, but it froze in August, a frost that damaged some of these \ncrops.\n  The Senate passed a disaster aid package for victims in the Southeast \nrecovering from the hurricanes, and also passed an agricultural \ndisaster aid package on the Homeland Security bill. We need to finish \nthat job.\n  I hear and now read in the National Journal and Congressional \nQuarterly that some are saying it is likely we will not keep the \nagricultural disaster package in the Homeland Security bill through the \nconference committee, because we have some people who do not want that \nto happen. I would say to those people: There is not a difference \nbetween the reimbursement for a crop that was lost in northern Florida \nor a crop that was lost in northern North Dakota due to a weather-\nrelated disaster. They both occur in counties that are disaster \ncounties. They both occur in a way that is devastating to the family \nfarmer and will injure that family in an irreparable way unless this \ncountry says, We are here to help you.\n  I want to tell those who are saying this cannot be done: this must be \ndone. We will help those folks who have been injured by the four \nhurricanes, but we will also insist on helping others across a wide \nband of this country who were injured by torrential rains and by a \nprotracted drought in the heartland and parts of the West. There is a \nbroad consensus in the Senate that disaster aid must be helpful also to \nfamily farmers in other parts of America. We cannot allow this to be \ndropped. We must continue to impress upon those who would not include \nthis assistance that when we provide disaster aid, it must include all \nof those who have been affected and devastated by weather-related \ndisasters.\n  If I might mention one additional point. We are currently dealing \nwith homeland security and terrorism in the Senate. I commend the \nmanagers of the bill on both the Republican and Democrat side. I have \nwatched the debate and the discussion. I think it has been wonderfully \ndone, very professionally handled.\n\n\n              National Registry Of Convicted Sex Offenders\n\n  Mr. President, terrorism comes in many forms. Within our country, one \nform of terror is perpetrated by sex offenders.\n  I have introduced a piece of legislation to deal with this problem. I \nwould like to describe why it is important that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee act on this legislation. And let me, at the outset, thank \nSenator Hatch, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his support \nof it.\n  Not quite one year ago, a young coed at the University of North \nDakota was working at a shopping center in Grand Forks, ND. At about 5 \nin the afternoon, she left her job to walk out to her car. She was \nabducted and brutally murdered.\n  The alleged murderer is now in jail. He will be standing trial. This \nman had been incarcerated 23 years for violent sex offenses in \nMinnesota, and then let out of prison. He was considered a high-risk \noffender, but he was let out of prison to go back on the streets, with \nno monitoring of any sort.\n  That afternoon, when this young woman named Dru Sjodin walked out of \nthat shopping center, her assailant was free to roam that parking lot, \nto abduct her and to brutally murder her.\n  After this tragic crime, I found out that there was a serious flaw in \nthe way that sex offenders are tracked in this country. If you were \nliving, for example, in Grand Forks, ND, as this young college coed \nwas, and you checked the North Dakota sex offender registry, you would \nnot know that violent sex offenders had been let out of jail in \nMinnesota and were living in your area, just a few miles across the \nstate line.\n  I think there ought to be a publicly available national database of \nconvicted sex offenders who are released from prison, so people are \nable to get a meaningful list of sex offenders in their area, including \noffenders across state lines.\n  I also think when a high-risk sex offender is about to be released \nfrom prison, the local State attorney ought to be notified, to \ndetermine whether to seek further incarceration for the protection of \nthe public.\n  Third, if a high-risk sex offender is, in fact, released from prison, \nthen there ought to be intensive monitoring following that person's \nrelease, for a period of at least one year.\n  In this case, a high-risk, dangerous offender was released from \nprison after\n\n[[Page S9911]]\n\n23 years. He was under zero supervision. A wonderful young coed from \nthe University of North Dakota walked out of a shopping center. She was \nabducted at knifepoint and then brutally murdered.\n  Maybe we save some lives with a bill, which would be known as Dru's \nLaw, that would require a national database to be made available to the \nAmerican public through the internet.\n  Maybe we can avoid future circumstances where high-risk sex offenders \nare turned loose with zero supervision.\n  I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy. They have both reviewed this \nlegislation, and both think it has merit. It is not something that \nwould cost very much. It is something that has a great deal of common \nsense to it. I also thank Senators Dayton, Coleman, Conrad, Johnson, \nLugar, and Durbin, who on a bipartisan basis have cosponsored this \nlegislation.\n  I passed a piece of legislation very much like this about 2 years \nago. A young woman named Jeanna North, who was 11 years old, was \nmurdered in Fargo, ND, by a man named Kyle Bell. He was being hauled \naround the country by a private company that was contracted by the \nState to haul prisoners from one facility to another.\n  I do not think a convicted murderer should ever leave the arms of law \nenforcement, and turned over to a private company. But I found out it \nis done all the time. If they are going to haul a convicted murderer, a \nviolent offender, they will often contract with a private company.\n\n  It turns out, they contracted with a company that took this man named \nKyle Bell, this murderer, and hauled him around the country. They \nstopped for gas. One guard was asleep, the other was in buying a \ncheeseburger, and Kyle Bell crawled out of the bus and walked into a \nparking lot of a shopping center, wearing his street clothes, mind you.\n  That will never happen again. There is now a law on the books. It \nsays if you are a private company hauling violent offenders, then there \nare certain responsibilities with respect to the restraints to be used, \nthe clothing the prisoners must wear while being transported--bright \norange clothing--and the Justice Department of the United States must \nestablish consistent rules.\n  So what happened with Kyle Bell, the fellow who murdered young Jeanna \nNorth, is not going to happen again. Someone is not going to walk into \na shopping center in street clothes because a private contracting \ncompany was transporting a convicted murderer and one was asleep in the \nvan and the other was buying a cheeseburger and the convicted murderer \nwalks off. That is not going to happen again.\n  Sometimes it is just a matter of common sense. It seems to me with \nrespect to this issue of Dru's Law, dealing with high-risk convicted \nsex offenders, we can do much, much more, and we should do much, much \nmore.\n  I, once again, say to Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, thank you for \nyour cooperation. I know you have been working to see how we might move \nthis legislation. I am looking forward to having it a part of other \nlegislation that moves from the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3704\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, \nalong with a very impressive bipartisan group of cosponsors, introduced \nan amendment of real import 2 days ago. We said we would try very hard \nto work it out. I am quite delighted and grateful that we have worked \nit out in a way that is acceptable to all involved and it accomplishes \na very significant public purpose. I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nall he did to bring us to that point.\n  I happily yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to both the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut and the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Collins. As I said on Monday, the Senate is well \nserved by having this bipartisan duo that has long practiced good \ngovernment steering us on this important piece of legislation.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is absolutely right; the three of us \nhave worked very cooperatively over the last few days. Senator Lott \nalso has made a valuable contribution, as well as Senator Cornyn, \nSenator Dayton, and Senator Snowe. A bipartisan group of Senators has \nbeen concerned about this issue. I believe the legislative counsel's \noffice will have the actual language to bring to the Senate very \nshortly, probably in 10 or 15 minutes.\n  With the agreement of the Senator from Connecticut, I will take a few \nminutes to outline what the distinguished Senator from Maine, the \nSenator from Connecticut, myself, Senator Lott, and our group have \nagreed to.\n  The ability to stamp a Government document secret is one of the most \npowerful tools in our Government. The backdrop for this whole debate \nwas best summed up by Governor Kean, who did such a good job in \nchairing the 9/11 Commission, who said three-quarters of all the \ndocuments he saw associated with his work on the 9/11 Commission that \nwere classified should not have been classified. The power to stamp, in \neffect, Government documents secret is now a power wielded by people in \nthe belly of 18 Federal agencies where they now classify more than 14 \nmillion new documents each year. This is a power that costs taxpayers \nabout $6.5 billion a year, and it is a power that is simply out of \ncontrol.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle recognize that the system used to \nclassify information for national security purposes is broken. It has \nbeen the premise of our bipartisan group that it is possible to fight \nterrorism ferociously, aggressively, and at the same time make sure \nthat the public's right to know information the public is entitled to \nis addressed.\n  When we look, for example, at the Senate Intelligence Committee--\nSenator Lott, Senator Snowe, Senator Bayh and I serve on that \ncommittee--had it not been for the exceptional work of Chairman Roberts \nand Senator Rockefeller, much of what we tried to do with respect to \nour bipartisan report on prewar intelligence would have simply been \ncensored. It would have all been drowned in a sea of black ink. So what \nwe need to do is bring some common sense to this area which is now a \nhodgepodge of laws and regulations and directives. We are now in a \nposition to outline the changes we have agreed to in our legislation.\n  First--most importantly--this legislation establishes an independent \nbody known as the independent national security classification board \nwhich would review existing or proposed classification of any document \nor material. They would, in effect, be part of an effort for the first \ntime to ensure that there would be an independent board to which there \ncan be an appeal of classification decisions. Although right now an \nexecutive agency has had an appeals body, it has been off limits to \ncongressional requests. For the first time, there will be an \nindependent board that will look at these classification issues and \nthere will be a right of the Congress to appeal a decision.\n  The distinguished chair of the committee was not on the floor, but I \nwant to express while she is here my appreciation to her. What this has \nbeen all about from the very beginning is not a Democratic or \nRepublican issue.\n  This has been about righting the imbalance between the executive \nbranch and the legislative branch with respect to classification \ndecisions. That is what we have been able to do. It ensures that any \nPresident's prerogatives as Commander in Chief are maintained. That is \nessential with respect to national security issues.\n  We will also have a chance to bring some real independence to the \nprocess of how Government documents are classified by ensuring that for \nthe first time there is an independent route to have a classification \ndecision reviewed.\n  That process will come after we have had a top-to-bottom review of \nthe standards and processes used to classify information. The chair of \nthe committee and I have talked about this in the past. What has been \nstriking is we have never even done a review of the processes that are \nnow used to classify\n\n[[Page S9912]]\n\ndocuments. People such as those who run the National Archives have said \nthat has been a factor in our having such a chaotic system.\n  So for the first time, again, Congress would have input into the \nscope of the review that would take place with respect to how \nGovernment documents are classified as well as the guidelines or \nstandards that would be issued as a result of the review.\n  The independent national security classification board the amendment \nestablishes would assume the duties of a group now known as the public \ninterest declassification board. The new board would be made up of nine \nindividuals, five of whom are appointed by the President and four of \nwhom are appointed by the Senate and the House leadership. This is an \neffort to try to maintain a new kind of balance between the legislative \nbranch and the executive branch.\n\n  In order to make sure that balance is maintained over time, the new \nboard may recommend changes in the classification of all or portions of \ndocuments, but the President does not have to accept them. However, the \nkey feature here is, if the President chooses not to accept a \nrecommendation of the independent national security classification \nboard, the President would have to submit to Congress in writing the \njustification for a decision not to implement the recommendation.\n  To reiterate, there would be an independent body to which Congress \ncan appeal national security classification decisions, but at the same \ntime, if the President doesn't see it in the same way the independent \nboard does, the President, as Commander in Chief, still has the power \nto exercise the constitutional prerogative as the President determines, \nbut for the first time it would have to be done in writing. I do not \nsubscribe to the view that there is an inherent conflict between the \nexecutive branch's accountability to Congress and the American people \non one hand and the constitutional role of the President as Commander \nin Chief. We have long needed a balance in this area, a balance between \nthe public's need for sound, clear-eyed analysis, and the executive's \ndesire to protect the Nation's legitimate security interests.\n  In my view, there is no room in this equation for the use of \nclassification to insulate officials and agencies from politics. That \nwas essentially the motivation that got Senator Lott and Senator Snowe \nand a bipartisan group of us in the first place. We have seen this \nabused again and again.\n  Senator Moynihan did exceptional work years ago, documenting how so \nmany documents have been classified largely because they were trying to \nprovide political cover rather than protection for this country's \nnational security. Senator Moynihan was a mentor to me because when I \ncame to the Senate, I said I was interested in making changes.\n  Senator Collins has been very helpful. She has also been helpful on \nsome of the other issues we will take up in the course of this \nlegislation, particularly the data mining area, where she and Senator \nLieberman have a great interest as well.\n  But Senator Lott, Senator Bob Graham, Senator Cornyn, Senator Snowe--\nthe group who worked on this issue--are very appreciative of the help \nwe received from the chair and the ranking minority member.\n  This amendment involves millions of Government documents. It involves \nmore than $6 billion that is spent on the classification system each \nyear.\n  I think we are starting now to lift this kind of fog of secrecy--\nchanging a classification system that rewards secrecy and discourages \nopenness. We will have the amendment actually before the Senate \nprobably in a few minutes. In the interest of time--I know the hour is \nlate and Senators have amendments--I wanted to speak about this, and I \nwanted to describe what it was that we have agreed to.\n  Senator Collins's staff and Senator Lieberman's staff have put in a \nlot of hours with us over the last few days. I am very appreciative and \nparticularly pleased that it would be possible to make these kinds of \nchanges. Senator Moynihan was right years ago when he advocated a \nprocess that brought some real independence and a right of appeal to a \nclassification decision. The amendment we will offer tonight does just \nthat.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the committee in the Chamber. I \nyield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator \nWyden. He is always so good to work with on so many issues, and we have \nenjoyed working on this one as well.\n  I want to recognize that Senator Lott was also very involved in the \nnegotiations and working with Senator Lieberman and me to modify this \namendment in a way to preserve the goal of the amendment, and yet to \naddress some concerns we had about creating a new board, unnecessary \nbureaucracy, or some duplication.\n  As I indicated when Senator Wyden first offered his amendment, I \nbelieve he is addressing a very real problem, and that is improving the \nway we classify and declassify documents. I know the members of the \nIntelligence Committee have been very frustrated with the process that \nthey went through in developing a lengthy report, only to have so much \nof it redacted and to have no good way of appealing those redactions, \nno good way of challenging what many members of that committee, on both \nsides of the aisle, viewed as excessive secrecy or excessive \nclassification.\n  I have been concerned that the original amendment intruded \nunnecessarily into the President's constitutional prerogative and \nduplicated some of the provisions in our bill. I believe the changes we \nhave worked out so cooperatively go a very long way toward addressing \nthe concerns we had while advancing the goal.\n  Rather than creating a new board to review the classification policy, \nSenator Wyden's amendment would now ensure that Congress has an \nopportunity to make comments regarding the Presidential review of \nclassification policies already established under the Collins-Lieberman \nbill, and even more importantly to the Senator who has said we need an \nindependent place for Congress to go to bring appeals regarding \nclassification decisions, the revised amendment has agreed to build \nupon a board that already exists, the Public Interest Declassification \nBoard. The amendment would change the name of that board to the \nIndependent National Security Classification Board. This board was \nestablished in 2001, but it is still being put into place.\n\n  Under the Wyden amendment, it will have specific authority to hear \nappeals of classification decisions from specified congressional \ncommittees. The board would then make a recommendation to the \nPresident, which the President could either accept or reject. If the \nPresident rejects the board's decision, then the President, as the \nSenator indicated, would have to send a written justification of that \ndecision to Congress. This framework helped to address some of the \nconcerns we had about the original amendment.\n  I will note that this is not the administration's favorite amendment, \neven in the revised form, but I believe we have struck a fair balance \nand I am prepared to recommend that we accept the amendment once we get \nit. I understand it is going to be here momentarily. There were a few \ntechnical glitches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, again, I thank Senator Wyden. It was a \npleasure for us and our staffs to work with him and his staff. As I \nsaid, this is a substantial accomplishment. I particularly enjoyed the \nSenator's reference to the late, great Senator Pat Moynihan. I have a \nvision of Pat in Heaven smiling right now. I can see that smile. He is \nprobably not wearing that hat that we all loved so much at the time.\n  The important thing here is this is a right of appeal, if you will, \nregarding the President's power to classify documents. That is a right \nthat will exist in a limited number of Members of Congress, \ninterestingly and importantly, of both parties. The ultimate \nbeneficiaries, of course, are the American people.\n  Members of Congress have access to matters that are fully classified. \nSo this is really the public's right to know. If these Members of \nCongress decide that the public has a right to know, ought to have a \nright to know the content of something that has been classified, they \nwill have the right to\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\nappeal to this board for review. It is a very finely balanced \ncompromise that is substantial, real, and preserves the President's \nright as Commander in Chief to have the final word. So this was real \nlegislating in the public interest.\n  I thank the Senator and his cosponsors for the leadership and \npersistence that brought this matter to the floor and results now in \nthis agreement which I think will receive unanimous consent from the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Again, I express my \nappreciation to the chair and ranking minority member. The chair made \nan important point with respect to the executive branch. Clearly, no \nPresident, no executive branch is going to ever hold a rally in favor \nof this kind of idea.\n  I think the Senator mentioned Senator Lott. Senator Lott has been \ninvaluable from the very beginning. He said we just have to build in--\nwhether it is Democrats or Republicans--a new sense of independence. I \nhave tried to say that there is no question in my mind, whether it was \na Democratic administration or a Republican administration, what you \nare talking about are human beings who I think inherently are going to \nbe concerned about something coming out. So out comes the stamp and \nsomething is marked ``classified,'' and by the time the rubberstamp \nprogram is done, you have millions of documents classified in our \ncountry for reasons that have nothing to do with national security.\n  The Senator from Maine has summed it up very well. I am sure we are \ngoing to continue to hear from the administration as this is debated in \nthe Senate and in the House. I do think we have struck a balance that \nensures that by giving the President, in effect, the first word on a \nclassification decision, through their appointees having the ability to \nclassify a Government document and, in effect, the last word on a \nsubject, because the independent board makes the recommendation to the \nPresident, if the President decides he doesn't want to go along with \nthe independent board, they get the last word by stating in writing why \nthey think the independent board is off base. I think that is the kind \nof balance between the executive branch and the legislative branch that \nwe ought to have.\n  What pleases me is tonight this is the end of the line for a \nclassification system that, in effect, encourages secrecy, discourages \nopenness, and I am glad a bipartisan effort could have put all this \ntime into it. I think we will have the amendment over here quickly. \nWith the concurrence of the chair and the ranking minority member, it \nis not my intent to ask for a recorded vote. I think we can do it on a \nvoice vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3727\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cornyn, I send an \namendment to the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Cornyn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3727.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: to amend provisions of law originally enacted in the Clinger-\n  Cohen Act to enhance agency planning for information security needs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. AMENDMENTS TO CLINGER-COHEN PROVISIONS TO ENHANCE \n                   AGENCY PLANNING FOR INFORMATION SECURITY NEEDS.\n\n       Chapter 113 of title 40, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in section 11302(b), by inserting ``security,'' after \n     ``use,'';\n       (2) in section 11302(c), by inserting ``, including \n     information security risks,'' after ``risks'' both places it \n     appears;\n       (3) in section 11312(b)(1), by striking ``information \n     technology investments'' and inserting ``investments in \n     information technology (including information security \n     needs)''; and\n       (4) in section 11315(b)(2), by inserting ``, secure,'' \n     after ``sound''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this proposal amends the Cohen-Clinger \nAct to explicitly require Federal agencies to emphasize information \nsecurity from the earliest possible stages of a new system's IT capital \nplanning and investment decisionmaking process.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has instructed agencies through \nits budget guidance that information security must be a vital part of \nthe capital planning and investment control process. Amending the \nCohen-Clinger Act to codify this guidance will ensure that the law \nreflects a certain threat environment in cyberspace and requires that \ninformation security be an integral part of the Federal acquisition \nprocess for the long term.\n  Security should be reinforced as we migrate toward a more \ninteroperable environment. I believe this amendment is helpful. It is \nmy understanding that it has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is a good amendment. I thank \nSenator Cornyn for offering it. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3727.\n  The amendment (No. 3727) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3763\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Coleman, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Coleman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3763.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: to strike the amendments made by section 202, regarding the \n                  National Homeland Security Council)\n\n       On page 117, strike line 1 and all that follows through \n     page 118, line 7.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senator Coleman has offered an amendment \nthat would strike the language in our bill that merges the Homeland \nSecurity Council into the National Security Council. I note that the \nadministration yesterday in its Statement of Administration Policy, in \nwhich it endorsed passage of our legislation, expressed considerable \nconcern about the provisions that would reorganize the President's \ninternal policy staff by merging the National Security Council and the \nHomeland Security Council. The administration feels strongly that \nCongress should not legislate and make permanent the internal \norganization of the President's own executive offices or otherwise \nlimit the flexibility needed to respond quickly to threats or attacks.\n  In looking further at this issue, I agree with the concerns raised by \nthe administration. Senator Coleman's amendment striking the merger of \nthose two councils within the Executive Office of the President is \nacceptable to me.\n  That is what his amendment would accomplish. I believe the amendment \nhas been cleared on both sides and I urge its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I \nthank\n\n[[Page S9914]]\n\nSenator Coleman for submitting it. The Homeland Security Council was, \nas I recall, created by the President and then made into statute as \npart of the Homeland Security Act that created the Department of \nHomeland Security. It was meant to be an advisory board to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and also a place to which the Secretary \ncould bring representatives of other departments that might not be in \nthe security community normally, such as the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, in terms of bioterrorism, for instance. So I think it \nhas played an important role.\n  The 9/11 Commission report very gently recommended that we consider \nmerging the Homeland Security Council into the National Security \nCouncil. Senator Coleman raises a concern that I think is justified as \nto, one, whether all of these items ought to be on the agenda of the \nNational Security Council, which is already quite busy; two, that this \ncouncil has a constructive role to play uniquely for the Department of \nHomeland Security, and insofar as one of the thoughts behind the \nCommission's suggestion was that merging the Homeland Security Council \ninto the National Security Council would provide a forum where disputes \nbetween departments could be resolved, the President, of course, always \nreserves the right to call the heads of the relevant departments \ntogether to do that.\n  So the long and the short of it is, I think it is too early to--what \nwas the Mark Twain line? The rumors of my death are premature, or \nsomething like that. I think the same could be said of the Homeland \nSecurity Council. There is a reason for it to live on. Senator \nColeman's amendment achieves that, and I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3763.\n  The amendment (No. 3763) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3704, As Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Wyden, I send a \nmodification of the Wyden amendment No. 3704 to the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3704), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 134, line 14, insert ``issue guidelines'' before \n     ``on classification''\n       On page 134, strike lines 16 and 17 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     commonly accepted processing and access controls, in the \n     course of which review, the President may consider any \n     comments submitted by the Select Committee on Intelligence, \n     the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate, and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence, the Committee on Armed Services, and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives regarding--\n       (i) the scope of the review the President should undertake \n     in formulating the guidelines under this subparagraph; and\n       (ii) the substance of what guidelines should be issued.\n       On page 177, after line 17, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 226. CONGRESSIONAL APPEALS OF CLASSIFICATION DECISIONS.\n\n       (a) Redesignation of Public Interest Declassification Board \n     as Independent National Security Classification Board.--(1) \n     Subsection (a) of section 703 of the Public Interest \n     Declassification Act of 2000 (title VII of Public Law 10-567; \n     50 U.S.C. 435 note) is amended by striking `` `Public \n     Interest Declassification Board' '' and inserting `` \n     `Independent National Security Classification Board' ''.\n       (2) The heading of such section is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 703. INDEPENDENT NATIONAL SECURITY CLASSIFICATION \n                   BOARD.''.\n\n       (b) Review of Classification Decisions.--\n       (1) In general.--The Independent National Security \n     Classification Board shall, pursuant to a request under \n     paragraph (3), review any classification decision made by an \n     executive agency with respect to national security \n     information.\n       (2) Access.--The Board shall have access to all documents \n     or other materials that are classified on the basis of \n     containing national security information.\n       (3) Requests for review.--The Board shall review, in a \n     timely manner, the existing or proposed classification of any \n     document or other material the review of which is requested \n     by the chairman or ranking member of--\n       (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, or the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate; or\n       (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     International Relations, or the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n       (4) Recommendations.--\n       (A) In general.--The Board may make recommendations to the \n     President regarding decisions to classify all or portions of \n     documents or other material for national security purposes or \n     to declassify all or portions of documents or other material \n     classified for such purposes.\n       (B) Implementation.--Upon receiving a recommendation from \n     the Board under subparagraph (A), the President shall \n     either--\n       (i) accept and implement such recommendation; or\n       (ii) not later than 60 days after receiving the \n     recommendation if the President does not accept and implement \n     such recommendation, transmit in writing to Congress \n     justification for the President's decision not to implement \n     such recommendation.\n       (5) Regulations.--The Board shall prescribe regulations to \n     carry out this subsection.\n       (6) Executive agency defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``Executive agency'' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 105 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this modification was debated earlier \nthis evening. There is no further debate on the amendment as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3704), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to reconsider the amendment and I move to lay it \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in consultation with the managers of the \nbill, it is the desire of the majority leader and Democratic leader to \nkeep moving tonight. I will send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3781\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the study of the 9/11 report, frequent \nreference is made to the Goldwater-Nichols Act. It is a piece of \nlegislation in which, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I \nhad a great deal of participation, working on this particular statute. \nIt was an attempt, and a successful attempt, to rewrite the defense-\nrelated laws, and describes certain changes which would make the \nDepartment and particularly the Joint Chiefs of Staff a more effective \nbody.\n  I want to refer to one provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that certain portions of the statute be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that provision reads as follows:\n\n       Advice and Opinions of Members Other Than Chairman . . . A \n     member of the Joint Chiefs--\n\n  That could be the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Naval \nOperations, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps.\n  I repeat:\n\n       A member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--other than the \n     Chairman--may submit to the Chairman advice or an opinion in \n     disagreement with, or advice or an opinion in addition to, \n     the advice presented by the Chairman to the President--\n\n  That is the President of the United States--\n\n     --the National Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense. \n     If a member submits such advice or opinion, the Chairman \n     shall present the advice or opinion of such member at the \n     same time he presents his own advice to the President, the \n     National Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense, as \n     the case may be.\n\n  We learned that in the course of the past 18 months or maybe longer--\nI will not try to define the exact period of time--when our President \nwas making\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\ndecisions in connection with certain advice he was receiving from the \nintelligence community--I will just touch on this lightly, and perhaps \nothers will want to address this with more specificity--certain \ncaveats, being other opinions--the opinions, say, of the Director of \nCentral Intelligence--were not brought with sufficient force and effect \nto the attention of the policymakers.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to enable a framework by which, \nfollowing the precedents of the Goldwater-Nichols Act, certain \nindividuals in the contemplated new legislative framework as described \nby the distinguished chairman and members of the Governmental \nOperations Committee, other opinions will be brought to the attention \nof the President at such time as the NID is briefing the President.\n  I will refer with specificity to the amendment I have sent to the \ndesk at this time. The first paragraph is technical, so I will omit \nthat. I will go right to the operative paragraph:\n  Advice and opinions of Members other than Chairman. ``Members'' \nrefers to the Joint Intelligence Community Council which is \nestablished, it is my understanding, by the chairman's statute.\n\n       A member of the Joint Intelligence Community Council (other \n     than the Chairman) may submit to the chairman advice or an \n     opinion in disagreement with, or advice or an opinion in \n     addition to, the advice presented by the National \n     Intelligence Director to the President or the National \n     Security Council, in the role of the Chairman as Chairman of \n     the Joint Intelligence Community Council. If a member submits \n     such advice or opinion, the Chairman shall present the advice \n     or opinion of such member at the same time the Chairman \n     presents the advice of the Chairman to the President or the \n     National Security Council, as the case may be.\n       The Chairman shall establish procedures to ensure that the \n     presentation of the advice of the Chairman to the President \n     or the National Security Council [or the Secretary of \n     Defense] is not unduly delayed by reason of the submission of \n     the individual advice or opinion of another member of the \n     council.\n\n  Lastly, ``Recommendations to Congress:\n\n       Any member of the Joint Intelligence Community Council may \n     make such recommendations to Congress.\n\n  I presume that would be interpreted as the leadership of both Houses \nand the chairmen and ranking members of the relevant committees.\n  The reason I have not been more specific here is that we are awaiting \nthe decisions of the group on which I am privileged to serve headed by \nthe distinguished whip, Mr. McConnell, and on other side the \ndistinguished whip, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  In other words, as we look at the revisions that will be proposed in \nconnection with the oversight responsibilities of the Congress, that \nmay require some refinement.\n  I will reread it:\n\n       Any member of the Joint Intelligence Community Council may \n     make such recommendations to Congress relating to the \n     intelligence committee as such member considers appropriate.\n\n  I think that is the insurance that is quite visible to put in place \nsuch that other opinions can be considered by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Throughout, the 9/11 report referred to: We have to have imagination. \nWe often use the phrase ``be competitive'' with opinions within the \nstructure of the intelligence committee. I believe that is all good. I \nreally do. And the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that there is \nin law a procedure that these important members of this council will \nhave the opportunity to see that their views are presented \ncontemporaneous--at the same time the President receives the views of \nthe NID. That is the purpose of the amendment.\n  I understand tonight it will be pending, and at such time as the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee wishes to come over and review \nthe subject with others, I would be happy to do so.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n       (d) Advice and Opinions of Members Other Than Chairman.--\n     (1) A member of the Joint Chief of Staff (other than the \n     Chairman) may submit to the Chairman advice or an opinion in \n     disagreement with, or advice or an opinion in addition to, \n     the advice presented by the Chairman to the President, the \n     National Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense. If a \n     member submits such advice or opinion, the Chairman shall \n     present the advice or opinion of such member at the same time \n     he presents his own advice to the President, the National \n     Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense, as the case \n     may be.\n       (2) The Chairman shall establish procedures to ensure that \n     the presentation of his own advice to the President, the \n     National Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense is not \n     unduly delayed by reason of the submission of the individual \n     advice or opinion of another member of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff.\n       (e) Advice on Request.--The members of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, individually or collectively, in their capacity as \n     military advisers, shall provide advice to the President, the \n     National Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense on a \n     particular matter when the President, the National Security \n     Council, or the Secretary requests such advice.\n       (f) Recommendations to Congress.--After first informing the \n     Secretary of Defense, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     may make such recommendations to Congress relating to the \n     Department of Defense as he considers appropriate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee for coming forward this evening and \nlaying down this amendment. He has explained very clearly the purpose. \nI very much appreciate that explanation.\n  As the Senator is aware, the ranking member of the committee had a \ncommitment for this evening. I would like to hold the amendment over \nuntil tomorrow morning. But I am very grateful to the Senator for \nlaying down the amendment this evening so that we can continue to make \nprogress on this bill. As always, he has given his proposal a great \ndeal of thought. I appreciate the parallels that he is drawing to the \nprovisions of the Goldwater-Nickles Act and the fact that the members \nof Joint Chiefs are allowed to present their views independently to \nCongress and to the President. I very much appreciate his laying down \nthe amendment tonight. I look forward to having further consideration \nin the morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for her \nviews.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stevens be listed as a cosponsor \nof the amendment. There may be others in due course that would like to \ndo so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am privileged to offer one of the first \namendments. I have other amendments of which I think the chairman is \naware. We are going to comply with her request and the leadership to \nhave the text before them within the amendments that are established. I \nwant to be very constructive as a working partner as we move forward \nwith this important piece of legislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee is always constructive in every way. I very \nmuch appreciate the thought and the knowledge he has and the depth with \nwhich he explores important issues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that note, I best yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3781\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Mr. \n     Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 3781.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HARRIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last Saturday, on September 25, the city \nof Chicago, the State of Illinois, and our Nation, lost a great man. \nIrving Harris died at the age of 94 in the city of Chicago. He was my \nfriend and my inspiration.\n  I have been called on many times to give commencement speeches at \ncolleges and universities, medical schools and law schools. When I \nspeak to the young students about what they can make of their lives, I \nnever fail to tell them the story of Irving Harris and his life. It is \na great story, and one that I would like to share with my colleagues in \nthe Senate.\n  Irving Harris was born and raised in Saint Paul, MN. He and his two \nbrothers were raised by a father, who was a merchant, and a mother who \ninspired him and his two brothers, in their words, ``to always be No. 1 \nin your class.'' They listened carefully to their parents and they \nsucceeded in almost unimaginable ways.\n  The two Harris brothers, Neison and Irving, joined a friend and \nstarted a company in 1946, the Toni Home Permanent Company. Within 2 \nyears, Tony home permanents had become so popular across the United \nStates that they sold this company to Gillette for $20 million. The \nyear was 1948; $20 million was a huge sum of money.\n  If you followed his business career, Irving Harris went on to do many \nthings--to be the director of a mutual fund, to start another company \nin North Brook, IL, the Pittway Corporation, which he ultimately sold \nfor some $2 billion. Just those facts and those stories alone tell you \nof the business success of Irving Harris. But if you were to stop with \nthose stories, you would not understand his greatness, nor would you \nunderstand the real measure of this man.\n  Unlike some people who were given great gifts of wealth and skill and \nthen used them to make their own lives more comfortable, Irving Harris \nsaw life much differently. He was a man who was constantly looking for \nways to help others, particularly ways to help children. And for over \n60 years, he took his wealth and his business success and devoted it to \nhelping other people in so many different ways.\n  He helped create the Yale Child Study Center at Yale University to \nhonor his alma mater but also to try to find ways to help children born \nin poverty have a full and successful life.\n  He provided the funds that launched the center for the University of \nChicago's Graduate School of Public Policy Studies, which bears his \nname, and the Erikson Institute for Advanced Studies in Child \nDevelopment.\n  Irving Harris believed that children, if given the right nurturing \nexperience and the right chance, could succeed. A lot of people believe \nthat. But he invested his money in that belief.\n  He started the Ounce of Prevention Fund in the city of Chicago in the \nState of Illinois to prove that point again. He was one of the early \npeople pushing for Head Start.\n  Let me read to you what Irving Harris said in one of his books. The \nbook is entitled, ``Children in Jeopardy: Can We Break the Cycle of \nPoverty?'' Irving Harris wrote in 1996, ``I believe that God's gift of \nbrain potential is not discriminatory.\n  ``Kindergarten is much too late to worry if a child is ready to \nlearn. We must begin in the first days and weeks and months of life to \nget children ready to learn.''\n  That was his passion and that was his belief. That fueled his life \nand his interest.\n  The many times that we would sit down and talk about policies, he \nwould come back to these points about how many wasted lives of children \nthere are in America because we didn't start soon enough and we didn't \ndo well enough and we didn't understand the complexity of the \nchallenges facing these children.\n  So this man so successful in business focused so much of his life and \ntime on children and helping them in so many different ways.\n  He was certainly good at business--one of the best. But he took that \nsuccess and he took that money and tried to improve the lives of \nothers.\n  His philanthropy didn't end there. There is hardly a place you can \nturn in Chicago without seeing Irving Harris's name or the name of his \nwife Joan. They left their mark in our city as they left it in our \nNation.\n  Joan, Irving Harris's wife of 30 years, whom I met just the other \nday, recounted her frustration when she was trying to build a new \ntheater in downtown Chicago for music and dance to make it part of \nMayor Daley's hugely successful Millennium Park. She turned to Irving \none day and said: I just think we are going to have to give up. I don't \nthink I can come up with money to build the theater.\n\n  I will not quote him exactly, but Irving basically said: I feel like \nthat myself, and I don't think I am ever going to get the promised \nland. We are going to do it.\n  He told Joan they were going to do it, and they did. They made a \nmassive investment in that theater--some $39 million of the $52 million \nprice tag to build that theater. That theater is going to endure in his \nname and in the name of Joan Harris. It is going to entertain, and it \nis going to remind a lot of people of the good in culture, in music, in \nart that really lifts us all.\n  They did the same thing, incidentally, in Aspen, CO. If you go to \nAspen, CO, where they used to spend some time, they decided they needed \na special place--an outdoor gathering place for music festivals--you \nwill find that Harris music gathering place, the Harris Music Center, \njust another part of his legacy.\n  The University of Chicago President, Don Michael Randel, called Mr. \nHarris ``one of those extraordinary and too-rare individuals whose \npassion and humanity made a real difference in the lives of others.''\n  Mr. Randel said:\n\n       Because of his foresight and his generosity, countless \n     disadvantaged children have been able to fulfill their \n     potential and to become productive citizens. And many of the \n     most fundamental social problems suffered by children and \n     families now have some hope of resolution thanks to the \n     research he has so generously supported.\n\n  In addition to his wife Joan, Irving Harris is survived by his \ndaughters, Virginia Polsky and Roxanne Frank; a son Bill, who is a \nclose friend as well, a person who has devoted his life to many \nimportant causes such as the global AIDS epidemic and children's \ncauses; a stepdaughter, Louise Frank; stepsons, Daniel and Jonathan \nFrank; a sister, June Barrows; 10 grandchildren and 26 great-\ngrandchildren.\n  His legacy goes beyond his family. His legacy will be realized by \nothers for generations to come. Irving Harris's life will not be \nmeasured in the number of dollars he earned but the number of lives \nthat he touched, not in the assets he accumulated but in the fact that \nhe was such an asset to Chicago and to America. The pillars of American \nbusiness know of his success, but Irving Harris was a pillar of \nstrength and hope for the poor, and in that effort he made his life a \nmodel for us all.\n  It is my good fortune in this business to meet many people and to \nmeet many wonderful people. I count on one hand the most amazing people \nI have ever met, and Irving Harris will be in that number.\n  I will miss Irving Harris, but I am grateful to have known him and to \nbe\n\n[[Page S9917]]\n\ninspired by his lifetime of caring and hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9917-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9917-S9927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE NOTICE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nstatement from the Office of Compliance be printed in the Record today \npursuant to section 304(b)(1) of the Congressional Accountability Act \nof 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1)).\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n        FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n       Implementing Certain Substantive Rights and Protections of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as Required by Section \n     203 of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), 2 \n     U.S.C. 1313.\n\n\n                     notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       Background: The purpose of this Notice is to initiate the \n     process for replacing existing overtime pay eligibility \n     regulations with new regulations which will substantially \n     mirror the new overtime exemption regulations recently \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor.\n       Do FLSA overtime pay requirements apply via the CAA to \n     Legislative Branch employing offices? Yes. One of the \n     regulatory statutes incorporated in part through the \n     Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), 2 U.S.C. 1301 \n     et seq., is the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 \n     U.S.C. 201 et seq. Section 203(a)(1) of the CAA states: \n     ``[t]he rights and protections established by subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the [FLSA] . . . (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1), 207, 212(c)) shall \n     apply to covered employees.'' Section 7 of the FLSA, 29 \n     U.S.C. 207, includes the requirements regarding the payment \n     of time and one half overtime pay to employees.\n       Are there existing overtime exemption regulations already \n     in force under the CAA? Yes. In 1996, the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance promulgated the existing CAA \n     overtime exemption regulations based on the ``old'' 29 CFR \n     Part 541 regulations which were in force until August 23, \n     2004. These regulations were adopted pursuant to the CAA \n     section 304 procedure outlined herein below. Those \n     regulations are found at Parts H541 (applicable to the House \n     of Representatives), S541 (applicable to the Senate), and \n     C541 (applicable to the other employing offices covered by \n     section 203 of the CAA) of the FLSA Regulations of the Office \n     of Compliance. These regulations remain in force until \n     replaced by new regulations. Office of Compliance regulations \n     can be accessed via our web site: www.compliance. gov.\n       Why is this Notice being issued? This Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking is occasioned by the recent promulgation of new \n     overtime exemption regulations by the Secretary of Labor at \n     Vol. 69 of the Federal Register, No. 79, at pp. 22122 et \n     seq., on August 23, 2004. The new regulations of the \n     Secretary of Labor are set out at 29 U.S.C. Part 541, and \n     replace the regulations which had been in effect prior to \n     August 23, 2004. The Secretary of Labor's regulations do not \n     apply to employing offices and employees covered by the CAA.\n       Why are there separate sets of existing FLSA regulations \n     for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the other \n     employing offices covered by the CAA? Section 304(a)(2)(B) of \n     the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(a)(2)(B), requires that the \n     substantive rules of the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance ``shall consist of 3 separate bodies of \n     regulations, which shall apply, respectively, to--(i) the \n     Senate and employees of the Senate; (ii) the House of \n     Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives; and (iii) the other covered employees and \n     employing offices.'' In 1996, the House of Representatives \n     (H. Res. 400) and the Senate (S. Res. 242) each adopted by \n     resolution the FLSA regulations applicable to each body. The \n     Senate and House of Representatives adopted by concurrent \n     resolution (S. Con. Res. 51) the regulations applicable to \n     other employing offices and employees.\n       Are there substantive differences in the proposed \n     regulations for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and \n     the other employing offices? No. While there are some \n     differences in other parts of the existing FLSA regulations \n     applicable to the Senate, the House of Representatives, and \n     the other employing offices (chiefly related to the mandate \n     at section 203(c)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1313(c)(3), \n     regarding ``covered employees whose work schedules directly \n     depend on the schedule of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate . . .''), the Board of Directors has identified no \n     ``good cause'' for varying the text of these regulations. \n     Therefore, if the proposed part 541 regulations are adopted, \n     the prefixes ``H'', ``S'', and ``C'' will be affixed to each \n     of the sets of regulations for the House, for the Senate, and \n     for the other employing offices, but the text of the part 541 \n     regulations will be identical.\n       How are substantive regulations proposed and approved under \n     the CAA? Section 203(c)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1313(c)(2), \n     requires that the Board of Directors propose substantive \n     regulations implementing the FLSA overtime requirements which \n     are ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions . . \n     . except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulation would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' Pursuant to section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384, \n     the procedure for promulgating such substantive regulations \n     requires that: (1) the Board of Directors adopt proposed \n     substantive regulations and publish a general notice of \n     proposed rulemaking in the Congressional Record; (2) there be \n     a comment period of at least 30 days after the date of \n     publication of the general notice of proposed rulemaking; (3) \n     after consideration of comments by the Board of Directors, \n     that the Board adopt regulations and transmit notice of such \n     action together with the regulations and a recommendation \n     regarding the method for Congressional approval of the \n     regulations to the Speaker of the House and President pro \n     tempore of the Senate for publication in the Congressional \n     Record; (4) committee referral and action on the proposed \n     regulations by resolution in each House, concurrent \n     resolution, or by joint resolution; and (5) final publication \n     of the approved regulations in the Congressional Record, with \n     an effective date prescribed in the final publication. For \n     more detail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C. 1384. This \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is step (1) of the outline set \n     forth above.\n       How does the Board of Directors recommend that Congress \n     approve these proposed regulations? Pursuant to section \n     304(b)(4) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(4), the Board of \n     Directors is required to ``include a recommendation in the \n     general notice of proposed rulemaking and in the regulations \n     as to whether the regulations should be approved by \n     resolution of the Senate, by resolution of the House of \n     Representatives, by concurrent resolution, or by joint \n     resolution.'' The Board of Directors recommends that the \n     procedure used in 1996 be used to adopt these proposed \n     overtime exemption regulations: the House of Representatives \n     adopted the ``H'' version of the regulations by resolution; \n     the Senate adopted the ``S'' version of the regulations by \n     resolution; and the House and Senate adopted the ``C'' \n     version of the regulations applied to the other employing \n     offices by a concurrent resolution.\n       Are these proposed regulations also recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance's Executive Director, the Deputy \n     Executive Director for the House of Representatives, and the \n     Deputy Executive Director for the Senate? Yes, as required by \n     section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(1), the \n     substance of these regulations is also recommended by the \n     Executive Director and Deputy Executive Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance.\n       How are the Secretary of Labor's new overtime exemption \n     regulations different than the old Secretary of Labor \n     regulations at 29 CFR Part 541? The Secretary of Labor has \n     substantially rewritten Part 541. Much of the regulatory \n     framework for determining whether a particular employee \n     should or should not receive overtime pay at time and one-\n     half of that employees's regular rate of pay has been \n     restructured under the new Part 541. For the Secretary of \n     Labor's explanation of the substance of the changes, see the \n     Department of Labor's discussion of the new regulations found \n     at: www.dol.gov/fairpay/.\n       How similar are the proposed CAA regulations with the new \n     Secretary of Labor regulations? Except for certain required \n     changes, which are shown in the accompanying proposed \n     regulations, the Board of Directors has repeated the text of \n     the regulations at 29 CFR Part 541. ``Good cause'' for \n     modification of the existing regulations of the Secretary of \n     Labor, as required by section 203(c)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     1313(c)(2), consists of those changes needed to reflect the \n     authority of the CAA as the enabling statute for these \n     regulations, the requirement at section 225(d)(3) of the CAA, \n     2 U.S.C. 1361(d)(3), that the CAA ``shall not be construed to \n     authorize enforcement by the executive branch of this Act. . \n     . .''. If there is any additional good cause for a particular \n     proposed variation from the Secretary of Labor's regulations, \n     it is set out adjacent to that provision of the proposed \n     regulation.\n       Are these proposed CAA regulations available to persons \n     with disabilities in an alternate format? This Notice of \n     Adoption of Amendments to the Procedural Rules is available \n     on the Office of Compliance web site, www.compliance.gov \n     which is compliant with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act \n     of 1973 as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794d. This Notice can also be \n     made available in large print or Braille. Requests for this \n     Notice in an alternative format should be made to: Alma \n     Candelaria, Deputy Executive Director, Office of Compliance, \n     110 2nd Street, S.E., Room LA-200, Washington, D.C. 20540; \n     202-724-9225; TDD: 202-426-1912; FAX: 202-426-1913.\n\n\n        30-Day Comment Period Regarding the Proposed Regulations\n\n       How can I submit comments regarding the proposed \n     regulations? Comments regarding the proposed new overtime \n     exemption regulations of the Office of Compliance set forth \n     in this NOTICE are invited for a period of thirty (30) days \n     following the date of the appearance of this NOTICE in the \n     Congressional Record. In addition to being posted on the \n     Office of Compliance's section 508 compliant web site \n     (www.compliance.go) this\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\n     NOTICE is also available in the following alternative \n     formats: Large Print, Braille.

It is \n     requested, but not required, that an electronic version of \n     any comments be provided on an accompanying computer disk. \n     Comments may also be submitted by facsimile to the Executive \n     Director at 202-426-1913 (a non-toll-free number.) Those \n     wishing to receive confirmation of the receipt of their \n     comments must provide a self-addressed, stamped post card \n     with their submission.\n       Copies of submitted comments will be available for review \n     on the Office's web site at www.compliance.gov, and at the \n     Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, \n     D.C. 20540-1999, on Monday through Friday (non-Federal \n     holidays) between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.\n       Supplementary Information: The Congressional Accountability \n     Act of 1995 (CAA), PL 104-1, was enacted into law on January \n     23, 1995. The CAA applies the rights and protections of 12 \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the Legislative Branch of \n     Government. Section 301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381) \n     establishes the Office of Compliance as an independent office \n     within the Legislative Branch.\n\n\n                  How To Read The Proposed Amendments\n\n       The text of the proposed amendments reproduces the text of \n     the regulations promulgated on August 23, 2004 by the \n     Secretary of Labor at 29 CFR Part 541, and shows changes \n     proposed for the CAA version of these same regulations. \n     Changes proposed by the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance are shown as follows: [[deletions within \n     italicized brackets]], and added text in italicized bold. \n     Therefore, if these regulations are approved as proposed, \n     [[bracketed text will disappear from the regulations]], and \n     added text will remain. If these regulations are approved for \n     the House of Representatives by resolution of the House, they \n     will be promulgated with the prefix ``H'' appearing before \n     each regulations section number. If these regulations are \n     approved for the Senate by resolution of the Senate, they \n     will be promulgated with the prefix ``S'' appearing before \n     each regulations section number. If these regulations are \n     approved for the other employing offices by joint or \n     concurrent resolution of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate, they will be promulgated with the prefix ``C'' \n     appearing before each regulations section number.\n\n                Proposed Overtime Exemption Regulations\n\n    PART 541--DEFINING AND DELIMITING THE EXEMPTIONS FOR EXECUTIVE, \n   ADMINISTRATIVE, PROFESSIONAL, COMPUTER AND OUTSIDE SALES EMPLOYEES\n\nSubpart A--General Regulations\nSec.\n541.0  Introductory statement.\n541.1  Terms used in regulations.\n541.2  Job titles insufficient.\n541.3  Scope of the section 13(a)(1) exemptions.\n541.4  Other laws and collective bargaining agreements.\n\n                     Subpart B--Executive Employees\n\n541.100  General rule for executive employees.\n541.101  Business owner.\n541.102  Management.\n541.103  Department or subdivision.\n541.104  Two or more other employees.\n541.105  Particular weight.\n541.106  Concurrent duties.\n\n                  Subpart C--Administrative Employees\n\n541.200  General rule for administrative employees.\n541.201  Directly related to management or general business operations.\n541.202  Discretion and independent judgment.\n541.203  Administrative exemption examples.\n541.204  Educational establishments.\n\n                   Subpart D--Professional Employees\n\n541.300  General rule for professional employees.\n541.301  Learned professionals.\n541.302  Creative professionals.\n541.303  Teachers.\n541.304  Practice of law or medicine.\n\n                     Subpart E--Computer Employees\n\n541.400  General rule for computer employees.\n541.401  Computer manufacture and repair.\n541.402  Executive and administrative computer employees.\n\n                   Subpart F--Outside Sales Employees\n\n541.500  General rule for outside sales employees.\n541.501  Making sales or obtaining orders.\n541.502  Away from employer's place of business.\n541.503  Promotion work.\n541.504  Drivers who sell.\n\n                     Subpart G--Salary Requirements\n\n541.600  Amount of salary required.\n541.601  Highly compensated employees.\n541.602  Salary basis.\n541.603  Effect of improper deductions from salary.\n541.604  Minimum guarantee plus extras.\n541.605  Fee basis.\n541.606  Board, lodging or other facilities.\n\n          Subpart H--Definitions And Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n541.700  Primary duty.\n541.701  Customarily and regularly.\n541.702  Exempt and nonexempt work.\n541.703  Directly and closely related.\n541.704  Use of manuals.\n541.705  Trainees.\n541.706  Emergencies.\n541.707  Occasional tasks.\n541.708  Combination exemptions.\n541.709  Motion picture producing industry.\n541.710  Employees of public agencies.\n       Authority: 29 U.S.C. 213; [[Public Law 101-583, 104 Stat. \n     2871]]; 2 U.S.C. 203; 2 U.S.C. 304.

(b) The requirements for these \n     exemptions are contained in this part as follows: executive \n     employees, subpart B; administrative employees, subpart C; \n     professional employees, subpart D; computer employees, \n     subpart E; outside sales employees, subpart F. Subpart G \n     contains regulations regarding salary requirements applicable \n     to most of the exemptions, including salary levels and the \n     salary basis test. Subpart G also contains a provision for \n     exempting certain highly compensated employees. Subpart H \n     contains definitions and other miscellaneous provisions \n     applicable to all or several of the exemptions. (c) Effective \n     July 1, 1972, the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended to \n     include within the protection of the equal pay provisions \n     those employees exempt from the minimum wage and overtime pay \n     provisions as bona fide executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees (including any employee employed in \n     the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher \n     in elementary or secondary schools), or in the capacity of an \n     outside sales employee under section 13(a)(1) of the Act.

A job title alone is \n     insufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee. \n     The exempt or nonexempt status of any particular employee \n     must be determined on the basis of whether the employee's \n     salary and duties meet the requirements of the regulations in \n     this part.\n       Sec. 541.3  Scope of the section 13(a)(1) exemptions.\n       (a) The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and the regulations in \n     this part do not apply to manual laborers or other ``blue \n     collar'' workers who perform work involving repetitive \n     operations with their hands, physical skill and energy. Such \n     nonexempt ``blue collar'' employees gain the skills and \n     knowledge required for performance of their routine manual \n     and physical work through apprenticeships and on-the-job \n     training, not through the prolonged course of specialized \n     intellectual instruction required for exempt learned \n     professional employees such as medical doctors, architects \n     and archeologists. Thus, for example, non-management \n     production-line employees and non-management employees in \n     maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as \n     carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, \n     craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction \n     workers and laborers are entitled to minimum wage and \n     overtime premium pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and \n     are not exempt under the regulations in this part no matter \n     how highly paid they might be.\n       (b)(1) The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and the regulations \n     in this part also do not apply\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\n     to police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, state \n     troopers, highway patrol officers, investigators, inspectors, \n     correctional officers, parole or probation officers, park \n     rangers, fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical \n     technicians, ambulance personnel, rescue workers, hazardous \n     materials workers and similar employees, regardless of rank \n     or pay level, who perform work such as preventing, \n     controlling or extinguishing fires of any type; rescuing \n     fire, crime or accident victims; preventing or detecting \n     crimes; conducting investigations or inspections for \n     violations of law; performing surveillance; pursuing, \n     restraining and apprehending suspects; detaining or \n     supervising suspected and convicted criminals, including \n     those on probation or parole; interviewing witnesses; \n     interrogating and fingerprinting suspects; preparing \n     investigative reports; or other similar work.\n       (2) Such employees do not qualify as exempt executive \n     employees because their primary duty is not management of the \n     enterprise in which the employee is employed or a customarily \n     recognized department or subdivision thereof as required \n     under Sec. 541.100. Thus, for example, a police officer or \n     fire fighter whose primary duty is to investigate crimes or \n     fight fires is not exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the Act \n     merely because the police officer or fire fighter also \n     directs the work of other employees in the conduct of an \n     investigation or fighting a fire.\n       (3) Such employees do not qualify as exempt administrative \n     employees because their primary duty is not the performance \n     of work directly related to the management or general \n     business operations of the employer or the employer's \n     customers as required under Sec. 541.200.\n       (4) Such employees do not qualify as exempt professionals \n     because their primary duty is not the performance of work \n     requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science \n     or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of \n     specialized intellectual instruction or the performance of \n     work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent \n     in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor as \n     required under Sec. 541.300. Although some police officers, \n     fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and \n     similar employees have college degrees, a specialized \n     academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for employment \n     in such occupations.\n       Sec. 541.4  Other laws and collective bargaining \n     agreements. The Fair Labor Standards Act provides minimum \n     standards that may be exceeded, but cannot be waived or \n     reduced. Employers must comply, for example, with any \n     Federal, State or municipal laws, regulations or ordinances \n     establishing a higher minimum wage or lower maximum workweek \n     than those established under the Act. Similarly, employers, \n     on their own initiative or under a collective bargaining \n     agreement with a labor union, are not precluded by the Act \n     from providing a wage higher than the statutory minimum, a \n     shorter workweek than the statutory maximum, or a higher \n     overtime premium (double time, for example) than provided by \n     the Act. While collective bargaining agreements cannot waive \n     or reduce the Act's protections, nothing in the Act or the \n     regulations in this part relieves employers from their \n     contractual obligations under collective bargaining \n     agreements.\n\n                     Subpart B--Executive Employees\n\n       Sec. 541.100  General rule for executive employees.\n       (a) The term ``employee employed in a bona fide executive \n     capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any \n     employee: (1) Compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not \n     less than $455 per week (or $380 per week, if employed in \n     American Samoa by employers other than the Federal \n     Government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities; \n     (2) Whose primary duty is management of the enterprise in \n     which the employee is employed or of a customarily recognized \n     department or subdivision thereof; (3) Who customarily and \n     regularly directs the work of two or more other employees; \n     and (4) Who has the authority to hire or fire other employees \n     or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, \n     firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status \n     of other employees are given particular weight.\n       (b) The phrase ``salary basis'' is defined at Sec. 541.602; \n     ``board, lodging or other facilities'' is defined at Sec. \n     541.606; ``primary duty'' is defined at Sec. 541.700; and \n     ``customarily and regularly'' is defined at Sec. 541.701.\n       Sec. 541.101  Business owner. The term ``employee employed \n     in a bona fide executive capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of \n     the Act also includes any employee who owns at least a bona \n     fide 20-percent percent equity interest in the enterprise in \n     which the employee is employed, regardless of whether the \n     business is a corporate or other type of organization, and \n     who is actively engaged in its management. The term \n     ``management'' is defined in Sec. 541.102. The requirements \n     of Subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply \n     to the business owners described in this section.\n       Sec. 541.102  Management. Generally, ``management'' \n     includes, but is not limited to, activities such as \n     interviewing, selecting, and training of employees; setting \n     and adjusting their rates of pay and hours of work; directing \n     the work of employees; maintaining production or sales \n     records for use in supervision or control; appraising \n     employees' productivity and efficiency for the purpose of \n     recommending promotions or other changes in status; handling \n     employee complaints and grievances; disciplining employees; \n     planning the work; determining the techniques to be used; \n     apportioning the work among the employees; determining the \n     type of materials, supplies, machinery, equipment or tools to \n     be used or merchandise to be bought, stocked and sold; \n     controlling the flow and distribution of materials or \n     merchandise and supplies; providing for the safety and \n     security of the employees or the property; planning and \n     controlling the budget; and monitoring or implementing legal \n     compliance measures.\n       Sec. 541.103  Department or subdivision. (a) The phrase ``a \n     customarily recognized department or subdivision'' is \n     intended to distinguish between a mere collection of \n     employees assigned from time to time to a specific job or \n     series of jobs and a unit with permanent status and function. \n     A customarily recognized department or subdivision must have \n     a permanent status and a continuing function. For example, a \n     large employer's human resources department might have \n     subdivisions for labor relations, pensions and other \n     benefits, equal employment opportunity, and personnel \n     management, each of which has a permanent status and \n     function. (b) When an enterprise has more than one \n     establishment, the employee in charge of each establishment \n     may be considered in charge of a recognized subdivision of \n     the enterprise. (c) A recognized department or subdivision \n     need not be physically within the employer's establishment \n     and may move from place to place. The mere fact that the \n     employee works in more than one location does not invalidate \n     the exemption if other factors show that the employee is \n     actually in charge of a recognized unit with a continuing \n     function in the organization. (d) Continuity of the same \n     subordinate personnel is not essential to the existence of a \n     recognized unit with a continuing function. An otherwise \n     exempt employee will not lose the exemption merely because \n     the employee draws and supervises workers from a pool or \n     supervises a team of workers drawn from other recognized \n     units, if other factors are present that indicate that the \n     employee is in charge of a recognized unit with a continuing \n     function.\n       Sec. 541.104  Two or more other employees. (a) To qualify \n     as an exempt executive under Sec. 541.100, the employee must \n     customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more \n     other employees. The phrase ``two or more other employees'' \n     means two full-time employees or their equivalent. One full-\n     time and two half-time employees, for example, are equivalent \n     to two full-time employees. Four half-time employees are also \n     equivalent. (b) The supervision can be distributed among two, \n     three or more employees, but each such employee must \n     customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more \n     other full-time employees or the equivalent. Thus, for \n     example, a department with five full-time nonexempt workers \n     may have up to two exempt supervisors if each such supervisor \n     customarily and regularly directs the work of two of those \n     workers. (c) An employee who merely assists the manager of a \n     particular department and supervises two or more employees \n     only in the actual manager's absence does not meet this \n     requirement. (d) Hours worked by an employee cannot be \n     credited more than once for different executives. Thus, a \n     shared responsibility for the supervision of the same two \n     employees in the same department does not satisfy this \n     requirement. However, a full-time employee who works four \n     hours for one supervisor and four hours for a different \n     supervisor, for example, can be credited as a half-time \n     employee for both supervisors.\n       Sec. 541.105  Particular weight. To determine whether an \n     employee's suggestions and recommendations are given \n     ``particular weight,'' factors to be considered include, but \n     are not limited to, whether it is part of the employee's job \n     duties to make such suggestions and recommendations; the \n     frequency with which such suggestions and recommendations are \n     made or requested; and the frequency with which the \n     employee's suggestions and recommendations are relied upon. \n     Generally, an executive's suggestions and recommendations \n     must pertain to employees whom the executive customarily and \n     regularly directs. It does not include an occasional \n     suggestion with regard to the change in status of a co-\n     worker. An employee's suggestions and recommendations may \n     still be deemed to have ``particular weight'' even if a \n     higher level manager's recommendation has more importance and \n     even if the employee does not have authority to make the \n     ultimate decision as to the employee's change in status.\n       Sec. 541.106  Concurrent duties.\n       (a) Concurrent performance of exempt and nonexempt work \n     does not disqualify an employee from the executive exemption \n     if the requirements of Sec. 541.100 are otherwise met. \n     Whether an employee meets the requirements of Sec. 541.100 \n     when the employee performs concurrent duties is determined on \n     a case-by-case basis and based on the factors set forth in \n     Sec. 541.700. Generally, exempt executives make the decision \n     regarding when to perform nonexempt duties and remain \n     responsible for the success or failure of business operations \n     under their management while performing the nonexempt work. \n     In contrast, the nonexempt employee generally is directed by \n     a supervisor to perform the exempt work or performs the \n     exempt work for defined time periods. An employee whose \n     primary duty is ordinary production work or routine, \n     recurrent or repetitive tasks cannot qualify for exemption as \n     an executive.\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\n       (b) For example, an assistant manager in a retail \n     establishment may perform work such as serving customers, \n     cooking food, stocking shelves and cleaning the \n     establishment, but performance of such nonexempt work does \n     not preclude the exemption if the assistant manager's primary \n     duty is management. An assistant manager can supervise \n     employees and serve customers at the same time without losing \n     the exemption. An exempt employee can also simultaneously \n     direct the work of other employees and stock shelves.\n       (c) In contrast, a relief supervisor or working supervisor \n     whose primary duty is performing nonexempt work on the \n     production line in a manufacturing plant does not become \n     exempt merely because the nonexempt production line employee \n     occasionally has some responsibility for directing the work \n     of other nonexempt production line employees when, for \n     example, the exempt supervisor is unavailable. Similarly, an \n     employee whose primary duty is to work as an electrician is \n     not an exempt executive even if the employee also directs the \n     work of other employees on the job site, orders parts and \n     materials for the job, and handles requests from the prime \n     contractor.\n\n                  Subpart C--Administrative Employees\n\n       Sec. 541.200  General rule for administrative employees.\n       (a) The term ``employee employed in a bona fide \n     administrative capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of the Act \n     shall mean any employee: (1) Compensated on a salary or fee \n     basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week (or $380 per \n     week, if employed in American Samoa by employers other than \n     the Federal Government), exclusive of board, lodging or other \n     facilities; (2) Whose primary duty is the performance of \n     office or non-manual work directly related to the management \n     or general business operations of the employer or the \n     employer's customers; and (3) Whose primary duty includes the \n     exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect \n     to matters of significance.\n       (b) The term ``salary basis'' is defined at Sec. 541.602; \n     ``fee basis'' is defined at Sec. 541.605; ``board, lodging or \n     other facilities'' is defined at Sec. 541.606; and ``primary \n     duty'' is defined at Sec. 541.700.\n       Sec. 541.201  Directly related to management or general \n     business operations.\n       (a) To qualify for the administrative exemption, an \n     employee's primary duty must be the performance of work \n     directly related to the management or general business \n     operations of the employer or the employer's customers. The \n     phrase ``directly related to the management or general \n     business operations'' refers to the type of work performed by \n     the employee. To meet this requirement, an employee must \n     perform work directly related to assisting with the running \n     or servicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, \n     from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a \n     product in a retail or service establishment.\n       (b) Work directly related to management or general business \n     operations includes, but is not limited to, work in \n     functional areas such as tax; finance; accounting; budgeting; \n     auditing; insurance; quality control; purchasing; \n     procurement; advertising; marketing; research; safety and \n     health; personnel management; human resources; employee \n     benefits; labor relations; public relations, government \n     relations; computer network, internet and database \n     administration; legal and regulatory compliance; and similar \n     activities. Some of these activities may be performed by \n     employees who also would qualify for another exemption.\n       (c) An employee may qualify for the administrative \n     exemption if the employee's primary duty is the performance \n     of work directly related to the management or general \n     business operations of the employer's customers. Thus, for \n     example, employees acting as advisers or consultants to their \n     employer's clients or customers (as tax experts or financial \n     consultants, for example) may be exempt.\n       Sec. 541.202  Discretion and independent judgment.\n       (a) To qualify for the administrative exemption, an \n     employee's primary duty must include the exercise of \n     discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters \n     of significance. In general, the exercise of discretion and \n     independent judgment involves the comparison and the \n     evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and acting or \n     making a decision after the various possibilities have been \n     considered. The term ``matters of significance'' refers to \n     the level of importance or consequence of the work performed.\n       (b) The phrase ``discretion and independent judgment'' must \n     be applied in the light of all the facts involved in the \n     particular employment situation in which the question arises. \n     Factors to consider when determining whether an employee \n     exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to \n     matters of significance include, but are not limited to: \n     whether the employee has authority to formulate, affect, \n     interpret, or implement management policies or operating \n     practices; whether the employee carries out major assignments \n     in conducting the operations of the business; whether the \n     employee performs work that affects business operations to a \n     substantial degree, even if the employee's assignments are \n     related to operation of a particular segment of the business; \n     whether the employee has authority to commit the employer in \n     matters that have significant financial impact; whether the \n     employee has authority to waive or deviate from established \n     policies and procedures without prior approval; whether the \n     employee has authority to negotiate and bind the company on \n     significant matters; whether the employee provides \n     consultation or expert advice to management; whether the \n     employee is involved in planning long- or short-term business \n     objectives; whether the employee investigates and resolves \n     matters of significance on behalf of management; and whether \n     the employee represents the company in handling complaints, \n     arbitrating disputes or resolving grievances.\n       (c) The exercise of discretion and independent judgment \n     implies that the employee has authority to make an \n     independent choice, free from immediate direction or \n     supervision. However, employees can exercise discretion and \n     independent judgment even if their decisions or \n     recommendations are reviewed at a higher level. Thus, the \n     term ``discretion and independent judgment'' does not require \n     that the decisions made by an employee have a finality that \n     goes with unlimited authority and a complete absence of \n     review. The decisions made as a result of the exercise of \n     discretion and independent judgment may consist of \n     recommendations for action rather than the actual taking of \n     action. The fact that an employee's decision may be subject \n     to review and that upon occasion the decisions are revised or \n     reversed after review does not mean that the employee is not \n     exercising discretion and independent judgment. For example, \n     the policies formulated by the credit manager of a large \n     corporation may be subject to review by higher company \n     officials who may approve or disapprove these policies. The \n     management consultant who has made a study of the operations \n     of a business and who has drawn a proposed change in \n     organization may have the plan reviewed or revised by \n     superiors before it is submitted to the client.\n       (d) An employer's volume of business may make it necessary \n     to employ a number of employees to perform the same or \n     similar work. The fact that many employees perform identical \n     work or work of the same relative importance does not mean \n     that the work of each such employee does not involve the \n     exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect \n     to matters of significance.\n       (e) The exercise of discretion and independent judgment \n     must be more than the use of skill in applying well-\n     established techniques, procedures or specific standards \n     described in manuals or other sources. See also Sec. 541.704 \n     regarding use of manuals. The exercise of discretion and \n     independent judgment also does not include clerical or \n     secretarial work, recording or tabulating data, or performing \n     other mechanical, repetitive, recurrent or routine work. An \n     employee who simply tabulates data is not exempt, even if \n     labeled as a ``statistician.''\n       (f) An employee does not exercise discretion and \n     independent judgment with respect to matters of significance \n     merely because the employer will experience financial losses \n     if the employee fails to perform the job properly. For \n     example, a messenger who is entrusted with carrying large \n     sums of money does not exercise discretion and independent \n     judgment with respect to matters of significance even though \n     serious consequences may flow from the employee's neglect. \n     Similarly, an employee who operates very expensive equipment \n     does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with \n     respect to matters of significance merely because improper \n     performance of the employee's duties may cause serious \n     financial loss to the employer.\n       Sec. 541.203  Administrative exemption examples.\n       (a) Insurance claims adjusters generally meet the duties \n     requirements for the administrative exemption, whether they \n     work for an insurance company or other type of company, if \n     their duties include activities such as interviewing \n     insureds, witnesses and physicians; inspecting property \n     damage; reviewing factual information to prepare damage \n     estimates; evaluating and making recommendations regarding \n     coverage of claims; determining liability and total value of \n     a claim; negotiating settlements; and making recommendations \n     regarding litigation.\n       (b) Employees in the financial services industry generally \n     meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption \n     if their duties include work such as collecting and analyzing \n     information regarding the customer's income, assets, \n     investments or debts; determining which financial products \n     best meet the customer's needs and financial circumstances; \n     advising the customer regarding the advantages and \n     disadvantages of different financial products; and marketing, \n     servicing or promoting the employer's financial products. \n     However, an employee whose primary duty is selling financial \n     products does not qualify for the administrative exemption.\n       (c) An employee who leads a team of other employees \n     assigned to complete major projects for the employer (such as \n     purchasing, selling or closing all or part of the business, \n     negotiating a real estate transaction or a collective \n     bargaining agreement, or designing and implementing \n     productivity improvements) generally meets the duties \n     requirements for the administrative exemption, even if the \n     employee does not have direct supervisory responsibility over \n     the other employees on the team.\n       (d) An executive assistant or administrative assistant to a \n     business owner or senior executive of a large business \n     generally meets the duties requirements for the \n     administrative exemption if such employee, without specific \n     instructions or prescribed procedures, has been delegated \n     authority regarding matters of significance.\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\n       (e) Human resources managers who formulate, interpret or \n     implement employment policies and management consultants who \n     study the operations of a business and propose changes in \n     organization generally meet the duties requirements for the \n     administrative exemption. However, personnel clerks who \n     ``screen'' applicants to obtain data regarding their minimum \n     qualifications and fitness for employment generally do not \n     meet the duties requirements for the administrative \n     exemption. Such personnel clerks typically will reject all \n     applicants who do not meet minimum standards for the \n     particular job or for employment by the company. The minimum \n     standards are usually set by the exempt human resources \n     manager or other company officials, and the decision to hire \n     from the group of qualified applicants who do meet the \n     minimum standards is similarly made by the exempt human \n     resources manager or other company officials. Thus, when the \n     interviewing and screening functions are performed by the \n     human resources manager or personnel manager who makes the \n     hiring decision or makes recommendations for hiring from the \n     pool of qualified applicants, such duties constitute exempt \n     work, even though routine, because this work is directly and \n     closely related to the employee's exempt functions.\n       (f) Purchasing agents with authority to bind the company on \n     significant purchases generally meet the duties requirements \n     for the administrative exemption even if they must consult \n     with top management officials when making a purchase \n     commitment for raw materials in excess of the contemplated \n     plant needs.\n       (g) Ordinary inspection work generally does not meet the \n     duties requirements for the administrative exemption. \n     Inspectors normally perform specialized work along \n     standardized lines involving well-established techniques and \n     procedures which may have been catalogued and described in \n     manuals or other sources. Such inspectors rely on techniques \n     and skills acquired by special training or experience. They \n     have some leeway in the performance of their work but only \n     within closely prescribed limits.\n       (h) Employees usually called examiners or graders, such as \n     employees that grade lumber, generally do not meet the duties \n     requirements for the administrative exemption. Such employees \n     usually perform work involving the comparison of products \n     with established standards which are frequently catalogued. \n     Often, after continued reference to the written standards, or \n     through experience, the employee acquires sufficient \n     knowledge so that reference to written standards is \n     unnecessary. The substitution of the employee's memory for a \n     manual of standards does not convert the character of the \n     work performed to exempt work requiring the exercise of \n     discretion and independent judgment.\n       (i) Comparison shopping performed by an employee of a \n     retail store who merely reports to the buyer the prices at a \n     competitor's store does not qualify for the administrative \n     exemption. However, the buyer who evaluates such reports on \n     competitor prices to set the employer's prices generally \n     meets the duties requirements for the administrative \n     exemption.\n       (j) Public sector inspectors or investigators of various \n     types, such as fire prevention or safety, building or \n     construction, health or sanitation, environmental or soils \n     specialists and similar employees, generally do not meet the \n     duties requirements for the administrative exemption because \n     their work typically does not involve work directly related \n     to the management or general business operations of the \n     employer. Such employees also do not qualify for the \n     administrative exemption because their work involves the use \n     of skills and technical abilities in gathering factual \n     information, applying known standards or prescribed \n     procedures, determining which procedure to follow, or \n     determining whether prescribed standards or criteria are met.\n       Sec. 541.204  Educational establishments.\n       (a) The term ``employee employed in a bona fide \n     administrative capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also \n     includes employees: (1) Compensated for services on a salary \n     or fee basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week (or \n     $380 per week, if employed in American Samoa by employers \n     other than the Federal Government) exclusive of board, \n     lodging or other facilities, or on a salary basis which is at \n     least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the \n     educational establishment by which employed; and (2) Whose \n     primary duty is performing administrative functions directly \n     related to academic instruction or training in an educational \n     establishment or department or subdivision thereof.\n       (b) The term ``educational establishment'' means an \n     elementary or secondary school system, an institution of \n     higher education or other educational institution. Sections \n     3(v) and 3(w) of the Act define elementary and secondary \n     schools as those day or residential schools that provide \n     elementary or secondary education, as determined under State \n     law. Under the laws of most States, such education includes \n     the curriculums in grades 1 through 12; under many it \n     includes also the introductory programs in kindergarten. Such \n     education in some States may also include nursery school \n     programs in elementary education and junior college \n     curriculums in secondary education. The term ``other \n     educational establishment'' includes special schools for \n     mentally or physically disabled or gifted children, \n     regardless of any classification of such schools as \n     elementary, secondary or higher. Factors relevant in \n     determining whether post-secondary career programs are \n     educational institutions include whether the school is \n     licensed by a state agency responsible for the state's \n     educational system or accredited by a nationally recognized \n     accrediting organization for career schools. Also, for \n     purposes of the exemption, no distinction is drawn between \n     public and private schools, or between those operated for \n     profit and those that are not for profit.\n       (c) The phrase ``performing administrative functions \n     directly related to academic instruction or training'' means \n     work related to the academic operations and functions in a \n     school rather than to administration along the lines of \n     general business operations. Such academic administrative \n     functions include operations directly in the field of \n     education. Jobs relating to areas outside the educational \n     field are not within the definition of academic \n     administration.\n       (1) Employees engaged in academic administrative functions \n     include: the superintendent or other head of an elementary or \n     secondary school system, and any assistants, responsible for \n     administration of such matters as curriculum, quality and \n     methods of instructing, measuring and testing the learning \n     potential and achiovement of students, establishing and \n     maintaining academic and grading standards, and other aspects \n     of the teaching program; the principal and any vice-\n     principals responsible for the operation of an elementary or \n     secondary school; department heads in institutions of higher \n     education responsible for the administration of the \n     mathematics department, the English department, the foreign \n     language department, etc.; academic counselors who perform \n     work such as administering school testing programs, assisting \n     students with academic problems and advising students \n     concerning degree requirements; and other employees with \n     similar responsibilities.\n       (2) Jobs relating to building management and maintenance, \n     jobs relating to the health of the students, and academic \n     staff such as social workers, psychologists, lunch room \n     managers or dietitians do not perform academic administrative \n     functions. Although such work is not considered academic \n     administration, such employees may qualify for exemption \n     under Sec. 541.200 or under other sections of this part, \n     provided the requirements for such exemptions are met.\n\n                   Subpart D--Professional Employees\n\n       Sec. 541.300  General rule for professional employees.\n       (a) The term ``employee employed in a bona fide \n     professional capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall \n     mean any employee: (1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis \n     at a rate of not less than $455 per week (or $380 per week, \n     if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the \n     Federal Government), exclusive of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities; and (2) Whose primary duty is the performance of \n     work: (i) Requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field \n     of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged \n     course of specialized intellectual instruction; or (ii) \n     Requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a \n     recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.\n       (b) The term ``salary basis'' is defined at Sec. 541.602; \n     ``fee basis'' is defined at Sec. 541.605; ``board, lodging or \n     other facilities'' is defined at Sec. 541.606; and ``primary \n     duty'' is defined at Sec. 541.700.\n       Sec. 541.301  Learned professionals.\n       (a) To qualify for the learned professional exemption, an \n     employee's primary duty must be the performance of work \n     requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or \n     learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of \n     specialized intellectual instruction. This primary duty test \n     includes three elements:\n       (1) The employee must perform work requiring advanced \n     knowledge;\n       (2) The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or \n     learning; and (3) The advanced knowledge must be customarily \n     acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual \n     instruction.\n       (b) The phrase ``work requiring advanced knowledge'' means \n     work which is predominantly intellectual in character, and \n     which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of \n     discretion and judgment, as distinguished from performance of \n     routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. An \n     employee who performs work requiring advanced knowledge \n     generally uses the advanced knowledge to analyze, interpret \n     or make deductions from varying facts or circumstances. \n     Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school \n     level.\n       (c) The phrase ``field of science or learning'' includes \n     the traditional professions of law, medicine, theology, \n     accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture, \n     teaching, various types of physical, chemical and biological \n     sciences, pharmacy and other similar occupations that have a \n     recognized professional status as distinguished from the \n     mechanical arts or skilled trades where in some instances the \n     knowledge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a field \n     of science or learning.\n       (d) The phrase ``customarily acquired by a prolonged course \n     of specialized intellectual instruction'' restricts the \n     exemption to professions where specialized academic training \n     is a standard prerequisite for entrance into the profession. \n     The best prima facie evidence that an employee meets this \n     requirement is possession of the appropriate academic degree. \n     However, the word ``customarily''\n\n[[Page S9922]]\n\n     means that the exemption is also available to employees in \n     such professions who have substantially the same knowledge \n     level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed \n     employees, but who attained the advanced knowledge through a \n     combination of work experience and intellectual instruction. \n     Thus, for example, the learned professional exemption is \n     available to the occasional lawyer who has not gone to law \n     school, or the occasional chemist who is not the possessor of \n     a degree in chemistry. However, the learned professional \n     exemption is not available for occupations that customarily \n     may be performed with only the general knowledge acquired by \n     an academic degree in any field, with knowledge acquired \n     through an apprenticeship, or with training in the \n     performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical \n     processes. The learned professional exemption also does not \n     apply to occupations in which most employees have acquired \n     their skill by experience rather than by advanced specialized \n     intellectual instruction.\n       (e)(1) Registered or certified medical technologists. \n     Registered or certified medical technologists who have \n     successfully completed three academic years of pre-\n     professional study in an accredited college or university \n     plus a fourth year of professional course work in a school of \n     medical technology approved by the Council of Medical \n     Education of the American Medical Association generally meet \n     the duties requirements for the learned professional \n     exemption. (2) Nurses. Registered nurses who are registered \n     by the appropriate State examining board generally meet the \n     duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. \n     Licensed practical nurses and other similar health care \n     employees, however, generally do not qualify as exempt \n     learned professionals because possession of a specialized \n     advanced academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for \n     entry into such occupations. (3) Dental hygienists. Dental \n     hygienists who have successfully completed four academic \n     years of pre-professional and professional study in an \n     accredited college or university approved by the Commission \n     on Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary Educational \n     Programs of the American Dental Association generally meet \n     the duties requirements for the learned professional \n     exemption. (4) Physician assistants. Physician assistants who \n     have successfully completed four academic years of pre-\n     professional and professional study, including graduation \n     from a physician assistant program accredited by the \n     Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the \n     Physician Assistant, and who are certified by the National \n     Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants generally \n     meet the duties requirements for the learned professional \n     exemption. (5) Accountants. Certified public accountants \n     generally meet the duties requirements for the learned \n     professional exemption. In addition, many other accountants \n     who are not certified public accountants but perform similar \n     job duties may qualify as exempt learned professionals. \n     However, accounting clerks, bookkeepers and other employees \n     who normally perform a great deal of routine work generally \n     will not qualify as exempt professionals. (6) Chefs. Chefs, \n     such as executive chefs and sous chefs, who have attained a \n     four-year specialized academic degree in a culinary arts \n     program, generally meet the duties requirements for the \n     learned professional exemption. The learned professional \n     exemption is not available to cooks who perform predominantly \n     routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. (7) \n     Paralegals. Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not \n     qualify as exempt learned professionals because an advanced \n     specialized academic degree is not a standard prerequisite \n     for entry into the field. Although many paralegals possess \n     general four-year advanced degrees, most specialized \n     paralegal programs are two-year associate degree programs \n     from a community college or equivalent institution. However, \n     the learned professional exemption is available for \n     paralegals who possess advanced specialized degrees in other \n     professional fields and apply advanced knowledge in that \n     field in the performance of their duties. For example, if a \n     law firm hires an engineer as a paralegal to provide expert \n     advice on product liability cases or to assist on patent \n     matters, that engineer would qualify for exemption. (8) \n     Athletic trainers. Athletic trainers who have successfully \n     completed four academic years of pre-professional and \n     professional study in a specialized curriculum accredited by \n     the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education \n     Programs and who are certified by the Board of Certification \n     of the National Athletic Trainers Association Board of \n     Certification generally meet the duties requirements for the \n     learned professional exemption. (9) Funeral directors or \n     embalmers. Licensed funeral directors and embalmers who are \n     licensed by and working in a state that requires successful \n     completion of four academic years of pre-professional and \n     professional study, including graduation from a college of \n     mortuary science accredited by the American Board of Funeral \n     Service Education, generally meet the duties requirements for \n     the learned professional exemption.\n       (f) The areas in which the professional exemption may be \n     available are expanding. As knowledge is developed, academic \n     training is broadened and specialized degrees are offered in \n     new and diverse fields, thus creating new specialists in \n     particular fields of science or learning. When an advanced \n     specialized degree has become a standard requirement for a \n     particular occupation, that occupation may have acquired the \n     characteristics of a learned profession. Accrediting and \n     certifying organizations similar to those listed in \n     paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4), (e)(8) and (e)(9) of this \n     section also may be created in the future. Such organizations \n     may develop similar specialized curriculums and certification \n     programs which, if a standard requirement for a particular \n     occupation, may indicate that the occupation has acquired the \n     characteristics of a learned profession.\n       Sec. 541.302  Creative professionals.\n       (a) To qualify for the creative professional exemption, an \n     employee's primary duty must be the performance of work \n     requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a \n     recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor as opposed \n     to routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. The \n     exemption does not apply to work which can be produced by a \n     person with general manual or intellectual ability and \n     training.\n       (b) To qualify for exemption as a creative professional, \n     the work performed must be ``in a recognized field of \n     artistic or creative endeavor.'' This includes such fields as \n     music, writing, acting and the graphic arts.\n       (c) The requirement of ``invention, imagination, \n     originality or talent'' distinguishes the creative \n     professions from work that primarily depends on intelligence, \n     diligence and accuracy. The duties of employees vary widely, \n     and exemption as a creative professional depends on the \n     extent of the invention, imagination, originality or talent \n     exercised by the employee. Determination of exempt creative \n     professional status, therefore, must be made on a case-by-\n     case basis. This requirement generally is met by actors, \n     musicians, composers, conductors, and soloists; painters who \n     at most are given the subject matter of their painting; \n     cartoonists who are merely told the title or underlying \n     concept of a cartoon and must rely on their own creative \n     ability to express the concept; essayists, novelists, short-\n     story writers and screen-play writers who choose their own \n     subjects and hand in a finished piece of work to their \n     employers (the majority of such persons are, of course, not \n     employees but self-employed); and persons holding the more \n     responsible writing positions in advertising agencies. This \n     requirement generally is not met by a person who is employed \n     as a copyist, as an ``animator'' of motion-picture cartoons, \n     or as a retoucher of photographs, since such work is not \n     properly described as creative in character.\n       (d) Journalists may satisfy the duties requirements for the \n     creative professional exemption if their primary duty is work \n     requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent, as \n     opposed to work which depends primarily on intelligence, \n     diligence and accuracy. Employees of newspapers, magazines, \n     television and other media are not exempt creative \n     professionals if they only collect, organize and record \n     information that is routine or already public, or if they do \n     not contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news \n     product. Thus, for example, newspaper reporters who merely \n     rewrite press releases or who write standard recounts of \n     public information by gathering facts on routine community \n     events are not exempt creative professionals. Reporters also \n     do not qualify as exempt creative professionals if their work \n     product is subject to substantial control by the employer. \n     However, journalists may qualify as exempt creative \n     professionals if their primary duty is performing on the air \n     in radio, television or other electronic media; conducting \n     investigative interviews; analyzing or interpreting public \n     events; writing editorials, opinion columns or other \n     commentary; or acting as a narrator or commentator.\n       Sec. 541.303  Teachers.\n       (a) The term ``employee employed in a bona fide \n     professional capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also \n     means any employee with a primary duty of teaching, tutoring, \n     instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting \n     knowledge and who is employed and engaged in this activity as \n     a teacher in an educational establishment by which the \n     employee is employed. The term ``educational establishment'' \n     is defined in Sec. 541.204(b).\n       (b) Exempt teachers include, but are not limited to: \n     Regular academic teachers; teachers of kindergarten or \n     nursery school pupils; teachers of gifted or disabled \n     children; teachers of skilled and semi- skilled trades and \n     occupations; teachers engaged in automobile driving \n     instruction; aircraft flight instructors; home economics \n     teachers; and vocal or instrumental music instructors. Those \n     faculty members who are engaged as teachers but also spend a \n     considerable amount of their time in extracurricular \n     activities such as coaching athletic teams or acting as \n     moderators or advisors in such areas as drama, speech, debate \n     or journalism are engaged in teaching. Such activities are a \n     recognized part of the schools' responsibility in \n     contributing to the educational development of the student.\n       (c) The possession of an elementary or secondary teacher's \n     certificate provides a clear means of identifying the \n     individuals contemplated as being within the scope of the \n     exemption for teaching professionals. Teachers who possess a \n     teaching certificate qualify for the exemption regardless of \n     the terminology (e.g., permanent, conditional, standard, \n     provisional, temporary, emergency, or unlimited) used by the \n     State to refer to different kinds of certificates. However, \n     private schools and public schools are not uniform in\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\n     requiring a certificate for employment as an elementary or \n     secondary school teacher, and a teacher's certificate is not \n     generally necessary for employment in institutions of higher \n     education or other educational establishments. Therefore, a \n     teacher who is not certified may be considered for exemption, \n     provided that such individual is employed as a teacher by the \n     employing school or school system.\n       (d) The requirements of Sec. 541.300 and Subpart G (salary \n     requirements) of this part do not apply to the teaching \n     professionals described in this section.\n       Sec. 541.304  Practice of law or medicine.\n       (a) The term ``employee employed in a bona fide \n     professional capacity'' in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also \n     shall mean: (1) Any employee who is the holder of a valid \n     license or certificate permitting the practice of law or \n     medicine or any of their branches and is actually engaged in \n     the practice thereof; and (2) Any employee who is the holder \n     of the requisite academic degree for the general practice of \n     medicine and is engaged in an internship or resident program \n     pursuant to the practice of the profession.\n       (b) In the case of medicine, the exemption applies to \n     physicians and other practitioners licensed and practicing in \n     the field of medical science and healing or any of the \n     medical specialties practiced by physicians or practitioners. \n     The term ``physicians'' includes medical doctors including \n     general practitioners and specialists, osteopathic physicians \n     (doctors of osteopathy), podiatrists, dentists (doctors of \n     dental medicine), and optometrists (doctors of optometry or \n     bachelors of science in optometry).\n       (c) Employees engaged in internship or resident programs, \n     whether or not licensed to practice prior to commencement of \n     the program, qualify as exempt professionals if they enter \n     such internship or resident programs after the earning of the \n     appropriate degree required for the general practice of their \n     profession.\n       (d) The requirements of Sec. 541.300 and subpart G (salary \n     requirements) of this part do not apply to the employees \n     described in this section.\n\n                     Subpart E--Computer Employees\n\n       Sec. 541.400  General rule for computer employees.\n       (a) Computer systems analysts, computer programmers, \n     software engineers or other similarly skilled workers in the \n     computer field are eligible for exemption as professionals \n     under section 13(a)(1) of the Act and under section 13(a)(17) \n     of the Act. Because job titles vary widely and change quickly \n     in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of \n     the applicability of this exemption.\n       (b) The section 13(a)(1) exemption applies to any computer \n     employee compensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate of \n     not less than $455 per week (or $380 per week, if employed in \n     American Samoa by employers other than the Federal \n     Government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities, \n     and the section 13(a)(17) exemption applies to any computer \n     employee compensated on an hourly basis at a rate not less \n     than $27.63 an hour. In addition, under either section \n     13(a)(1) or section 13(a)(17) of the Act, the exemptions \n     apply only to computer employees whose primary duty consists \n     of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and \n     procedures, including consulting with users, to determine \n     hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) \n     The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, \n     testing or modification of computer systems or programs, \n     including prototypes, based on and related to user or system \n     design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, \n     testing, creation or modification of computer programs \n     related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of \n     the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires \n     the same level of skills.\n       (c) The term ``salary basis'' is defined at Sec. 541.602; \n     ``fee basis'' is defined at Sec. 541.605; ``board, lodging or \n     other facilities'' is defined at Sec. 541.606; and ``primary \n     duty'' is defined at Sec. 541.700.\n       Sec. 541.401  Computer manufacture and repair. The \n     exemption for employees in computer occupations does not \n     include employees engaged in the manufacture or repair of \n     computer hardware and related equipment. Employees whose work \n     is highly dependent upon, or facilitated by, the use of \n     computers and computer software programs (e.g., engineers, \n     drafters and others skilled in computer-aided design \n     software), but who are not primarily engaged in computer \n     systems analysis and programming or other similarly skilled \n     computer-related occupations identified in Sec. 541.400(b), \n     are also not exempt computer professionals.\n       Sec. 541.402  Executive and administrative computer \n     employees. Computer employees within the scope of this \n     exemption, as well as those employees not within its scope, \n     may also have executive and administrative duties which \n     qualify the employees for exemption under subpart B or \n     subpart C of this part. For example, systems analysts and \n     computer programmers generally meet the duties requirements \n     for the administrative exemption if their primary duty \n     includes work such as planning, scheduling, and coordinating \n     activities required to develop systems to solve complex \n     business, scientific or engineering problems of the employer \n     or the employer's customers. Similarly, a senior or lead \n     computer programmer who manages the work of two or more other \n     programmers in a customarily recognized department or \n     subdivision of the employer, and whose recommendations as to \n     the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or other change of \n     status of the other programmers are given particular weight, \n     generally meets the duties requirements for the executive \n     exemption.\n\n                   Subpart F--Outside Sales Employees\n\n       Sec. 541.500  General rule for outside sales employees. (a) \n     The term ``employee employed in the capacity of outside \n     salesman'' in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any \n     employee: (1) Whose primary duty is: (i) making sales within \n     the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or (ii) obtaining \n     orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities \n     for which a consideration will be paid by the client or \n     customer; and (2) Who is customarily and regularly engaged \n     away from the employer's place or places of business in \n     performing such primary duty.\n       (b) The term ``primary duty'' is defined at Sec. 541.700. \n     In determining the primary duty of an outside sales employee, \n     work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the \n     employee's own outside sales or solicitations, including \n     incidental deliveries and collections, shall be regarded as \n     exempt outside sales work. Other work that furthers the \n     employee's sales efforts also shall be regarded as exempt \n     work including, for example, writing sales reports, updating \n     or revising the employee's sales or display catalogue, \n     planning itineraries and attending sales conferences.\n       (c) The requirements of subpart G (salary requirements) of \n     this part do not apply to the outside sales employees \n     described in this section.\n       Sec. 541.501  Making sales or obtaining orders.\n       (a) Section 541.500 requires that the employee be engaged \n     in: (1) Making sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of \n     the Act, or (2) Obtaining orders or contracts for services or \n     for the use of facilities.\n       (b) Sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act \n     include the transfer of title to tangible property, and in \n     certain cases, of tangible and valuable evidences of \n     intangible property. Section 3(k) of the Act states that \n     ``sale'' or ``sell'' includes any sale, exchange, contract to \n     sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other \n     disposition.\n       (c) Exempt outside sales work includes not only the sales \n     of commodities, but also ``obtaining orders or contracts for \n     services or for the use of facilities for which a \n     consideration will be paid by the client or customer.'' \n     Obtaining orders for ``the use of facilities'' includes the \n     selling of time on radio or television, the solicitation of \n     advertising for newspapers and other periodicals, and the \n     solicitation of freight for railroads and other \n     transportation agencies.\n       (d) The word ``services'' extends the outside sales \n     exemption to employees who sell or take orders for a service, \n     which may be performed for the customer by someone other than \n     the person taking the order.\n       Sec. 541.502  Away from employer's place of business. An \n     outside sales employee must be customarily and regularly \n     engaged ``away from the employer's place or places of \n     business.'' The outside sales employee is an employee who \n     makes sales at the customer's place of business or, if \n     selling door-to-door, at the customer's home. Outside sales \n     does not include sales made by mail, telephone or the \n     Internet unless such contact is used merely as an adjunct to \n     personal calls. Thus, any fixed site, whether home or office, \n     used by a salesperson as a headquarters or for telephonic \n     solicitation of sales is considered one of the employer's \n     places of business, even though the employer is not in any \n     formal sense the owner or tenant of the property. However, an \n     outside sales employee does not lose the exemption by \n     displaying samples in hotel sample rooms during trips from \n     city to city; these sample rooms should not be considered as \n     the employer's places of business. Similarly, an outside \n     sales employee does not lose the exemption by displaying the \n     employer's products at a trade show. If selling actually \n     occurs, rather than just sales promotion, trade shows of \n     short duration (i.e., one or two weeks) should not be \n     considered as the employer's place of business.\n       Sec. 541.503  Promotion work.\n       (a) Promotion work is one type of activity often performed \n     by persons who make sales, which may or may not be exempt \n     outside sales work, depending upon the circumstances under \n     which it is performed. Promotional work that is actually \n     performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee's \n     own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work. On the \n     other hand, promotional work that is incidental to sales \n     made, or to be made, by someone else is not exempt outside \n     sales work. An employee who does not satisfy the requirements \n     of this subpart may still qualify as an exempt employee under \n     other subparts of this rule.\n       (b) A manufacturer's representative, for example, may \n     perform various types of promotional activities such as \n     putting up displays and posters, removing damaged or spoiled \n     stock from the merchant's shelves or rearranging the \n     merchandise. Such an employee can be considered an exempt \n     outside sales employee if the employee's primary duty is \n     making sales or contracts. Promotion activities directed \n     toward consummation of the employee's own sales are exempt. \n     Promotional activities designed to stimulate sales that will \n     be made by someone else are not exempt outside sales work.\n       (c) Another example is a company representative who visits \n     chain stores, arranges\n\n[[Page S9924]]\n\n     the merchandise on shelves, replenishes stock by replacing \n     old with new merchandise, sets up displays and consults with \n     the store manager when inventory runs low, but does not \n     obtain a commitment for additional purchases. The arrangement \n     of merchandise on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is \n     not exempt work unless it is incidental to and in conjunction \n     with the employee's own outside sales. Because the employee \n     in this instance does not consummate the sale nor direct \n     efforts toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not \n     exempt outside sales work.\n       Sec. 541.504  Drivers who sell.\n       (a) Drivers who deliver products and also sell such \n     products may qualify as exempt outside sales employees only \n     if the employee has a primary duty of making sales. In \n     determining the primary duty of drivers who sell, work \n     performed incidental to and in conjunction with the \n     employee's own outside sales or solicitations, including \n     loading, driving or delivering products, shall be regarded as \n     exempt outside sales work.\n       (b) Several factors should be considered in determining if \n     a driver has a primary duty of making sales, including, but \n     not limited to: a comparison of the driver's duties with \n     those of other employees engaged as truck drivers and as \n     salespersons; possession of a selling or solicitor's license \n     when such license is required by law or ordinances; presence \n     or absence of customary or contractual arrangements \n     concerning amounts of products to be delivered; description \n     of the employee's occupation in collective bargaining \n     agreements; the employer's specifications as to \n     qualifications for hiring; sales training; attendance at \n     sales conferences; method of payment; and proportion of \n     earnings directly attributable to sales.\n       (c) Drivers who may qualify as exempt outside sales \n     employees include: (1) A driver who provides the only sales \n     contact between the employer and the customers visited, who \n     calls on customers and takes orders for products, who \n     delivers products from stock in the employee's vehicle or \n     procures and delivers the product to the customer on a later \n     trip, and who receives compensation commensurate with the \n     volume of products sold. (2) A driver who obtains or solicits \n     orders for the employer's products from persons who have \n     authority to commit the customer for purchases. (3) A driver \n     who calls on new prospects for customers along the employee's \n     route and attempts to convince them of the desirability of \n     accepting regular delivery of goods. (4) A driver who calls \n     on established customers along the route and persuades \n     regular customers to accept delivery of increased amounts of \n     goods or of new products, even though the initial sale or \n     agreement for delivery was made by someone else.\n       (d) Drivers who generally would not qualify as exempt \n     outside sales employees include: (1) A route driver whose \n     primary duty is to transport products sold by the employer \n     through vending machines and to keep such machines stocked, \n     in good operating condition, and in good locations.\n       (2) A driver who often calls on established customers day \n     after day or week after week, delivering a quantity of the \n     employer's products at each call when the sale was not \n     significantly affected by solicitations of the customer by \n     the delivering driver or the amount of the sale is determined \n     by the volume of the customer's sales since the previous \n     delivery. (3) A driver primarily engaged in making deliveries \n     to customers and performing activities intended to promote \n     sales by customers (including placing point-of-sale and other \n     advertising materials, price stamping commodities, arranging \n     merchandise on shelves, in coolers or in cabinets, rotating \n     stock according to date, and cleaning and otherwise servicing \n     display cases), unless such work is in furtherance of the \n     driver's own sales efforts.\n\n                     Subpart G--Salary Requirements\n\n       Sec. 541.600  Amount of salary required.\n       (a) To qualify as an exempt executive, administrative or \n     professional employee under section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an \n     employee must be compensated on a salary basis at a rate of \n     not less than $455 per week (or $380 per week, if employed in \n     American Samoa by employers other than the Federal \n     Government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities. \n     Administrative and professional employees may also be paid on \n     a fee basis, as defined in Sec. 541.605.\n       (b) The $455 a week may be translated into equivalent \n     amounts for periods longer than one week. The requirement \n     will be met if the employee is compensated biweekly on a \n     salary basis of $910, semimonthly on a salary basis of \n     $985.83, or monthly on a salary basis of $1,971.66. However, \n     the shortest period of payment that will meet this \n     compensation requirement is one week.\n       (c) In the case of academic administrative employees, the \n     compensation requirement also may be met by compensation on a \n     salary basis at a rate at least equal to the entrance salary \n     for teachers in the educational establishment by which the \n     employee is employed, as provided in Sec. 541. 204(a)(1).\n       (d) In the case of computer employees, the compensation \n     requirement also may be met by compensation on an hourly \n     basis at a rate not less than $27.63 an hour, as provided in \n     Sec. 541. 400(b).\n       (e) In the case of professional employees, the compensation \n     requirements in this section shall not apply to employees \n     engaged as teachers (see Sec. 541.303); employees who hold a \n     valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law \n     or medicine or any of their branches and are actually engaged \n     in the practice thereof (see Sec. 541.304); or to employees \n     who hold the requisite academic degree for the general \n     practice of medicine and are engaged in an internship or \n     resident program pursuant to the practice of the profession \n     (see Sec. 541.304). In the case of medical occupations, the \n     exception from the salary or fee requirement does not apply \n     to pharmacists, nurses, therapists, technologists, \n     sanitarians, dietitians, social workers, psychologists, \n     psychometrists, or other professions which service the \n     medical profession.\n       Sec. 541.601  Highly compensated employees.\n       (a) An employee with total annual compensation of at least \n     $100,000 is deemed exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the Act \n     if the employee customarily and regularly performs any one or \n     more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an \n     executive, administrative or professional employee identified \n     in subparts B, C or D of this part.\n       (b)(1) ``Total annual compensation'' must include at least \n     $455 per week paid on a salary or fee basis. Total annual \n     compensation may also include commissions, nondiscretionary \n     bonuses and other nondiscretionary compensation earned during \n     a 52-week period. Total annual compensation does not include \n     board, lodging and other facilities as defined in Sec. \n     541.606, and does not include payments for medical insurance, \n     payments for life insurance, contributions to retirement \n     plans and the cost of other fringe benefits. (2) If an \n     employee's total annual compensation does not total at least \n     the minimum amount established in paragraph (a) of this \n     section by the last pay period of the 52-week period, the \n     employer may, during the last pay period or within one month \n     after the end of the 52-week period, make one final payment \n     sufficient to achieve the required level. For example, an \n     employee may earn $80,000 in base salary, and the employer \n     may anticipate based upon past sales that the employee also \n     will earn $20,000 in commissions. However, due to poor sales \n     in the final quarter of the year, the employee actually only \n     earns $10,000 in commissions. In this situation, the employer \n     may within one month after the end of the year make a payment \n     of at least $10,000 to the employee. Any such final payment \n     made after the end of the 52-week period may count only \n     toward the prior year's total annual compensation and not \n     toward the total annual compensation in the year it was paid. \n     If the employer fails to make such a payment, the employee \n     does not qualify as a highly compensated employee, but may \n     still qualify as exempt under subparts B, C or D of this \n     part. (3) An employee who does not work a full year for the \n     employer, either because the employee is newly hired after \n     the beginning of the year or ends the employment before the \n     end of the year, may qualify for exemption under this section \n     if the employee receives a pro rata portion of the minimum \n     amount established in paragraph (a) of this section, based \n     upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has \n     been employed. An employer may make one final payment as \n     under paragraph (b)(2) of this section within one month after \n     the end of employment. (4) The employer may utilize any 52-\n     week period as the year, such as a calendar year, a fiscal \n     year, or an anniversary of hire year. If the employer does \n     not identify some other year period in advance, the calendar \n     year will apply.\n       (c) A high level of compensation is a strong indicator of \n     an employee's exempt status, thus eliminating the need for a \n     detailed analysis of the employee's job duties. Thus, a \n     highly compensated employee will qualify for exemption if the \n     employee customarily and regularly performs any one or more \n     of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive, \n     administrative or professional employee identified in \n     subparts B, C or D of this part. An employee may qualify as a \n     highly compensated executive employee, for example, if the \n     employee customarily and regularly directs the work of two or \n     more other employees, even though the employee does not meet \n     all of the other requirements for the executive exemption \n     under Sec. 541.100.\n       (d) This section applies only to employees whose primary \n     duty includes performing office or non-manual work. Thus, for \n     example, non-management production-line workers and non \n     management employees in maintenance, construction and similar \n     occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, \n     plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, \n     longshoremen, construction workers, laborers and other \n     employees who perform work involving repetitive operations \n     with their hands, physical skill and energy are not exempt \n     under this section no matter how highly paid they might be.\n       Sec. 541.602  Salary basis.\n       (a) General rule. An employee will be considered to be paid \n     on a ``salary basis'' within the meaning of these regulations \n     if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a \n     weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount \n     constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, \n     which amount is not subject to reduction because of \n     variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed. \n     Subject to the exceptions provided in paragraph (b) of this \n     section, an exempt employee must receive the full salary for \n     any week in which the employee performs any work without \n     regard to the number of days or hours worked. Exempt \n     employees need not be paid for any workweek in which they \n     perform no work. An employee is not paid on a salary basis if \n     deductions from\n\n[[Page S9925]]\n\n     the employee's predetermined compensation are made for \n     absences occasioned by the employer or by the operating \n     requirements of the business. If the employee is ready, \n     willing and able to work, deductions may not be made for time \n     when work is not available.\n       (b) Exceptions. The prohibition against deductions from pay \n     in the salary basis requirement is subject to the following \n     exceptions: (1) Deductions from pay may be made when an \n     exempt employee is absent from work for one or more full days \n     for personal reasons, other than sickness or disability. \n     Thus, if an employee is absent for two full days to handle \n     personal affairs, the employee's salaried status will not be \n     affected if deductions are made from the salary for two full \n     day absences. However, if an exempt employee is absent for \n     one and a half days for personal reasons, the employer can \n     deduct only for the one full-day absence. (2) Deductions from \n     pay may be made for absences of one or more full days \n     occasioned by sickness or disability (including work-related \n     accidents) if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona \n     fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for \n     loss of salary occasioned by such sickness or disability. The \n     employer is not required to pay any portion of the employee's \n     salary for full-day absences for which the employee receives \n     compensation under the plan, policy or practice. Deductions \n     for such full-day absences also may be made before the \n     employee has qualified under the plan, policy or practice, \n     and after the employee has exhausted the leave allowance \n     thereunder. Thus, for example, if an employer maintains a \n     short-term disability insurance plan providing salary \n     replacement for 12 weeks starting on the fourth day of \n     absence, the employer may make deductions from pay for the \n     three days of absence before the employee qualifies for \n     benefits under the plan; for the twelve weeks in which the \n     employee receives salary replacement benefits under the plan; \n     and for absences after the employee has exhausted the 12 \n     weeks of salary replacement benefits. Similarly, an employer \n     may make deductions from pay for absences of one or more full \n     days if salary replacement benefits are provided under a \n     State disability insurance law or under a State workers' \n     compensation law. (3) While an employer cannot make \n     deductions from pay for absences of an exempt employee \n     occasioned by jury duty, attendance as a witness or temporary \n     military leave, the employer can offset any amounts received \n     by an employee as jury fees, witness fees or military pay for \n     a particular week against the salary due for that particular \n     week without loss of the exemption. (4) Deductions from pay \n     of exempt employees may be made for penalties imposed in good \n     faith for infractions of safety rules of major significance. \n     Safety rules of major significance include those relating to \n     the prevention of serious danger in the workplace or to other \n     employees, such as rules prohibiting smoking in explosive \n     plants, oil refineries and coal mines. (5) Deductions from \n     pay of exempt employees may be made for unpaid disciplinary \n     suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith \n     for infractions of workplace conduct rules. Such suspensions \n     must be imposed pursuant to a written policy applicable to \n     all employees. Thus, for example, an employer may suspend an \n     exempt employee without pay for three days for violating a \n     generally applicable written policy prohibiting sexual \n     harassment. Similarly, an employer may suspend an exempt \n     employee without pay for twelve days for violating a \n     generally applicable written policy prohibiting workplace \n     violence. (6) An employer is not required to pay the full \n     salary in the initial or terminal week of employment. Rather, \n     an employer may pay a proportionate part of an employee's \n     full salary for the time actually worked in the first and \n     last week of employment. In such weeks, the payment of an \n     hourly or daily equivalent of the employee's full salary for \n     the time actually worked will meet the requirement. However, \n     employees are not paid on a salary basis within the meaning \n     of these regulations if they are employed occasionally for a \n     few days, and the employer pays them a proportionate part of \n     the weekly salary when so employed. (7) An employer is not \n     required to pay the full salary for weeks in which an exempt \n     employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical \n     Leave Act. Rather, when an exempt employee takes unpaid leave \n     under the Family and Medical Leave Act, an employer may pay a \n     proportionate part of the full salary for time actually \n     worked. For example, if an employee who normally works 40 \n     hours per week uses four hours of unpaid leave under the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act, the employer could deduct 10 \n     percent of the employee's normal salary that week.\n       (c) When calculating the amount of a deduction from pay \n     allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, the employer may \n     use the hourly or daily equivalent of the employee's full \n     weekly salary or any other amount proportional to the time \n     actually missed by the employee. A deduction from pay as a \n     penalty for violations of major safety rules under paragraph \n     (b)(4) of this section may be made in any amount.\n       Sec. 541.603  Effect of improper deductions from salary.\n       (a) An employer who makes improper deductions from salary \n     shall lose the exemption if the facts demonstrate that the \n     employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis. \n     An actual practice of making improper deductions demonstrates \n     that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary \n     basis. The factors to consider when determining whether an \n     employer has an actual practice of making improper deductions \n     include, but are not limited to: the number of improper \n     deductions, particularly as compared to the number of \n     employee infractions warranting discipline; the time period \n     during which the employer made improper deductions; the \n     number and geographic location of employees whose salary was \n     improperly reduced; the number and geographic location of \n     managers responsible for taking the improper deductions; and \n     whether the employer has a clearly communicated policy \n     permitting or prohibiting improper deductions.\n       (b) If the facts demonstrate that the employer has an \n     actual practice of making improper deductions, the exemption \n     is lost during the time period in which the improper \n     deductions were made for employees in the same job \n     classification working for the same managers responsible for \n     the actual improper deductions. Employees in different job \n     classifications or who work for different managers do not \n     lose their status as exempt employees. Thus, for example, if \n     a manager at a company facility routinely docks the pay of \n     engineers at that facility for partial-day personal absences, \n     then all engineers at that facility whose pay could have been \n     improperly docked by the manager would lose the exemption; \n     engineers at other facilities or working for other managers, \n     however, would remain exempt.\n       (c) Improper deductions that are either isolated or \n     inadvertent will not result in loss of the exemption for any \n     employees subject to such improper deductions, if the \n     employer reimburses the employees for such improper \n     deductions.\n       (d) If an employer has a clearly communicated policy that \n     prohibits the improper pay deductions specified in Sec. \n     541.602(a) and includes a complaint mechanism, reimburses \n     employees for any improper deductions and makes a good faith \n     commitment to comply in the future, such employer will not \n     lose the exemption for any employees unless the employer \n     willfully violates the policy by continuing to make improper \n     deductions after receiving employee complaints. If an \n     employer fails to reimburse employees for any improper \n     deductions or continues to make improper deductions after \n     receiving employee complaints, the exemption is lost during \n     the time period in which the improper deductions were made \n     for employees in the same job classification working for the \n     same managers responsible for the actual improper deductions. \n     The best evidence of a clearly communicated policy is a \n     written policy that was distributed to employees prior to the \n     improper pay deductions by, for example, providing a copy of \n     the policy to employees at the time of hire, publishing the \n     policy in an employee handbook or publishing the policy on \n     the employer's Intranet.\n       (e) This section shall not be construed in an unduly \n     technical manner so as to defeat the exemption.\n       Sec. 541.604  Minimum guarantee plus extras.\n       (a) An employer may provide an exempt employee with \n     additional compensation without losing the exemption or \n     violating the salary basis requirement, if the employment \n     arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least the minimum \n     weekly-required amount paid on a salary basis. Thus, for \n     example, an exempt employee guaranteed at least $455 each \n     week paid on a salary basis may also receive additional \n     compensation of a one percent commission on sales. An exempt \n     employee also may receive a percentage of the sales or \n     profits of the employer if the employment arrangement also \n     includes a guarantee of at least $455 each week paid on a \n     salary basis. Similarly, the exemption is not lost if an \n     exempt employee who is guaranteed at least $455 each week \n     paid on a salary basis also receives additional compensation \n     based on hours worked for work beyond the normal workweek. \n     Such additional compensation may be paid on any basis (e.g., \n     flat sum, bonus payment, straight-time hourly amount, time \n     and one-half or any other basis), and may include paid time \n     off.\n       (b) An exempt employee's earnings may be computed on an \n     hourly, a daily or a shift basis, without losing the \n     exemption or violating the salary basis requirement, if the \n     employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least \n     the minimum weekly required amount paid on a salary basis \n     regardless of the number of hours, days or shifts worked, and \n     a reasonable relationship exists between the guaranteed \n     amount and the amount actually earned. The reasonable \n     relationship test will be met if the weekly guarantee is \n     roughly equivalent to the employee's usual earnings at the \n     assigned hourly, daily or shift rate for the employee's \n     normal scheduled workweek. Thus, for example, an exempt \n     employee guaranteed compensation of at least $500 for any \n     week in which the employee performs any work, and who \n     normally works four or five shifts each week, may be paid \n     $150 per shift without violating the salary basis \n     requirement. The reasonable relationship requirement applies \n     only if the employee's pay is computed on an hourly, daily or \n     shift basis. It does not apply, for example, to an exempt \n     store manager paid a guaranteed salary of $650 per week who \n     also receives a commission of one-half percent of all sales \n     in the store or five percent of the store's profits, which in \n     some weeks may total as much as, or even more than, the \n     guaranteed salary.\n       Sec. 541.605  Fee basis.\n       (a) Administrative and professional employees may be paid \n     on a fee basis, rather\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\n     than on a salary basis. An employee will be considered to be \n     paid on a ``fee basis'' within the meaning of these \n     regulations if the employee is paid an agreed sum for a \n     single job regardless of the time required for its \n     completion. These payments resemble piecework payments with \n     the important distinction that generally a ``fee'' is paid \n     for the kind of job that is unique rather than for a series \n     of jobs repeated an indefinite number of times and for which \n     payment on an identical basis is made over and over again. \n     Payments based on the number of hours or days worked and not \n     on the accomplishment of a given single task are not \n     considered payments on a fee basis.\n       (b) To determine whether the fee payment meets the minimum \n     amount of salary required for exemption under these \n     regulations, the amount paid to the employee will be tested \n     by determining the time worked on the job and whether the fee \n     payment is at a rate that would amount to at least $455 per \n     week if the employee worked 40 hours. Thus, an artist paid \n     $250 for a picture that took 20 hours to complete meets the \n     minimum salary requirement for exemption since earnings at \n     this rate would yield the artist $500 if 40 hours were \n     worked.\n       Sec. 541.606  Board, lodging or other facilities.\n       (a) To qualify for exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the \n     Act, an employee must earn the minimum salary amount set \n     forth in Sec. 541.600, ``exclusive of board, lodging or other \n     facilities.'' The phrase ``exclusive of board, lodging or \n     other facilities'' means ``free and clear'' or independent of \n     any claimed credit for non-cash items of value that an \n     employer may provide to an employee. Thus, the costs incurred \n     by an employer to provide an employee with board, lodging or \n     other facilities may not count towards the minimum salary \n     amount required for exemption under this part 541. Such \n     separate transactions are not prohibited between employers \n     and their exempt employees, but the costs to employers \n     associated with such transactions may not be considered when \n     determining if an employee has received the full required \n     minimum salary payment.\n       (b) Regulations defining what constitutes ``board, lodging, \n     or other facilities'' are contained in 29 CFR part 531. As \n     described in 29 CFR 531.32, the term ``other facilities'' \n     refers to items similar to board and lodging, such as meals \n     furnished at company restaurants or cafeterias or by \n     hospitals, hotels, or restaurants to their employees; meals, \n     dormitory rooms, and tuition furnished by a college to its \n     student employees; merchandise furnished at company stores or \n     commissaries, including articles of food, clothing, and \n     household effects; housing furnished for dwelling purposes; \n     and transportation furnished to employees for ordinary \n     commuting between their homes and work. [[Good cause for the \n     inclusion of subsection (b): The regulations referenced in \n     this paragraph at 29 CFR 531.29 are not substantive \n     regulations, but are ``interpretive'' regulations which were \n     not incorporated in Part 531 of the CAA regulations adopted \n     in 1996. However, the Board of Directors has determined that, \n     since these particular interpretive regulations are \n     incorporated by reference in the new substantive regulations, \n     employing offices and employees may reference these \n     particular interpretive regulations as part of the new \n     substantive regulations as proposed here.]]\n\n          Subpart H--Definitions and Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n       Sec. 541.700  Primary duty.\n       (a) To qualify for exemption under this part, an employee's \n     ``primary duty'' must be the performance of exempt work. The \n     term ``primary duty'' means the principal, main, major or \n     most important duty that the employee performs. Determination \n     of an employee's primary duty must be based on all the facts \n     in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the \n     character of the employee's job as a whole. Factors to \n     consider when determining the primary duty of an employee \n     include, but are not limited to, the relative importance of \n     the exempt duties as compared with other types of duties; the \n     amount of time spent performing exempt work; the employee's \n     relative freedom from direct supervision; and the \n     relationship between the employee's salary and the wages paid \n     to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work performed \n     by the employee.\n       (b) The amount of time spent performing exempt work can be \n     a useful guide in determining whether exempt work is the \n     primary duty of an employee. Thus, employees who spend more \n     than 50 percent of their time performing exempt work will \n     generally satisfy the primary duty requirement. Time alone, \n     however, is not the sole test, and nothing in this section \n     requires that exempt employees spend more than 50 percent of \n     their time performing exempt work. Employees who do not spend \n     more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt duties \n     may nonetheless meet the primary duty requirement if the \n     other factors support such a conclusion.\n       (c) Thus, for example, assistant managers in a retail \n     establishment who perform exempt executive work such as \n     supervising and directing the work of other employees, \n     ordering merchandise, managing the budget and authorizing \n     payment of bills may have management as their primary duty \n     even if the assistant managers spend more than 50 percent of \n     the time performing nonexempt work such as running the cash \n     register. However, if such assistant managers are closely \n     supervised and earn little more than the nonexempt employees, \n     the assistant managers generally would not satisfy the \n     primary duty requirement.\n       Sec. 541.701  Customarily and regularly. The phrase \n     ``customarily and regularly'' means a frequency that must be \n     greater than occasional but which, of course, may be less \n     than constant. Tasks or work performed ``customarily and \n     regularly'' includes work normally and recurrently performed \n     every workweek; it does not include isolated or one-time \n     tasks.\n       Sec. 541.702  Exempt and nonexempt work. The term ``exempt \n     work'' means all work described in Sec. 541.100, 541.101, \n     541.200, 541.300, 541.301, 541.302, 541.303, 541.304, 541.400 \n     and 541.500, and the activities directly and closely related \n     to such work. All other work is considered ``nonexempt.''\n       Sec. 541.703  Directly and closely related.\n       (a) Work that is ``directly and closely related'' to the \n     performance of exempt work is also considered exempt work. \n     The phrase ``directly and closely related'' means tasks that \n     are related to exempt duties and that contribute to or \n     facilitate performance of exempt work. Thus, ``directly and \n     closely related'' work may include physical tasks and menial \n     tasks that arise out of exempt duties, and the routine work \n     without which the exempt employee's exempt work cannot be \n     performed properly. Work ``directly and closely related'' to \n     the performance of exempt duties may also include \n     recordkeeping; monitoring and adjusting machinery; taking \n     notes; using the computer to create documents or \n     presentations; opening the mail for the purpose of reading it \n     and making decisions; and using a photocopier or fax machine. \n     Work is not ``directly and closely related'' if the work is \n     remotely related or completely unrelated to exempt duties.\n       (b) The following examples further illustrate the type of \n     work that is and is not normally considered as directly and \n     closely related to exempt work: (1) Keeping time, production \n     or sales records for subordinates is work directly and \n     closely related to an exempt executive's function of managing \n     a department and supervising employees. (2) The distribution \n     of materials, merchandise or supplies to maintain control of \n     the flow of and expenditures for such items is directly and \n     closely related to the performance of exempt duties. (3) A \n     supervisor who spot checks and examines the work of \n     subordinates to determine whether they are performing their \n     duties properly, and whether the product is satisfactory, is \n     performing work which is directly and closely related to \n     managerial and supervisory functions, so long as the checking \n     is distinguishable from the work ordinarily performed by a \n     nonexempt inspector. (4) A supervisor who sets up a machine \n     may be engaged in exempt work, depending upon the nature of \n     the industry and the operation. In some cases the setup work, \n     or adjustment of the machine for a particular job, is \n     typically performed by the same employees who operate the \n     machine. Such setup work is part of the production operation \n     and is not exempt. In other cases, the setting up of the work \n     is a highly skilled operation which the ordinary production \n     worker or machine tender typically does not perform. In large \n     plants, non-supervisors may perform such work. However, \n     particularly in small plants, such work may be a regular duty \n     of the executive and is directly and closely related to the \n     executive's responsibility for the work performance of \n     subordinates and for the adequacy of the final product. Under \n     such circumstances, it is exempt work. (5) A department \n     manager in a retail or service establishment who walks about \n     the sales floor observing the work of sales personnel under \n     the employee's supervision to determine the effectiveness of \n     their sales techniques, checks on the quality of customer \n     service being given, or observes customer preferences is \n     performing work which is directly and closely related to \n     managerial and supervisory functions. (6) A business \n     consultant may take extensive notes recording the flow of \n     work and materials through the office or plant of the client; \n     after returning to the office of the employer, the consultant \n     may personally use the computer to type a report and create a \n     proposed table of organization. Standing alone, or separated \n     from the primary duty, such note-taking and typing would be \n     routine in nature. However, because this work is necessary \n     for analyzing the data and making recommendations, the work \n     is directly and closely related to exempt work. While it is \n     possible to assign note-taking and typing to nonexempt \n     employees, and in fact it is frequently the practice to do \n     so, delegating such routine tasks is not required as a \n     condition of exemption. (7) A credit manager who makes and \n     administers the credit policy of the employer, establishes \n     credit limits for customers, authorizes the shipment of \n     orders on credit, and makes decisions on whether to exceed \n     credit limits would be performing work exempt under Sec. \n     541.200. Work that is directly and closely related to these \n     exempt duties may include checking the status of accounts to \n     determine whether the credit limit would be exceeded by the \n     shipment of a new order, removing credit reports from the \n     files for analysis, and writing letters giving credit data \n     and experience to other employers or credit agencies. (8) A \n     traffic manager in charge of planning a company's \n     transportation, including the most economical and quickest \n     routes for shipping merchandise to and from the plant, \n     contracting for common-carrier and other transportation \n     facilities, negotiating with carriers for adjustments for \n     damages to\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\n     merchandise, and making the necessary rearrangements \n     resulting from delays, damages or irregularities in transit, \n     is performing exempt work. If the employee also spends part \n     of the day taking telephone orders for local deliveries, such \n     order-taking is a routine function and is not directly and \n     closely related to the exempt work. (9) An example of work \n     directly and closely related to exempt professional duties is \n     a chemist performing menial tasks such as cleaning a test \n     tube in the middle of an original experiment, even though \n     such menial tasks can be assigned to laboratory assistants. \n     (10) A teacher performs work directly and closely related to \n     exempt duties when, while taking students on a field trip, \n     the teacher drives a school van or monitors the students' \n     behavior in a restaurant.\n       Sec. 541.704  Use of manuals. The use of manuals, \n     guidelines or other established procedures containing or \n     relating to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial or \n     other similarly complex matters that can be understood or \n     interpreted only by those with advanced or specialized \n     knowledge or skills does not preclude exemption under section \n     13(a)(1) of the Act or the regulations in this part. Such \n     manuals and procedures provide guidance in addressing \n     difficult or novel circumstances and thus use of such \n     reference material would not affect an employee's exempt \n     status. The section 13(a)(1) exemptions are not available, \n     however, for employees who simply apply well-established \n     techniques or procedures described in manuals or other \n     sources within closely prescribed limits to determine the \n     correct response to an inquiry or set of circumstances.\n       Sec. 541.705  Trainees. The executive, administrative, \n     professional, outside sales and computer employee exemptions \n     do not apply to employees training for employment in an \n     executive, administrative, professional, outside sales or \n     computer employee capacity who are not actually performing \n     the duties of an executive, administrative, professional, \n     outside sales or computer employee.\n       Sec. 541.706  Emergencies.\n       (a) An exempt employee will not lose the exemption by \n     performing work of a normally nonexempt nature because of the \n     existence of an emergency. Thus, when emergencies arise that \n     threaten the safety of employees, a cessation of operations \n     or serious damage to the employer's property, any work \n     performed in an effort to prevent such results is considered \n     exempt work.\n       (b) An ``emergency'' does not include occurrences that are \n     not beyond control or for which the employer can reasonably \n     provide in the normal course of business. Emergencies \n     generally occur only rarely, and are events that the employer \n     cannot reasonably anticipate.\n       (c) The following examples illustrate the distinction \n     between emergency work considered exempt work and routine \n     work that is not exempt work: (1) A mine superintendent who \n     pitches in after an explosion and digs out workers who are \n     trapped in the mine is still a bona fide executive. (2) \n     Assisting nonexempt employees with their work during periods \n     of heavy workload or to handle rush orders is not exempt \n     work. (3) Replacing a nonexempt employee during the first day \n     or partial day of an illness may be considered exempt \n     emergency work depending on factors such as the size of the \n     establishment and of the executive's department, the nature \n     of the industry, the consequences that would flow from the \n     failure to replace the ailing employee immediately, and the \n     feasibility of filling the employee's place promptly. (4) \n     Regular repair and cleaning of equipment is not emergency \n     work, even when necessary to prevent fire or explosion; \n     however, repairing equipment may be emergency work if the \n     breakdown of or damage to the equipment was caused by \n     accident or carelessness that the employer could not \n     reasonably anticipate.\n       Sec. 541.707  Occasional tasks. Occasional, infrequently \n     recurring tasks that cannot practicably be performed by \n     nonexempt employees, but are the means for an exempt employee \n     to properly carry out exempt functions and responsibilities, \n     are considered exempt work. The following factors should be \n     considered in determining whether such work is exempt work: \n     Whether the same work is performed by any of the exempt \n     employee's subordinates; practicability of delegating the \n     work to a nonexempt employee; whether the exempt employee \n     performs the task frequently or occasionally; and existence \n     of an industry practice for the exempt employee to perform \n     the task.\n       Sec. 541.708  Combination exemptions. Employees who perform \n     a combination of exempt duties as set forth in the \n     regulations in this part for executive, administrative, \n     professional, outside sales and computer employees may \n     qualify for exemption. Thus, for example, an employee whose \n     primary duty involves a combination of exempt administrative \n     and exempt executive work may qualify for exemption. In other \n     words, work that is exempt under one section of this part \n     will not defeat the exemption under any other section.\n       Sec. 541.709  Motion picture producing industry. The \n     requirement that the employee be paid ``on a salary basis'' \n     does not apply to an employee in the motion picture producing \n     industry who is compensated at a base rate of at least $695 a \n     week (exclusive of board, lodging, or other facilities). \n     Thus, an employee in this industry who is otherwise exempt \n     under subparts B, C or D of this part, and who is employed at \n     a base rate of at least $695 a week is exempt if paid a \n     proportionate amount (based on a week of not more than 6 \n     days) for any week in which the employee does not work a full \n     workweek for any reason. Moreover, an otherwise exempt \n     employee in this industry qualifies for exemption if the \n     employee is employed at a daily rate under the following \n     circumstances: (a) The employee is in a job category for \n     which a weekly base rate is not provided and the daily base \n     rate would yield at least $695 if 6 days were worked; or (b) \n     The employee is in a job category having a weekly base rate \n     of at least $695 and the daily base rate is at least one-\n     sixth of such weekly base rate.\n       Sec. 541.710  Employees of Public Agencies. (a) An employee \n     of a public agency who otherwise meets the salary basis \n     requirements of section 541.602 shall not be disqualified \n     from exemption under sections 541.100, 541.200, 541.300 or \n     541.400 on the basis that such employee is paid according to \n     a pay system established by statute, ordinance, or \n     regulation, or by a policy or practice established pursuant \n     to principles of public accountability, under which the \n     employee accrues personal leave and sick leave and which \n     requires the public agency employee's pay to be reduced or \n     such employee to be placed on leave without pay for absences \n     for personal reasons or because of illness or injury of less \n     than one work-day when accrued leave is not used by an \n     employee because: (1) Permission for its use has not been \n     sought or has been sought or denied; (2) Accrued leave has \n     been exhausted; (3) The employee chooses to use leave without \n     pay. (b) Deductions from the pay of an employee of a public \n     agency for absences due to a budget required furlough shall \n     not disqualify the employee from being paid on a salary basis \n     except on the workweek in which the furlough occurs and for \n     which the employee's pay is accordingly reduced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9927-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9927-S9930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, throughout our country's history there \nhave been many debates in the Congress over the use, conservation, and \nprotection of our natural resources. These debates have resulted in \nlandmark policies, such as the Louisiana Purchase, the Homestead Act, \nand the establishment of the world's first national park, Yellowstone, \nin 1872.\n  Natural resource and environmental issues are inherently complex and \noften controversial, for they involve tradeoffs in which many diverse \ninterests have a stake. There is one interest that cannot speak for \nitself and relies upon the vision of others; the interest of future \ngenerations. Teddy Roosevelt said it best, it seems to me, in his 1916 \nbook, A Book-Lover's Holidays in the Open, where he castigates those \n``short-sighted men who in their greed and selfishness will, if \npermitted, rob our country of half its charm by their reckless \nextermination of all useful and beautiful wild things''. He goes on to \nsay, ``Our duty to the whole, including the unborn generations, bids us \nrestrain an unprincipled present-day minority from wasting the heritage \nof these unborn generations. The movement for the conservation of wild \nlife and the larger movement for the conservation of all our natural \nresources are essentially democratic in spirit, purpose, and method.''\n  It is in this spirit of our moral obligation to the future--to those \nwho, in Teddy Roosevelt's memorable phrase, are ``within the womb of \ntime''--that I wish to salute the 40th anniversary of the Wilderness \nAct of 1964. I am pleased to lend my support to this bipartisan \nresolution honoring the milestone legislation preserving our Nation's \nrare and spectacular wild places.\n  Arizona has the good fortune to have numerous preserved wilderness \nareas, thanks to this law. In fact, more than 4,500,000 acres have been \npreserved in 90 wilderness areas. These range from the Cabeza Prieta \nWilderness of more than 800,000 acres, to the 2,040 acre Baboquivari \nPeak Wilderness, an extraordinary area designated in 1990. From our \ndesert expanses to the heights of 12,643-foot Humphrey's Peak, the \nhighest point in Arizona, protected within the Kachina Peaks \nWilderness, Arizona is not only one of America's fastest-growing \nstates, but also a state in which we preserve and treasure our \nwilderness heritage.\n  In 1936, the great forester and wilderness champion, Bob Marshall, \nspoke of the luxury--a privilege--we Americans have. He commented that \nAmericans can enjoy ``a twofold civilization--the mechanized, \ncomfortable, easy civilization of twentieth-century modernity, and the \npeaceful timelessness of the wilderness where vast forests germinate \nand flourish and die and rot and grow again without any relationship to \nthe ambitions and interferences of man.''\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\n  In spite of the environmental challenges that face our country and \nthe world today, I am very grateful for the vision of past leaders that \nenacted this law to ensure that those who inhabit our nation many \ngenerations into the future will be able to experience wilderness in \ntheir lives, as we do today. As we celebrate the protection of existing \nand additional wilderness areas under this historic law, we follow our \nmost noble and nonpartisan traditions of national resource \nconservation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe following statement of Stewart Udall, one of our Nation's \nconservation leaders and the Secretary of the Interior in the Kennedy \nand Johnson administrations, presented at an event on September 19, \n2004, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks by Former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall--Wilderness Act \n        Commemorative Dinner, Washington, DC, September 19, 2004\n\n       I am honored and delighted to be here tonight with John \n     Dingell and Gaylord Nelson and Bob Byrd. I was running for \n     Congress 50 years ago right now, and I came in the door with \n     John Dingell and Bob Byrd had been there two years, and they \n     considered him a ``hick,''--he played the fiddle, he loved \n     the folk music of his people and now he is the conscience of \n     the Senate.\n       If you want to know why I say that, you will buy his book, \n     ``Losing America,'' and find out what his message is. John \n     Dingell, you were given too little credit tonight. The \n     National Environmental Policy Act would probably not have \n     been passed if it had not been for John Dingell. What you \n     don't know is Wayne Aspinell thought it was a crazy idea, and \n     John Dingell said ``if he doesn't want it, then I will pick \n     it up.'' And he carried the mail through the House. So I want \n     to say something--I'm on a ``lecture tour'' this evening. \n     There was something about that time, and John Dingell and I \n     discussed it--the 60s into the 70s was called a golden age of \n     sorts. One of the things that comes to my mind as I go back \n     there is the way you saw young Congressmen and Senators who \n     were pretty raw in the beginning, but they had open minds and \n     they grew and they developed new convictions and they \n     developed new horizons. One example was John and Robert \n     Kennedy--changing before your eyes. And John Dingell and Bob \n     Byrd are examples of this, and my brother--yes, my brother. \n     It did not take him long to enlarge his mind and encompass \n     it. And that is a great gift--to be open minded and have the \n     capacity to grow. It's a very great gift. And can we see \n     members of congress now, too many of them that come in with \n     fixed ideologies and fixed views, and they will stay for \n     10 or 25 years, and when they leave they have the very \n     same views. They haven't changed a damn thing. It's \n     pathetic.\n       So now a lot of it's been covered, and I only have time to \n     hit a few high notes because I promised Mike Matz (executive \n     director of the Campaign for America's Wilderness) that I \n     would give out of my faulty memory some of the highlights of \n     the Wilderness bill. And this is an extraordinary story. The \n     wilderness idea--it originated here in this country. The \n     national park idea originated in this country --the idea of \n     setting aside areas. And Bob Marshall, Aldo Leopold, and a \n     little group came up with this, and it was thought to be a \n     far-out and crazy idea, and it culminated with the \n     introduction of the wilderness bill.\n       One person left out was Humphrey, John Saylor--what a great \n     man he was. Thomas Kuchel, Republican from California was \n     one. And he shortly became the deputy leader--the whip to \n     Everett Dirksen, and the reason we got an overwhelming \n     bipartisan vote, in the Senate, was Tom Kuchel. Tom Kuchel, \n     so give him credit for it. What a great, great man he was. To \n     show you the spirit of bipartisanship, we worked on Point \n     Reyes together. When I went to his office, he'd say, ``Hi \n     Stewie, what do you want today?'' And that's the way it was \n     in that period. But the Wilderness Bill--Howard Zahniser--Mr. \n     Zahniser--the man was a saint. He rewrote and touched up that \n     bill 60 times over a period of 8 years. Every time Aspinall \n     raised a new argument, he'd work on a little language and \n     tried to offset it. He was truly a saintly person--a poet, a \n     lover of Thoreau, a wonderful man.\n       But when the wilderness bill got off the ground, and too \n     much we, all of us, when it's all over, like to take credit. \n     I have been given more than my share tonight. Two persons I \n     would single out are President John F. Kennedy and Senator \n     Clinton Anderson of New Mexico. Clint Anderson had been as a \n     young insurance man, a personal friend of Aldo Leopold \n     in Albuquerque, and when he became chairman of the \n     Committee after the 1960 election, and Kennedy was \n     president. I didn't tell Kennedy what to do. Clint \n     Anderson went to the White House and said, ``Kennedy \n     didn't campaign on wilderness, I can't find anything in \n     the campaign.'' He said put in your message to Congress on \n     conservation--Presidents used to send up such messages, if \n     they had a conservation program--a call for the enactment \n     of a wilderness bill along the lines of Senate bill five--\n     his bill. Kennedy put it in, and that electrified the \n     country--to have a call like that. And in July the bill \n     went to the floor of the Senate, and I'll tell you I was \n     startled. I was startled, Senator Byrd. The vote was 78 to \n     12, and people all over the country--the \n     conservationists--suddenly began to arouse and see how \n     much power they have.\n       We give too much credit in my view--I was a Congressman--to \n     members of Congress. Lyndon Johnson was great at that--``the \n     Congress, they did it''. They enact laws, yes. But there was \n     an upsurge, an uplifting of people. Conservation had been put \n     on the shelf after Pearl Harbor and then there was a Cold War \n     and Kennedy issued a call for national seashores and we got \n     started on 14 of them. Some of them passed later on, but I \n     have to say what made it all possible was a bipartisanship \n     and affection between the members of the old generation--my \n     generation. We were depression kids, we fought the war, we \n     believed in mutual respect. That was what made it so \n     wonderful in those days. And that spirit carried forward. \n     Richard Nixon was a damn good conservation president.\n       I like metaphors, and I have likened what happened--we just \n     saw the Olympics--to a relay race, because the work and \n     conservation in those days was never finished. There was a \n     pipeline. Heavens, it took Gaylord Nelson--because he wanted \n     the people to accept it--12 years to do the Apostle Islands \n     National Seashore. It took Bill Hart 10 years to do Sleeping \n     Bear Dunes in Michigan. And this meant that when we came, and \n     a different party won the White House, you carried the baton. \n     I am not sure Nixon understood in the beginning, but they \n     took it and they ran with it. Russell Train, Nat Reed--\n     those wonderful people who put that ad in the newspaper \n     last month that said ``Come back to the mainstream, come \n     back to the main stream.'' And Gerald Ford carried it on, \n     and Jimmy Carter. And then--no names mentioned--but a \n     Secretary of the Interior when 1981 began, refused. In \n     fact, he said--and I never understood where he was coming \n     from--we've been going in the wrong direction for the last \n     20 years, so he wouldn't take the baton. And it has been \n     on the floor ever since.\n       The bipartisanship by these five presidents was ended, and \n     I want to say because there is so much doublespeak these \n     days--don't let a president or his people say because he \n     signed a wilderness bill that he is for wilderness. Does he \n     issue a call for more wilderness? That's the test. That's the \n     test. The Land and Water Conservation Fund--oh I can take \n     some credit on that, but I won't--too long. Do you know, 10 \n     billion dollars in 1960 dollars, Senator Byrd, went into that \n     program and half of it went to the states and they matched \n     it, and almost 40 thousand projects--cities, counties, open \n     space, playgrounds--boy, do we need playgrounds with this \n     plague of obesity that is claiming this country. We ought to \n     go back to that program.\n       Well that's enough, I guess, and you know how strongly I \n     feel. The fight is not over, as everyone has said tonight. \n     And we may have gaps and we have an ebb and flow. I'd like to \n     believe, I am a troubled optimist, but there will be a flow \n     again in terms of wilderness preservation. And I like to end, \n     and my vision is gone so I have to memorize things. I can't \n     use notes, I just blabber away. Congressman Aspinall--from \n     Colorado--was an honorable man, as John Dingell and I have \n     discussed. He was strong-headed, but an honorable man. Very \n     stubborn and he could be dictatorial. He wouldn't even let \n     his committee consider the bill--no hearings--no bill \n     reported. John Saylor would say, ``Wayne, you cannot get away \n     with this forever,'' and we tried to persuade him. Where was \n     he? He said to me once, Stuart--I was one of his boys, I \n     trained under him, he taught you a lot of things--and he \n     said people that don't understand me, don't understand \n     that my congressional district is a mining district. It \n     had been a mining district. He was a great champion of the \n     American Mining Congress. He regarded a wilderness bill as \n     a lock up. That was the argument that Howard Zanhiser had \n     to work against all the time. He said, ``Stuart, you may \n     get a bill from out of my committee, but you might not \n     recognize it.'' And so it came to a compromise. And he and \n     Clinton Anderson were two old bulls that ended up hating \n     and distrusting each other. And Anderson's bill had all of \n     the elements, the framework, and the language about how \n     you identified a wilderness bill and how you passed a \n     wilderness bill. And Anderson put in 50 million acres of \n     lands that the Forest Service largely had already \n     identified. Aspinall cut it back to nine. And they made \n     the compromise because Anderson had to give in if he \n     wanted to get a wilderness bill. So it was cut way back. \n     Aspinall thought it might be true today--but not in the \n     next 20 or 30 years--that if every bill had to pass \n     individually through the Senate and House, that \n     Congressmen who held the views that he did, would not want \n     a wilderness in their area because it was locking up very \n     valuable resources. And so that is the way it played out. \n     And the wilderness bill--the essential elements of the \n     wilderness bill--were there when the bill was passed. And \n     this was a great moment for the country. What happened was \n     the citizens all over the country--in the West and the \n     East, the Congressmen and the Senators got behind \n     wilderness bills, and that is why we have the 110 million \n     acres today.\n\n[[Page S9929]]\n\n       I have to say one final thing about Mo Udall, my brother, \n     and this is getting back, Senator Byrd, to your book because \n     the whole democratic process as far as I can see, is gone in \n     the House of Representatives. It's gone. We have another man \n     that says no bill will go out of his committee unless it \n     meets my personal standards. What kind of democracy is that? \n     Mo Udall was committed to the idea--he wrote a book, it's \n     been thrown away, ``The Job of A Congressman.'' A bill is \n     introduced, you have hearings--everybody that wants to be \n     heard can be heard--you have field hearings, you mark up a \n     bill, the committees work their will--if it can survive \n     the committee it goes to the floor of the House and the \n     House works its will. That's democracy, and that's what he \n     was committed to, and that is gone now. Things are tucked \n     into appropriation bills now. A democracy has been watered \n     down and disappeared, and that is one of the things \n     Senator Byrd's book is about.\n       So let's bear that in mind, but don't give up. Don't give \n     out--the fight goes on. I'm finally going to end, I'm sorry, \n     I got carried away. The case for wilderness was made against \n     the lock up argument by Clinton Anderson, who said \n     ``wilderness is an anchor to windward.'' Knowing it is there, \n     we can go about our business of managing our resources wisely \n     and not be a people in despair, ransacking our public lands \n     for the last barrel of oil, the last board of timber, the \n     last blade of grass, the last tank of water. That was Clint \n     Anderson's answer to the lock up argument.\n       Wallace Stenger, as usual, caught the spirit in that \n     wonderful essay he wrote in 1960. He said, ``We need this \n     wild country even if we do no more than go to the edge and \n     look in. We need it as a symbol of our sanity as creatures as \n     part of the geography of hope.'' And Ansel Adams, the great \n     photographer said it in a different way, and I once said, \n     ``Ansel, can I apply your statement to the Grand Canyon and \n     Yosemite?'' ``Of course,'' he said Ansel was writing home \n     after his first trip to New Mexico and he used these words: \n     All is very beautiful and magical here. He is talking about \n     the landscape. ``All is beautiful and magical here.'' A \n     quality one cannot describe. He said, ``The sky and the land \n     is so enormous and that the detail is so precise and \n     exquisite,'' the eye of the photographer--``that wherever you \n     are, there is a golden glow and everything is sideways under \n     you and over you, and the clocks stopped long ago.''\n       Keep up the fight, and good night.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this month our Nation celebrates the \n40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act. To commemorate the anniversary \nof this landmark legislation, I want to take a few moments to highlight \nthe historic importance of this law, and remind us of some of the work \nremaining to be done.\n  When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law \non September 3, 1964, it became our unambiguous national policy ``to \nsecure for the American people of present and future generations the \nbenefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.''\n  The legislation empowered those of us in Congress, with the ultimate \napproval of the President, to designate Federal lands for protection as \npart of our national wilderness preservation system. It was a \ntremendous accomplishment, immediately placing some 1.2 million acres \nof wilderness in 13 areas on national forest lands throughout my home \nState of California under statutory protection. And it protected \nanother 8 million acres of land in other States.\n  But that was only the start. Over the ensuing four decades, \nCalifornians have welcomed acts of Congress that have expanded most of \nthose initial areas. Today, those original 13 wilderness areas have \ngrown to 1.7 million acres of wilderness firmly protected by statute.\n  The Wilderness Act also required that numerous other areas of Federal \nland be studied, with local public hearings, leading to Presidential \nrecommendations for additional wilderness areas. Congress has enacted \nthose proposals in California, beginning with the great San Rafael \nWilderness near Santa Barbara in 1969--the first area added to the \nnational wilderness system after the Wilderness Act became law.\n  Another early study focused on the 50,000-acre Ventana Primitive Area \nin the mountains along the central California coast above Big Sur--an \narea the U.S. Forest Service preserved in the 1930s. The study led \nCongress to establish the 98,000-acre Ventana Wilderness in 1969, with \nthe leadership, among others, of California Senator Thomas Kuchel.\n  Since that time we have revisited this area in four additional laws, \nmost recently when we passed and President George W. Bush signed a law \nin late 2002 further expanding this wilderness. As a result, the \nVentana Wilderness now covers 240,000 acres.\n  Beyond the original Wilderness Act study areas, our California \ndelegation has listened carefully to the diverse voices of the people \nof California. Year after year, we receive proposals for wilderness \nprotection that come to us from ordinary citizens and organizations in \nour State, most often working in close consultation with the \nFederal land managing agencies involved and our State government.\n\n  Many of these proposals have been enacted, particularly for lands \nadministered by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement. As a result of all this work, California now boasts 130 \nwilderness areas comprising 14 million acres.\n  These California wilderness areas offer a diverse spectrum of \nlandscapes and ecosystems, recreational opportunities and scenic \nvistas, from the high peaks and forested valleys of the Sierra, to the \nextraordinarily wild deserts that Senator Alan Cranston and I fought to \nprotect in the California Desert Protection Act of 1994--one of my \nproudest achievements for the people of California.\n  In celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act, I \nparticularly stress that the work of preserving California's wilderness \nheritage has always been a bipartisan endeavor. In our State, we enjoy \nwilderness areas found in the congressional districts of both Democrats \nand Republicans, protected in laws signed by every President since this \nprogram began 40 years ago--Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, \nGerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill \nClinton, and George W. Bush.\n  The act itself became law after 8 years of congressional debate. \nEndorsed by the Eisenhower administration and the administrations of \nPresidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, the act was shaped by \npractical-minded people, mostly westerners. It is, as Senator Kuchel \nsaid during those Senate debates, ``reasonable . . . not extreme in any \ndegree.''\n  Senator Kuchel insisted that the law not conflict with State water \nrights and that the act respect existing mining claims and established \ngrazing uses. At the same time, Senator Kuchel reminded his colleagues \nthat protecting wilderness watersheds is key to abundant, clean water \nsupplies--the lifeblood of California's ranching and agricultural \nsector, our thriving cities and towns, and the economic well-being of \nour entire Nation.\n  Still, there is more wilderness to be protected and more work to be \ndone. These days, Federal lands that deserve a fair look by Congress \nare, in some cases, under threat from other kinds of use that are \ninconsistent with the preservation of wilderness. This is the kind of \ncareful balancing Congress undertakes as we make these decisions.\n  This Congress has a great opportunity to preserve even more stunning \nwilderness by completing action on the Northern California Coastal Wild \nHeritage Wilderness Act that I have cosponsored with my colleague \nSenator Barbara Boxer. This bill has the strong and effective support \nof Representative Mike Thompson, in whose district every acre of its \nproposed wilderness areas is situated, and the support of numerous \ncosponsors, including California Representatives from both sides of the \naisle.\n\n  Among the 300,000 acres this priority bill would protect is the \n42,000-acre King Range Wilderness, a wild expanse on our California \n``lost coast'' south of Eureka. Many of the proposals in this bill are \nbased on agency recommendations or proposals by local citizens like the \nHumboldt County nurse who has been working to save the King Range for \n20 years. These areas enjoy strong support, as wilderness, from local \nbusiness owners in the area, from hunting and fishing enthusiasts, from \ndedicated backpackers to young parents hiking or backpacking to \nintroduce their children or their grandchildren to nature at its most \nwild.\n  Similarly worthy, bipartisan proposals await action for wilderness \nsponsored by our colleagues from New Mexico and Washington. And no less \nworthy is the proposed wilderness area designation for an area on the \nCaribbean National Forest in Puerto Rico--a wilderness area proposed by \nthe U.S. Forest Service more than three decades ago.\n\n[[Page S9930]]\n\n  As we consider these wilderness proposals, we can generally rely upon \nexisting standards and interpretations of the Wilderness Act. Thanks to \nour predecessors we have a wealth of guidance in the legislative \nhistory of the Wilderness Act and the more than 100 laws Congress has \nenacted since to protect additional lands.\n  Now, as we celebrate the 40th year of the Wilderness Act, the \npreservation of our wilderness has never been more important. \nPopulation growth, especially in the Western United States, is placing \nincreased pressure on our public lands. That is why it was so critical \nthat our leaders acted 40 years ago and why it is urgent that we \ncontinue to preserve our Nation's natural treasures today.\n  John Muir once said, ``Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, \nplaces to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength \nto body and soul alike.''\n  For 40 years, the Wilderness Act has entrusted Congress and the \nAmerican people with the means to preserve that beauty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9930-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NOTICE OF CHANGE IN SENATE SERVICE PIN REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

In 1968 Congress voted to name the week including September 15 \nand 16 National Hispanic Heritage Week, and in 1988 Congress passed \nPublic Law 100-402, expanding National Hispanic Heritage Week to a 30-\nday celebration.\n  Hispanic individuals have made immeasurable contributions to America \nin many fields. Dr. Severo Ochoa discovered RNA, Ribonucleic acid, and \nas a result won the Nobel Prize and set the foundations of many of \ntoday's medical technologies. Cesar Chaves made great strides in \nworker's rights, and more than three dozen Hispanic Americans have been \nawarded the Medal of Honor for their military service to our country.\n  America, the great melting pot, has always taken pride in her \ndiversity. Over 10,000 of my constituents are of Hispanic origin, and \napproximately 40 million Hispanics call America home, making them the \nUnited States' largest minority group.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nachievements of Antoine Pettway on the occasion of his being honored by \nhis high school, Wilcox Central High School, in Camden, AL. During \nceremonies for Mr. Pettway, the Mayor of Camden, Henrietta Blackmon, \npresented him with a key to the city and a series of speakers praised \ntheir native son for his skills on the basketball court and for his\n\n[[Page S9931]]\n\nstrengths as a person. I have watched his career unfold with special \ninterest because I too went to school in the small town of Camden. \nWhile the community is not a wealthy one, it has produced many \noutstanding young people, and Antoine is one of the most noteworthy.\n  Antoine Pettway was born on November 13, 1982, to Joseph Pettway and \nLinda Crawford. Growing up in the small, rural town of Alberta, AL, \nAntoine ate, slept, and breathed basketball, when he was not working on \nhis father's cattle farm or in his grandfather's country store. Pettway \nwas a high school basketball standout averaging 24.3 points, 5.2 \nrebounds, and 6.7 assists, per game. Subsequently, with his athletic \nskills and strong leadership on and off the court, Antoine was able to \nhelp clinch State championship titles in 1998 for Keith High School, \nand in 2000 for Wilcox Central High School. Antoine was not only known \nfor his athletic success, but also his academic success. He was a 4.0 \nstudent in high school and Salutatorian of his graduating class.\n  Pettway received athletic scholarships from Jacksonville State, \nLouisiana Tech, Alabama State, and Alabama A, but his heart belonged \nto the University of Alabama. Standing at only 6 feet, he was not \nnoticed by the Tide's coach, Mark Gottfried, until the State tournament \nand after all scholarship positions had been filled for the upcoming \nseason. However, Antoine was approached by Coach Gottfried and asked to \nwalk on as a freshman. So, with the help of his father and an academic \nscholarship, Antoine Pettway entered the University of Alabama in the \nfall of 2000 and joined the Crimson Tide basketball team as a walk-on \nfor the 2000-2001 season.\n  Antoine, determined to prove to Coach Gottfried that he belonged, \naveraged 2.9 points, 1.6 assists, and 1.1 rebounds per game during the \n29 games he played his freshman year. His best game was a stand-out \nperformance at Ole Miss in which he scored 19 points. His energy and \nskills on the court earned Pettway a scholarship in July of 2002.\n  During his sophomore year, Antoine became a well-recognized figure on \nthe Crimson Tide's basketball team not only for his charisma and \nathletic ability, but also his bright red, shiny sneakers. They became \nhis trademark. His ``ruby slippers'' earned him fame around the \ncountry, but he is probably most remembered that year for his lay-up at \nthe buzzer that gave Alabama a 65-64 victory over Florida, clinching \nthe Tide's first Southeastern Conference title since 1987.\n  In the 2002-2003 season, Pettway started 10 games and averaged 6.3 \npoints, 2.5 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game. He was ranked 7th in \nthe SEC in assists to turnover ratio and shot 81.8 percent from the \nfree throw line, making 36 of 44. His hard work and awesome talent was \nrecognized by the basketball community when he was awarded the MVP of \nthe Basketball Hall of Fame Tipoff Classic.\n  Antoine remained the heart and soul of the Crimson Tide's basketball \nteam through his senior year and led his team to the Elite Eight of the \nNCAA Tournament, a plateau that Alabama basketball had never reached \nbefore. He was the starting point guard and averaged 9.38 points, 3.62 \nrebounds, and 3.31 assists per game.\n  Antoine's dedication and extraordinary work ethic can be seen not \nonly on the basketball court, but also in the classroom. In his senior \nyear, he was named Academic All-Southeastern Conference. To make the \nhonor roll, an athlete must be a sophomore or higher in academic \nstanding and have a 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher grade point average. \nHe graduated from the University of Alabama in May of 2004 with a \ndegree in Health Care Management.\n  Most recently, Antoine Pettway was selected as the World Basketball \nAssociation's ``Rookie of the Year'' and was named to the 2nd Team All-\nWBA All-Star Team. He helped lead his team, the Kentucky Reach, the \nfirst Christian-based professional basketball team, to an 11-9 record \nand averaged 4.6 assists and 12.7 points per game. He is ranked second \nin the league in assists and 14th in scoring.\n  The people of Camden and Wilcox county are proud of his basketball \nsuccess, and they are even more proud of his leadership, his academic \nachievements, and his character. Indeed, Antoine Pettway's \naccomplishments on and off the court have inspired young and old to \nstrive for excellence. He has high ideals and is true to his faith. The \npeople of the State of Alabama are proud to call him their native son, \nand I wish him best of luck with his future endeavors. Whatever the \nfuture holds for this Wilcox County native son, it will be bright \nbecause he has his priorities straight.\n  I am proud to recognize the accomplishments of a great American and \nAlabamian, and a wonderful representative of Wilcox County, Antoine \nPettway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9931-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POLISH DAILY NEWS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Dziennik \nPolski, or the Polish Daily News, one of Michigan's oldest and honored \npublications, on its 100th anniversary. The Polish Daily News can be \nproud of its dedication to generations of Polish Americans and its \nsupport of American traditions and ideals. The Polish Daily News has \nworked together with other organizations in the greater Detroit area to \nhelp build strong and effective communities, which has given rise to a \ndiverse and vibrant socioeconomic region in southeast Michigan.\n  Founded in 1904 by a small group of community members, the Polish \nDaily News was housed in a building on the south side of Canfield east \nof Riopelle. This was home to the paper until the 1960s when the \noffices and print production moved to a location on Van Dyke in \nDetroit. A third and fourth move relocated the newspaper to two \naddresses on Joseph Campau, with the last one in Hamtramck. As \nDetroit's primary Polish newspaper serving the new immigrants who began \nto settle in what was becoming the Nation's Motor City, the Polish \nDaily News played a vital role in building a strong Polonia that was \ncommitted to full participation in American life. The paper supported a \ncohesive community that encouraged its members to strive for \naccomplishments that reflected their shared values of a deep commitment \nto family, faith, hard work, as well as the American ideals of \ndemocracy and freedom. With a circulation of 30,000 during the 1940s \nand 1950s, the Polish Daily News kept its readership informed about the \nstruggle for Poland's independence from Soviet oppression while \nadvocating for a future democratic Poland and strong U.S.-Poland \nrelations.\n  Today as the Polish Weekly, the newspaper continues the heritage of \npromoting both a strong Polonia and citizen participation in the life \nof the United States. The Polish Daily News is celebrating its 100th \nanniversary of serving the Polish-American community of greater Detroit \non Saturday, October 2, 2004. Families, friends, community leaders, and \nelected officials will gather at the American Polish Cultural Center in \nTroy to pay tribute to the important efforts of the Polish Daily News \norganization which has helped to promote community life and strengthen \nPolish-American pride throughout the 100 years of its existence.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in also congratulating publisher \nBruno Nowicki and the editors and staff, along with the community \nsupporters and many friends of the Polish Daily News/Polish Weekly on \nthis great milestone. I am proud to recognize their record of service \nto the Polish-American community and their respected standing among all \nthe people of Michigan.

Mr. President, earlier today, my State of \nOklahoma, as well as the Nation, lost a true friend of education.\n  Ed Hennessee, a longtime resident of Lawton, OK died doing what he \nloved best--advocating for children attending federally connected \nschool districts.\n  Ed served the Lawton Public Schools in a variety of capacities for \nmany years retiring as assistant superintendent for business in 1995.\n  While in that capacity he fought for a program that I have come to \nchampion--Impact Aid.\n\n[[Page S9932]]\n\n  The program's origin was rooted in Oklahoma in the late 1940s and \nearly 1950s, when Oscar Rose, superintendent of the Mid-Del Schools and \nothers convinced Congress that the Federal Government had a \nresponsibility and an obligation to provide assistance to school \ndistricts serving children whose parents were employed by the Federal \nGovernment or the military. Ed Hennessee continued that legacy right up \nto the time of his death this morning.\n  During his long education career, Ed received many honors, including \nbeing named the State of Oklahoma Teacher of the Year.\n  However, he was most proud of the fact that he was helping children.\n  He truly understood that education is about giving children an \nopportunity to be successful. One of his most frequent statements was \n``Teach a child to love to learn, then you will be successful teaching \nthem any school subject.'' Ed was a success because he loved learning.\n  He also loved helping others have the opportunity to learn, and, \nthankfully, he taught many the importance of using their gifts and \ntalents to help our children. Although he retired from the Lawton \nPublic Schools in the mid-1990s, he continued serving federally \nconnected schools. As executive director of the National Council of \nImpacted Schools, he continued to work for both Oklahoma federally \nconnected schools, along with other schools throughout the nation.\n  He visited my office at least twice a year to talk about ways to \nimprove the program. He was an expert on the intricacies of the often \ncomplex and confusing details of Impact Aid and freely offered that \nexpertise. When my staff or I needed information about how schools in \nOklahoma and around the country would be affected by the level of \nfunding appropriated for Impact Aid, Ed knew the answers. He was an \ninnovator for Impact Aid.\n  For example, S. 777 was a bill I developed from one of his ideas. Ed \nwas in Washington this weekend to advocate for the Impact Aid program \nwhen he became ill. He was doing what he had been doing for more than a \nquarter of a century--- asking Congress to fulfill its obligation to \nschool districts all across this country that are impacted by a federal \npresence.\n  Prior to Ed's retirement, he served on the Board of Directors of the \nNational Association of Federally Impacted Schools and served as its \nPresident from 1991 to 1993. He never stopped putting the needs of \nfederally connected students at the top of his priority list. His \npresence will indeed be missed--not only by those who knew him well, \nsuch as his dear wife Edna who was always by his side--but also by \nthose who enjoy the fruits of his labor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9932-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF HIS EXCELLENCY H.E.

His efforts to \nfoster better understanding among America, Qatar and the Arab world \nthrough support of important initiatives in the American Arab community \nare appreciated by many. His respect for diplomacy has been \ndemonstrated throughout his exemplary career which spans more than 25 \nyears.\n  Upon graduation from Western Michigan University, Ambassador Al-Dafa \nbegan his career as a diplomatic attache at the Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs, Doha. While serving in his second assignment as First \nSecretary at the Embassy of the State of Qatar in Washington, DC, he \nearned a master's degree in international public policy from the School \nof Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in 1979. \nWith his solid understanding of America and its people, Ambassador Al-\nDafa has been energetic and consistent in his commitment to improving \nbilateral relations.\n  Ambassador Al-Dafa has served in his post as Ambassador of Qatar to \nthe United States since September 5, 2000. Prior to this assignment, he \nserved as Non-Resident Ambassador to Mexico; Director of European and \nAmerican Affairs Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Qatar; \nAmbassador to The Russian Federation; Non Resident Ambassador to \nFinland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia; Ambassador to France and Non \nResident Ambassador to Greece; Non-Resident Ambassador to Switzerland; \nAmbassador to Egypt and Permanent Representative to the Arab League in \nCairo, Egypt; and Ambassador to Spain. Through the Washington Embassy, \nAmbassador Al-Dafa has worked on a wide array of programs, including \nthe establishment of branches of Virginia Commonwealth University, \nTexas A, and Weill Cornell Medical College in Education City in Doha. \nIn addition to Arabic and English, he speaks Spanish and French \nfluently. Ambassador Al-Dafa is married to Awatef Mohamed Al-Dafa and \nhas three children.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Ambassador Al-Dafa on \nhis success and achievements in international affairs and on this \nprestigious honor that will be conferred by Western Michigan \nUniversity. I am pleased to offer my best wishes on his continued \nservice and contribution to the close ties and good relations between \nthe State of Qatar and the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9932-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9932-S9934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n  At 10:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       S.J.

Apparently, when it \ncomes to companies showing their respect for their employees called to \nserve, there is special meaning to the old cliche ``no good deed goes \nunpunished.''\n  The National Committee for Employer Support for the Guard and \nReserve, a nationwide association, reports that over 2,500 employers \nhave signed a pledge of support and have gone above and beyond the \nrequirements of the law in support of their National Guard and Reserve \nemployees. This includes many of our Nation's largest and most \nreputable corporations, including 3M, McDonalds, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, \nLiberty Mutual and many others. These commendable companies provide \nreservist employees who are on active duty with ``differential pay'' \nthat makes up the difference between their military stipend and \ncivilian salary.\n  Not just national companies provide special pay to our men and women \nwho are called to serve overseas. In New Hampshire, some of the most \nremarkable stories of corporate patriotism can be found. BAE Systems of \nNashua provides differential pay to their 25 called-up employees and \ncontinuing access to benefits to family members. The company even \nprovides a stipend to make up the lost pay of active duty spouses of \ncompany employees when the spouse's employer is not able to provide \ndifferential pay.\n  Consider also the account of Mr. Marian Noronha, Chairman and Founder \nof Turbocam, a manufacturer based in Dover, New Hampshire. An immigrant \nfrom India, Mr. Noronha has not only provided his employees with \ndifferential pay and continued family health benefits, but has also \nextended to each of his activated employees a $10,000 line of credit. \nHis active duty reservist and Guard employees have used this money to, \namong other things, purchase personal computers so their families can \ncommunicate with them while they are overseas. Several other New \nHampshire private-sector companies, including Hitchiner Manufacturing \nCompany in Milford, have exemplary records when it comes to dealing \nwith reservist employees. Also, New Hampshire's Governor Benson by \nExecutive Order has extended differential pay for up to 18 months to \nState employees who have been called to active duty.\n  Under current law, employers of reservists and guardsmen called up \nfor active duty are required to treat them as if they are on a leave of \nabsence under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights \nAct of 1994 (USERRA). The Act does not require employers to pay \nreservists who are on active duty. But as I have pointed out, many \nemployers pay the reservists the difference between their military \nstipends and their regular salaries. Some employers provide this \n``differential pay'' for up to three years. For employee convenience, \nmany of these companies also allow deductions from the differential \npayment for contributions to their 401(k) retirement plans.\n  The conflict arises, however, because a 1969 IRS Revenue Ruling \nconsiders the employment relationship terminated when active duty \nbegins. This ruling prevents employers from treating the differential \npay as wages for income tax purposes, resulting in unexpected tax bills \nat the end of the year for these military personnel. Further, the \ncontributions made to the worker's retirement account potentially \ninvalidate, disqualify, the employer's entire retirement plan which \ncould make all amounts immediately taxable to plan participants and the \nemployer.\n  The Uniformed Services Differential Pay Protection Act that I am \nintroducing today clarifies that differential wage payments are to be \ntreated as wages to current employees for income tax purposes and that \nretirement plan contributions are permissible.\n  Differential wage payments would be treated as wages for income tax \nwithholding purposes and reported on the worker's W-2 form. This means \nthat active duty personnel will not be hit with end-of-the-year tax \nbills.\n  No New Taxes: The legislation does not change present law, and \ndeferential wage payments will not be subject to Social Security and \nunemployment compensation taxes.\n  Definition: ``Differential wage payments'' are defined to mean any \npayment which: (1) is made by an employer to an individual while he or \nshe is on active duty for a period of more than 30 days, and (2) \nrepresents all or a portion of the wages the individual would have \nreceived from the employer if he or she were performing service for the \nemployer.\n  An individual receiving differential wage payments would continue to \nbe treated as an employee for purposes of the rules applicable to \nqualified retirement plans, removing the threat that contributions on \nhis or her behalf would invalidate the employer's entire plan.\n  Distributions Protected: Clarifying language is included to ensure \nthat individuals would continue to be permitted to take distributions \nfrom their accounts when they leave their jobs for active duty. Thus, \nthe right to receive distributions will be preserved even though \nindividuals are treated as current employees for contribution purposes. \nThe bill includes a prohibition on making elective deferrals or \nemployee contributions for six months after receiving a distribution.\n  Satisfying Nondiscrimination Rules: In order to avoid disruptions in \nretirement savings plans and to remove disincentives, employers could \ndisregard contributions to retirement savings accounts based on \ndifferential wage payments for nondiscrimination testing purposes, \nprovided that such payments are available to all mobilized employees on \nreasonably equivalent terms.\n  In summary, the Uniformed Services Differential Pay Protection Act \nupholds the principle that employers should not be penalized for their \ngenerosity towards our Nation's reservists and members of the National \nGuard.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2858\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 to \nprohibit the issuance of permits for marine aquaculture facilities \nuntil requirements for such permits are enacted into the law; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is a fact that scientists, the media \nand the public are gradually awakening to the serious disadvantages of \nfish raised in fish farming operations compared to naturally healthy \nwild fish species such as Alaska salmon, halibut, sablefish, crab and \nmany other species.\n  News reports are now common that cite not only the general health \nadvantages of eating fish at least once or twice a week, but the \nspecific advantages of fish such as wild salmon, which contains \nessential Omega-3 fatty acids that may help reduce the risk of heart \ndisease and possibly have similar beneficial effects on other diseases.\n  Educated and watchful consumers have also seen recent stories citing \nresearch demonstrating that farmed salmon fed vegetable-based food does \nnot have the same beneficial impact on cardio-vascular health, but that \nthe demand for non-vegetable-based food for fish farms may be \ndecimating populations of other key fish species.\n  Those same alert consumers may also have seen stories indicating that \nfish farms may create serious pollution problems from the concentration \nof fish feces and uneaten food, that fish farms may harbor diseases \nthat can be transmitted to previously healthy wild fish stocks, and \nthat fish farming has had a devastating effect on communities that \ndepend on traditional fisheries.\n  And yet, despite abundant evidence that fish farming practices are \ndeeply problematic, a small cadre of federal bureaucrats continues to \npush hard for legislation that would encourage the development of huge \nnew fish farms off our coasts. These same people have been pushing the \nidea for a number of years, and are closer than ever to presenting \ndraft legislation that would vastly expand fish farming by encouraging \nthe development of new farms in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone from 3 \nto 200 miles offshore.\n  Not only does this small group want to encourage such development, \nbut reports indicate they want to change the rules to place all the \ndecision-making authority over new farms in the hands of just one \nagency--which just happens to be theirs--rather than continue the \ncurrent system where authority is spread among the agencies with the \ngreatest expertise in different areas, such as hydraulic engineering, \nenvironmental protection, fish biology, etc.\n  We cannot afford a rush to judgment on this issue--it is far too \ndangerous if we make a mistake.\n  The Natural Stock Conservation Act I am introducing today lays down a \nmarker for where this debate needs to go. It would prohibit the \ndevelopment of new offshore aqua-culture operations until Congress has \nacted to ensure every federal agency involved does the necessary \nanalyses in areas such as disease control, engineering, pollution \nprevention, biological and genetic impacts, and other critical issues, \nnone of which are specifically required under existing law.\n  I realize it is far too late in this session to anticipate action on \nsuch a controversial and complex issue, but I intend this bill to \nstimulate further debate on this issue next year, as Congress begins \nserious work on the future of our ocean programs in response to the \nU.S. Ocean Commission report. I intend to pursue this discussion \nvigorously, and I will be calling on other coastal senators to work \nwith me.\n  We all want to make sure we enjoy abundant supplies of healthy foods \nin the future, but not if it means unnecessary and avoidable damage to \nwild species, to the environment generally, and to the economies of \nAmerica's coastal fishing communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2859\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nclassify automatic fire sprinkler systems as 5-year property for \npurposes of depreciation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing along with \nSenator Rockefeller the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of 2004. Passage \nof this bipartisan bill would serve to help reduce the tremendous \nannual economic and human loss that fire in the United States inflicts \non our Nation.\n  In the United States, fire departments responded to approximately 1.7 \nmillion fires in 2002. Annually, over 500,000 of these are structural \nfires causing approximately 3,400 deaths, around 100 of which are \nfirefighters. Fire also caused some 18.5 million civilian injuries and \n$10.3 billion in direct property loss. The indirect cost of fire in the \nUnited States annually exceeds $80 billion. These losses are \nstaggering. All of this translates to the fact that fire departments \nrespond to a fire every 18 seconds. Every 60 seconds a fire breaks out \nin a structure and in a residential structure every 80 seconds.\n  There are literally thousands of high-rise buildings built under \nolder codes that lack adequate fire protection. In addition, billions \nof dollars were spent to make these and other buildings handicapped \naccessible, but people with disabilities now occupying these buildings \nare not adequately protected from fire. At recent code hearings, \nrepresentatives of the health care industry testified that there are \napproximately 4,200 nursing homes that need to be retrofitted with fire \nsprinklers. They further testified that the cost of protecting these \nbuildings with fire sprinklers would have to be raised through \ncorresponding increases in Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to the \nalarming number of nursing homes lacking fire sprinkler protection, \nthere are literally thousands of assisted living facilities housing \nolder Americans and people with disabilities that lack fire sprinkler \nprotection.\n  The solution resides in automatic sprinkler systems that are usually \ntriggered within 4 minutes of the temperature rising above 120 degrees. \nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has no record of a fire \nkilling more than two people in a public assembly, educational, \ninstitutional, or residential building that has fully operational \nsprinklers. Furthermore, sprinklers are responsible for dramatically \nreducing property loss.\n  Building owners do not argue with fire authorities over the logic of \nprotecting their building with fire sprinklers. The issue is cost. This \nbill would drastically reduce the staggering annual economic toll of \nfire in America and thereby dramatically improve the quality of life \nfor everyone involved. This legislation provides a tax incentive for \nbusinesses to install sprinklers through the use of a 5-year \ndepreciation period, opposed to the current 27.5 or 39-year period for \ninstallations in residential rental and non-residential real property \nrespectively. While only a start, the bill will help eliminate the \nmassive losses seen in nursing homes, nightclubs, office buildings, \napartment buildings, manufacturing facilities, and other for-profit \nentities.\n  This bill enjoys support from a variety of organizations. They \ninclude: the American Insurance Association, the American Fire \nSprinkler Association, the California Department of Forestry and Fire \nProtection, Campus Firewatch, Congressional Fire Services Institute, \nIndependent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, International \nAssociation of Arson Investigators, International Association of Fire \nChiefs, International Fire Service Training Association, National Fire \nProtection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, National \nVolunteer Fire Council, the Society of Fire Protection Engineers, and \nthe Mechanical Contractors Association of America.\n  The Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of 2004 provides long needed safety \nincentives for building owners that will help fire departments across \nthe country save lives. I ask my colleagues for their support of this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, every 18 seconds a fire department \nsomewhere in America responds to a fire. And sadly, in 2001, not \nincluding those killed in the terrorist attacks on September 11, there \nwere almost 4,000 deaths in America resulting from fires, including the \ndeaths of 99 firefighters. Obviously, the Government cannot prevent \nevery tragedy. But when we can help, we ought to. That is why I am \nproud to introduce legislation today with my friend from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Santorum, that will create incentives for the installation of \nfire sprinkler systems, which are indisputably effective in limiting \ndeath and destruction by fires. The Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of \n2004 will make retrofit installation of fire sprinklers more \naffordable.\n  The National Fire Protection Association has no record of a fire \nkilling more than two people in a building that had a properly \ninstalled and functioning sprinkler system. Less important than saving \nlives, but still important, sprinklers can dramatically reduce the \nproperty damage caused by fires. Because sprinkler systems are so \nsuccessful, many jurisdictions require that newly constructed buildings \nbe built with proper fire suppression technology.\n  Unfortunately, building codes for new construction cannot protect the \nmany people who are living, working, or meeting in older buildings that \ndo not have sprinklers. And because retrofitting buildings is so \nexpensive few property owners can reasonably afford the upgrade. The \nlegislation that the Senator from Pennsylvania and I are introducing \ntoday will provide some tax relief to property owners who are willing \nto make the investment in sprinkler systems that can save lives.\n  A business that operates nursing homes, for example, may not be able \nto afford to retrofit its older facilities without charging residents \ninsupportable fees. The Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act will help \nameliorate the costs of sprinkler installation by enabling property \nowners to depreciate the investment over a five-year period. This small \nchange to the Tax Code can result in lives saved and property \npreserved.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this important \nlegislation enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. DeWine, \n        and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2863. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Department of \nJustice for fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues \nSenators Leahy, DeWine, and Schumer to introduce the ``Department of \nJustice Appropriations Authorization Act, fiscal years 2005 through \n2007.'' I want to thank Senator Leahy for his hard work on this bill. I \nalso want to thank the House Judiciary Committee under the leadership \nof Chairman Sensenbrenner for developing legislation upon which we have \nbeen able to build.\n  I am pleased that Congress passed a Department of Justice \nreauthorization bill last Congress for the first time in over two \ndecades. The bill, however, did not address a number of authorities, \nincluding the Office of Justice\n\n[[Page S9941]]\n\nPrograms. The bill we are introducing today authorizes and consolidates \nand makes permanent a host of appropriations authorities. These \nauthorities are essential to the administration of the Department of \nJustice and its ability to accomplish its mission.\n  The Department of Justice's central duty is to provide security and \njustice for all Americans. I believe this legislation is essential to \nthe Department's work in protecting America from future terrorist \nattacks. Importantly, the legislation will facilitate the Department's \nability to continue providing much-needed assistance and advice to our \nstate and local law enforcement.\n  I want to take a moment to highlight some of the more important \nprovisions of this bill. Title I of the bill authorizes appropriations \nfor the major components of the Department for fiscal year 2005 through \nfiscal year 2007. Among these authorizations are funding for Federal \nBureau of Investigation and the newly created Terrorism Threat \nIntegration Center to fight the war against terrorism, and the Drug \nEnforcement Administration to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs.\n  Title II of the bill restructures and authorizes many of the grant \nprograms at the Department. Specifically, it restructures the Byrne and \nLocal Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) programs and authorizes for \nthe first time ever the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant. By merging \nthese two programs into one Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \nGrant program (JAG), it will allow states to make one application for \nfunds and streamline the process.\n  I want to take a moment and address the concern I have heard raised \nthat the merger of these programs will somehow cause states to lose the \nassistance they rely upon. Although we have combined the funds into one \nprogram, we have kept the same purpose areas so that activities and \nprograms funded currently under Byrne and LLEBG may continue to be \neligible for funds under the JAG program. Additionally, the money \nallocated to the JAG program is set up to split the funds 50/50--fifty \npercent of the JAG funds are allocated in the same manner that Byrne \ngrants are currently allocated, and fifty percent are allocated in the \nsame manner that the LLEBG funds are currently allocated. Each state \nreceives 0.25 percent of the overall funds. Then of the remaining \nfunds, 50 percent is distributed based upon population, similar to the \nByrne grants, and the other 50 percent is based on the violent crime \nrate, similar to the LLEBG. In other words, the JAG program is designed \nto address the same purposes of the Byrne and LLEBG programs, and funds \nare intended to be allocated in the same manner. The only difference is \nthat those funds will now come from one pot of money--the JAG account.\n\n  That being said, I do share the concern that money for the one pot, \nthe JAG account, will be reduced. I have supported full funding for \nByrne and LLEBG grants in the past, and I will continue to support \nfunding for the JAG program. For this reason, this legislation \nauthorizes the JAG account to receive the total amount of funds that \nboth the Byrne and LLEBG programs received in Fiscal Year 2003 plus a 2 \npercent increase. I am hopeful that the Appropriators will fund the new \nJAG program at the same level. In fact, one of the benefits of creating \none new program is that it will help limit the earmarking of these \ngrants, thus allowing meritorious programs to receive money that may \nhave been previously allocated for some earmark.\n  In addition to the authorization of the JAG program, this legislation \nrestructures the COPS program as one single block grant program \ncovering all of its current purposes so local governments will need to \nfile only one COPS application for any of these purposes. The bill \nreauthorizes the Boys and Girls Club of America, the Regional \nInformation Sharing System (RISS), the Crime Free Rural States Grant \nprogram, the National Criminal History Background Check System, the \nNational Incident-Based Reporting System, and the records of the \nNational Crime Information Center. Further, the bill makes a number of \nimportant changes to grants that assist victims of crime and to the \ndrug courts to enable these valuable programs to be more effective. *In \naddition, the legislation creates a new Office of Weed and Seed \nStrategies to replace the never-before authorized executive Office of \nWeed and Seed Strategies.\n  The bill includes the Prevention and Recovery of Missing Children Act \nand the Senior Safety Act to better protect our nation's most \nvulnerable citizens: our children and seniors. The Prevention and \nRecovery of Missing Children Act sets standards for the registration of \nsex offenders which will make our registration system more accurate and \nreliable. The Senior Safety Act enhances the penalties for crimes \ncommitted against seniors, including fraud and telemarketing fraud, and \nincludes a provision to safeguard pensions from fraud and theft.\n  One of the keys to fighting terrorism is a tough arsenal of laws \ndesigned to target those who support or assist terrorists and their \ncause, such as those who launder money. This legislation includes the \nCombating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act of 2004 which \nadds several provisions to the list of specified unlawful activities \nwithin the RICO statute that serve as predicate offenses under the \nmoney laundering statute. It adds a provision to the civil forfeiture \nstatute to allow for the forfeiture of property outside U.S. \nterritorial boundaries if the property was used in the planning of a \nterrorist act that occurred within the U.S. It also includes a parallel \ntransaction provision which provides that all parts of a parallel or \ndependent financial transaction are considered a money laundering \noffense if one part of that transaction involves the proceeds of an \nunlawful activity.\n  This legislation also includes the Koby Mandell Act which creates \nwithin the DOJ an Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism. \nThe office will assume responsibility for the administration of the \nRewards for Justice Program and its website. The office will offer \nrewards in an effort to capture terrorists involved in harming American \ncitizens overseas. It will also provide other related services \nincluding sending U.S. officials to funerals of American victims of \nterrorism overseas.\n\n  This bill also contains important immigration provisions, including \nthe PROMISE Act. The PROMISE Act is an immigration enforcement measure \nthat amends the Immigration and Nationality Act so that those who fail \nto satisfy their child support obligations are ineligible to enter the \nUnited States. Further, those already in the United States will be \nineligible for certain immigration benefits, such as citizenship.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Senator Leahy and the House Judiciary Committee \nto enact this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-\nsection analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                     DOJ Reauth Section by Section\n\n     Section 1. Short Title; Table of Contents\n       Section 1 provides that the bill may be cited as the \n     ``Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, \n     Fiscal Years 2005 through 2007'' and sets forth the table of \n     contents.\n\n                TITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS\n\n     Section 101. Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Year \n         2005\n       Section 101 sets forth specific sums authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out the activities of the Department of \n     Justice for Fiscal Year 2005. These sums are set out in 22 \n     accounts. The numbers generally reflect the President's \n     budget requests for the Department of Justice for Fiscal Year \n     2004 with a 2% inflation adjustment.\n     Section 102. Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Year \n         2006\n       Section 102 sets forth specific sums authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out the activities of the Department of \n     Justice for Fiscal Year 2006. These sums are set out in 22 \n     accounts. The numbers generally reflect the President's \n     budget requests for the Department of Justice for Fiscal Year \n     2005 in Section 101 with a 2% inflation adjustment.\n     Section 103. Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Year \n         2007\n       Section 103 sets forth specific sums authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out the activities of the Department of \n     Justice for Fiscal Year 2007. These sums are set out in 20 \n     accounts. The numbers generally reflect the numbers for \n     Fiscal Year 2006 in section 102 with a 2% inflation \n     adjustment.\n\n[[Page S9942]]\n\n     TITLE II--IMPROVING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S GRANT PROGRAMS\n\n  Subtitle A--Assisting Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Agencies\n\n     Section 201. Merger of Byrne Grant and Local Law Enforcement \n         Block Grant Programs\n       Section 201 merges the current Byrne Grant Program (both \n     formula and discretionary) and the Local Law Enforcement \n     Block Grant Programs into one new Edward Byrne Memorial \n     Justice Assistance Grant Program. This will allow states and \n     local governments to make one application for this money \n     annually for a four-year term.\n       The formula for distributing these grants combines elements \n     of the current Byrne and LLEBG formulas. For allocating money \n     to the states, each state automatically receives 0.25% of the \n     total.\n       Of the remaining amount, 50% is divided up among the states \n     according to population (the method currently used under \n     Byrne) and 50% is divided up based on the violent crime rate \n     (the method currently used under LLEBG).\n       Each state's allocation is then divided among state and \n     locals in the following manner. Sixty percent of the \n     allocation goes to the state. Then, that 60% is divided \n     between state and locals based on their relative percentages \n     of overall criminal justice spending within the state. The \n     state keeps its portion of the 60% and gives out the local \n     portion in the state's discretion. This follows how Byrne \n     formula grants are now done.\n       The remaining 40% of the state's allocation goes directly \n     to the local governments from OJP. Each class of local \n     governments (e.g., cities, counties, townships, etc.) gets a \n     share based on its relative percentage of local criminal \n     justice spending within the state. Within each class, the \n     class's share is divided up between the local governments in \n     that class based on their crime rate. This is similar to how \n     LLEBG grants are now done.\n       The bill authorizes $1.075 billion for FY 2005 for the \n     program which represents a 2% increase over the amount \n     appropriated for both programs in Fiscal Year 2003. A new \n     feature of the program is that states will be allowed to keep \n     grant funds in interest bearing accounts until spent and then \n     keep the interest. However, all money must be spent during \n     the four-year grant period.\n     Section 202. Clarification of Official To Be Consulted by \n         Attorney General in Considering Application for Emergency \n         Federal Law Enforcement Assistance\n       Section 202 amends the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement \n     Assistance program (42 U.S.C. Sec. 10501 et seq.) to clarify \n     that in awarding grants under this program the Attorney \n     General shall consult with the Assistant Attorney General for \n     the Office of Justice Programs rather than the Director of \n     the Office of Justice Assistance. This change simply brings \n     the statute into conformity with the existing chain of \n     command in the Department.\n     Section 203. Clarification of Uses for Regional Information \n         Sharing System Grants\n       Section 203 amends the authorization for the Regional \n     Information Sharing System (42 U.S.C. Sec. 3796h) to clarify \n     its regional character and its authority to establish and \n     maintain a secure telecommunications backbone.\n     Section 204. Authorization ofAppropriations for the Regional \n         Information Sharing System Grants to facilitate Federal-\n         State-Local Law Enforcement Response Related to Terrorist \n         Attacks\n       Section 204 reauthorizes the Regional Information Sharing \n     System for FY 2005-2007 at $100 million each year.\n     Section 205. Integrity and Enhancement of National Criminal \n         Record Databases\n       Section 205 amends the authorizing statute for the Bureau \n     of Justice Statistics (42 U.S.C. Sec. 3732): (1) to clarify \n     that the Director shall be responsible for the integrity of \n     data and statistics and the prevention of improper or illegal \n     use or disclosure; (2) to provide specific authorization \n     for the already existing National Criminal History \n     Background Check System, the National Incident-Based \n     Reporting System, and the records of the National Crime \n     Information Center and to facilitate state participation \n     in these systems; and (3) to facilitate data-sharing \n     agreements between the Bureau of Justice Statistics and \n     other federal agencies.\n     Section 206. Extension of Crime Free Rural States Grant \n         Program\n       Section 206 reauthorizes the Crime Free Rural States Grant \n     program for FY 2005-2007.\n\nSubtitle B--Building Community Capacity to Prevent, Reduce, and Control \n                                 Crime\n\n     Section 211. Office of Weed and Seed Strategies\n       Section 211 creates a new Office of Weed and Seed \n     Strategies. This office will replace the current Executive \n     Office of Weed and Seed, and for the first time, this program \n     will have a specific authorization.\n\n                 Subtitle C--Assisting Victims of Crime\n\n     Section 221. Grants to Local Nonprofit Organizations to \n         Improve Outreach Services to Victims of Crime\n       Section 221 amends the crime victim assistance grants \n     program to allow grants of less than $10,000 to be made to \n     smaller neighborhood and community-based victim service \n     organizations. Currently, grants under this program tend to \n     go to larger organizations, and this amendment simply \n     emphasizes that some of the money spent in this program \n     should go to smaller organizations as well.\n     Section 222. Clarification and Enhancement of Certain \n         Authorities Relating to Crime Victims Fund\n       Section 222 makes several minor adjustments to the \n     authorities relating to the Crime Victims Fund.\n       Subsection 222(1) clarifies that the fund may only accept \n     gifts, donations, or bequests if they do not attach \n     conditions inconsistent with applicable laws or regulations \n     and if they do not require the expenditure of appropriated \n     funds that are not available to the Office of Victims of \n     Crime. Current law establishes a $50 million antiterrorism \n     reserve within the fund. Each year that reserve may be \n     replenished by using up to 5% of the money in the fund that \n     was not otherwise expended during that year.\n       Subsection 222(2) permits replenishments of the \n     Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve based upon amounts \n     ``obligated'' rather than amounts actually ``expended'' in \n     any given fiscal year.\n       Subsection 222(3) allows the Assistant Attorney General to \n     direct the use of the funds available for Indian child abuse \n     program grants under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 10601(g) and to use 5% of \n     those funds for grants to Indian tribes to establish victim \n     assistance programs.\n       Subsection 222(4) clarifies that the Antiterrorism \n     Emergency Reserve may be replenished only once each fiscal \n     year, rather than be continually replenished as amounts are \n     obligated or expended. It also ensures that no AER funds are \n     included in limitations on annual Crime Victims Fund \n     obligations.\n     Section 223. Amounts Received Under Crime Victim Grants May \n         Be Used by State for Training Purposes\n       Section 223 amends the grant programs for victim \n     compensation and victim assistance to allow the states part \n     of the reserved amount for administrative costs for training \n     purposes.\n     Section 224. Clarification of Authorities Relating to \n         Violence Against Women Formula and Discretionary Grant \n         Programs\n       Section 224 makes several clarifications to the program to \n     fund grants to combat violent crimes against women. \n     Subsection 224(a) clarifies that grants may be used for \n     victim services. Subsection 224(b) corrects an incorrect \n     section number reference in last Congress' DOJ authorization \n     bill. Subsection 224(c) clarifies that grants under the \n     program can be made to Indian tribal domestic violence \n     coalitions and corrects other technical errors and makes \n     conforming changes. Subsection 224(d) changes the reporting \n     requirement on the program from annual to biennial.\n       Subsection 224(e) clarifies that state and tribal \n     governments may use grant funds under the program to pay for \n     forensic medical exams for sexual assault victims so long as \n     the victims are not required to seek reimbursement from their \n     insurers. It further provides that the victim shall not be \n     required to participate in the criminal justice system or \n     cooperate with law enforcement in order to be provided with a \n     forensic medical exam, reimbursement for such exam, or both. \n     Subsection 224(f) makes a technical amendment to the heading \n     for this part of the Code.\n     Section 225. Expansion of Grant Programs Assisting \n         Enforcement of Domestic Violence Cases To Also Assist \n         Enforcement of Sexual Assault Cases\n       Section 225 amends the programs to provide grants to \n     encourage domestic violence arrest policies and to provide \n     assistance for rural domestic violence and child abuse \n     enforcement to clarify that such grants can also be used to \n     assist enforcement of sexual assault cases.\n\n                      Subtitle D--Preventing Crime\n\n     Section 231. Clarification of Definition of Violent Offender \n         for Purposes of Juvenile Drug Courts\n       Section 231 amends the juvenile drug court grant program so \n     that offenders who are convicted of a violent misdemeanor may \n     participate in the program. Currently, misdemeanor offenders \n     may participate only if their offense is non-violent.\n     Section 232. Eligibility for Grants Under Drug Court Grants \n         Program Extended to Courts That Supervise Non-Offenders \n         With Substance Abuse Problems\n       Section 232 amends the drug court program to allow \n     continuing supervision over non-violent offenders as well as \n     other related persons who may be before the court. This will \n     allow a drug court to consolidate the cases of related \n     individuals who may be under its jurisdiction at one time and \n     supervise them jointly.\n     Section 233. Terms of Residential Substance Abuse Treatment \n         Program for Local Facilities\n       Section 233 amends the Residential Substance Abuse \n     Treatment for State Prisoners program to clarify that the \n     grants should go to local correctional facilities and \n     detention facilities where prisoners are held long enough to \n     carry out a 3-month course of drug treatment.\n     Section 234. Rural 9-1-1 Service\n       Section 234 authorizes the Attorney General to provide \n     grants for access to, and improvements on a communications \n     infrastructure that will ensure a reliable and seamless \n     communication between, law enforcement, fire, and emergency \n     medical service providers in units of local government and \n     tribal governments located outside a Standard Metropolitan \n     Statistical Area and in States.\n\n[[Page S9943]]\n\n     Section 235. Methamphetamine Cleanup\n       Section 235 authorizes the Methamphetamine Cleanup program. \n     The program funds the cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories \n     and related hazardous waste, and provides additional contract \n     personnel, equipment, and facilities to local governments.\n     Section 236. National Citizens Crime Prevention Campaign\n       Section 236 authorizes the National Citizens Crime \n     Prevention Campaign for FY 2005-2007 and requires a 30% non-\n     Federal match for all Federal funds.\n     Section 237. SEARCH, the National Consortium for Justice \n         Information and Statistics\n       Section 237 authorizes the Bureau of Justice Assistance to \n     award a grant to SEARCH, the National Consortium for Justice \n     Information and Statistics to perform its functions under the \n     direction of the Office of Justice Programs.\n\n                       Subtitle E--Other Matters\n\n     Section 241. Changes to Certain Financial Authorities\n       Subsection 241 (a) raises from 3 to 6 percent the amount of \n     money collected from civil debt collection activities that \n     can be credited to the Working Capital Fund established under \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 527.\n       Subsection 241 (b) exempts the Southwest Border Initiative \n     from the requirement that it reimburse the Treasury for \n     untimely payments and the requirement that it pay interest to \n     states for untimely payments.\n       Subsections 241(c) and (d) update certain general law \n     enforcement authorities of the Attorney General to include \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n     Section 242. Coordination Duties of Assistant Attorney \n         General\n       Subsection 242(a) amends the authorizing statute for OJP to \n     include the Office for Victims of Crime within the list of \n     OJP bureaus. Subsection 242(b) allows the Assistant Attorney \n     General to place special conditions on all grants.\n     Section 243. Repeal of Certain Programs\n       Section 243 repeals seven grant programs that have been \n     authorized, but have largely not been funded in recent years: \n     the Criminal Justice Facility Construction Pilot Program; the \n     Family Support Program; the Matching Grant Program for School \n     Security; the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant Program; the \n     Assistance for Delinquent and At-Risk Youth Program; and the \n     Improved Training and Technical Automation Program; the Other \n     State and Local Aid Program.\n     Section 244. Elimination of Certain Notice and Hearing \n         Requirements\n       Section 244 eliminates the requirement that OJP must \n     provide notice and a hearing for grant applicants whose \n     applications are denied. It further eliminates the \n     opportunity for appellate review of the decisions arising \n     from such hearings. These rights are rarely used.\n     Section 245. Amended Definitions for Purposes of Omnibus \n         Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968\n       Section 245 broadens the definition of the term ``Indian \n     Tribe'' to allow more tribes to be treated as units of local \n     government for purposes of OJP grants. It broadens the \n     definition of the term ``combination'' of State and local \n     governments to include those who jointly plan. It amends the \n     definition of the term ``neighborhood or community-based \n     organizations'' to clarify that it includes faith-based \n     organizations.\n     Section 246. Clarification of Authority To Pay Subsistence \n         Payments to Prisoners for Health Care Items and Services\n       Under current law, the Attorney General is required to pay \n     for health care items and services for certain prisoners in \n     the custody of the United States. In every instance, he must \n     not pay more than the lesser of what the Medicare or Medicaid \n     program would pay. This requires the Attorney General to \n     expend a great deal of effort to determine that in each \n     case. This subsection changes that to simply say that he \n     shall not pay more than the Medicare rate. It also \n     substitutes the Department of Homeland Security for a \n     reference to the now defunct Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service.\n     Section 247. Consolidation of Financial Management Systems of \n         Office of Justice Programs\n       Section 247 requires the Assistant Attorney General of the \n     Office of Justice Programs to make two significant financial \n     management reforms: (1) consolidate all accounting activities \n     of OJP into a single financial management system under the \n     direct management of the Office of the Comptroller by \n     September 30, 2010, and (2) consolidate all procurement \n     activities of OJP into a single procurement system under the \n     direct management of the Office of Administration by \n     September 30, 2007.\n       The Assistant Attorney General is required to begin the \n     consolidation of accounting activities under the Office of \n     the Comptroller and the consolidation of procurement \n     activities under the Office of Administration not later than \n     October 1, 2003. The Office of Administration is to begin the \n     consolidation of procurement operations and financial \n     management systems into a single financial system not later \n     than September 30, 2005.\n     Section 248. Authorization and Change of COPS program to \n         single grant program\n       Section 248 reauthorizes the COPS program while \n     restructuring it as one single block grant program covering \n     all of its current purposes so local governments will need \n     only to file one COPS application for any of these purposes.\n     Section 249. Enhanced Assistance for Criminal Investigations \n         and Prosecutions by State and Local Law Enforcement \n         Officials\n       Section 249 enhances assistance for criminal investigations \n     and prosecutions by requiring the Attorney General to provide \n     federal assistance upon request by a state, local or Indian \n     tribe governments.\n\n TITLE III--COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING ACT OF \n                                  2004\n\n     Section 301. Short Title\n       Section 301 authorizes that this bill may be cited as the \n     ``Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act of \n     2003''.\n     Section 302. Specified Activities for Money Laundering\n       Amends the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations \n     Act (RICO) to expand its scope to cover acts or threats \n     involving burglary, embezzlement, and fraud in the purchase \n     of securities. Modifies provisions regarding: (1) the \n     laundering of monetary instruments to include violations of \n     the Social Security Act relating to obtaining funds through \n     misuse of a social security number, to grant authority to the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security and the Commissioner of Social \n     Security over offenses within their jurisdictions, and to \n     cover certain informal transfers of the proceeds of specified \n     unlawful activity; and (2) engaging in monetary transactions \n     in property derived from specified unlawful activity to grant \n     authority to the Secretary over offenses within his \n     jurisdiction.\n     Section 303. Illegal Money Transmitting Businesses\n       Changes the name of a money transmitting business the \n     operation of which is prohibited from an ``unlicensed'' to an \n     ``illegal'' money transmitting business. Specifies that such \n     a business shall be illegal if it fails to comply with money \n     transmitting business registration requirements (current \n     law), whether or not the defendant knew that the operation \n     was required to comply with such requirements. Authorizes the \n     Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security to investigate violations \n     regarding such businesses.\n     Section 304. Assets of Persons Committing Terrorist Acts \n         Against Foreign Countries or International Organizations\n       Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for civil \n     forfeiture of the assets of individuals or entities engaging \n     in planning or perpetrating any act of international \n     terrorism against any international organization or foreign \n     government.\n     Section 305. Money Laundering through Informal Value Transfer \n         Systems\n       Section 305 amends the Federal criminal code to include as \n     money laundering unlawful transactions where one part of such \n     plan or arrangement actually involves the proceeds of \n     specified unlawful activity.\n     Section 306. Technical Corrections to Financing of Terrorism \n         Statute\n       Section 306 amends 18 USC 2339(c) to change the definition \n     of concealment and other minor changes.\n     Section 307. Miscellaneous and Technical Amendments\n       Section 307 amends 18 USC 982(b), 18 USC 1510(b)(3)(B) and \n     adds technical amendments Sections 1956, 1957.\n     Section 308. Extension of the Money Laundering and Financial \n         Crimes Strategy Act of 1998\n       Reauthorizes the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes \n     Strategy Act of 1998 through years 2004, 2005, and 2006.\n\n   TITLE IV--PREVENTION AND RECOVERY OF MISSING CHILDREN ACT OF 2004\n\n     Section 401. Short Title\n       This Title may be called the ``Prevention and Recovery of \n     Missing Children Act of 2004.''\n     Section 402. Findings\n     Section 403. Missing Child Reporting Requirements\n       Section 403 stops the practice of removing a missing child \n     entry from the NCIC database when the child reaches age 18 to \n     increase the chances for child recovery and investigative \n     information available for other cases. It also requires that \n     a missing child be entered into NCIC within 2 hours of \n     receipt.\n     Section 404. Standards for Sex Offender Registration Programs\n       Section 404 requires that (1) a state register sex \n     offenders before they are released from prison; (2) the \n     registering agency obtain current fingerprints and a \n     photograph (annually), as well as a DNA sample, from an \n     offender at the time of registration; (3) registrants obtain \n     either a driver's license or an identification card from the \n     department of motor vehicles; (4) registration changes occur \n     within 10 days of the changes taking effect; (5) all \n     registered sex offenders verify their registry information \n     every 90 days; and (6) states inform another state when a \n     known registered person is moving into its jurisdiction. This \n     section also creates a felony designation for the crime of \n     non-compliance with the registration requirements.\n     Section 405. Effective Date\n       The provisions in this title will go into effect 2 years \n     after this bill is signed into law.\n\n        TITLE V--BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 2004\n\n     Section 501. Short Title\n       This title may be called the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership \n     Grant Act of 2004.''\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\n     Section 502. Authorization of Appropriations\n       Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n     1968 to extend through FY 2007 the authorization of \n     appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \n     Program (a matching grant program which helps State, tribal, \n     and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law \n     enforcement officers).\n\n                           TITLE VI--PACT ACT\n\n     Section 601. Short Title\n       This title may be called the ``Prevent All Cigarette \n     Trafficking Act'' or ``PACT Act.''\n     Section 602. Collection of State Cigarette Taxes\n       This section increases the ability of state, local, and \n     tribal governments to collect excise taxes from cigarette and \n     smokeless tobacco sales by strengthening the Jenkins Act, \n     which requires reporting of interstate cigarette sales. \n     Jenkins now explicitly includes cigarette and smokeless \n     tobacco sales made via phone, Internet or mail. Delivery \n     sellers must report interstate sales, including those to \n     distributors, to state, local, and tribal governments, as \n     well as list all Jenkins requirements on the bill of lading, \n     and maintain records of all delivery sales. Delivery sales \n     may not be made until excise tax stamps are applied. \n     Violators of Jenkins are subject to felony prosecution and \n     civil penalties. State, local and tribal governments, as well \n     as tobacco manufacturers may prevent and restrain violations \n     of Jenkins in U.S. district courts, in addition to their \n     respective jurisdictions.\n     Section 603. Treatment of Cigarettes as Nonmailable Matter\n       This section prohibits a person from sending cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco via the U.S. Postal Service in the \n     continental United States.\n     Section 604. Penal Provisions Regarding Trafficking in \n         Contraband Cigarettes\n       Under the amended Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act \n     (``CCTA''), the threshold amount of non-excise tax-paid \n     cigarettes is lowered to 10,000. CCTA covers smokeless \n     tobacco if the quantity exceeds 500 single-units. Monthly \n     reports must be filed detailing transactions and inventory \n     with the Attorney General and Secretary of Treasury, as well \n     as with state and tribal authorities as appropriate, if \n     monthly delivery sales exceed these contraband thresholds. \n     Seized cigarettes and smokeless tobacco may be used for \n     undercover law enforcement operations. State, local and \n     tribal governments, as well as tobacco manufacturers may \n     prevent and restrain violations of the CCTA in U.S. district \n     courts, in addition to their respective jurisdictions.\n     Section 605. Compliance with Model Statute or Qualifying \n         Statute\n       This section prohibits tobacco manufacturers and importers \n     from participating in transactions occurring in states party \n     to the Master Settlement Agreement (``MSA''), which involve \n     cigarettes manufactured by companies that are not in \n     compliance with the ``qualifying statute'' of the particular \n     MSA state. These statutes require that states neutralize the \n     cost disadvantages of the manufacturers that entered into the \n     MSA due to their escrow payments. State attorneys general may \n     bring actions in the United States district courts to prevent \n     and restrain violations of this section.\n     Section 606. Undercover Criminal Investigations of the Bureau \n         of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n       This section grants BATFE the authority to offset expenses \n     incurred in undercover operations by revenue obtained from \n     the same operation. This will enhance their ability to \n     conduct sting operations. BATFE is also empowered to inspect \n     the records and premises of those who ship, sell, distribute, \n     or receive in interstate commerce any quantity in excess \n     of the contraband threshold, within a single month.\n     Section 607. Inspection by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n         Firearms and Explosives of Records of Certain Cigarette \n         Sellers\n       This section empowers the BATFE to inspect the records and \n     premises of those who ship, sell, distribute, or receive in \n     interstate commerce any quantity in excess of the contraband \n     threshold, within a single month.\n     Section 608. Compliance with Tariff Act of 1930\n     Section 609. Exclusions Regarding Indian Tribes and Tribal \n         Matters\n     Section 610. Effective Date\n       The new authority granted to the BATFE is effective \n     immediately. All other changes are effective 90 days after \n     enactment.\n\n                         TITLE VII--CREATE ACT\n\n     Section 701. Short Title\n       Section 701 authorizes that this bill may be cited as the \n     ``Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) \n     Act of 2004.''\n     Section 702. Collaborative Efforts on Claimed Inventions\n       Section 702 amends Federal patent and trademark law to deem \n     subject matter developed by another person and a claimed \n     invention to have been owned by the same person or subject to \n     an obligation of assignment to the same person, for purposes \n     of provisions that treat inventions of a common owner \n     similarly to inventions made by a single person, if: (1) the \n     claimed invention was made by or on behalf of parties to a \n     joint research agreement (agreement) that was in effect on or \n     before the date the claimed invention was made; (2) the \n     claimed invention was made as a result of activities \n     undertaken within the scope of the agreement; and (3) the \n     application for patent for the claimed invention discloses, \n     or is amended to disclose, the names of the parties to the \n     agreement.\n     Section 703. Effective Date\n       Section 703 applies the CREATE Act to any patents issued \n     after its enactment and does not apply to any pending action \n     before the courts or the Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n     TITLE VIII--PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS AGAINST THEFT AND \n                       EXPROPRIATION ACT OF 2004\n\n     Section 801. Short Title\n       Section 801 authorizes that this bill may be cited as the \n     ``Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and \n     Expropriation Act of 2004''.\n     Section 802. Authorization of Civil Copyright Enforcement by \n         Attorney General\n       Section 802 amends Federal copyright law to authorize the \n     Attorney General (AG) to: (1) commence a civil action against \n     any person who engages in conduct constituting copyright \n     infringement; (2) collect damages and profits resulting from \n     such infringement; and (3) collect\n     Section 803. Authorization of Funding for Training and Pilot \n         Program\n       Section 803 directs the Attorney General to: (1) develop a \n     program to ensure effective implementation and use of the \n     authority for civil enforcement of the copyright laws, \n     including training programs for qualified personnel from the \n     Department of Justice and United States Attorneys Offices; \n     and (2) report annually to Congress on the use of such \n     enforcement authority and progress made in implementing the \n     training programs.\n       Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005.\n\n                   TITLE IX--KOBY MANDELL ACT OF 2004\n\n     Section 901. Short Title\n     Section 902. Definitions\n     Section 903. Establishment of an Office of Justice for \n         Victims of Overseas Terrorism in the Department of \n         Justice\n       Section 903 creates within the DOJ an Office of Justice for \n     Victims of Overseas Terrorism which will assume the \n     responsibility for administration of the Rewards for Justice \n     Program and its website. These offices will offer rewards to \n     capture all terrorists involved in harming American citizens \n     overseas as well as other related services including sending \n     US officials to funerals of American victims of terrorism \n     overseas.\n       Included in this section are reporting requirements to \n     Congress and monitoring of actions by governments and regimes \n     pertaining to terrorists who have harmed American citizens. \n     This section also requires the Office to initiate \n     negotiations to secure compensation for American citizens or \n     their families who were harmed by organizations who claim \n     responsibility for the acts of terrorism.\n       The Office will also be required to monitor the \n     incarceration abroad of terrorists who have harmed American \n     citizens overseas to ensure their incarceration is similar to \n     that condition of incarceration in the United States. As \n     well, this section requires that all terrorists who have \n     harmed Americans overseas are treated by the US government as \n     persona non grata.\n     Section 904. Authorization of Appropriations\n       Section 904 authorizes for 2005-2007 such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this title.\n\n                   TITLE X--SENIOR SAFETY ACT OF 2004\n\n     Section 1001. Short Title\n       The title may be cited as the ``Seniors Safety Act of \n     2004.''\n     Section 1002. Findings and Purposes\n       This section enumerates 14 findings on the incidence of \n     crimes against seniors, the large percentages of seniors who \n     can expect to spend time in nursing homes, the amount of \n     Federal money spent on nursing home care and the estimated \n     losses due to fraud and abuse in the health care industry.\n       The purposes of the Act are to enhance safeguards for \n     pension plans and health benefit programs, prevent and deter \n     criminal activity that results in economic and physical harm \n     to seniors, and ensure appropriate restitution.\n     Section 1003. Definitions\n       Definitions are provided for the following terms: (1) \n     ``Crime'' is defined as any criminal offense under Federal or \n     State law; and (2) ``Senior'' is defined as an individual who \n     is older than 55.\n\n              Subtitle A--Combating Crimes Against Seniors\n\n     Section 1011. Enhanced Sentencing Penalties Based on Age of \n         Victim\n       Directive to the United States Sentencing Commission. The \n     U.S. Sentencing Commission is directed to review and, if \n     appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines applicable to \n     the age or a victim.\n     Section 1012. Study and Report on Health Care Fraud Sentences\n       (a) Directive to the United States Sentencing Commission. \n     The U.S. Sentencing Commission is directed to review and, if \n     appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines applicable to \n     health care fraud offenses.\n       (b) Requirements. During its review, the Sentencing \n     Commission shall: ensure that the guidelines reflect the \n     serious harms associated with health care fraud and the need \n     for law enforcement to prevent such fraud;\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\n     consider enhanced penalties for persons convicted of health \n     care fraud; consult with representatives of industry, \n     judiciary, law enforcement, and victim groups; account for \n     mitigating circumstances; assure reasonable consistency with \n     other relevant directives and guidelines; make any necessary \n     conforming changes; and assure that the guidelines adequately \n     meet the purposes of sentencing.\n       (c) Report. The Sentencing Commission shall report the \n     results of the review required under (a) and include any \n     recommendations for retention or modification of the current \n     penalty levels for health care fraud offenses, by December \n     31, 2004.\n     Section 1013. Increased Penalties for Fraud Resulting in \n         Serious Injury or Death\n       This section increases the penalties under the mail fraud \n     statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, and the wire fraud statute, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1343, for fraudulent schemes that result in \n     serious injury or death. Existing law provides such an \n     enhancement for a narrow class of health care fraud schemes \n     (see 18 U.S.C. 1347). This provision would extend this \n     penalty enhancement to other forms of fraud under the mail \n     and wire fraud statutes that result in death or serious \n     injury. The maximum penalty if serious bodily harm occurred \n     would be up to twenty years; if a death occurred, the maximum \n     penalty would be a life sentence.\n     Section 1014. Safeguarding Pension Plans From Fraud and Theft\n       (a) In General. This section would add new section 1351 to \n     title 18, United States Code.\n       Sec. 1351: Fraud in Relation to Retirement Arrangements.\n       (a) This section defines retirement arrangements and \n     provides an exception for plans established by the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).\n       (b) This section punishes, with up to ten years' \n     imprisonment, the act of defrauding retirement arrangements, \n     or obtaining by means of false or fraudulent pretenses money \n     or property of any retirement arrangement. Retirement \n     arrangements would include employee pension benefit plans \n     under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), \n     qualified retirement plans under section 4974(c) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code (IRC), medical savings accounts under \n     section 220 of the IRC, and funds established within the \n     Thrift Savings Fund. This provision is modeled on existing \n     statutes punishing bank fraud (see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344) and \n     health care fraud (see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1347). Any government \n     plan defined under section 3(32) of title I of the ERISA, \n     except funds established by the Federal Retirement Thrift \n     Investment Board, is exempt from this section.\n       (c) The Attorney General is given authority to investigate \n     offenses under the new section, but this authority expressly \n     does not preclude other appropriate Federal agencies, \n     including the Secretary of Labor, from investigating \n     violations of ERISA.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment. The table of sections for chapter \n     63 of title 18 United States Code, is modified to list new \n     section ``1351. Fraud in relation to retirement \n     arrangements.''\n     Section 1015. Additional Civil Penalties for Defrauding \n         Pension Plans\n       (a) In General. This section would authorize the Attorney \n     General to bring a civil action for a violation, or \n     conspiracy to violate, new section 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1351, \n     relating to retirement fraud. Proof of such a violation \n     established by a preponderance of the evidence would subject \n     the violator to a civil penalty of the greater of the amount \n     of pecuniary gain to the offender, the pecuniary loss to the \n     victim, or up to $50,000 in the case of an individual, \n     or $100,000 for an organization. Imposition of this civil \n     penalty has no effect on other possible remedies.\n       (b) Exception. No civil penalties would be imposed for \n     conduct involving an employee pension plan subject to \n     penalties under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1132.\n       (c) Determination of Penalty Amount. In determining the \n     amount of the penalty, the court is authorized to consider \n     the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to \n     restore all losses to the victims and to pay other important \n     tax or criminal penalties.\n     Section 1016. Punishing Bribery and Graft in Connection with \n         Employee Benefit Plans\n       This section would amend section 1954 of title 18, United \n     States Code, by changing the title to ``Bribery and graft in \n     connection with employee benefit plans,'' and increasing the \n     maximum penalty for bribery and graft in regard to the \n     operation of an employee benefit plan from 3 to 5 years \n     imprisonment. This section also broadens existing law under \n     section 1954 to cover corrupt attempts to give or accept \n     bribery or graft payments, and to proscribe bribery or graft \n     payments to persons exercising de facto influence or control \n     over employee benefit plans. Finally, this amendment \n     clarifies that a violation under section 1954 requires a \n     showing of corrupt intent to influence the actions of the \n     recipient of the bribe or graft.\n\n               Subtitle B--Preventing Telemarketing Fraud\n\n     Section 1021. Centralized Complaint and Consumer Education \n         Service for Victims of Telemarketing Fraud\n       (a) Centralized Service. This section directs the \n     Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission to log the \n     receipt of calls complaining about telemarketing fraud and \n     provide information on telemarketing fraud to such \n     individuals. The FTC is also authorized to provide civil or \n     criminal law enforcement information about specific \n     companies.\n       (b) Fraud Conviction Data. The Attorney General is directed \n     to provide information about corporations and companies that \n     are the subject of civil or criminal law enforcement action \n     for telemarketing fraud, under Federal and state law, to the \n     FTC in electronic format, so that the FTC can enter the \n     information into a database maintained in accordance with \n     section (a).\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations. Authorization is \n     provided for such sums as are necessary to carry out the \n     section.\n     Section 1022. Blocking of Telemarketing Scams\n       (a) Expansion of Scope of Telemarketing Fraud Subject to \n     Enhanced Criminal Penalties. Section 2325 of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by replacing the term ``telephone \n     calls'' with ``wire communication utilizing a telephone \n     service'' to clarify that telemarketing fraud schemes \n     executed using cellular telephone services are subject to the \n     enhanced penalties for such fraud under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2326.\n       (b) Blocking or Termination of Telephone Service Associated \n     With Telemarketing Fraud. This section adds new section 2328 \n     to title 18, United States Code, to authorize the termination \n     of telephone service used to carry on telemarketing fraud, \n     and is similar to the legal authority provided under 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1084(d), regarding termination of telephone \n     service used to engage in illegal gambling. The new section \n     2328 requires telephone companies, upon notification in \n     writing from the Department of Justice that a particular \n     phone number is being used to engage in fraudulent \n     telemarketing or other fraudulent conduct, and after notice \n     to the customer, to terminate the subscriber's telephone \n     service. The common carrier is exempt from civil and criminal \n     penalties for any actions taken in compliance with any notice \n     received from the Justice Department under this section. \n     Persons affected by termination may seek an appropriate \n     determination in Federal court that the service should not be \n     discontinued or removed, and the court may direct the \n     Department of Justice to present evidence supporting the \n     notification of termination. Definitions are provided for \n     ``wire communication facility'' and ``reasonable notice to \n     the subscriber.''\n\n  TITLE XI--FEDERAL PROSECUTORS RETIREMENT BENEFIT EQUITY ACT OF 2004\n\n     Section 1101. Short Title\n       This title may be called the ``Federal Prosecutors \n     Retirement Benefit Equity Act.''\n     Section 1102. Retirement Treatment of Federal Prosecutors\n       Amends the definition of law enforcement officer to include \n     prosecutors for retirement purposes.\n     Section 1103. Provisions Relating to Incumbents\n       Defines ``federal prosecutor'' to include assistant United \n     States Attorneys and attorneys at the Department of Justice \n     designated by the Attorney General under the conditions set \n     out in this title. The change takes effect upon enactment of \n     the bill. This section also sets a time limit for the \n     attorneys to elect to opt out.\n     Section 1104. Department of Justice Administrative Actions\n       Directs the Attorney General to consult with the Office of \n     Personnel Management on this title and make regulations.\n\n         TITLE XII--ANTI-ATROCITY ALIEN DEPORTATION ACT OF 2004\n\n     Section 1201. Short Title\n       This title may be cited as the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien \n     Deportation Act of 2004.''\n     Section 1202. Inadmissibility and Deportability of Aliens Who \n         Have Committed Acts of Torture or Extrajudicial Killing \n         Abroad\n       Currently, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \n     provides that (i) participants in Nazi persecutions during \n     the time period from March 23, 1933 to May 8, 1945, and (ii) \n     aliens who engaged in genocide, are inadmissible to the \n     United States. See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i) and (ii). \n     Current law also provides that aliens who have participated \n     in Nazi persecutions or engaged in genocide are deportable. \n     See Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The bill would amend these sections \n     of the INA by expanding the grounds for inadmissibility and \n     deportation to cover aliens who have committed, ordered, \n     incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the \n     commission of acts of torture or extrajudicial killing abroad \n     and clarify and expand the scope of the genocide bar.\n       Subsection (a) would first amend the definition of \n     ``genocide'' in clause (ii) of section 212(a)(3) of the INA, \n     8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E)(ii). Currently, the ground of \n     inadmissibility relating to genocide refers to the definition \n     in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \n     Crime of Genocide. Article III of that Convention punishes \n     genocide, the conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and \n     public incitement to commit genocide, attempts to commit \n     genocide, and complicity in genocide. The bill would modify \n     the definition to refer instead to the ``genocide'' \n     definition in section 1091 (a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, which was adopted to implement United States \n     obligations under the Convention and also prohibits attempts \n     and conspiracies to commit genocide.\n       Specifically, section 1091 (a) defines genocide as \n     ``whoever, whether in time of peace or in time of war, . . . \n     with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in \n     substantial\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\n     part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group as such: \n     (1) kills members of that group; (2) causes serious bodily \n     injury to members of that group; (3) causes the permanent \n     impairment of the mental faculties of members of the group \n     through drugs, torture, or similar techniques; (4) subjects \n     the group to conditions of life that are intended to cause \n     the physical destruction of the group in whole or in part; \n     (5) imposes measures intended to prevent births within the \n     group; or (6) transfers by force children of the group to \n     another group.'' This definition includes genocide by public \n     or private individuals in times of peace or war. While the \n     federal criminal statute is limited to those offenses \n     committed within the United States or offenders who are U.S. \n     nationals, see 18 U.S.C. 1091(d), the grounds for \n     inadmissibility in the bill would apply to such offenses \n     committed outside the United States that would otherwise be a \n     crime if committed within the United States or by a U.S. \n     national.\n       In addition, the bill would broaden the reach of the \n     inadmissibility bar to apply not only to those who ``engaged \n     in genocide,'' as in current law, but also to cover any alien \n     who has ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated \n     in genocide abroad. This broader scope will ensure that the \n     genocide provision addresses a more appropriate range of \n     levels of complicity.\n       Second, subsection (a) would add a new clause to 8 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E) that would trigger operation of the \n     inadmissibility ground if an alien has ``committed, ordered, \n     incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in'' acts of \n     torture, as defined in section 2430 of title 18, United \n     States Code, or extrajudicial killings, as defined in section \n     3(a) the Torture Victim Protection Act. The statutory \n     language--``committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or \n     otherwise participated in''--is intended to reach the \n     behavior of persons directly or personally associated with \n     the covered acts, including those with command \n     responsibility. Command responsibility holds a commander \n     responsible for unlawful acts when (1) the forces who \n     committed the abuses were subordinates of the commander \n     (i.e., the forces were under his control either as a matter \n     of law or as a matter of fact); (2) the commander knew, or, \n     in light of the circumstances at the time, should have known, \n     that subordinates had committed, were committing, or were \n     about to commit unlawful acts; and (3) the commander failed \n     to prove that he had taken the necessary and reasonable \n     measures to (a) prevent or stop subordinates from committing \n     such acts, or (b) investigate the acts committed by \n     subordinates in a genuine effort to punish the perpetrators. \n     Attempts and conspiracies to commit these crimes are \n     encompassed in the ``otherwise participated in'' language. \n     This language addresses an appropriate range of levels of \n     complicity for which aliens should be held accountable, and \n     has been the subject of extensive judicial interpretation and \n     construction. See Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S. 490, \n     514 (1981); Kalejs v.INS, 10 F.3d 441, 444 (7th Cir. 1993); \n     U.S. v. Schmidt, 923 F. 2d 1253, 1257-59 (7th Cir. 1991); \n     Kulle v. INS, 825 F. 2d 1188, 1192 (7th Cir. 1987).\n       The definitions of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial \n     killing'' are contained in the Torture Victim Protection Act, \n     which served as the implementing legislation when the United \n     States joined the United Nations' ``Convention Against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment.'' This Convention entered into force with respect \n     to the United States on November 20, 1992 and imposes an \n     affirmative duty on the United States to prosecute torturers \n     within its jurisdiction. The Torture Victim Protection Act \n     provides both criminal liability and civil liability for \n     persons who, acting outside the United States and under \n     actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign \n     nation, commit torture or extrajudicial killing.\n       The criminal provision passed as part of the Torture Victim \n     Protection Act defines ``torture'' to mean ``an act committed \n     by a person acting under the color of law specifically \n     intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or \n     suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful \n     sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical \n     control.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340(1). ``Severe mental pain or \n     suffering'' is further defined to mean the ``prolonged mental \n     harm caused by or resulting from (A) the intentional \n     infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain \n     or suffering; (B) the administration or application, or \n     threatened administration or application, of mind-altering \n     substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt \n     profoundly the senses or personality; and (C) the threat of \n     imminent death; or (D) the threat that another person will \n     imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or \n     suffering, or the administration or application of mind-\n     altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt \n     profoundly the senses or personality.'' 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2340(2).\n       The bill also incorporates the definition of \n     ``extrajudicial killing'' from section 3(a) of the Torture \n     Victim Protection Act. This law establishes civil liability \n     for wrongful death against any person ``who, under actual or \n     apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation . \n     . . subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing,'' which \n     is defined to mean ``a deliberated killing not authorized by \n     a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted \n     court affording all the judicial guarantees which are \n     recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, \n     however, does not include any such killing that, under \n     international law, is lawfully carried out under the \n     authority of a foreign nation.''\n       Both definitions of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial \n     killing'' require that the alien be acting under color of \n     law. A criminal conviction, criminal charge or a confession \n     are not required for an alien to be inadmissible or removable \n     under the new grounds added in this subsection of the bill.\n       The final paragraph in subsection (a) would modify the \n     subparagraph heading to clarify the expansion of the grounds \n     for in admissibility from ``participation in Nazi persecution \n     or genocide'' to cover ``torture or extrajudicial killing.''\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 237(a)(4)(D) of the INA, \n     8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D), which enumerates grounds for \n     deporting aliens who have been admitted into or are present \n     in the United States. The same conduct that would constitute \n     a basis of inadmissibility under subsection (a) is a ground \n     for deportability under this subsection of the bill. Under \n     current law, assisting in Nazi persecution and engaging in \n     genocide are already grounds for deportation. The bill would \n     provide that aliens who have committed any act of torture or \n     extrajudicial killing would also be subject to deportation. \n     In any deportation proceeding, the burden would remain on the \n     government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     alien's conduct brings the alien within a particular ground \n     of deportation.\n       Subsection (c) regarding the ``effective date'' clearly \n     states that these provisions apply to acts committed before, \n     on, or after the date this legislation is enacted. These \n     provisions apply to all cases after enactment, even where the \n     acts in question occurred or where adjudication procedures \n     within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the \n     Executive Office of Immigration Review were initiated prior \n     to the time of enactment.\n     Section 1203. Inadmissibilty and Deportability of Foreign \n         Government Officials Who Have Committed Particularly \n         Severe Violations of Religious Freedom\n       This section of the bill would amend section 212(a)(2)(G) \n     of the INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(2)(G), which was added as \n     part of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 \n     (IFRA), to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and \n     deportability of aliens who commit particularly severe \n     violations of religious freedom. Current law bars the \n     admission of an individual who, while serving as a foreign \n     government official, was responsible for or directly carried \n     out particularly severe violations of religious freedom \n     within the last 24 months. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(c)(2)(G). The \n     existing provision also bars from admission the individual's \n     spouse and children, if any. ``Particularly severe violations \n     of religious freedom'' is defined in section 3 of IFRA to \n     mean systematic, ongoing, egregious violation of religious \n     freedom, including violations such as (A) torture or cruel, \n     inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; (B) prolonged \n     detention without charges; (C) causing the disappearance of \n     persons or clandestine detention of those persons; or (D) \n     other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the \n     security of persons. While IRFA contains numerous provisions \n     to promote religious freedom and prevent violations of \n     religious freedom throughout the world, including a wide \n     range of diplomatic sanctions and other formal expressions of \n     disapproval, section 212 (a)(2)(G) is the only provision \n     which specifically targets individual abusers.\n       Subsection (a) would delete the 24-month restriction in \n     section 212 (a)(2)(G) since it limits the accountability, for \n     purposes of admission, to a two-year period. This limitation \n     is not consistent with the strong stance of the United States \n     to promote religious freedom throughout the world. \n     Individuals who have committed particularly severe violations \n     of religious freedom should be held accountable for their \n     actions and should not be admissible to the United States \n     regardless of when the conduct occurred.\n       In addition, this subsection would amend the law to remove \n     the current bar to admission for the spouse or children of a \n     foreign government official who has been involved in \n     particularly severe violations of religious freedom. The bar \n     of inadmissibility is a serious sanction that should not \n     apply to individuals because of familial relationships that \n     are not within an individual's control. None of the other \n     grounds relating to serious human rights abuse prevent the \n     spouse or child of an abuser from entering or remaining \n     lawfully in the United States. Moreover, the purpose of these \n     amendments is to make those who have participated in \n     atrocities accountable for their actions. That purpose is not \n     served by holding the family members of such individuals \n     accountable for the offensive conduct over which they had no \n     control.\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 237(a)(4) of the INA, 8 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1227(a)(4), which enumerates grounds for \n     deporting aliens who have been admitted into or are present \n     in the United States, to add a new clause (E), which provides \n     for the deportation of aliens described in subsection (a) of \n     the bill.\n       The bill does not change the effective date for this \n     provision set forth in the original IFRA, which applies the \n     operation of the amendment to aliens ``seeking to enter the \n     United States on or after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.''\n     Section 1204. Waiver of Inadmissibility\n       Under current law, most aliens who are otherwise \n     inadmissible may receive a waiver\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\n     under section 212(d)(3) of the INA to enter the nation as a \n     nonimmigrant, where the Secretary of State recommends it and \n     the Attorney General approves. Participants in Nazi \n     persecutions or genocide, however, are not eligible for such \n     a waiver. Our bill retains that prohibition. It does allow \n     for the possibility, however, of waivers for those who commit \n     acts of torture or extrajudicial killings.\n     Section 1205. Bar to Good Moral Character, Asylum and Refugee \n         Status, and Withholding of Removal for Aliens Who Have \n         Committed Acts of Torture, Extrajudicial Killings, or \n         Severe Violations of Religious Freedom\n       This section of the bill would amend section 101 (f) of the \n     INA, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(f), which defines ``good moral \n     character,'' to make clear that aliens who have committed \n     torture, extrajudicial killing, or severe violation of \n     religious freedom abroad do not qualify. Good moral character \n     is a prerequisite for certain forms of immigration relief, \n     including naturalization, cancellation of removal for \n     nonpermanent residents, and voluntary departure at the \n     conclusion of removal proceedings. Aliens who have committed \n     torture or extrajudicial killing, or severe violations of \n     religious freedom abroad cannot establish good moral \n     character. Accordingly, this amendment prevents aliens \n     covered by the amendments made in sections 2 and 3 of the \n     bill from becoming United States citizens or benefiting from \n     cancellation of removal or voluntary departure. Absent such \n     an amendment there is no statutory bar to naturalization \n     for aliens covered by the proposed new grounds for \n     inadmissibility and deportation.\n       It would also make aliens who are inadmissible under \n     section 212(a)(3)(E) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E), \n     ineligible for asylum, refugee status, or withholding of \n     removal.\n     Section 1206. Establishment of the Office of Special \n         Investigations\n       Attorney General Civiletti established OSI in 1979 within \n     the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, \n     consolidating within it all ``investigative and litigation \n     activities involving individuals, who prior to and during \n     World War II, under the supervision of or in association with \n     the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other \n     affiliatated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered, \n     incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the \n     persecution of any person because of race, religion, national \n     origin, or political opinion.'' (Att'y Gen. Order No. 85179). \n     The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that Attorney \n     General Order.\n       Subsection (a) would first amend the INA, 8 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1103, by directing the Attorney General to establish an \n     Office of Special Investigations within the Department of \n     Justice with authorization to denaturalize any alien who has \n     participated in Nazi persecution, genocide, torture or \n     extrajudicial killing abroad. This would not only provide \n     statutory authorization for OSI, but also expand OSI's \n     current authorized mission beyond Nazi war criminals.\n       The second part of this subsection would require the \n     Attorney General to consult with the Secretary of the \n     Department of Homeland Security before making decisions about \n     prosecution or extradition of the aliens covered by this \n     bill. The third part of this subsection sets forth specific \n     considerations in determining the appropriate legal action to \n     take against an alien who has participated in Nazi \n     persecution, genocide, torture or extrajudicial killing \n     abroad. Significantly, in order to fulfill the United States' \n     obligation under the ``Convention Against Torture and Other \n     Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment'' to hold \n     accountable torturers found in this country, the bill \n     expressly directs the Department of Justice to consider the \n     availability of prosecution under United States laws for any \n     conduct that forms the basis for removal and \n     denaturalization. In addition, the Department is directed to \n     consider extradition to foreign jurisdictions that are \n     prepared to undertake such a prosecution. Statutory and \n     regulatory provisions to implement Article 3 of the \n     Convention Against Torture, which prohibits the removal of \n     any person to a country where he or she would be tortured, \n     must also be part of this consideration.\n       Subsection (b) authorizes additional funds for these \n     expanded duties to ensure that OSI fulfills its continuing \n     obligations regarding Nazi war criminals.\n     Section 1207. Reports on Implementation of the Act\n       This section of the bill would direct the Attorney General, \n     in consultation with the Homeland Security Secretary, to \n     report within six months on implementation of the Act, \n     including procedures for referral of matters to OSI, any \n     revisions made to INS forms to reflect amendments made by the \n     bill, and the procedures developed, with adequate due process \n     protection, to obtain sufficient evidence and determine \n     whether an alien is deemed inadmissible under the bill.\n       It also requires the Attorney General and the DHS Secretary \n     to report annually on the number of criminal investigations \n     and prosecutions undertaken pursuant to the Act, the number \n     of persons removed from or denied admission to the United \n     States pursuant to the Act, and the nationality of those \n     persons.\n\n                        TITLE XIII--PROMISE ACT\n\n     Section 1301. Short Title\n       This title may be called the ``Parental Responsibility \n     Obligations Met through Immigration System Enforcement Act'' \n     or ``PROMISE Act''.\n     Section 1302. Aliens Ineligible to Receive Visas and Excluded \n         from Admission for Non-Payment of Child Support\n       Section 1302 amends INA Sec. 212(a) so that aliens who are \n     in violation of court order to pay child support are \n     inadmissible. This section defines child support order to \n     include orders from a court in the United States as well as \n     any foreign country, if a reciprocity agreement exists \n     between that country and the United States or any individual \n     State. The applicant for admission may become admissible by \n     satisfying the outstanding child support debt, or by entering \n     into an approved payment arrangement.\n     Section 1303. Authority to Parole Aliens Excluded from \n         Admission for Non-Payment of Child Support\n       Section 1303 allows for the alien's physical return to the \n     United States in the event that it is crucial to his ability \n     to pay child support, the Secretary of DHS may parole the \n     alien, but the alien will be subject to removal until he \n     meets his support obligations.\n     Section 1304. Effect of Non-Payment of Child Support on \n         Establishment of Good Moral Character\n       Section 1304 amends INA Sec. 101(f) so that an alien who is \n     not in compliance with a court order to pay child support \n     does not possess good moral character. This provision \n     includes agreements in the United States and in any foreign \n     country, if a reciprocity agreement exists between that \n     country and the United States or any individual State. The \n     alien would be unable to obtain certain immigration benefits, \n     the most important of which is U.S. citizenship, without \n     being able to demonstrate statutory good moral character.\n     Section 1305. Authorization to Serve Legal Process in Child \n         Support Cases on Certain Visa Applicants and Arriving \n         Aliens\n       Section 1305 authorizes immigration officers to serve on \n     any alien seeking admission to the United States legal \n     process with respect to any action to enforce or to establish \n     a legal obligation of an individual to pay child support.\n     Section 1306. Authorization to Obtain Information on Child \n         Support Payments by Aliens\n       Section 1306 grants the Secretaries of State and Homeland \n     Security as well as the Attorney General access to child \n     support payment information of an alien seeking an \n     immigration benefit.\n     Section 1307. Effective Date\n       The provisions of this title shall be effective 90 days \n     after enactment.\n\n                  TITLE XIV--FALLEN HEROES OF 9/11 ACT\n\n     Section 1401. Short Title\n       Section 1401 authorizes that this bill may be cited as the \n     ``Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Act.''\n     Section 1402. Congressional Findings\n     Section 1403. Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Congressional Medals\n       Authorizes the President to present to the personal \n     representative or next of kin of each individual who died on \n     or after September 11, 2001, as a direct result of the act of \n     terrorism within the United States on that date, a Fallen \n     Heroes of 9/11 Congressional Medal in recognition of their \n     sacrifice and to honor their deaths.\n     Section 1404. Duplicate Medals\n       Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to strike: (1) three \n     medals to honor victims of the attack at the World Trade \n     Center (WTC), victims aboard United Airlines Flight 93 that \n     crashed in Pennsylvania, and victims at the Pentagon; and (2) \n     duplicate medals for presentation to each precinct house, \n     firehouse, emergency response station, or other duty station \n     or place of employment to which officers, emergency workers, \n     and other employees of the U.S. Government and of State and \n     local government agencies (including the Port Authority of \n     New York and New Jersey) and others who responded to and \n     perished as a direct result of the WTC attacks were assigned \n     on September 11, 2001.\n     Section 1405. Establishment of Lists of Recipients\n       Directs the Secretary of Treasury to establish a list of \n     individuals eligible under section 1604 and add individuals \n     as they subsequently become eligible.\n     Section 1406. Sales to the Public to Defray Costs\n       Directs the Secretary of Treasury to strike and sell \n     duplicate medals to the public to defray the costs of \n     production.\n     Section 1407. National Medals\n       The medals struck pursuant to this title are national \n     medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United 11 \n     States Code.\n\n                   TITLE XV--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     Section 1501. Technical Amendments Relating to Public Law \n         107-56\n       Section 1501 makes a series of technical amendments to \n     Public Law No. 107-56, the USA PATRIOT Act.\n     Section 1502. Miscellaneous Technical Amendments\n       Section 1502 makes a series of technical amendments to \n     Title 18 and Title 28, and it also repeals a duplicative \n     authorization of a sexual abuse prevention program for \n     runaway children which has recently been reauthorized in \n     another statute. Sec. 117(b) of Pub. L. No. 108-96.\n\n[[Page S9948]]\n\n     Section 1503. Minor Substantive Amendment Relating to \n         Contents of FBI Annual Report\n       Section 1503 adds a requirement that the FBI include the \n     number of personnel receiving danger pay in its annual \n     report.\n     Section 1504. Use of Federal Training Facilities\n       Section 1504 is intended to ensure that the Justice \n     Department uses the most cost-effective training and meeting \n     facilities for its employees. For any predominantly internal \n     training subsection (a) requires the Justice Department to \n     use only a facility that does not require a payment to a \n     private entity for the use of such facility, unless \n     specifically authorized in writing by the Attorney General. \n     Subsection (b) requires the Attorney General to prepare an \n     annual report to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the \n     House and Senate Judiciary Committees that details each \n     training requiring authorization under subsection (a). The \n     report must include an explanation of why the facility was \n     chosen and a breakdown of any expenditures incurred in excess \n     of the cost of conducting the training at a facility that did \n     not require such authorization.\n     Section 1505. Technical Correction Relating to Definition \n         Used in ``Terrorism Transcending National Boundaries'' \n         Statute\n       Makes technical changes to 18 USC 1958.\n     Section 1506. Increased Penalties and Expanded Jurisdiction \n         for Sexual Abuse Offenses in Correctional Facilities\n       Section 1506 increases the penalties for sexual abuse \n     within federal correction facilities and those who are held \n     by the Bureau of Prisons.\n     Section 1507. Expanded Jurisdiction for Contraband Offenses \n         in Correctional Facilities\n       Section 1507 expands the jurisdiction for contraband \n     offenses in correctional facilities to include those in the \n     custody of or in a facility under the control of the Attorney \n     General and the Bureau of Prisons.\n     Section 1508. Magistrate Judge's Authority To Continue \n         Preliminary Hearing\n       Amends 18 USC 3060(c) to include a provision to allow a \n     magistrate judge to extend a preliminary hearing without the \n     consent of the accused after a showing of extraordinary \n     circumstances.\n     Section 1509. Boys and Girls Clubs of America\n       Section 1509 reauthorizes the Boys and Girls Club of \n     America through 2010 and increases the minimum number of \n     clubs that must exist nationwide.\n     Section 1510. Authority of the Inspectors General\n       Section 1510 amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 to allow \n     Inspectors General to provide assistance to the National \n     Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n     Section 1511. Foreign Student Visas\n       This section would allow foreign students participating in \n     ``distance learning'' programs at U.S. colleges and \n     universities to enter the United States for up to 30 days on \n     an ``F'' visa, in order to pursue their studies. Such aliens \n     would be ineligible to change their nonimmigrant \n     classification while in the United States.\n     Section 1512. Pre-Release Custody of Prisoners\n       This provision corrects an anomaly that developed in the \n     law that prevents the BOP from exercising their previous \n     ability to place convicts in community correctional \n     facilities for a small part of the final portion of their \n     sentences, so as to facilitate a smoother transition back \n     into society.\n     Section 1513. FBI Translator Reporting Requirement\n       Section 1513 amends section 205 of the USA PATRIOT Act \n     regarding an important reporting requirement by the Attorney \n     General to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees about \n     (1) the number of translators employed by the FBI, (2) legal \n     and practical impediments to using translators employed by \n     other Federal, State, or local agencies, on a full, part-\n     time, or shared basis, and (3) the needs of the FBI for \n     specific translation services in certain languages, and \n     recommendations for meeting those needs. This section \n     clarifies the deadline for the report, makes such reporting \n     an annual requirement and expands the reporting requirement \n     to include translators contracted by the government.\n     Section 1514. Amendment to Victims of Child Abuse Act\n       Section 1514 provides specific guidance on what information \n     is required to be reported to the CyberTipline to include \n     information on the content and images of the apparent \n     violation, the Internet Protocol Address, the date and time \n     associated with the violation, and specific contact \n     information for the sender. In 1999, Congress established a \n     statutory ``duty to report'' evidence of apparent violations \n     of child pornography laws by Internet Service Providers \n     (ISPs) to the CyberTipline which is operated by the National \n     Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).\n     Section 1515. Development of an Information System Interstate \n         Compact for Adult Offender Supervision\n       This section supports the development of an information \n     sharing system between states to support the exchange of \n     information on offenders seeking and completing transfer from \n     one state to another through the Interstate Compact for Adult \n     Offender Supervision. This system will (1) establish a system \n     of uniform data collection; (2) allow instant and real time \n     access to information on active criminal cases by criminal \n     justice officials; (3) provide regular reporting of Compact \n     activities to heads of state councils, state executive, \n     judicial and legislative leaders and criminal justice \n     administrators; and (4) will be designed to integrate with \n     current and future national, state, and local information \n     systems.\n\n   TITLE XVI--REAUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION BOARD\n\n     Section 1601. Short Title\n       Section 1601 sets forth the short title of Title XVII, the \n     ``National Film Preservation Act of 2004.''\n     Section 1602. Reauthorization and Amendment\n       Section 1602 generally reauthorizes the National Film \n     Preservation Board and directs the Librarian of Congress to \n     continue the National Film Registry, established and \n     maintained under the National Film Preservation Acts of 1988, \n     1992 and 1996, to maintain and preserve films that are \n     culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\n       Section 1602(a) clarifies that the National Film Registry \n     seal may be used with all formats of Registry films (e.g., \n     film, video, DVD), inserts language regarding copyright \n     ownership of Registry films that is consistent with a similar \n     provision under the Sound Recording Preservation Act of 2000 \n     [P.L. 106-474]; and sets forth, among current duties and \n     powers of the Librarian under this title, new duties, \n     parallel to those under the Sound Recording Preservation \n     Act, to make registry films more broadly accessible for \n     research and educational purposes, to review the \n     comprehensive national plan developed under the National \n     Film Preservation Act of 1992 and amend it to the extent \n     necessary to ensure that it addresses technological \n     advances in film preservation and storage, and to \n     undertake initiatives to ensure preservation of the \n     nation's moving image heritage, in concert with efforts of \n     the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC) of \n     the Library of Congress and other organizations.\n       Section 1602(b) amends the National Film Preservation Board \n     to increase Board membership from 20 to 22 members, and \n     amends the provision governing reimbursement of expenses so \n     that it is consistent with the corresponding provision of the \n     Sound Recording Preservation Act of 2000. The two new members \n     are at-large members appointed by the Librarian.\n       Section 1602(c) incorporates parallel language from the \n     Sound Recording Preservation Act of 2000, requiring the \n     Librarian to utilize the NAVCC to ensure proper storage, \n     preservation and dissemination of Registry films.\n       Section 1602(d) clarifies that the National Film Registry \n     seal may be used with all formats of Registry films (e.g., \n     film, video, DVD).\n       Section 1602(e) extends the authorization of the National \n     Film Preservation Act for 10 years from the effective date of \n     this Act, by striking the 7-year authorization period under \n     the 1996 Act and substituting a 17-year period, dating from \n     the 1996 Act effective date.\n\n     TITLE XVII--REAUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION \n                               FOUNDATION\n\n     Section 1701. Short Title\n       Section 1701 sets forth the short title of Title XV111, the \n     ``National Film Preservation Foundation Reauthorization Act \n     of 2004.''\n     Section 1702. Reauthorization and Amendment\n       Section 1702(a) increases the Foundation's Board of \n     Directors from nine to twelve, and allowing Board members to \n     serve an unlimited number of terms.\n       Section 1702(b) and (c) permit the Board to incorporate the \n     foundation in any location, rather than only in the District \n     of Columbia.\n       Section 1702(d) increases the authorized appropriations \n     level for federal matching funds for the Foundation from \n     $250,000 per year to: $500,000 in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, \n     and $1 million for fiscal years 2006 through 2013.\n\n                         TITLE XVII--DREAM ACT\n\n     Section 1801. Short Title\n       This title may be called the ``Development, Relief, and \n     Education for Alien Minors Act.''\n     Section 1802. Definition of an Institute of Higher Education\n       This section explains that ``institution of higher \n     education'' is defined by the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n     Section 1803. Restoration of State Option To Determine \n         Residency for the Purposes of Higher Education Benefits\n       Section 1803 repeals IIRIRA Sec. 505, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1623. \n     Each state is free to determine whom it deems a resident for \n     the purpose of determining in-state tuition. The DREAM Act \n     does not compel states to offer in-state tuition to \n     undocumented aliens, nor does it prevent states from offering \n     in-state tuition to anyone else.\n     Section 1804. Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of \n         Status of Certain Long-Term Residents Who Entered the \n         United States as Children\n       Section 1804 provides that applicants may qualify for an \n     initial conditional period of six years during which they can \n     earn permanent resident status if they entered the United \n     States at least five years prior to enactment, were under 16 \n     years of age at the time of entry and are not inadmissible or \n     deportable for specifically enumerated\n\n[[Page S9949]]\n\n     grounds. There is a limited waiver only applicable for \n     grounds of inadmissibility under Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (INA) Sec. 212(a)(6) or deportability under INA \n     Sec. 237(a)(1), (3), and (6). The applicant must also have \n     graduated from high school, obtained a GED, or be admitted to \n     an institution of higher learning as defined in 20 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1001. Additionally, the secondary and higher education \n     institutions must be located within the United States. \n     Persons previously ordered deported are not eligible for \n     adjustment of status under this Act. Exceptions are made for \n     those who remain within the United States with the U.S. \n     government's consent or who received the deportation order \n     while under the age of sixteen. This section also contains a \n     physical presence requirement that the applicant must not \n     have been out of the United States for more than ninety days \n     in one visit, or one hundred and eighty days in the aggregate \n     during the five-year period. There is a possible waiver of \n     this requirement if the applicant shows exceptional \n     circumstances no less compelling than serious illness to \n     self, or death or serious illness to an immediate family \n     member.\n     Section 1805. Conditional Permanent Residence Status\n       Section 1805 provides the ways through which conditional \n     residents, after proving themselves worthy after six years, \n     may become permanent residents. The ways are to earn a degree \n     from an institution of higher education or to complete two \n     years in a bachelor's or higher program, or to serve \n     honorably in the military for at least two years. The \n     applicant may obtain a waiver for these requirements but only \n     at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security or \n     the Attorney General and only if applicant demonstrates \n     ``exceptional and extreme unusual hardship.'' In addition, \n     the applicant must maintain a clean record, meaning no crime \n     or other misdeed that would render the applicant deportable \n     or inadmissible. The alien cannot be a public charge \n     during the six-year period. The applicant also must \n     maintain continuous residence, as defined by this act, in \n     the United States. If the applicant successfully completes \n     the enumerated requirements, the six-year conditional \n     period also satisfies the residency requirements for \n     naturalization, subject to the limitations set forth in \n     section 316 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n     Section 1806. Retroactive Benefits Under this Act\n       Section 1806 provides that if at the time of enactment an \n     alien has already satisfied all requirements under sections \n     1804 and 1805 (meaning that the alien has already ``passed \n     the test'' and has proven himself or herself worthy of the \n     DREAM Act benefits) then that alien can adjust to permanent \n     resident status without going to school or serving in the \n     military again. Those who benefit from this ``grandfather'' \n     clause must undergo the six-year conditional period and \n     comply with all other requirements.\n     Section 1807. Exclusive Jurisdiction\n       Section 1807 provides that the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security has jurisdiction to adjudicate affirmative \n     applications for benefits, but the jurisdiction transfers to \n     the EOIR under the DOJ when the applicant is in removal \n     proceedings. The DREAM Act benefits will be available \n     defensively to those in proceedings. Children 12 years of age \n     or older who satisfy all other requirements of this act but \n     who are still enrolled full time in school shall be granted a \n     stay of proceedings by the EOIR. To the extent permissible \n     under existing law, a child whose removal proceedings are \n     stayed may obtain work authorization. Section 1807 does not \n     preempt any existing federal or state labor laws, including \n     laws governing minimum age to work.\n     Section 1808. Penalties for False Statements in Application\n       Section 1808 provides for criminal penalties for falsifying \n     the application including fine or imprisonment or both.\n     Section 1809. Confidentiality of Information\n       Section 1809 contains a confidentiality clause. The \n     Government is not permitted to use information gathered in \n     processing an application under the DREAM Act to initiate \n     removal proceedings against anyone. Violation of the \n     confidentiality agreement would result in a fine up to \n     $10,000. However, information sharing is permissible for the \n     purpose of investigating a crime or a national security \n     breach. Information also may be disseminated to a coroner for \n     the purpose of identifying the deceased.\n     Section 1810. Expedited Processing of Applications; \n         Prohibition on Fees\n       Section 1810 prohibits the collection of an application \n     fee.\n     Section 1811. SERVIS Registration\n       Section 1811 requires an institution of higher education to \n     register any student it enrolls who is a beneficiary under \n     this Act in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information \n     System (SEVIS).\n     Section 1812. Higher Education Assistance\n       Section 1812 limits the types of federal financial \n     assistance that beneficiaries may receive. This section \n     limits federal financial assistance under Title IV of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 to student loans under Parts B \n     and D, and work study programs under Part C of Title IV.\n     Section 1813. GAO Report\n       Section 1813 requires the Government Accounting Office \n     (GAO) to produce a study, seven years after enactment, \n     concerning the number of aliens who apply for and receive \n     benefits under this Act.\n\n                          TITLE XIX--DRU'S LAW\n\n     Section 1901. Short Title\n       This title may be called the Dru Sjodin National Sex \n     Offender Public Database Act of 2004, or Dru's Law\n     Section 1902. Definitions\n     Section 1903. Availability of the NSOR Database to the Public\n     Section 1904. Release of High Risk Inmates\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with Senator \nHatch the ``Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, \nfiscal years 2005 through 2007.'' I thank Senator Hatch, the Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, for support of this legislation.\n  In the 107th Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives \nproperly authorized spending for the entire Department of Justice, \n``DOJ'' or the ``Department'', for the first time since 1979. Congress \nextended that authorization in 1980 and 1981. Until 2002 Congress had \nnot passed nor had the President signed an authorization bill for the \nDepartment. In fact, there were a number of years where Congress failed \nto consider any Department authorization bill. This 23-year failure to \nproperly reauthorize the Department forced the appropriations \ncommittees in both houses to reauthorize and appropriate money.\n  We ceded the authorization power to the appropriators for too long, \nbut in the 107th Congress Senator Hatch and I joined forces with House \nJudiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers to create \nand pass bipartisan legislation that reaffirmed the authorizing \nauthority and responsibility of the House and Senate Judiciary \nCommittees--the ``21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act,'' Public Law 107-273. A new era of oversight began \nwith that new charter for the Justice Department, with the Senate and \nHouse Judiciary Committees taking active new roles in setting the \npriorities and monitoring the operations of the Department of Justice, \nthe FBI and other law enforcement agencies, and that bill helped our \noversight duties in many ways. And, as we have learned in the past \nthree years, the fight against terrorism makes constructive oversight \nmore important than ever before.\n  Already this Congress, House Judiciary Committee Chairman \nSensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers have authored and shepherded \nthrough the House of Representatives a new Department of Justice \nAppropriations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2006, \nH.R. 3036. I commend both Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member \nConyers for working in a bipartisan manner to pass that legislation in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The ``Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Fiscal \nYears 2005 through 2007,'' is a comprehensive authorization of the \nDepartment based on H.R. 3036 as passed by the House of Representatives \non March 30, 2004. Our bipartisan legislation would authorize \nappropriations for the Department for fiscal years 2005 through 2007, \nprovide permanent enabling authorities which will allow the Department \nto efficiently carry out its mission, clarify and harmonize existing \nstatutory authority, and repeal obsolete statutory authorities. The \nbill also establishes certain reporting requirements and other \nmechanisms intended to better enable the Congress and the Department to \noversee the operations of the Department. Finally, our bill \nincorporates numerous other pieces of legislation on such issues as \npreventing--and recovering missing children, cigarette trafficking, \nintellectual property, going after terrorists who commit violent acts \nagainst American citizens overseas, among others--currently pending \nbefore Congress that enjoy strong bipartisan support.\n  I will now highlight a number of the provisions that make up this \nauthorization bill.\n  Title I of our bill authorizes appropriations for the Department of \nJustice for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2007. With minor \nexceptions, these authorizations generally reflect the President's \nbudget request.\n  Title II makes numerous improvements and upgrades to the Department's \ngrant programs that assist law\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\nenforcement and criminal justice agencies; build community capacity to \nprevent, reduce and control crime; assist victims of crime; and prevent \ncrime.\n  We decided to combine the current Byrne formula grant, Byrne \ndiscretionary grant and Local Law Enforcement Block Grant, (LLEBG), \nprograms into one Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram with an authorization of $1.075 billion and a list of 35 uses--\na combination of the traditional Byrne and LLEBG grants regulations--\nfor which these grants may be used.\n  I am a longtime supporter of the Edward Byrne Memorial State and \nLocal Law Enforcement Assistance Program and the LLEBG, both of which \nhave been continuously targeted for elimination by the Bush \nAdministration. LLEBG, which received $225 million this year, provide \nlocal governments with the means to underwrite projects that reduce \ncrime and improve public safety, and allow communities to craft their \nown responses to local crime and drug problems. The Edward Byrne \nMemorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, which \nCongress funded at $659,117,000 in fiscal year 2004, makes grants to \nStates to improve the functioning of the criminal justice system, with \nemphasis on violent crimes and serious offenders, and to enforce State \nand local drug laws. As a senator from a rural State that relies on \nLLEBG and Byrne grants to combat crime, I have been concerned with the \nPresident's proposals for funding and program eliminations of these \nwell-established grant programs; our legislation makes it clear that \nthe same authorized funding levels and uses will be available under the \nnew consolidated grant program as under the previous two grant \nprograms.\n  I am pleased that Title II also extends the authorization of \nappropriations for the Regional Information Sharing System, RISS, at \n$100 million for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2007. RISS serves as \nan invaluable tool to Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies \nby providing much-needed criminal intelligence and investigative \nsupport services. It has built a reputation as one of the most \neffective and efficient means developed to combat multi-jurisdictional \ncriminal activity, such as narcotics trafficking and gang activity. \nWithout RISS, most law enforcement officers would not have access to \nnewly developed crime-fighting technologies and would be hindered in \ntheir intelligence-gathering efforts.\n  By providing State and local law enforcement agencies with rapid \naccess to its secure, state-of-the-art, nationwide information sharing \nsystem, RISS gives law enforcement officers the resources they need to \nidentify and apprehend potential terrorists before they strike. With \nthis in mind, I authored Title VII of the USA PATRIOT Act, Public Law \n107-56, to increase information sharing for critical infrastructure \nprotection. The law expanded RISS to facilitate information sharing \namong Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies to investigate \nand prosecute terrorist conspiracies and activities, and increased \nauthorized funding to $100 million.\n  Proper funding provides RISS with the means to maintain six \nregionally-based information sharing centers that allow for information \nand intelligence services to be disseminated nationwide addressing \nmajor, multi-jurisdictional crimes. In addition, as the September 11 \nterrorist attacks and calls for increased vigilance against future \nattacks demonstrated, RISS requires additional support to intensify \nanti-terrorism measures.\n  Each RISS center has up to 1,600 member agencies, the vast majority \nof which are at the municipal and county levels. Over 400 State \nagencies and over 850 Federal agencies, however, are also members. The \nDrug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. \nAttorneys' Offices, Internal Revenue Service, Secret Service, Customs, \nand the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among \nthe Federal agencies that participate in the RISS Program.\n  Unfortunately, the Consolidated Appropriations law for FY 2004 did \nnot provide full funding for RISS, instead including $30 million for \nthe program. For the coming fiscal year, the President has proposed $45 \nmillion. We must ensure that RISS can continue current services, meet \nincreased membership support needs for terrorism investigations and \nprosecutions, increase intelligence analysis capabilities and add staff \nto support the increasing numbers of RISS members.\n  This title also contains a reauthorization of the Crime Free Rural \nStates program that we created in the DOJ Authorization bill in the \nlast Congress. This program authorizes $10 million annually for rural \nstates to address specific crime problems plaguing their areas. In \nVermont, for example, this funding could be used to battle heroin abuse \nand its consequences.\n  This authorization bill contains a number of provisions of great \ninterest to victim service organizations and those who administer \nfederal grants for victim assistance and compensation. In particular, I \nam pleased that we have responded to repeated requests from the field \nto increase the amount that State assistance and compensation programs \nmay retain for administrative purposes. I have been proposing such an \nincrease for many years, without success.\n  Under current law, not more than five percent of victim assistance \nand compensation grants may be used for the administration of the State \nprogram receiving the grant. The House bill effectively decreases this \nalready-low apportionment by combining administrative costs with \ntraining costs--currently one percent under guidelines promulgated by \nthe Office for Victims of Crime, OVC. By contrast, we propose raising \nthe amount that can be used for both worthwhile purposes to 7.5 percent \nof the grants. While this is still less than 10 percent retention \npermitted, for example, by the Violence Against Women Act, it will help \nStates to accommodate the addition of training purposes in their costs.\n  Our bill will also amend the Victims of Crime Act, VOCA, to clarify \nthe provisions establishing the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve in \nvarious ways. The original H.R. 3036 permits replenishments of the \nEmergency Reserve based upon amounts obligated rather than amounts \nactually expended in any given fiscal year. Our bill includes two \nadditional clarifications that I proposed. First, it makes explicit \nthat the Emergency Reserve may be replenished only once each fiscal \nyear, and may not be continually replenished as amounts are obligated \nor expended. Allowing continual replenishments could result in the \nobligations or expenditures exceeding the $50 million Emergency Reserve \nmaximum. Second, we have ensured that all Emergency Reserve funds--\nwhether carried over, used to replenish the Reserve, obligated or \nexpended--fall above the cap on spending from the Crime Victim Fund as \nset by appropriations legislation.\n  Section 242 of the House-passed bill authorized the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office for Justice Programs (OJP) to impose \nspecial conditions and determine priorities for formula grants. It was \nunclear to me why the authority to determine formula grant priorities \nwas necessary and what its real impact would be on local victim \nservices. Could it be read to authorize OJP to infringe on the \ndiscretion of each State to meet its own needs, as for example by \nmandating that State VOCA programs give priority to public agencies \nover nonprofit community organizations, or fund faith-based programs \nbefore secular programs? Priorities are already set out by Congress in \nthe authorizing statutes, as is the requirement that programs \ncoordinate public and private victim services in their communities, and \nthe Justice Department should not be allowed to override those \ncongressional directives. Moreover, VOCA already has extensive \nreporting requirements that enable the Department to monitor how States \nare distributing these funds. We have therefore deleted the authority \nto determine formula grant priorities, while retaining the special \nconditions provision.\n\n  Subtitle D of Title II deals with approaches to prevent crime. I am \nespecially pleased that we included provisions that will specifically \naid in preventing rural crime because rural States and communities face \na number of unique law enforcement challenges. We added these \nprovisions from Senator Daschle's ``Rural Safety Act,'' S. 1907, of \nwhich I am proud to be an original cosponsor. I commend our\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\nDemocratic Leader for his commitment to providing real and meaningful \ninvestments to address the unique set of challenges facing rural law \nenforcement agencies.\n  Rural law enforcement officers patrol larger areas, operate under \ntighter budgets and with smaller staffs than their urban and suburban \ncounterparts. This legislation creates programs specifically designed \nto meet the many complex needs of rural law enforcement agencies and \nofficers. Methamphetamine production and use, for example, is a growing \nconcern for Vermonters. Because the ingredients and the equipment used \nto produce methamphetamines are so inexpensive and readily available, \nthe drug can be manufactured or ``cooked'' in homemade labs. This has \nbecome one of the major problems facing law enforcement agencies \nnationwide. Last month, the Vermont State Police busted the first known \nmethamphetamine lab in the State. We must help our law enforcement \nagencies as they struggle to keep up with its troubling growth.\n  To help law enforcement combat the spread of methamphetamine and \nother challenges, we authorize in this bill $20 million in grants for \nfiscal year 2005 to provide for the cleanup of methamphetamine \nlaboratories and related hazardous waste in units of local government \nand tribal governments located outside a Standard Metropolitan \nStatistical Area; and the improvement of contract-related response time \nfor cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories and related hazardous waste \nin units of local establish methamphetamine prevention and treatment \npilot programs in rural areas, and provide additional financial support \nto local law enforcement.\n  We also establish a rural 9-1-1 service program to provide access to, \nand improve a communications infrastructure that will ensure a reliable \nand seamless communication between, law enforcement, fire, and \nemergency medical service providers in units of local government and \ntribal governments located outside a Standard Metropolitan Statistical \nArea and in States. Grants authorized at $25 million for fiscal year \n2005 under this program will be used to establish or improve 9-1-1 \nservice in rural communities. Priority in making grants under this \nprogram will be given to communities that do not have 9-1-1 service.\n  I am pleased that our bill includes the Campbell-Leahy-Hatch \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003, a bill to reauthorize \nan existing matching grant program to help State, tribal, and local \njurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement officers. \nThis bill was passed by the Senate by unanimous consent a year ago this \nmonth and it awaits consideration by the House of Representatives.\n  This measure marks the third time that I have had the privilege of \nteaming with my friend and colleague Senator Campbell to work on this \nlegislation. We authored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act of \n1998 in response to the tragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the \nVermont-New Hampshire border, in which two State troopers who did not \nhave bulletproof vests were killed. The Federal officers who responded \nto the scenes of the shooting spree were equipped with life-saving body \narmor, but the State and local law enforcement officers lacked \nprotective vests because of the cost.\n  Two years later, we successfully passed the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000, and I hope we will go 3-for-3 this time \naround. Senator Campbell brings to our effort invaluable experience in \nthis area and during his time in the Senate he has been a leader in the \narea of law enforcement. As a former deputy sheriff, he knows the \ndangers law enforcement officers face when out on patrol. I am pleased \nthat we have been joined in this effort by 12 other Senate cosponsors.\n  Our bipartisan legislation will save the lives of law enforcement \nofficers across the country by providing more help to State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to purchase body armor. Since its inception in \n1999, this highly successful Department of Justice program has provided \nlaw enforcement officers in 16,000 jurisdictions nationwide with nearly \n350,000 new bulletproof vests. In Vermont, 148 municipalities have been \nfortunate to receive funding for the purchase of almost 1200 vests. \nWithout the Federal funding given by this program, I daresay that there \nwould be close to that number of police officers without vests in \nVermont today.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003 will further the \nsuccess of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program by re-\nauthorizing the program through fiscal year 2007. Our legislation would \ncontinue the Federal-State partnership by authorizing up to $50 million \nper year for matching grants to State and local law enforcement \nagencies and Indian tribes at the Department of Justice to buy body \narmor.\n  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests \nout of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program \nmakes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few \nthings mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and \nthey tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible \nbecause of this program. This is the least we should do for the \nofficers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every \nday. I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof vest gets one.\n\n  We also included in this authorization bill the ``Prevent All \nCigarette Trafficking, PACT, Act,'' as passed by the Senate by \nunanimous consent on December 9, 2003, but which has yet to be taken up \nand passed by the House. I commend Senators Hatch and Kohl for their \nleadership on this measure and thank them for working with me, among \nothers, to craft the compromise language that we include in this bill \nto crack down on the growing problem of cigarette smuggling, both \ninterstate and international, as well as to address the connection \nbetween cigarette smuggling activities and terrorist funding. I am \nproud to join Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl and 10 others as a cosponsor \nof the standalone bill.\n  I also thank the National Association of Attorneys General and the \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, for working with us and contributing to \nthis language. I want to say a special thanks to Vermont Attorney \nGeneral Bill Sorrell, who also serves as the current Chair of the NAAG \nTobacco Committee, for his valuable input on the problems with \ncigarette smuggling that states are facing and his support for this \ncompromise measure. I also want to thank the Vermont Grocers \nAssociation, the Vermont Retail Association, the Vermont Association of \nChiefs of Police, and the National Conference of State Legislatures for \ntheir support for this measure.\n  The movement of cigarettes from low-tax areas to high-tax areas in \norder to avoid the payment of taxes when the cigarettes are resold has \nbecome a public health problem in recent years. As State after State \nchooses to raise its tobacco excise taxes as a means of reducing \ntobacco use and as a source of revenue, many smokers have sought \ncheaper means by which to purchase cigarettes. Smokers can often \npurchase cigarettes and tobacco from remote sellers, Internet or mail \norder at substantial discounts due to avoidance of State taxes. These \nsellers, however, are evading their tax obligations because they \nneither collect nor pay the proper State and local excise taxes for \ncigarette and other tobacco product sales.\n  We have the ability to dramatically reduce smuggling without imposing \nundue burdens on manufacturers or law abiding citizens. By reducing \nsmuggling we will also increase government revenues by minimizing tax \navoidance. My friend General Sorrell has told me that this has become a \nrapidly growing problem in Vermont as more and more tobacco product \nmanufacturers fail to collect and pay cigarette taxes. Criminals are \ngetting away with smuggling and not paying tobacco taxes because of \nweak punishments, products that are often poorly labeled, the lack of \ntax stamps and the inability of the current distribution system to \ntrack sales from State-to-State. These lapses point to a need for \nuniform rules governing group sales to individuals.\n  The PACT Act will give States the authority to collect millions of \ndollars in lost State tax revenue resulting from online and other \nremote sales of cigarette and smokeless tobacco. It also ensures that \nevery tobacco retailer, whether a brick-and-mortar or remote retailer \nof tobacco products, play by the same rules by equalizing the tax \nburdens.\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\n  Moreover, the PACT Act gives States the authority necessary to \nenforce the Jenkins Act, a law passed in 1949, which requires cigarette \nvendors to report interstate sales of cigarettes. This legislation \nenhances States' abilities to collect all excise taxes and verify the \ndeposit of all required escrow payments for cigarette and smokeless \ntobacco sales in interstate commerce, including internet sales. In \naddition, it provides Federal and State law enforcement with additional \nresources to enforce state tobacco excise tax laws.\n  Finally, at the request of the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral and many State Attorneys General, we have added a new section \nto provide the States with authority to enforce the Imported Cigarette \nCompliance Act to crack down on international tobacco smuggling. This \nadditional authority should further reduce tax evasion and eliminate a \nlucrative funding source for terrorist organizations.\n  We must not turn a blind eye to the problem of illegal tobacco \nsmuggling. Those who smuggle cigarettes are criminals and we must close \nthe loopholes that allow cigarette smuggling to continue.\n  The United States has from its inception recognized the importance of \nintellectual property laws in fostering innovation, and vested in \nCongress the responsibility of crafting laws that ensure that those who \nproduce inventions are able to reap economic rewards for their efforts. \nI am pleased that we can today include, as part of the Department of \nJustice Authorization Act, the ``Cooperative Research and Technology \nEnhancement Act of 2004,'' the CREATE Act, legislation that I \ncosponsored along with Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Grassley, Senator Johnson, and Senator \nCochran. This bill will provide a needed remedy to one aspect of our \nNation's patent laws. On June 25, 2004, the CREATE Act passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent.\n  When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, the law encouraged \nprivate entities and not-for-profits such as universities to form \ncollaborative partnerships in order to spur innovation. Prior to the \nenactment of this law, universities were issued fewer than 250 patents \neach year. That this number has in recent years surpassed two thousand \nis owed in large measure to the Bayh-Dole Act. The innovation this law \nencouraged has contributed billions of dollars annually to the United \nStates economy and has produced hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\n  However, one component of the Bayh-Dole Act, when read literally, \nruns contrary to the intent of that legislation. In 1999, the United \nStates Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit ruled, in Oddzon \nProducts, Inc. v. Just Toys, Inc., that non-public information may in \ncertain cases be considered ``prior art''--a standard which generally \nprevents an inventor from obtaining a patent. Thus some collaborative \nteams that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to encourage have been unable \nto obtain patents for their efforts. The result is a disincentive to \nform this type of partnership, which could have a negative impact on \nthe U.S. economy and hamper the development of new creations.\n  However, the Federal Circuit in its ruling invited Congress to better \nconform the language of the Bayh-Dole Act to the intent of the \nlegislation. The ``CREATE Act'' does exactly that by ensuring that non-\npublic information is not considered ``prior art'' when the information \nis used in a collaborative partnership under the Bayh-Dole Act. The \nbill also includes strict evidentiary burdens to ensure that the \nlegislation is tailored narrowly in order to solely fulfill the intent \nof the Bayh-Dole Act.\n  I am pleased that the PIRATE Act, which I cosponsored with Senator \nHatch, will be included as part of this bipartisan bill. Like the \noverall bill, the PIRATE Act is a consensus bill that will give the \nJustice Department new and needed tools--in this case, these tools are \nspecific to the fight against piracy. This bill was unanimously passed \nby the Senate on June 25, 2004. By including this measure in the \nDepartment of Justice Authorization Bill, we hope to muster more forces \nto combat the growing problem of digital piracy.\n  For too long, Federal prosecutors have been hindered in their pursuit \nof pirates, by the fact that they were limited to bringing criminal \ncharges with high burdens of proof. In the world of copyright, a \ncriminal charge is unusually difficult to prove because the defendant \nmust have known that his conduct was illegal and he must have willfully \nengaged in the conduct anyway. For this reason prosecutors can rarely \njustify bringing criminal charges, and copyright owners have been left \nalone to fend for themselves, defending their rights only where they \ncan afford to do so. In a world in which a computer and an Internet \nconnection are all the tools you need to engage in massive piracy, this \nis an intolerable predicament.\n  The PIRATE Act will give the Attorney General civil enforcement \nauthority for copyright infringement. It also calls on the Justice \nDepartment to initiate training and pilot programs to ensure that \nFederal prosecutors across the country are aware of the many difficult \ntechnical and strategic problems posed by enforcing copyright law in \nthe digital age.\n  This new authority does not supplant either the criminal provisions \nof the Copyright Act, or the remedies available to the copyright owner \nin a private suit. Rather, it allows the government to bring its \nresources to bear on this immense problem, and to ensure that more \ncreative works are made available online, that those works are more \naffordable, and that the people who work to bring them to us are paid \nfor their efforts.\n  I am pleased that the Koby Mandell Act of 2003 was included in this \nlegislation. I am a proud cosponsor of the stand-alone bill. The Act \nwould establish an office within the Department of Justice with a \nmandate to ensure equal treatment of all victims of terrorist acts \ncommitted overseas. Its primary role would be to guarantee that \nvigorous efforts are made to pursue, prosecute, and punish each and \nevery terrorist who harms Americans overseas, no matter where attacks \noccur. It would also take steps to inform victims of important \ndevelopments in international cases, such as status reports on efforts \nto capture terrorists and monitoring the incarceration of those \nterrorists who are imprisoned overseas. This is important legislation \nthat would send a strong message of resolve that we are committed to \nfinding and punishing every terrorist who harms Americans overseas.\n  I am pleased that we have included part of S. 1286, the Seniors \nSafety Act, which I introduced last year. This bill would create an \nenhanced sentencing penalty for those who commit crimes against the \nelderly, create new civil and criminal penalties for pension fraud, and \ncreate a centralized service to log complaints of telemarketing fraud.\n  We would also provide the Attorney General with a new and substantial \ntool to prevent telemarketing fraud--the power to block or terminate \nservice to telephone facilities that are being used to defraud innocent \npeople. The Justice Department could use this authority to disrupt \ntelemarketing fraud schemes directed from foreign sources by cutting \noff the swindlers' telephone service. Even if the criminals acquire a \nnew telephone number, temporary interruptions will prevent some seniors \nfrom being victimized.\n  We have agreed to incorporate a slightly revised version of the \nFederal Prosecutors' Retirement Benefit Equity Act of 2004, which was \noriginally introduced as a stand-alone bill with my good friends \nSenator Hatch, Senator Mikulski and Senator Durbin. This bill would \ncorrect an inequity that exists under current law, whereby Federal \nprosecutors receive substantially less favorable retirement benefits \nthan nearly all other people involved in the Federal criminal justice \nsystem including pretrial services officers, probation officers, \naccountants, cooks and secretaries of the Bureau of Prisons. Indeed the \nbenefits incorporated in this bill are comparable not only to those \nreceived by traditional ``law enforcement officers'' such as Federal \nagents, but also the Capitol Police, Supreme Court police, air traffic \ncontrollers and firefighters. The bill would essentially allow, but not \nmandate, AUSAs to retire at age 50 with 20 years of service.\n\n  Currently, Assistant United States Attorneys, AUSAs, and other \nFederal\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\nprosecutors are not eligible for these enhanced benefits even though \nthey are enjoyed by the vast majority of other employees in the \ncriminal justice system. Once a defendant is brought to into the \ncriminal justice system, the person with whom they have the most face-\nto-face contact, and often in an extremely confrontational environment, \nis the Federal prosecutor. AUSAs and other Federal prosecutors \nparticipate in planning investigations, interviewing witnesses both \ninside and outside of the office setting, debriefing defendants, \nobtaining warrants, negotiating plea agreements and representing the \ngovernment at trials and sentencings. Each of these responsibilities \nencompass ``the investigation, apprehension, or detention'' of \nindividuals suspected or convicted of violating Federal law which is \njust one justification for granting extended benefits to law \nenforcement officers.\n  AUSAs are an integral part of the criminal justice system and their \nunique position and demanding jobs has rightfully earned them the \nbenefits set forth in this important bill.\n  I am pleased that S. 710, the Leahy-Hatch Anti-Atrocity Alien \nDeportation Act, was included in this legislation. This measure would \nexpand the grounds for removing alien human rights violators from the \nUnited States, or for denying them entry in the first place. We have \nheard many accounts of abusers who have taken advantage of America's \nfreedoms after committing horrifying violations of their fellow \ncitizens in their native lands. We need to stop that from happening \nagain.\n  This bill passed the Judiciary Committee last November but has been \nsubject to an anonymous hold on the floor. A similar version of it \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent in the 106th Congress. It is \nlong past time to make it law.\n  I would note that on May 12, a Rwandan man wanted on international \ncharges of genocide and crimes against humanity was arrested at his \nsuburban Chicago home by agents from the Bureau of Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, ICE. Before I and others began to raise the issue \nof the war criminals among us, it was my impression that the former INS \npaid little attention to rooting out these thugs. I am pleased that the \nissue has taken on greater importance at ICE, and urge the Senate to \npass this bill so that we can expand the grounds of inadmissibility and \nremovability for human rights violators.\n  I am proud that we include Schumer-Specter legislation to honor the \nsacrifice of the September 11, 2001, terrorist victims by creating \nCongressional medals that would be awarded to their families and loved \nones by the President. I am proud to have joined my friends as a \ncosponsor of this legislation, as have 18 other Senators.\n  The tragedy of September 11, 2001, demanded unprecedented sacrifices \nof everyday American civilians and rescue workers--3,000 of whom lost \ntheir lives in the attacks. In recognition of their heroic actions on \nthat day, the bipartisan Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Act would create a medal \nto be awarded posthumously to the victims of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks. The medal would be designed by the Department of Treasury and \nawarded to representatives of the deceased by the President. The \nproduction of the medals would be paid for by the sale of duplicate \nmedals to the public. Those of us who lost loved ones almost three \nyears ago can never have them back, but a medal of honor could \nrecognizes the sacrifices and heroic efforts of our fallen citizens.\n  We also incorporated language similar to the Leahy-Grassley-Lincoln \n``Missing Child Cold Case Review Act of 2004,'' S. 2435, which will \nallow an Inspector General to authorize his or her staff to provide \nassistance on and conduct reviews of the inactive case files, or ``cold \ncases,'' involving children stored at the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, NCMEC, and to develop recommendations for \nfurther investigations. The only alteration we made to the original \nbill was to include language to also allow the Inspector General of the \nGovernment Printing Office to authorize his or her staff to work on \ncold cases.\n  Speed is everything in homicide investigations. As a former \nprosecutor in Vermont, I know firsthand that speed is of the essence \nwhen trying to solve a homicide. This focus on speed, however, has led \nthe law enforcement community to generally believe that any case not \nsolved within the first 72 hours or lacking significant leads and \nwitness participation has little likelihood of being solved, regardless \nof the expertise and resources deployed. With time, such unsolved cases \nbecome ``cold,'' and these are among the most difficult and frustrating \ncases detectives face because they are, in effect, cases that other \ninvestigators, for whatever reason, failed to solve.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement agencies, regardless of size, are not \nimmune to rising crime rates, staff shortages and budget restrictions. \nSuch obstacles have strained the investigative and administrative \nresources of all agencies. More crime often means that fewer cases are \nvigorously pursued, fewer opportunities arise for follow-up and \nindividual caseloads increase for already overworked detectives.\n  All the obstacles that hamper homicide investigations in their early \nphases contribute to cold cases. The National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children--our Nation's top resource center for child \nprotection--presently retains a backlog of cold cases involving \nchildren that law enforcement departments nationwide have stopped \ninvestigating primarily due to all these obstacles. NCMEC serves as a \nclearinghouse for all cold cases in which a child has not been found \nand/or the suspect has not been identified.\n  This provision will allow an Inspector General to provide staff \nsupport to NCMEC for the purpose of conducting reviews of inactive case \nfiles to develop recommendations for further investigation and similar \nactivities. The Inspector General community has one of the most diverse \nand talented criminal investigative cadres in the Federal Government. A \nvast majority of these special agents have come from traditional law \nenforcement agencies, and are highly trained and extremely capable of \ndealing with complex criminal cases.\n  Under current law, an Inspector General's duties are limited to \nactivities related to the programs and operations of an agency. This \nmeasure would allow an Inspector General to permit criminal \ninvestigators under his or her supervision to review cold case files, \nso long as doing so would not interfere with normal duties. An \nInspector General would not conduct actual investigations, and any \nInspector General would only commit staff when the office's mission-\nrelated workloads permitted. At no time would these activities be \nallowed to conflict with or delay the stated missions of an Inspector \nGeneral.\n  From time to time a criminal investigator employed by an Inspector \nGeneral may be between investigations or otherwise available for brief \nperiods of time. This act would also allow those resources to be \nprovided to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \nCommitment of resources would be at a minimum and would not materially \naffect the budget of any office.\n  We have before us the type of bipartisan legislation that should be \nmoved easily through the Senate and House. It is supported by the \nDepartment of Justice Office of the Inspector General. I applaud the \nongoing work of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \nand hope that we can soon provide NCMEC with the resources it requires \nto solve cold cases involving missing children.\n  This authorization bill includes a provision that would help colleges \nand universities in Vermont and across the Nation. It would allow \nforeigners who are pursuing ``distance learning'' opportunities at \nAmerican schools to enter the country for up to 30 days to fulfill \nacademic requirements. Under current law, these students do not fall \nunder any visa category, and many are being denied entry and are thus \nunable to complete their educations. This is a loophole that harms both \nthose students and the institutions that serve them.\n  In recent months, serious questions have been raised in the media and \nin several congressional hearings about deficiencies within the \ntranslation program at the FBI. Nearly 2 years ago I began asking \nquestions in Judiciary Committee hearings about the FBI's translation \nprogram. Most of these remain unanswered. As a result, members of our \nCommittee are no closer to\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\ndetermining the scope of the issue, including the pervasiveness and \nseriousness of FBI shortcomings in this area, or what the FBI intends \nto do to rectify personnel shortages, security issues, translation \ninaccuracies and other problems that have plagued the translator \nprogram for years.\n  Section 205 of the USA PATRIOT Act included an important reporting \nrequirement by the Attorney General to the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees about 1. the number of translators employed by the FBI, 2. \nlegal and practical impediments to using translators employed by other \nFederal, State, or local agencies, on a full, part-time, or shared \nbasis, and 3. the needs of the FBI for specific translation services in \ncertain languages, and recommendations for meeting those needs. To \ndate, the Attorney General has not made the report required by Section \n205--most likely because there is no date certain written in the law by \nwhich the report must be made. This provision fills that gap by \nrequiring the report ``not later than 30 days after the date of \nenactment . . . and annually thereafter . . . with respect to the \npreceding 12 month period.'' It also expands the reporting requirement \nto include translators ``contracted'' by the government in addition to \nthose ``employed.''\n  I have worked my entire professional life to protect children from \nthose who would prey on them. Preventing child exploitation through the \nuse of the Internet is one concrete and important way to help this \nimportant cause. In this regard, under the Protection of Children from \nSexual Predators Act of 1998, Public Law 105-314, remote computing and \nelectronic communication service providers are mandated to report all \ninstances of child pornography to the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children. I respect and applaud the work of NCMEC and its \ntireless efforts in this important national priority.\n  In March 1998, Congress mandated that NCMEC initiate the CyberTipline \nfor citizens to report online sexual crimes against children. In \nDecember 1999, Congress passed Public Law 106-113 to modify 42 U.S.C. \nSec. 13032(b)(1) to set forth a ``duty to report'' by ISPs. According \nto NCMEC, many U.S. electronic communications service providers are not \ncomplying with the requirement that they register and use the \nCyberTipline to report child porn found on their services because \nsupporting regulations required to be promulgated by the Department of \nJustice on matters such as the contents of the report were never done \nso.\n\n  In this authorization bill we propose language that amends the ``duty \nto report'' language by providing specific guidance on what information \nis required to be included in the ISP reports. The information required \nincludes the content and images of the apparent violation, the Internet \nProtocol Address, the date and time associated with the violation, and \nspecific contact information for the sender.\n  America's film heritage is an important part of the American \nexperience, an inheritance from previous generations that help tell us \nwho we are--and who we were--as a society. They offer insight into our \nhistory, our dreams, and our aspirations. Yet sadly, this part of \nAmerican heritage is literally disintegrating faster than can be saved. \nToday, I am delighted that with the help of Senator Hatch, the \n``National Film Preservation Act'' can be included in our Department of \nJustice Reauthorization bill.\n  I introduced the ``National Film Preservation Act'' last November, a \nbill that will reauthorize and extend the ``National Film Preservation \nAct of 1996.'' We first acted in 1988 in order to recognize the \neducational, cultural, and historical importance of our film heritage, \nand its inherently fragile nature. In doing so, Congress created the \nNational Film Preservation Board and the National Film Preservation \nFoundation both of which operate under the auspices of the Library of \nCongress in order to help save America's film heritage.\n  The ``National Film Preservation Act'' will allow the Library of \nCongress to continue its important work in preserving America's fading \ntreasures, as well as providing grants that will help libraries, \nmuseums, and archives preserve films and make those works available for \nstudy and research. These continued efforts are more critical today \nthan ever before. While a wide range of works have been saved, with \nevery passing day we lose the opportunity to save more. Fewer than 20 \npercent of the features of the 1920s exist in complete form and less \nthan 10 percent of the features of the 1910s have survived into the new \nmillennium.\n  The films saved by the National Film Preservation Board are precisely \nthose types of works that would be unlikely to survive without public \nsupport. At-risk documentaries, silent-era films, avant-garde works, \nethnic films, newsreels, and home movies frequently provide more \ninsight into the American experience than the Hollywood sound features \nkept and preserved by major studios. What is more, in many cases only \none copy of these ``orphaned'' works exists. As the Librarian of \nCongress, Dr. James H. Billington, has noted, ``Our film heritage is \nAmerica's living past.''\n  I would like to thank Senator Hatch again for working with me to \ninclude the ``National Film Preservation Act'' in the bill we are \nintroducing today.\n  I am pleased that the DREAM Act has been included in this bill. I am \na cosponsor of the bill, which Senators Hatch and Durbin introduced \nlast year and was passed last fall by the Judiciary Committee. It would \nbenefit undocumented alien children who were brought to the United \nStates by their parents as young children, by restoring States' ability \nto offer them in-state tuition and offering them a path to legal \nresidency. It has been distressing that a bill with Committee approval \nand 48 sponsors has been unable to get a vote on the floor of the \nSenate, and I hope that including the DREAM Act in this legislation \nwill give it added momentum.\n  Status Reports on Enemy Combatants: The House-passed bill included an \nimportant reporting requirement authored by Representative Adam Schiff \nand adopted by the House Judiciary Committee. Specifically, this \nprovision required the Department of Justice to submit an annual report \nto Congress specifying the number of U.S. persons or residents detained \non suspicion of terrorism, and describing Department standards for \nrecommending or determining that a person should be tried as a criminal \ndefendant or designated as an enemy combatant. A Washington Post \neditorial dated April 3, 2004, praised this provision, while noting \nthat ``If more members of the House took their duty to legislate in \nthis critical area seriously, Congress would craft a bill that actually \nimposed standards rather than simply inquired what they were.'' I \nagree, and regret that was unable to persuade Chairman Hatch to retain \nthis modest oversight tool.\n  Privacy Officer: I am disappointed that we will not be including the \nprivacy officer provision referred to us by the House. It is critical \nthat the Department have a designated leader who is consistently \nmindful of the impact of the Department's activities on privacy rights. \nWhile there has been some history of a privacy official at the \nDepartment, these positions have been non-statutory, and thus there has \nbeen no guarantee of consistent vigor and accountability on these \nissues. Given that the Department's mission increasingly involves \ngathering and assessing personal information, we simply can't afford to \nhave a lapse in accountability on privacy. Moreover, this is not an \nuntested idea. Congress created a privacy officer for the Department of \nHomeland Security, and it has been recognized as a successful example \nof how this role can be helpful in assessing and addressing privacy \nconcerns. We need to follow this lead, and the privacy officer \nprovision would have been a good opportunity to do so.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, Congressman \nSensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers to continue the important \nbusiness of re-authorizing the Department of Justice. Clearly, regular \nreauthorization of the Department should be part and parcel of the \nCommittees' traditional role in overseeing the Department's activities. \nSwift passage into law of the ``Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act, Fiscal Years 2005 through 2007'' will be a \nsignificant step toward enhancing our oversight role.\n\n[[Page S9955]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bond, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2864.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 to clarify the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation to enter into memorandums of \nunderstanding with a State regarding the collection of approved State \ncommodity assessments on behalf of the State from the proceeds of \nmarketing assistance loans; read the first time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly introduce the \nCommodity Assessment Protection and Reform Act.\n  This legislation fixes a potential problem for our wheat producers in \nthe State of Oklahoma as well as other wheat producing states.\n  As Government encourages agricultural producers to become more \nresponsible for their own marketing and research programs, it is vital \nthat we give producers the ability to do just that.\n  To enhance marketing and research of agricultural commodities, farm \nprograms for many years have authorized the use of marketing loans for \nsome commodities. Producers receive cash loans using the commodity as \ncollateral. Marketing loans allow the producer to market crops while \nalso providing cash to pay outstanding bills.\n  These marketing and research programs provide many benefits: \nincreasing commodity category sales; creating a viable, thriving \nmarketplace for individual businesses; providing greater opportunity \nfor brands and businesses to compete for their share of the category; \nprotecting small producers from being severely disadvantaged against \nlarge competitors that could undermine industry growth; building a more \nfavorable economic environment--better prices for producers, more \nrevenue growth for processors; reducing dependence on taxpayer dollars \nfor support payments and government administration in times of economic \nhardship; providing an open, free flow of consumer information to help \nconsumers make informed choices about purchasing these commodities; and \nproviding ongoing investments in research to ensure product quality, \nsafety and nutrition expectations.\n  For wheat, this program is administered by the individual State wheat \ncommissions and is not a national program. In Oklahoma, wheat producers \nhave the option to opt out of the program if they choose.\n  Wheat producers in Oklahoma, and in many other States, have supported \nthis system for collecting assessments on the commodities they produce. \nFor wheat placed under loan with the United States Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, the CCC has \ncollected these grower-funded assessments. Again, these assessments are \nused to fund research and marketing programs.\n  The loan placement is considered to occur at the first point of sale. \nThe CCC has supported State commissions in the collection of grower-\nfunded assessments for many years. These State assessments have been \ncollected under a cooperative agreement defined in a Memoranda of \nUnderstanding between individual State commodity commissions and the \nUSDA.\n  Recently USDA determined that if the state commission changes the \nassessment rate, USDA would no longer honor a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding between a state commodity commission and USDA. In several \nstates, wheat growers voted to increase their support of commodity \nactivities by approving an assessment increase. State wheat commissions \nwhose growers have voted for increased funding are faced with no viable \nmeans of collecting assessments on the commodity under the loan \nprogram.\n  USDA claims that it lacks statutory authority to recognize these new \nor modified Memoranda of Understanding. The decision by USDA not to \nhonor amended Memoranda of Understanding could cause serious financial \nharm to the work of the commissions, which support a range of \nactivities from research to market development.\n  The use of these funds is very important for the expanding markets \nand increasing research. They become even more critical when wheat \nprices are low.\n  This decision by USDA to no longer honor these Memoranda of \nUnderstanding has caused great hardship for a number of wheat states \nwhose producers have voluntarily voted to give more of their own money \nto programs they deem important.\n  In order to correct this problem, I am introducing legislation that \nwill allow USDA to continue to collect approved State commodity \nassessments. This legislation authorizes the USDA to recognize a \nMemorandum of Understanding when a State has increased or modified its \nassessment rate, as well as recognize Memoranda of Understanding that \nhave been terminated prior to the date of enactment of this \nlegislation.\n  According to USDA, the cost of implementing this legislation would be \nminimal, since the collection procedure is already in place and will \nonly require a change in the factor of the assessment.\n  I would like to note that the House Agriculture Committee passed this \nbill unanimously last week through the excellent work of my friends \nGeorge Nethercutt and Bob Goodlatte.\n  The House Agriculture Committee informs me that their intention is to \nachieve full House passage of this legislation by suspension of the \nrules next week. I want to make a special plea to the Senate to pass \nthis simple, much-needed, thoroughly bipartisan, and noncontroversial \nlegislation in the 108th Congress. Toward that end, I request that the \nbill be held at the desk per Rule 14.\n  Again, as Government encourages agricultural producers to become more \nresponsible for their own marketing and research programs, this common \nsense legislation is needed to ensure the continued success of these \nprograms.\n  At this time I thank the people in Oklahoma who have contacted me in \nsupport of this legislation: Jeramy Rich with the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, \nRay Wulf with the Oklahoma Farmers Union, Tim Bartram with the Oklahoma \nWheat Growers Association, Mark Hodges with Oklahoma Wheat Commission, \nMike Kubicek with the Oklahoma Peanut Commission, as well my \nLegislative Assistant Mike Ference who assisted me with this \nlegislation. I appreciate all of their support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2866\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 442\n\n       Whereas the crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the \n     ultimate expression of racism in the United States following \n     Reconstruction;\n       Whereas lynching was a common practice in the United States \n     until the middle of the 20th century;\n       Whereas lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the \n     Nation, with documented incidents in all but 4 States;\n       Whereas at least 4,749 people, predominantly African-\n     Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between \n     1881 and 1964;\n       Whereas 99 percent of all lynch mob perpetrators escaped \n     any form of punishment from State or local officials;\n       Whereas lynching prompted African-Americans to form the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     (NAACP) and prompted members of B'nai B'rith to found the \n     Anti-Defamation League;\n       Whereas nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in \n     Congress during the first half of the 20th century;\n       Whereas between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned \n     Congress to end lynching;\n       Whereas between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives \n     passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures;\n       Whereas protection against lynching was the minimum and \n     most basic of Federal responsibilities, yet the Senate failed \n     to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated requests \n     by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of \n     Representatives;\n       Whereas until the recent publication of ``Without \n     Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America'', the victims of \n     lynching have never been properly acknowledged;\n       Whereas only by coming to terms with its history can the \n     United States effectively champion human rights abroad; and\n       Whereas an apology offered in the spirit of true repentance \n     moves the Nation toward reconciliation and may become central \n     to a new understanding upon which improved racial relations \n     can be forged: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) apologizes to the victims and survivors of lynching for \n     its failure to enact anti-lynching legislation;\n       (2) expresses its deepest sympathies and most solemn \n     regrets to the descendants of victims of lynching whose \n     ancestors were deprived of life, human dignity, and the \n     constitutional protections accorded all other citizens of the \n     United States; and\n       (3) remembers the history of lynching, to ensure that these \n     personal tragedies will be neither forgotten nor repeated.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it has been said that ``ignorance, \nallied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.'' \nSadly, this great body, in which I am so proud to serve, once allied \nits power with ignorance. In so doing, it condoned unspeakable \ninjustice that diminished the role of the Senate, and heaped untold \nsuffering on Americans sorely in need of our protection. I am referring \nto the Senate's role in the decades long campaign to end lynching in \nthis country. On three separate occasions, our colleagues in the House \nof Representatives passed anti-lynching legislation with overwhelming \nmajorities. On all three of those occasions members of this Chamber \nblocked, or filibustered the consideration of that legislation.\n  Between 1882, when records first began to be collected, and 1968 four \nthousand, seven hundred and forty-two Americans lost their lives to \nlynch mobs. The experts believe that undocumented cases might double \nthat figure. The vast majority of those killed--three thousand, four \nhundred and forty-five Americans--were African American. Sadly, a \ndisproportionate number of those deaths occurred within my home region \nof the South, but 46 of the 50 States experienced these atrocities. \nLynching was truly a national problem deserving the attention of the \nnational legislative bodies.\n  Frederick Douglas seems to have captured the real reason for this \ndark period of our national history. These acts of terrorism were not \nso much an admission of African Americans' weakness, but of their \nperseverance--and indomitable spirit. Douglas wrote: It is proof that \nthe Negro is not standing still. He is not dead, but alive and active. \nHe is not drifting with the current, but manfully resisting it . . . A \nship rotting at anchor meets with no resistance, but when she sails on \nthe sea, she has to buffet opposing billows. The enemies of the Negro \nsee that he is making progress and they naturally wish to stop him and \nkeep him in just what they consider his proper place.\n  It was, in short, the ability of African Americans to overcome Jim \nCrow laws, to overcome share-cropping, to overcome second-class \ncitizenship that provoked such savagery. Its an old story that repeats \nitself throughout human history. Whether it was the Israelites in \nEgypt, the colonial empires in Africa or America's own history of \nApartheid, rulers that assume superiority inevitably prove themselves \nmodels of mankind's basest instincts.\n  It should also be noted that this was not only an outrage committed \nagainst African Americans. The effort to dehumanize people on the basis \nof race or ethnicity did not limit itself to black Americans. In fact, \nthe single largest incident of lynching occurred in my home state, in \nmy home town of New Orleans. Yet, the victims were not black. They were \nItalians. On March 14, 1891, 11 Italian immigrants were lynched in the \nCity of New Orleans. These immigrants too were thought to\n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\nbe less than human, and were simply rounded up as a group of the \n``usual suspects'' following the murder of Police Superintendent David \nHennessy. Already edgy from a media prompted mafia scare, a mob \nsurrounded the prison and eventually battered down the doors. An armed \ngroup of twenty five men overtook the guards and summarily riddled the \nbodies of the 11 Italian prisoners with bullets. Their bodies were hung \non lampposts outside the prison. Eyewitnesses described the cheering of \nthe crowd as deafening.\n\n  Of course, the attacks on that day are an example of mob justice and \nits irrational prejudices. However, in nearly 25 percent of all \nlynchings the motivations of the attackers came down to a bald attempt \nto maintain a caste system in this country. The NAACP cataloged the \nreported motivations for these forms of attack. They included: using \ndisrespectful, insulting, slanderous, boastful, threatening or \nincendiary language; insubordination, impertinence, or improper \ndemeanor, a sarcastic grin, laughing at the wrong place, a prolonged \nsilence; refusing to take off one's hat to a white person or to give \nthe right-of-way when encountering a white on the sidewalk; resisting \nassault by whites; being troublesome generally; disorderly conduct, \npetty theft or drunkenness; writing an improper letter to a white \nperson; paying undue or improper attention to a white female; accusing \na white man of writing love letters to a black woman; or living or \nkeeping company with a white woman; turning or refusing to turn state's \nevidence; testifying or bringing suit against a white person; being \nrelated to a person accused of a crime and already lynched; political \nactivities; union organizing; conjuring; discussing a lynching; \ngambling; operating a house of ill fame; a personal debt; refusing to \naccept an employment offer; vagrancy; refusing to give up one's farm; \nconspicuously displaying one's wealth or property; and trying to act \nlike a white man.\n  In many instances, lynchings were little more than a way to remove an \neconomic competitor and confiscate his property. This was true in a \nnumber of cases in Mississippi involving successful African American \nlandowners, and in one notorious Hawaiian case involving a Japanese \nimmigrant competing with established white businessmen.\n  Many of my colleagues might wonder why now? After all, some of these \nincidents are over a century old. There are two reasons. First, this \naspect of American history is not well known or understood. As \nreconstruction concluded in the South, a very ugly struggle to reassert \nthe social structure that preceded the Civil War took place. A great \ndeal of it occurred with the tacit consent of the Federal Government, \nand the most part, the media either shared in the common prejudice, or \nsimply ignored what was occurring.\n  Fortunately, we have the publication of the book ``Without \nSanctuary'' by James Allen, Hilton Als, Congressman John Lewis, and \nLeon F. Litwak to serve as a focal point for our attention to this \nneglected history. This is a difficult book to examine. It serves as a \ncatalog of inhuman crime perpetrated by very ordinary citizens. Looking \nat anything so tragic as the victims of these crimes would be \ndisturbing, but that is not what will leave a lasting impression. It is \nthe festive attitude, the smiles and smirks on the crowd gathered \naround the victim. They clearly take a perverse pride in this act. \nHannah Arendt, the famous political philosopher, subtitled her book on \nAdolph Eichman's war crimes trials ``A Report on the Banality of \nEvil.'' When you look at the expressions on the faces of the murderers \nin these photos, that is all you can think about. These are not crazed \nkillers, these are rational people going about their everyday lives, \nand committing unspeakable acts in the process.\n  Photos like these serve to remind us that a healthy society is not \nsomething that is built up over time, and then like a great monument, \nexists for centuries. Rather, a healthy society is a thin levee that \nmust be constantly improved and maintained to hold back the worst \ninstincts of mankind. I think the horrible pictures that came from Abu \nGharib prison served as a reminder of this lesson. This book is even \ngreater testimony that atrocities are not events that only occur in far \noff places. They can and have occurred here in the United States.\n  The only way to maintain a healthy society is to acknowledge and \ndiscuss our mistakes. No one would defend the Senate's filibuster of \nanti-lynching legislation today. I would like to think that any Senator \nwho did so would quickly be looking for another line of work. However, \ndespite the change of attitude we have taken no action to remedy our \nwrong. That is the purpose of this resolution today. I would like to \nextend my deep thanks to my courageous colleague, the Junior Senator \nfrom Virginia. He seemed to instantly understand the significance of \nthis effort, and I believed it was vitally important to proceed with \nthis resolution in a bipartisan manner. His input and drive have made \nthis effort much more successful than it otherwise would have been.\n  It is our intention to submit this legislation today, and use the \nrecess period to confer with our colleagues about it. When we reconvene \nnext year, we will resubmit this resolution, and at that time, we hope \nto have the co-sponsorship of every member of this body. Then, we will \nendeavor to enact the resolution to commemorate Black History month.\n  I said ignorance allied with power is justice's most ferocious enemy. \nYet imagine what truth allied with power can bring. For over 50 years, \nAfrican American achievement was seen as a threat to the majority of \npeople in this nation. It is time to close the book on that tragic \nperiod and begin to celebrate the achievements of black Americans as \naccomplishments that have bettered us all. I believe that this \nresolution of apology will be an important symbolic step in this \nprocess of healing and growth.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of an \nanti-lynching resolution that Ms. Landrieu and I are submitting. Like \nall of my colleagues, I am proud to be a member of this Chamber, not \nfor its grandeur, but because of the grand ideas it represents. It is \nhere, on these same small desks where big ideas have been debated and \nargued through the course of our history for the greater good of our \nNation. It is here in this Chamber, on this floor, where our Democracy \nreaches consensus from what our Founding Fathers called, the ``Will of \nthe People.''\n  In the history of this Chamber, there have been many great minds and \ndefenders of Freedom. One of those whose words still reverberate here \ntoday is Daniel Webster. Standing in the old Senate Chamber, Webster \ntold his colleagues in 1834 that a ``representative of the people is a \nsentinel on the watch tower of liberty.''\n  I know that Webster was right. I believe throughout our history, the \nUnited States Senate has been a watchtower on Liberty. It has been \nvenerated as the World's greatest deliberative body. The formidable \nBritish Member of Parliament, William Gladstone called the American \nSenate, ``that remarkable body, the most remarkable of all the \ninventions of modern politics.''\n  But unfortunately, this august body has a dark stain on its history. \nA stain that was borne of hatred, racism, and the blood of mostly \nAfrican Americans who died from a noose, from flogging, from a torch, \nfrom the evil heart of men.\n  I rise today to offer a formal and heartfelt apology to all the \nvictims of lynchings in our history--black, white, Jewish, Indian, \nHispanic and Asian and the failure of the U.S. Senate to take action \nwhen action was most deserved.\n  The term ``lynching'' has its roots in my own beloved Commonwealth. \nCharles Lynch, a Virginia planter during the Revolutionary War meted \nout his own form of justice without a court. In Bedford County, Lynch \npersecuted Tories and Tory sympathizers without trial.\n  Soon, others who desired to thwart the rule of law and to trample on \nthe rights of the accused used ``lynchings'' against the innocent or \nlightly accused.\n  This body stood by as these vile killings captivated front-page \nheadlines, drew crowds with morbid curiosity and left thousands of \nmostly African Americans hanging from trees or bleeding to death from \nthe lashings of whips. This body failed to act and in not acting, \nfailed to protect the Liberty of which Webster spoke.\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\n  According to the archives of Tuskegee Institute, 4,749 Americans died \nby lynching starting in 1882. Two-thirds of these lynchings were \nperpetrated against black men, women, and children. Many were not lone \nacts by a few white men, but angry mobs whipped into frenzies by skewed \nmentalities of right and wrong.\n  One of those who suffered this awful fate was an African American \nnamed Zachariah Walker of Coatesville, VA. In 1911, Walker was dragged \nfrom a hospital bed where he was recovering from a gunshot wound. \nAccused of killing a white man--which he claimed was in self-defense--\nWalker was burned alive at the stake without a trial.\n  Such horrendous acts were not a regional phenomenon. Yes, it is true \nthat most lynchings took place in Southern States. But, Illinois, Ohio, \nMichigan and even this city of Washington, D.C. experienced mob \nviolence, making lynching not just a regional problem, but a national \ncrime.\n  Yet, despite the national scope of these acts, the U.S. Senate failed \nto pass one of the estimated 200 anti-lynching bills introduced in \nCongress in the first half of the Twentieth Century. Three strong \npieces of legislation were passed by the other body, but faced \nfilibusters and failures to reach cloture on this Senate floor.\n  In the winter of 1937-38, one grisly lynching captivated this body's \nattention. The crime had happened in Mississippi the previous April. \nTwo African Americans were taken from a jail. They were whipped and \ntorched. Senator Champ Clark of Missouri posted photographs of the \nbrutality back here in the cloakroom. For six weeks, this body debated. \nFor six weeks! In the end, those in favor of an anti-lynching bill \nfailed to enact cloture over the filibustering of others.\n  Historians will no doubt disagree as to a single reason that U.S. \nSenators blocked legislation to make lynching a federal crime. My \ndesire here is not to get into motivations.\n  Regardless of their reasoning, our reason tells us that it was wrong \nand it is time to right it.\n  Thankfully, justice in our Nation has moved forward and left such \ndespicable acts to history. But, this story can never be complete \nwithout an acknowledgement from this body that it failed to protect \nindividual freedoms and rights.\n  It ignored the protection our Founding Fathers extended to those \naccused of crimes and the bedrock foundation of our system of justice \nthat everyone is innocent until proven guilty. And, it turned its back \non the most helpless in our society at a time when the weak needed \nprotection.\n  I stand here today as a proud Senator from a Southern State. I look \naround this chamber and know of its abundance of honor and integrity \nthroughout its history. Yet, we have not been perfect, especially on \nthis issue. We failed our American ideals and we failed our citizens.\n  As Ephesians teaches us, ``all things that are reproved are made \nmanifest by the light.''\n  My fellow Senators, this apology is too long in coming. I \nrespectfully urge all of us to reprove this omission of history as a \nstrong step never to be repeated in our future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 443--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND \n        LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN UNITED STATES V.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In its final report, the 9-11 Commission advocated that \n     Congress pass legislation providing for the expedited and \n     increased assignment of radio spectrum for public safety \n     purposes. The 9-11 Commission stated that this spectrum was \n     necessary to improve communications between local, State and \n     Federal public safety organizations and public safety \n     organizations operating in neighboring jurisdictions that may \n     respond to an emergency in unison.\n       (2) Specifically, the 9-11 Commission report stated ``The \n     inability to communicate was a critical element at the World \n     Trade Center, Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, \n     crash sites, where multiple agencies and multiple \n     jurisdictions responded. The occurrence of this problem at \n     three very different sites is strong evidence that compatible \n     and adequate communications among public safety organizations \n     at the local, State, and Federal levels remains an important \n     problem.''.\n       (3) In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Congress \n     directed the FCC to allocate spectrum currently being used by \n     television broadcasters to public safety agencies to use for \n     emergency communications. This spectrum has specific \n     characteristics that make it an outstanding choice for \n     emergency communications because signals sent over these \n     frequencies are able to penetrate walls and travel great \n     distances, and can assist multiple jurisdictions in deploying \n     interoperable communications systems.\n       (4) This spectrum will not be fully available to public \n     safety agencies until the completion of the digital \n     television transition. The need for this spectrum is greater \n     than ever. The nation cannot risk further loss of life due to \n     public safety agencies' first responders' inability to \n     communicate effectively in the event of another terrorist act \n     or other crisis, such as a hurricane, tornado, flood, or \n     earthquake.\n       (5) In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress set a date \n     of December 31, 2006, for the termination of the digital \n     television transition. Under current law, however, the \n     deadline will be extended if fewer than 85 percent of the \n     television households in a market are able to continue \n     receiving local television broadcast signals.\n       (6) Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. \n     Powell testified at a hearing before the Senate Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation Committee on September 8, 2004, \n     that, absent government action, this extension may allow the \n     digital television transition to continue for ``decades'' or \n     ``multiples of decades''.\n       (7) The Nation's public safety and welfare cannot be put \n     off for ``decades'' or ``multiples of decades''. The Federal \n     government should ensure that this spectrum is available for \n     use by public safety organizations by January 1, 2009.\n       (8) Any plan to end the digital television transition would \n     be incomplete if it did not ensure that consumers would be \n     able to continue to enjoy over-the-air broadcast television \n     with minimal disruption. If broadcasters air only a digital \n     signal, some consumers may be unable to view digital \n     transmissions using their analog-only television set. Local \n     broadcasters are truly an important part of our homeland \n     security and often an important communications vehicle in the \n     event of a national emergency. Therefore, consumers who rely \n     on over-the-air television, particularly those of limited \n     economic means, should be assisted.\n       (9) The New America Foundation has testified before \n     Congress that the cost to assist these 17.4 million \n     exclusively over-the-air households to continue to view \n     television is less than $1 billion dollars for equipment, \n     which equates to roughly 3 percent of the Federal revenue \n     likely from the auction of the analog television spectrum.\n       (10) Specifically, the New America Foundation has estimated \n     that the Federal Government's auction of this spectrum could \n     yield $30-to-$40 billion in revenue to the Treasury. Chairman \n     Powell stated at the September 8, 2004, hearing that \n     ``estimates of the value of that spectrum run anywhere from \n     $30 billion to $70 billion''.\n       (11) Additionally, there will be societal benefits with the \n     return of the analog broadcast spectrum. Former FCC Chairman \n     Reed F. Hundt, at an April 28, 2004, hearing before the \n     Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, \n     testified that this spectrum ``should be the fit and proper \n     home of wireless broadband''. Mr. Hundt continued, ``Quite \n     literally, [with this spectrum] the more millions of people \n     in rural America will be able to afford Big Broadband \n     Internet access, the more hundreds of millions of people in \n     the world will be able to afford joining the Internet \n     community.''.\n       (12) Due to the benefits that would flow to the Nation's \n     citizens from the Federal Government reclaiming this analog \n     television spectrum--including the safety of our Nation's \n     first responders and those protected by first responders, \n     additional revenues to the Federal treasury, millions of new \n     jobs in the telecommunications sector of the economy, and \n     increased wireless broadband availability to our Nation's \n     rural citizens--Congress finds it necessary to set January 1, \n     2009, as a firm date for the return of this analog television \n     spectrum.\n\n     SEC. 3.

DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, more than two dozen \n     terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, are pursuing chemical, \n     biological, radiological, and nuclear materials.\n       (2) According to the report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, the United States \n     is a prime target for weapons made with chemical, biological, \n     radiological, and nuclear materials.\n       (3) The Department of Energy estimates that about 14,000 \n     sealed sources of greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive \n     waste (as defined in section 61.55 of title 10, Code of \n     Federal Regulations) will become unwanted and will have to be \n     disposed of through the Offsite Source Recovery Program by \n     2010.\n       (4) The Department of Energy--\n       (A) does not have the resources or storage facility to \n     recover and store all unwanted sources of greater-than-Class \n     C low-level radioactive waste; and\n       (B) has not identified a permanent disposal facility.\n       (5) A report by the Government Accountability Office \n     entitled ``Nuclear Proliferation: DOE Action Needed to Ensure \n     Continued Recovery of Unwanted Sealed Radioactive Sources'' \n     states that ``[t]he small size and portability of the sealed \n     sources make them susceptible to misuse, improper disposal, \n     and theft. If these sealed sources fell into the hands of \n     terrorists, they could be used as simple and crude but \n     potentially dangerous radiological weapons, commonly called \n     dirty bombs.''\n       (6) The Government Accountability Office report further \n     states that ``[c]ertain sealed sources are considered \n     particularly attractive for potential use in producing dirty \n     bombs because, among other things, they contain more \n     concentrated amounts of nuclear material known as `greater-\n     than-Class-C material.'''\n       (b) Department of Energy Responsibilities.--\n       (1) Designation of responsibility.--The Secretary of Energy \n     shall designate an entity within the Department of Energy to \n     have the responsibility of completing activities needed to \n     develop a facility for safely disposing of all greater-than-\n     Class C low-level radioactive waste.\n       (2) Consultation with congress.--In developing a plan for a \n     permanent disposal facility for greater-than-Class C low-\n     level radioactive waste (including preparation of an \n     environmental impact statement and issuance of a record of \n     decision), the Secretary of Energy shall consult with \n     Congress.\n       (c) Reports.--\n       (1) Update of 1987 report.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit \n     to Congress an update of the comprehensive report making \n     recommendations for ensuring the safe disposal of all \n     greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste that was \n     submitted by the Secretary to Congress in February 1987.\n       (B) Contents.--The update shall contain--\n       (i) an identification of the radioactive waste that is to \n     be disposed of (including the source of the waste and the \n     volume, concentration, and other relevant characteristics of \n     the waste);\n       (ii) an identification of the Federal and non-Federal \n     options for disposal of the waste;\n       (iii) a description of the actions proposed to ensure the \n     safe disposal of the waste;\n       (iv) an estimate of the costs of the proposed actions;\n       (v) an identification of the options for ensuring that the \n     beneficiaries of the activities resulting in the generation \n     of the radioactive waste bear all reasonable costs of \n     disposing of the waste;\n       (vi) an identification of any statutory authority required \n     for disposal of the waste; and\n       (vii) in coordination with the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an \n     identification of any regulatory guidance needed for the \n     disposal of the waste.\n       (2) Report on permanent disposal facility.--\n       (A) Report on cost and schedule for completion of eis and \n     rod.--Not later than 180 days after the date of submission of \n     the update under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Energy shall \n     submit to Congress a report containing an estimate of the \n     cost and schedule to complete an environmental impact \n     statement and record of decision for a permanent disposal \n     facility for greater-than-Class C radioactive waste.\n\n[[Page S9967]]\n\n       (B) Report on alternatives.--Before the Secretary of Energy \n     makes a final decision on the disposal alternative to be \n     implemented, the Secretary of Energy shall--\n       (i) submit to Congress a report that describes all \n     alternatives under consideration; and\n       (ii) await action by Congress.\n       (3) Report on short-term plan.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2005, the \n     Secretary of Energy shall submit to Congress a plan to ensure \n     the continued recovery and storage of greater-than-Class C \n     low-level radioactive waste until a permanent disposal \n     facility is available.\n       (B) Contents.--The plan shall contain estimated cost, \n     resource, and facility needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3771.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In its final report, the 9-11 Commission advocated that \n     Congress pass legislation providing for the expedited and \n     increased assignment of radio spectrum for public safety \n     purposes. The 9-11 Commission stated that this spectrum was \n     necessary to improve communications between local, State and \n     Federal public safety organizations and public safety \n     organizations operating in neighboring jurisdictions that may \n     respond to an emergency in unison.\n       (2) Specifically, the 9-11 Commission report stated ``The \n     inability to communicate was a critical element at the World \n     Trade Center, Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, \n     crash sites, where multiple agencies and multiple \n     jurisdictions responded. The occurrence of this problem at \n     three very different sites is strong evidence that compatible \n     and adequate communications among public safety organizations \n     at the local, State, and Federal levels remains an important \n     problem.''.\n       (3) In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Congress \n     directed the FCC to allocate spectrum currently being used by \n     television broadcasters to public safety agencies to use for \n     emergency communications. This spectrum has specific \n     characteristics that make it an outstanding choice for \n     emergency communications because signals sent over these \n     frequencies are able to penetrate walls and travel great \n     distances, and can assist multiple jurisdictions in deploying \n     interoperable communications systems.\n       (4) This spectrum will not be fully available to public \n     safety agencies until the completion of the digital \n     television transition. The need for this spectrum is greater \n     than ever. The nation cannot risk further loss of life due to \n     public safety agencies' first responders' inability to \n     communicate effectively in the event of another terrorist act \n     or other crisis, such as a hurricane, tornado, flood, or \n     earthquake.\n       (5) In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress set a date \n     of December 31, 2006, for the termination of the digital \n     television transition. Under current law, however, the \n     deadline will be extended if fewer than 85 percent of the \n     television households in a market are able to continue \n     receiving local television broadcast signals.\n       (6) Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. \n     Powell testified at a hearing before the Senate Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation Committee on September 8, 2004, \n     that, absent government action, this extension may allow the \n     digital television transition to continue for ``decades'' or \n     ``multiples of decades''.\n       (7) The Nation's public safety and welfare cannot be put \n     off for ``decades'' or ``multiples of decades''. The Federal \n     government should ensure that this spectrum is available for \n     use by public safety organizations by January 1, 2009.\n       (8) Any plan to end the digital television transition would \n     be incomplete if it did not ensure that consumers would be \n     able to continue to enjoy over-the-air broadcast television \n     with minimal disruption. If broadcasters air only a digital \n     signal, some consumers may be unable to view digital \n     transmissions using their analog-only television set. Local \n     broadcasters are truly an important part of our homeland \n     security and often an important communications vehicle in the \n     event of a national emergency. Therefore, consumers who rely \n     on over-the-air television, particularly those of limited \n     economic means, should be assisted.\n       (9) The New America Foundation has testified before \n     Congress that the cost to assist these 17.4 million \n     exclusively over-the-air households to continue to view \n     television is less than $1 billion dollars for equipment, \n     which equates to roughly 3 percent of the Federal revenue \n     likely from the auction of the analog television spectrum.\n\n[[Page S9968]]\n\n       (10) Specifically, the New America Foundation has estimated \n     that the Federal Government's auction of this spectrum could \n     yield $30-to-$40 billion in revenue to the Treasury. Chairman \n     Powell stated at the September 8, 2004, hearing that \n     ``estimates of the value of that spectrum run anywhere from \n     $30 billion to $70 billion''.\n       (11) Additionally, there will be societal benefits with the \n     return of the analog broadcast spectrum. Former FCC Chairman \n     Reed F. Hundt, at an April 28, 2004, hearing before the \n     Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, \n     testified that this spectrum ``should be the fit and proper \n     home of wireless broadband''. Mr. Hundt continued, ``Quite \n     literally, [with this spectrum] the more millions of people \n     in rural America will be able to afford Big Broadband \n     Internet access, the more hundreds of millions of people in \n     the world will be able to afford joining the Internet \n     community.''.\n       (12) Due to the benefits that would flow to the Nation's \n     citizens from the Federal Government reclaiming this analog \n     television spectrum--including the safety of our Nation's \n     first responders and those protected by first responders, \n     additional revenues to the Federal treasury, millions of new \n     jobs in the telecommunications sector of the economy, and \n     increased wireless broadband availability to our Nation's \n     rural citizens--Congress finds it necessary to set January 1, \n     2009, as a firm date for the return of this analog television \n     spectrum.\n\n     SEC. 3. SETTING A SPECIFIC DATE FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF \n                   SPECTRUM FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS AND \n                   CREATING A DEADLINE FOR THE TRANSITION TO \n                   DIGITAL TELEVISION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 309(j)(14) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(14)) is amended--\n       (5) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(E) Acceleration of deadline for public safety use.--\n       ``(i) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and (B), the \n     Commission shall take all action necessary to complete by \n     December 31, 2007--\n\n       ``(I) the return of television station licenses operating \n     on channels between 764 and 776 megaHertz and between 794 and \n     806 megaHertz; and\n       ``(II) assignment of the electromagnetic spectrum between \n     764 and 776 megahertz, and between 794 and 806 megahertz, for \n     public safety services.\n\n       ``(ii) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), the \n     Commission shall have the authority to modify, reassign, or \n     require the return of, the television station licenses \n     assigned to frequencies between 758 and 764 megahertz, 776 \n     and 782 megahertz, and 788 and 794 megahertz as necessary to \n     permit operations by public safety services on frequencies \n     between 764 and 776 megahertz and between 794 and 806 \n     megahertz, after the date of enactment of the this section, \n     but such modifications, reassignments, or returns may not \n     take effect until after December 31, 2007.''.\n     (b) The FCC may waive the requirements of sections (i) and \n     (ii) and such other rules as necessary:\n       (A) in the absence of a bona fide request from relevant \n     first responders in the affected designated market area; and;\n       (B) to the extent necessary to avoid consumer disruption \n     but only if all relevant public safety entities are able to \n     use such frequencies free of interference by December 31, \n     2007, or are otherwise able to resolve interference issues \n     with relevant broadcast licensee by mutual agreement.''\n\n     SEC. --04. STUDIES OF COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES AND NEEDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Commission, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, shall conduct a study to \n     assess strategies that may be used to meet public safety \n     communications needs, including--\n       (1) the short-term and long-term need for additional \n     spectrum allocation for Federal, State, and local first \n     responders, including an additional allocation of spectrum in \n     the 700 megaHertz band;\n       (2) the need for a nationwide interoperable broadband \n     mobile communications network;\n       (3) the ability of public safety entities to utilize \n     wireless broadband applications; and\n       (4) the communications capabilities of first receivers such \n     as hospitals and health care workers, and current efforts to \n     promote communications coordination and training among the \n     first responders and the first receivers.\n       (b) Reallocation Study.--The Commission shall conduct a \n     study to assess the advisability of reallocating any amount \n     of spectrum in the 700 megaHertz band for unlicensed \n     broadband uses. In the study, the Commission shall consider \n     all other possible users of this spectrum, including public \n     safety.\n       (c) Report.--The Commission shall report the results of the \n     studies, together with any recommendations it may have, to \n     the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce within 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. --05.

PRIVATE SECTOR PREPAREDNESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Private sector organizations own 85 percent of the \n     Nation's critical infrastructure and employ the vast majority \n     of the Nation's workers.\n       (2) Unless a terrorist attack targets a military or other \n     secure government facility, the first people called upon to \n     respond will likely be civilians.\n       (3) Despite the exemplary efforts of some private entities, \n     the private sector remains largely unprepared for a terrorist \n     attack, due in part to the lack of a widely accepted standard \n     for private sector preparedness.\n       (4) Preparedness in the private sector and public sector \n     for rescue, restart and recovery of operations should \n     include--\n       (A) a plan for evacuation;\n       (B) adequate communications capabilities; and\n       (C) a plan for continuity of operations.\n       (5) The American National Standards Institute recommends a \n     voluntary national preparedness standard for the private \n     sector based on the existing American National Standard on \n     Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity \n     Programs (NFPA 1600), with appropriate modifications. This \n     standard would establish a common set of criteria and \n     terminology for preparedness, disaster management, emergency \n     management, and business continuity programs.\n       (6) The mandate of the Department of Homeland Security \n     extends to working with the private sector, as well as \n     government entities.\n       (b) Private Sector Preparedness Program.--\n       (1) In general.--Title V of the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002 (6 U.S.C. 311 et seq.), as amended by section 805, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 511. PRIVATE SECTOR PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM.\n\n       ``The Secretary shall establish a program to promote \n     private sector preparedness for terrorism and other \n     emergencies, including promoting the adoption of a voluntary \n     national preparedness standard such as the private sector \n     preparedness standard developed by the American National \n     Standards Institute and based on the National Fire Protection \n     Association 1600 Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management \n     and Business Continuity Programs.''.\n       (2) Technical and conforming amendment.--Section 1(b) of \n     that Act, as amended by section 805, is amended by inserting \n     after the item relating to section 510 the following:\n\n``Sec. 511.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony, documents, and representation in a criminal action pending \nin Florida Federal District Court. In this action, the defendant is \ncharged with impersonating an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nconspiracy to impersonate a CIA agent, possession of a firearm after a \nfelony conviction, and mail fraud. The indictment alleges that the \ndefendant unjustly enriched himself by obtaining money from third \nparties upon the false representation that he was working with the CIA \non a secret operation to obtain funds allegedly stolen from Cuban \nleader Fidel Castro. According to the prosecution, in furtherance of \nthe alleged fraud, the defendant or his co-conspirators provided to \nthird parties a fictitious letter purportedly signed by Senator Graham.\n  The defendant's trial is scheduled to commence on or about November \n1, 2004. The prosecution has requested testimony and the production of \ndocuments from a member of the Senator's staff who has evidence \nrelevant to the charged offenses. Senator Graham wishes to cooperate \nwith the prosecution's request. Accordingly, the enclosed resolution \nauthorizes that staff member, and any other employees of Senator \nGraham's office from whom evidence may be required, to testify and \nproduce documents in this action.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof H.R. 4259, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4259) to amend title 31, United States Code, \n     to improve the financial accountability requirements \n     applicable to the Department of Homeland Security, to \n     establish requirements for the Future Years Homeland Security \n     Program of the Department, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                       homeland security strategy\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to call attention to a critical \npiece of this legislation--the requirement in section 5 of H.R. 4259, \nthe Department of Homeland Security Financial Accountability Act, for \nan annual homeland security strategy.\n  Before 9/11, we did not truly perceive the threat of terrorism on our \nown soil, and what homeland security efforts we did have underway were \nbadly divided. Dozens of agencies responsible for pieces of our \nhomeland security were scattered across the Federal Government, and \nwere largely unconnected to State and local officials and first \nresponders on the front lines in our nation's cities and towns. There \nwere overlaps and, more critically, treacherous gaps. And because \neveryone was responsible for parts of the effort, no one was ultimately \nin charge.\n  We took one large step to remedy these weaknesses by creating the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS. The Department brings more than \ntwo dozen of the Federal Government's critical homeland security \nagencies and programs under one roof, allowing for unprecedented \ncoordination and cooperation. It also created a Cabinet Secretary \ncharged with managing the budget and personnel of these agencies, and \ncapable of providing a focal point for homeland programs and issues in \nthe Cabinet and beyond.\n  But we knew that in addition to creating a better organization we \nwould need to lay out a clear roadmap to galvanize our homeland \ndefenses--at all levels of Government and the private sector. That is \nwhat many of us called for and, regretfully, it is something this \nNation still sorely lacks.\n  The administration did produce a ``National Strategy for Homeland \nSecurity'' in July 2002 that correctly identified many of the \nchallenges we face in preparing to meet the threat of terrorism. But \nthat document predates the creation of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and is already badly out of date.\n  More significantly, as the highly regarded Gilmore Commission on \nterrorism noted in its final report last December:\n\n       Much is still required in order to achieve an effective, \n     comprehensive, unified national strategy and to translate \n     vision into action. Notably, absent is a clear prioritization \n     for the use of scarce resources against a diffuse, unclear \n     threat as part of the spectrum of threats--some significantly \n     more common than terrorism. The panel has serious concerns \n     about the current state of homeland security efforts along \n     the full spectrum from awareness to recovery and is worried \n     that efforts by the government may provide the perception of \n     enhanced security that causes the nation to become complacent \n     about the many critical actions still required.\n\n  It is true that the Department of Homeland Security is proceeding \nwith some more targeted strategic regarding specific areas of concern, \nbut these cannot replace a comprehensive strategy that sets the \nultimate policies and priorities for our homeland effort.\n  That is why I am pleased that the legislation before us calls upon \nthe administration to develop and update its homeland security strategy \nin connection with its budgeting process for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. More specifically, the legislation requires that the \nSecretary for Homeland Security:\n\n     . . . set forth the homeland security strategy of the \n     department, which shall be developed and updated as \n     appropriate annually . . .\n\nand explain how that strategy relates to the Department's planned \nbudgeting.\n  As it does so, the administration should adhere to the guiding \nprinciples laid out in the February 3, 2004 report by the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, now referred to as the Government \nAccountability Office, regarding the Nation's various strategies \nrelated to terrorism and homeland security. In that report, the GAO \nsurveyed 7 existing Federal strategies related to terrorism--including \nthe National Strategy for Homeland Security--and laid out guiding \nprinciples to improve these strategies. These principles stress \naccountability and prioritization as requirements for a sound strategy. \nThe new strategy must employ risk assessment and analysis to help \nprioritize strategic goals, then indicate the specific activities \nneeded to achieve those goals, as well as the likely costs and how such \nfunds should be generated. In other words, the strategy must make real \nchoices about priorities and resources. The current strategy identifies \nmany goals, but rarely provides real deadlines for action, standards or \nperformance measures to assess progress, or details on the resources \nrequired for stated initiatives.\n\n  The strategy should clearly spell out organizational roles and \nresponsibilities, including the proper roles of State, local, private \nand international actors and the coordinating mechanisms to bring these \nactors together. Almost 3 years after 9/11, we still too often must ask \n``who is in charge?'' of key pieces of our homeland security agenda. \nAnd, critically, the homeland security strategy must address how it \nrelates to other Federal strategies regarding terrorist threats, and \nhow the strategies will be integrated.\n  Such a strategy must also provide more leadership on critical \ncomponents of our homeland effort, such as a thoroughgoing strategy to \nmaximize information sharing related to homeland security throughout \nthe Federal Government and with state and local officials\n\n[[Page S9988]]\n\nand, where appropriate, the private sector. The strategy must look at \npreparing the public health sector to detect and respond to terrorist \nattacks, at integrating military capabilities into our homeland \nsecurity planning, at building emergency preparedness throughout all \nlevels of Government and the private sector, and securing our critical \ninfrastructure, much of which is in private hands.\n  While the Department of Homeland Security is central to our effort to \nprotect the homeland, many critical components of the homeland security \neffort nonetheless lie outside the Department. An effective strategy \nmust address all key homeland security programs, and should involve the \ncooperation of the Homeland Security Council and the President's \nSpecial Assistant for Homeland Security to assist the Secretary in \ngathering appropriate input from throughout the Federal government.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has made important strides in \nimproving our homeland defenses. But in the face of ongoing threats of \nterrorist attacks on our homeland, we cannot afford anything less than \nour best effort. Today, we still lack strong direction on critical \naspects of our homeland security effort. A new and more forceful \nnational strategy will energize and organize our resources--at all \nlevels of Government and within the private sector--to better meet the \nthreats ahead.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his comments on \nthis important issue, and rise to add my own remarks on the critical \nimportance of building a strong homeland security strategy. As members \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee labored over legislation to \ncreate the Department of Homeland Security, we became well acquainted \nwith the daunting array of programs and policies that are part of our \nhomeland security effort. In creating the Department, and through \nefforts we have undertaken since that time, the committee has worked to \nhelp supply the Department of Homeland Security with the tools it will \nneed to be successful. Our oversight work has demonstrated the need to \nhave a strong national strategy to guide our homeland efforts. I agree \nwith my colleague that GAO and others have identified ways in which our \nhomeland security strategy could be strengthened and updated. This \nlegislation will facilitate improvements by requiring that the \nadministration lay out its homeland security strategy anew, and \ncoordinate this strategy with its annual budget requests. This should \nbring out strategic vision into sharper view, and ensure that adequate \nresources are sought and secured to carry out homeland priorities.\n\n\n                        financial accountability\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \npassage of H.R. 4259, the Department of Homeland Security Financial \nAccountability Act. This Act will apply the Chief Financial Officers \nAct of 1990 to the Department of Homeland Security, and will codify the \nexistence of an Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation within the \nDepartment. This latter provision, which was not part of the Senate-\npassed companion bill, S. 1567, is an important one, and I would like \nto engage in a colloquy with the chair and ranking member of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs to clarify what is and is not \nintended by this provision.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is charged with carrying out a \nwide range of activities related to our domestic security. In my view, \nit is probably the executive department with the broadest range of \nactivities that need to be coordinated and reconciled from a \nprogrammatic standpoint. It is crucial that the Department have a \nrobust programmatic coordination function at the highest level, and \nthat this function have, at its base, a strong analytical capability \nfor purposes of setting priorities among the disparate parts of the \nDepartment for purposes of budget formulation and execution. For this \nreason, the statutory creation of an Office of Program Analysis and \nEvaluation, and the mandate that it report no lower in the organization \nthan directly to the new chief financial officer, is very sound.\n  There is another related function in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity that has been given a different placement by statute. That is \nthe function of test and evaluation for developing homeland security \npriorities and for assessing specific technologies. Under section 302 \nof the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Under Secretary for Science \nand Technology within the Department of Homeland Security was given \nstatutory missions for, among other things, ``assessing and testing \nhomeland security vulnerabilities and possible threats,'' ``testing and \nevaluation activities that are relevant to any or all elements of the \nDepartment'' and ``coordinating and integrating all research, \ndevelopment, testing, and evaluation activities of the Department.'' It \nis crucial that these testing and evaluation functions remain under the \nmanagement of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, because \nthey need strong scientific management and focus. We cannot afford to \nspend constrained Federal funds for homeland security on approaches or \ntechnologies that are not technically sound, or that are not cost-\neffective compared to other technologies.\n  I do not believe that there is an inherent conflict between the new \nstatutory office created by this bill and the existing statutory \nassignments in the Homeland Security Act. Offices like the proposed \nOffice of Program Analysis and Evaluation exist in several executive \ndepartments, and are generally more focused on assessing programmatic \ndirections, outcomes, resources, and priorities. The test and \nevaluation function, in contrast, focuses more specifically on \ntechnical issues and relative technical merits. In the Department of \nDefense, for example, both functions are in distinct organizations that \nwork together where appropriate to complement the different strengths \nand missions that each brings to the table. It would be my assumption \nthat this is the outcome that Congress wants to see in the case of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  With this as background, I would like to ascertain from my \ncolleagues, the chair and ranking member of the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, if they agree with my understanding that the \nstatutory creation of the new Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation \nis not meant to supersede or alter the testing and evaluation function \nthat Congress has previously assigned to the Under Secretary of \nHomeland Security for Science and Technology.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I have spoken to the necessary parties.

Does the Senator accept the modification?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection to the request of the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the information of all Senators, tomorrow the \nSenate will resume consideration of the intelligence reform bill. We \nhad good debate on the bill today, disposing of several amendments. In \naddition, we were able to lock in a final list of amendments and a \nfiling deadline for tomorrow, as well, so that Members will be able to \nview actual legislative text for each amendment.\n  For the remainder of the day tomorrow we will continue working \nthrough amendments to the bill. The chairman and ranking member will be \nhere to receive amendments. Again, we will complete action on the bill \nprior to adjourning. Senators who wish to offer amendments are \nencouraged to work with the managers to get their amendments pending. \nSenators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day.\n  I observe that when the Senate passed fiscal year 2005 Defense \nappropriations conference report, we adopted discretionary spending \nlevels for all fiscal year 2005 appropriations of $821.9 billion. \nUnfortunately, the continuing resolution, H.J. Res. 107, authorized an \nannualized spending level of more than $840 billion because section 103 \nof the resolution allows billions in 2004 supplemental appropriations \nto continue into a new fiscal year. It is my understanding the House of \nRepresentatives will shortly pass a bill to correct this problem and \neliminate funding in the CR for any one-time 2004 spending items. It \nalso is my understanding that the majority leader and Chairman Stevens \nwill seek to have the Senate consider that correction whenever it \nbecomes available. I believe it is essential we comply with the \nspending limits we previously adopted, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/29/senate-section/article/S9994-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
