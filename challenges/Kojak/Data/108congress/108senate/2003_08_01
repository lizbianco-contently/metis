Mr. President, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to \none of America's greatest performers, Mr. Bob Hope, somebody who has \nchanged all of our lives in very special and individual ways. As we all \nknow, he died last Sunday night of pneumonia, with his family at his \nbedside.\n  The family plans an August 27 mass in Los Angeles, and a public \nmemorial later that afternoon at the Academy of Television Arts and \nSciences. Today, I wish to remember, in this humble body, Mr. Hope's \nprofound contributions to American life.\n  Bob Hope was born one of six boys in a London suburb on May 29, 1903. \nHis family made their way to America when he was three, and they \nsettled in Cleveland, OH. What a blessing for America that the Hope \nfamily made that journey.\n  Growing up, Bob Hope was a shoe shine boy, a butcher's mate, \nstockboy, newspaper boy, golf caddy, shoe salesman, and even a prize \nfighter. All of these things, before he became what we remember him as, \none of America's most beloved and successful entertainers.\n  As a performer, Bob Hope had the rare and miraculous gift of being \nable to touch our common humanity.\n  His famous road pictures with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour were the \nquintessential expressions of the adventure of being an American.\n  But he is most loved, of course, for the thousands of hours and \nmillions of miles he spent on selfless devotion to our troops. He \ntraversed 9 million miles, despite a fear of flying, to comfort and \nentertain our fighting men and women.\n  World War II, South Korea, Vietnam, from the Far East to Northern \nAfrica, the Indonesian Peninsula to the heart of Europe, in jungles and \nrefugee camps, Air Force bases, Navy ships, forward bases, and \ndemilitarized zones, Bob Hope went wherever we needed him, and he \nconveyed to our troops the commitment and love of the American people.\n  The front rows would be filled with soldiers injured in battle, limbs \nblown off, bodies wrapped in bandages and he would manage to make them \nlaugh.\n  He was able--for those moments while he was onstage giving his best \nto our best--to lift those young men and women out of their war torn \nbodies and help them forget the fatigue, fear and loneliness of battle.\n  Time magazine wrote in 1943 that ``Hope was funny, treating hoards of \nsoldiers to roars of laughter. He was friendly--ate with servicemen, \ndrank with them, read their doggerel, listened to their songs. He was \nindefatigable, running himself ragged with five, six, seven shows a \nday. . . . Hence boys whom Hope might entertain for an hour awaited him \nfor weeks. And when he came, anonymous guys who had no other \nrecognition felt personally remembered.''\n  Hope narrowly escaped an attempt on his life when his hotel in \nVietnam was bombed by enemy forces. He was waiting at the airport for \nhis cue cards to be unloaded from the plane, and the delay literally \nsaved him. You could say it was the only occasion he didn't have \nperfect timing, and thank goodness.\n  Bob Hope's dear friend, legendary golfer and Hall of Famer, Arnold \nPalmer, said today that he believes the reason why Bob Hope lived so \nlong was because he was fundamentally happy and doing what he loved. \nMay we all be so blessed.\n  Albert Einstein said, ``Try not to become a man of success, but, \nrather, to become a man of value.'' Bob Hope managed to become both.\n  Four stars on the Walk of Fame--one for each child, a legendarily \nhappy marriage of 69 years to his beloved Dolores.\n  I wanna tell ya': Bob Hope is a giant and a national treasure. We \nwill never forget his service to our country.\n  Thank you for the memories, Mr. Hope. Godspeed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \nmajority leader's comments about Bob Hope. I remember the morning after \nhe died his daughter was interviewed. She said as the children were \ncoming in and saying goodbye to him, one of them asked, Dad, where do \nyou want to be buried? He said, ``Surprise me.''\n  He had a one-liner right to the end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10874-3", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10874-S10875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE FIRST SESSION OF THE 108TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another subject, I commend the \nmajority leader, before he leaves the floor, for his extraordinary \nleadership this year. We have truly had an outstanding 6 months. I am \ntotally confident it would not have happened but for his nurturing of \nall Members and moving us in the right direction, dealing with the \nmyriad complaints and concerns that arise from Members on both sides of \nthe aisle during the course of trying to move legislation forward.\n  As he goes into the August recess, he should feel very good about \naccomplishments so far this year.\n  The accomplishments of this Senate in the first session of this 108th \nCongress would be considered remarkable in any historical comparison. \nBut given that our President is in the second half of his term and the \nslender majority that his party holds in the Senate, the record of \naccomplishments is nothing short of extraordinary.\n  These actions have substantially improved our homeland security, our \nnational security, our economic security, and the health and retirement \nsecurity of our seniors. We have compensated for the budgetary and \nappropriations shortfalls of last year and are on path to complete our \nappropriations for the coming year in good order.\n  In the last 2 months alone, this Senate has taken the historic step \nof passing legislation to add a prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors in the Medicare program while imposing much needed market-based \nreforms. Almost 40 years after the programs creation, and after years \nof unfulfilled promises, the Senate is poised to complete final action \nwhen it returns in September.\n  In the last 2 months, this Senate has passed both the defense \nauthorization and defense appropriations bills to keep our military \nstrong and ready.\n  In the last 2 months, the Senate has passed the Federal Aviation \nAdministration reauthorization to revitalize an air transport industry \nsuffering from the effects of the terrorist attack of \n9/11.\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\n  The Senate has passed appropriation bills for the legislative branch, \nmilitary construction, and homeland security, with 8 others ready for \nfloor action upon our return in September.\n  After 42 days of consideration during the past 2 years, the Senate \nhas passed an energy bill.\n  After more than a decade of repression, the Senate has passed the \nBurmese Freedom and Democracy Act.\n  And to ensure funding of any disasters that may arise prior to the \nCongress' return in September, the Senate has enacted an emergency \nsupplemental for FEMA funding.\n  Looking to the earlier part of the year, the Senate, extended \nunemployment benefits to those who need it--twice; passed the 11 \nunfinished spending bills from the last Congress; funded Operation \nIraqi Freedom; initiated the protection of Homeland by confirming the \nnomination of the first Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity; maintained fiscal discipline by passing the Federal budget \nwhich the Senate failed to do last year; enacted the President's plans \nto create jobs and stimulate the economy; banned the horrific practice \nof partial birth abortion; passed the President's faith-based \ninitiative; funded the effort to eradicate the scourge of global AIDs; \nacted to guard our children against abduction and exploitation by \npassing the PROTECT Act; improved safeguards from foreign terrorists by \nenacting the FISA bill; expanded of NATO to include most of the former \nWarsaw Pact countries; passed a significant arms reduction treaty with \nenemy turned ally, Russia; taken steps to bridge the digital divided by \nproviding needed funds to historically black colleges; affirmed the \nconstitutionality of using the term ``under God'' in the Pledge of \nAllegiance; awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to Prime Minister Tony \nBlair; and provided tax equity to men and women in our Nation's Armed \nForces.\n  This is a record all Senators can be particularly proud of. There is \nmuch yet to be done, but we have had an extraordinary first half of the \nyear. Members of the Senate can go back to their States with a good \nfeeling they have made great progress for our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10875-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me speak very briefly in regard to \nthe Energy bill that we passed here last night. As I just did \npersonally, let me congratulate the majority leader on the decision he \nand the minority leader, Senator Daschle, made to move ahead and take \nthe bill that was developed and had strong bipartisan support in the \nprevious Congress and send that to the conference with the House as the \ndemocratically passed bill.\n  I think that was the right decision. That bill, as many have said, \nhad a strong majority in the previous Congress. I think there were 88 \nSenators voting for it. There were nearly that many voting for it last \nnight when it, once again, passed the Senate. I think that does allow \nus to move to the next stage of the process of actually writing a \ncomprehensive Energy bill.\n  I, like many of my colleagues on the Democratic side, strongly \nsupport enacting a comprehensive bill. We have worked very hard to do \nthat in the previous Congress. We worked hard to do that in this \nCongress, and to assist the majority in the development of the bill.\n  I believe strongly that the amendments that were offered to the bill \nthat my colleague, Senator Domenici, brought to the floor were \nconstructive amendments, were intended to improve the bill, were \nintended to get us in a better position to serve the needs of the \ncountry as far as energy is concerned over the next years and decades.\n  I think this result is a good one. Like all successful results in \nCongress, nobody won everything; nobody lost everything. There were \nwins and losses on both sides. I think that is the nature of \ncompromise. But the end result is the American people will win. We will \nbe able to go to conference now and hopefully develop an Energy bill \nthat will continue to enjoy strong bipartisan support.\n  That is a challenge, as I see it. We have come a long way in a \nbipartisan way. We have had disagreements about particular provisions \nof the bill, but by and large we have been willing to resolve those \ndifferences and come up with something that makes good sense for the \ncountry. That same process needs to continue in the conference. I am \nconfident it will.\n  Again, my colleague Senator Domenici will chair that conference. We \nhad some disagreement in the previous Congress as to whether the Senate \nor House chairman should be the chair of the conference. We concluded \nthat, based on precedent and all, in the 107th Congress the House was \nentitled to that position. But it is obvious now that in this Congress \nthe Senate is entitled to that position. Senator Domenici will chair \nthe conference. I hope to be on the conference once the conferees are \nnamed, and I look forward to working with him and with all the other \nmembers on the conference to try to ensure that we come up with a good \nbill that meets our long-term energy needs.\n  Let me, before I yield the floor, just take a moment to thank the \nstaff, the Energy Committee staff, the cloakroom staff, and Senator \nDaschle's staff, for the hard work they put in getting us to this point \non the energy legislation: On the Democratic committee staff of the \nEnergy Committee: Bob Simon, Sam Fowler, Vicki Thorne, Patty Beneke, \nMike Connor, Leon Lowery, Deborah Estes, Jennifer Michael, Bill Wicker, \nJonathan Black, Jonathan Epstein, Malini Sekhar, Poonum Agrawal, Amanda \nGoldman, Shelley Brown, and Rosemarie Calabro.\n\n  The Democratic cloakroom staff, of course, is essential to all the \nprogress we make here in the Senate. I want to acknowledge them: Marty \nPaone, Lula Davis, Nancy Iacomini, Tim Mitchell, Tricia Engle, Bret \nWincup, Eric Pederson, Joe Lapia, Ben Vaughan.\n  I thank all of them and also Senator Daschle's excellent staff that \nis essential to all progress, as well, here in the Senate: Mark \nChildress, Jonathan Lehman, Peter Umhofer, Mark Patterson, and Michele \nBallentine.\n  I think the result we achieved regarding energy was a good one. We \nnow have a lot of work to do this fall when we return on the \nconference. I look forward to that. I am confident we can succeed in \npassing a good, bipartisan bill. I hope that will be the result.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have passed the supplemental \nappropriations bill. Because of the lateness of the hour last evening, \nand the fact that the House had already adjourned, having sent an \nemergency spending bill to us that basically included disaster relief \nmoney to FEMA, almost $1 billion, we were left with a choice of having \nto take it or leave it. It certainly was necessary for funding for FEMA \nfor all kinds of emergencies. But, unfortunately, we did not have the \nopportunity to amend the bill to add additional items of very necessary \nfunding.\n  One of those is the ongoing investigation into what happened to the \nSpace Shuttle Columbia. This commission was established by NASA and \nheaded by retired Navy Admiral Gayman. I have personally visited with \nthem several times, and I am quite impressed with the professionalism \nof the individual members of the Columbia commission.\n  Certainly I am impressed with the professionalism and the dedication \nof Admiral Gayman as we anticipate the forthcoming report about what \nhappened to the space shuttle. What was\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n\nthe cause? What is the fix? I think we can anticipate we are going to \nsee them go much deeper into the organization of NASA itself as to what \ncan be improved. I want to talk about that for a minute.\n  Let me get to the point about my coming to the floor so I can address \nthis issue. They did not get the money appropriated which they need to \ncontinue the investigation. The only place conceivably they could get \nit is to take it right out of the hide of NASA. Of course, NASA has \nbeen starved over the last 10 years, which is part of the reason we got \nto this point in the first place. Safety was not given the priority it \nshould have been given. Often safety is a reflection of where the \nresources--the money--is going. Thus, over that decade, right up until \nrecently, NASA was starved of funds and, therefore, they were taking \nmoney out of space shuttle safety upgrades and putting it into other \nareas. That is one of the problems I think the Gayman commission will \nidentify as their report comes forward.\n  But the supplemental appropriations bill that we passed last night \ndid not provide the appropriation of $50 million for the Gayman \ncommission when, in fact, it is ongoing and it will be reporting.\n  The long and short of it is that when we come back in session in \nSeptember, that is one of the items we will have to address \nimmediately. I think the will is clearly here in the Senate. From \ntalking to the leadership on both sides of the aisle, I think the will \nis clearly here, and that is an item that we will have to attend to.\n  Let me say a couple of words about the investigation and what I think \nthey might find. Clearly, the dramatic evidence they have is that this \npiece of foam that covered one of the support structures for the strut \nthat attaches to the orbiter came off after launch during the ascent. \nIt came off at such a rate and velocity, hitting the leading edge of \nthe wing--that reinforced carbon--that it just blew a hole in it. Yet \nwhen the space shuttle got into orbit many engineers in the space \nagency were saying we ought to take photographs of it. That was denied. \nThe capability of those high resolution photographs is well known, well \nestablished, and well reported in the press. That would have shown the \nbreach. The breach was estimated to be probably a half foot. With that \nkind of photography available, NASA managers would have been able to \nclearly see it.\n  Then the question is, What would you do about it? They had the \ncapability because we had another space shuttle already stacked. It was \nback in the vehicle assembly building. It could have been processed; it \ncould have been done double time. They could have rolled it out to the \npad. Unless there was a major hitch, they could have launched it. They \ncould have gotten this launched as a rescue shuttle in time. Another \noption was they could have done an EVA--that is an acronym for space \nwalk--from Columbia in orbit.\n  The ingenuity of NASA in a time of peril is just incredible. What \nthat space team, that space family can do to figure out how to take \ncare of problems and how to meet emergencies is incredible.\n  Let us not forget Apollo 13. On the way to the Moon, the major \nengines exploded. They were losing oxygen. They were losing air \npressure. That team went into emergency mode and they figured out how \nto get those three Apollo astronauts back into the lunar lander. Then \nthey figured out how to use the motor of the lunar lander. As the \ngravity of the Moon caught them and pulled them behind the Moon, they \nused that motor to kick them out of lunar orbit onto a trajectory back \nto Earth. All reasonable people thought we were going to have three \ndead astronauts. Yet the NASA team, the NASA family, even the astronaut \nwho had been bumped from the flight because he had been exposed to the \nmeasles--he was on the ground--could go into the simulator and work it \nreal time--figured out how to bring them back. That team, headed by \nastronaut Jim Lovell, who was in the spacecraft, came back home. They \ncame back home safely. It was an incredible time. It is just another \nexample of the ingenuity and the high-pressure decisionmaking that \nNASA's family and its team is capable of doing.\n\n  Had they known that a hole was blown into the leading edge of the \nleft wing of the Space Shuttle Columbia this past February, they, too, \nwould have been able to figure out something that they could do in a \nspace walk to stuff it in. That may not have saved them but we could \nhave tried.\n  I think the Gayman report will discuss these issues. But I think the \nGayman report is also going to discuss some additional points.\n  It has been well reported in the press that you can expect they are \ngoing to talk about the lack of communication and the culture of NASA \nthat discourages communication from the bottom up. That is a culture \nthat leads to intimidation of people coming forth into the open--a \nculture in which the managers are not encouraging that information. It \nis kind of like water. It is very easy for water to flow from the top \ndown, but it is very difficult for water to flow from the bottom up. \nYou have to encourage that communication for it to occur.\n  Interestingly, this same kind of problem occurred 17 years ago in the \ndestruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger. There were engineers in \nProvo, UT, at Morton Thiokol begging their management the night before \nto stop the countdown on the Space Shuttle Challenger because they \nfeared the cold weather was going to stiffen those rubberized gaskets \ncalled O-rings which would on launch allow the hot gases to come \nthrough the joints of the solid rocket boosters, which is exactly what \nhappened, and it caused the destruction of the Space Shuttle \nChallenger.\n  There is a logical reason why it was destroyed, but there is also a \nculture reason why it was destroyed. That culture was a lack of \ncommunication. It was a culture in NASA that did not encourage \ncommunication, that was almost intimidation if you dared challenge the \nauthority.\n  When you are dealing in a research and development agency that is as \ngood as NASA is, you can only expect the very best flow of information \nin all directions.\n  So I am looking forward to Admiral Gayman's commission report, which \nI think will be very helpful as we try to get this problem fixed and \nget flying again so we can get on with America's space program. Once we \naddress all these culture issues, it is going to be the responsibility \nof this Congress to help NASA develop a new goal, a new vision, a new \nmission, that will ignite again the imagination of the American people.\n  I think in large part that is going to be either us going back to the \nmoon with a lunar colony and/or the next major bold step of sending an \ninternational team from planet Earth to planet Mars. That will be an \nexciting day.\n  In the meantime, however, we have to do what we did not do last \nnight. We have to fund the investigation as to the destruction of \nColumbia. We have to fund that commission, and not out of the hide of \nNASA, so that those NASA moneys are not taken away from upgrades in \nsafety. Instead, we have to fund that as we had promised we would fund \nit.\n  Mr. President, there was another program we did not fund last night. \nIt is clearly the majority opinion in this Senate that we want to fund \nAmeriCorps, that we want to continue to have young people have a \nfinancial incentive to help out their country, just like we do in the \nPeace Corps.\n  We have been down to only 7,500 people in the Peace Corps. We need to \nat least get that up to 25,000. I have had foreign leaders over the \ncourse of the last two and a half decades tell me the Peace Corps is \none of the best things America has going for it in our foreign \nrelations.\n  Also, young people who want to help their country, but not \nnecessarily to do so abroad, ought to be able to do so at home. But, \ninstead, what do we see? The House of Representatives cutting \nAmeriCorps.\n  So one of the things we wanted to do last night was to add to the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill an additional amount of \nmoney so AmeriCorps could stay at least at its present level so it was \nnot cut. That was not done. I am sad it was not done. In the judgment \nof this Senator, that clearly was not in the best interests of the \ncountry.\n  Indeed, I would like to see a day in which every young person in \nAmerica\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\nwould have an obligation to their country for 1 or 2 years. And that \nobligation could be their choice of national service. They could go \ninto the military. They could go into the Peace Corps. They could go \ninto AmeriCorps; part of that, the Job Corps. They could go in as \nteachers' aides. They could do innumerable tasks and, in return, have \nsome financial incentives for their own education, something akin to \nwhat we did after the Great War, the GI Bill, where soldiers could come \nback and go to school.\n  The politics is not right for that. It would be costly. But that is a \ngoal I think we ought to work toward. Instead, what we are doing is \nexactly the opposite by cutting AmeriCorps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10877-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                LIBERIA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I was looking forward to going \nright now to a classified briefing on Liberia as part of our Senate \nArmed Services Committee. It is my understanding that briefing has been \ncanceled because they feel too many of the Senators have already gone \nback to their States. I am going to still see if we can get that \ninformation for those of us on the Armed Services Committee who are \nstill here.\n  But as we look at Liberia, we cannot keep delaying decisionmaking. I \nthink putting the marines on the boats offshore is clearly a step in \nthe right direction, but this should have been done a couple of weeks \nago. Although it wasn't, the marines are in transit, and that is a step \nin the right direction.\n  What do we need to do? I think it is clearly in the interest of the \nUnited States that we diplomatically--in addition to the military \naction--make sure the cease-fire we are trying to get in place stays, \nand to reach out to all sides, including the rebel side. I think they \nhave an interest in having the cease-fire. We need to make sure that \ncease-fire sticks. Then we need to work out an arrangement whereby the \nAfrican troops come into place. At that point, once there is a military \npresence stabilizing the country, I think we should have a simultaneous \nevacuation of Taylor with our U.S. Marines coming in with a presence \nfor a short period of time, with mainly the peacekeeping burden being \nput on the ECOWAS or African troops. Clearly, we, the United States, \nneed to be directly involved in order to stabilize that region, with a \nminimum of involvement of U.S. troops.\n  It is clearly in our interest that part of Africa be stabilized. We \nare going to have to help with it. I think the movement of the marines \ninto that region, albeit on the ships offshore, is a step in the right \ndirection. I hope something akin to what I have laid out here will, in \nfact, be put into place.\n  So thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to share these \nthoughts. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to speak to the Senate \ntoday about a subject on which I have risen to speak before, a very \nimportant piece of legislation that I think has the potential to solve \nwhat is probably the No. 1 problem that small businesspeople and their \nemployees confront today. I am talking about the bill which I have \ncosponsored along with Senator Snowe, who is the chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, and others. It is a bill to allow small \nbusinesspeople to create association health plans.\n  This bill is not a Government program. In a time of great deficits, \nit does not require us to spend any money. It is going to take a long \nstep toward solving the problems of the uninsured, reducing the number \nof the uninsured, and getting working people better health insurance at \nless cost. It does not cost the taxpayers anything because all it does \nis allow people to work together and do for themselves, as small \nbusinesspeople and employees of small businesses, what big companies \nand employees of big companies can already do.\n  Most people in the United States who have health insurance are a part \nof a big national pool--almost everybody is. You are either in Medicaid \nor Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan or covered by \na labor union plan or a multi-employer plan with a labor union or you \nwork for a big company. If you are in any of those situations, you are \ncovered by health insurance, and it is health insurance where you are a \npart of a big national pool.\n\n  The only people who are not in that situation are people who work for \nsmall businesses. I define that very broadly. That includes farmers. It \nincludes people who are self-employed consultants operating out of \ntheir own home. They are in the small group market. They have to buy \ninsurance. If they own or run a small business or a farm, they are \nbuying insurance for small groups of people, 5 people or 10 people or \n20 people or 25 people.\n  Insurance works better when you spread the risk across as large a \npool as possible. It doesn't take an advanced degree to understand \nthat. All association health plans do--and it is very important what \nthey do--is simply allow the employees of small businesses to get the \nsame efficiencies and economies of scale that employees of big business \nalready enjoy. All I would do is allow trade associations--the Farm \nBureau, the NFIB, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Restaurant \nAssociation--to sponsor health insurance coverage nationally the same \nway the human resources side of a big company would do.\n  Let's take a big company such as Emerson Electric, a great company in \nMissouri, or Sprint, or Anheuser Busch, all headquartered there. They \nhave a human resources side, an employee benefits side. They contract \nwith insurance companies nationally; they may have a self-insured side. \nThen their employees all over the country can enjoy an option in \ndifferent plans as part of pools of 5 or 10 or 20 or 30,000 people. The \nadministrative costs of such plans are much lower because they are \nspread across a much wider base of employees. They have much greater \npurchasing power and negotiating power when dealing with the big \ninsurance companies. They have the competitive possibilities of self-\ninsurance. So insurance is better in that situation and it costs less.\n  It doesn't mean they don't have problems, but you are a lot better \noff there than you would be and are right now if you are struggling as \na small business owner or the employee of a small business.\n  Of the 44 million people uninsured in the country, about two-thirds \neither own a small business or work for a small business or are \ndependents of somebody who owns or works for a small business. I am \nincluding farmers. Then there are tens of millions of other people who \nmay have health insurance through a small business, but it is bare-\nbones health insurance. It is not what it should be because the costs \nare so high, and they are going up every year.\n  There is a human side to this. Senators who have not done this--I \nimagine most Senators have--go out and talk to people who work in small \nbusinesses or run small businesses. I guarantee you, they will tell you \nthe No. 1 problem they are confronting, short and long term, is the \nrising cost of health insurance and increasing unavailability. This \nhits people where they live.\n  We have had too many layoffs in Missouri. We have lost more jobs in \nMissouri in a 1-year period than any other State. There are a lot of \nbad results connected with the layoff, obviously. But I think maybe the \nfirst that hits a family when they lose a job or are concerned about \nlosing a job, particularly if it is a family with kids, is: What about \nmy health insurance? What do I do for that? It is as important as \npeople's wages.\n\n  Folks in the small business sector, employees of people in the small \nbusiness sector have labored too long in a market that does not work. \nIt is dominated by a few companies, and they are acting more and more \nlike monopolists, raising prices higher and higher, providing fewer and \nfewer services, less and less quality insurance. We need to do \nsomething about it. We can do it, if this Senate will pass association \nhealth plans. It passed in the House by 100 votes last month--strong \nbipartisan support. It has passed several years in a row in the House. \nThe President supports it. We in the Senate ought to pass it.\n  I fought on the floor of the Senate for it. I will continue to do so. \nIt is a great bill. We have great sponsors. We will take up the debate \nagain in the fall. I am very hopeful we can pass it.\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\n  It is no secret--and Senators know this because I have been talking \nto them and I know how strongly they are being lobbied on both sides, \nlobbied in opposition to association health plans--who is at the core \nof the lobbying effort against association health plans. It is the Blue \nCross Insurance Company. It is no secret why. Blue Cross is dominant in \nmany States. It is one of the few big insurance companies in almost \nevery State that currently provide health insurance to small \nbusinesses. They have a big stake in not having association health \nplans enter the market to compete. It would be a huge competitive \nforce. It would take business away from them or cause them to lower \ntheir prices in order to keep the business.\n  I don't begrudge them or anybody else their opportunities or rights \nto lobby on legislation that comes before this Senate. They have \nlobbied. They spent $4.3 million last year on lobbyists. I don't know \nhow much of that was spent on association health plans. We do know this \nis the No. 1 priority for that company--to stop this bill. We can all \ninfer why. I don't begrudge them that. But the debate ought to be done \nhonestly, and it ought to be done within the limits of fair play. That \nis not happening. I want the Senate to know about it.\n  First, I said it is not being done within the limits of honesty. The \nNo. 1 charge being brought against association health plans is not only \nnot true, it is exactly the inversion of the truth. It is exactly the \nopposite of the truth. If you want to fool somebody, tell them \nsomething that not only isn't true but is the opposite of the truth. \nTry and sell them on that.\n  The No. 1 charge against association health plans is that they would \nresult in cherry picking; that is, that small businesses that are \nhealthy would want to go into the association health plans; small \nbusinesses with employees who are sick would not want to go into \nassociation health plans. That is the exact opposite of the truth. I \nthink everybody who currently is trapped in the small group market is \ngoing to want to be a part of an association health plan. Who would not \nwant to get insurance through a big national pool as opposed to a small \ngroup of 5 or 10 people, if you could do it? It is simply economics. It \noperates more efficiently. It operates better. It is going to lower \ncosts for everybody. By our estimates, it will lower costs for small \nbusiness, on average, 10 to 20 percent and reduce the number of \nuninsured by millions. It will provide good quality health insurance to \nothers who right now are laboring with bare-bones insurance because the \nmarket is so difficult. Everybody is going to benefit. The people who \nwill benefit especially are people who are trapped in small groups \nwhere somebody has become sick.\n  I have talked about this subject and toured scores and scores of \nsmall businesses. I have brought up this charge of cherry picking. I \nsay to people: If you had a history of medical problems and you had a \nchoice of working for a big company which provides health insurance the \nway an association health plan would or, on the other hand, working for \na small company which is trapped in this small group market and that \nwas all you knew about the two opportunities--big company, national \npool; small company, small group market--and you were sick, for which \none would you want to work? I have never had a single person say: I \nwant to work for the small business; I think I am going to get better \nhealth insurance there.\n  One of the big competitive advantages big businesses have over small \nbusinesses is that generally they offer better health insurance. \nEverybody in the job market knows it. I have had a lot of small \nbusiness people tell me: We have lost employees to big companies on the \nhealth insurance issue. We have not been able to hire people we want to \nbecause they went to work for a big company because they thought they \nwould get better health insurance.\n  I don't begrudge the larger companies. But why should small \nbusinesses and their employees not have the same opportunities? This \nwill benefit everybody in the small business market, but it is going to \nbenefit most the people who are ill, or employers who are struggling \nalong with people who are ill and are doing the best they can to \nprovide good health insurance.\n\n  Here is another reason it is not association health plans that will \ncherry-pick. The legislation requires that they take everybody, all \ncomers. Must offer/must carry. Join the association and you get the \nhealth insurance. They cannot screen you out because you have somebody \nwho has cancer or heart disease or something like that.\n  Mr. President, it is the big interest companies now who are cherry-\npicking. Just talk to people who run small businesses. When somebody in \ntheir business gets sick and files a claim, their rates get jacked up \nor they get canceled. Everybody knows it. I could give a lot of \nexamples. One example is Janet Poppen, a small business owner from St. \nLouis. Like many small business owners, she wants to do right by her \nfive employees, so she tries to provide them health insurance. How many \nhours and hours does Janet and people like her spend just on the \nadministrative details? It is hours they need to spend running their \nsmall business.\n  If we had an association health plan, they would join the trade \nassociation, and the trade association has done all that work. It just \nsends them the papers and they sign up their employees. She had health \ninsurance through Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and one of her employees had \nthe temerity to get sick with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. As soon as she \nstarted getting treatment for the cancer, Janet's premiums increased by \n16 percent. That is on top of the substantial premium increases that \nhad occurred the year before. Her premiums had gone up 35 percent over \n2 years.\n  This is not an uncommon story. Everywhere I go, small businesses say \nthat premiums are going up 15, 20, 25 percent a year, doubling over 3 \nyears, going up by a third over 2 years. That happened to Janet Poppen, \nand she is insured by Blue Cross. They are the ones cherry-picking. \nAssociation health plans are the remedy, and to say otherwise is the \nexact opposite of the truth.\n  One other point, and then I will close. I have trespassed on the \nSenate's time enough. We ought not to turn this debate, which is one of \nthe most important ones we are going to have in the Senate, into a \nsweepstakes. Blue Cross is doing that. They have sponsored a Web site. \nThere are other problems as well, but on that Web site they have a \nsweepstakes. You can enter the sweepstakes to win a trip to Washington \nfor four people, and they will give you $300 cash on top of it. Do you \nknow what you have to do to enter the sweepstakes? You have to click on \nthe place where you can send an e-mail to your Congressman and Senator \nopposing association health plans. Then you get in the sweepstakes. \nThen you get a chance to win a trip to Washington--if you will just \nclick on the e-mail and send a letter to Washington opposing \nassociation health plans. You don't get anything if you send in a \nletter supporting association health plans. I will show the Senate \nwhere it says enter to win.\n  Here is a chart, and this is the Web site now. It says that you can \nmake your voice heard by sending a free fax to Congress. That is what \nthey tell people. They don't tell you what the fax is about, that the \nfax has to oppose association health plans and support their business \ninterests. Then they have some misrepresentations about association \nhealth plans.\n\n  Go to the third chart. This is what you get if you do it. At least \nyou have a chance at this. It is a drawing. The grand prize is a trip \nfor four to Washington, DC, including round-trip coach class air \ntransportation at the U.S. airport nearest the winner's home, double \noccupancy, standard hotel accommodations, two rooms, a 4-hour \nWashington, DC, bus tour, shuttle bus airport transfers, and a total of \n$300 in spending money. It has an approximate retail value of $4,000.\n  All you have to do is join Blue Cross, sending in an e-mail opposing \nthe association health plans. You don't get to join if you decide you \nwant to support them. You don't get a chance at the sweepstakes then.\n  I always encourage people to contact their Congressmen and Senators. \nI like it when people contact me, even if they disagree with me on \nsomething. That gives me a chance to write back and explain my \nposition. I have had great exchanges with constituents that way.\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\nBut we ought not to give people a monetary incentive one way or another \nbecause that means the opinions we are getting are not unnecessarily \nunbiased, are they?\n  I don't blame anybody who wants a shot at a $4,000 trip and \nparticipates in a sweepstakes in order to get it. But I sure blame the \npeople who have sponsored that Web site and are distorting the debate \non this serious issue before the Senate. And this is a serious issue.\n  There are millions and millions of people in this country who don't \nhave health insurance and who need it. Most of them are stuck in a \nmarket that isn't working and is dominated by a few competitors, and we \nhave a chance to change that. It doesn't even cost the taxpayers \nanything. I hope we can do it. They have done it in the House with a \nbipartisan vote. I hope we can do it in the Senate. At the very least, \nwe need a debate that is conducted honestly, conducted fairly, and that \ndoesn't turn health care into a sweepstakes. I hope after this we will \nhave it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WINER\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express a personal note of \ngrief and fond remembrance as I pay tribute to one of my dearest \nfriends, Bob Winer, who passed away on July 18.\n  Bob was born in Brooklyn, NY, moved to New Jersey, and joined the \nNavy when he was 17 and proudly served in the Pacific during World War \nII.\n  After the war, he joined his two brothers in a clothing manufacturing \nbusiness begun by their father many years earlier. The company, Winer \nIndustries, was located in Paterson, NJ, where I was born.\n  I first met Bob when I called upon him to use my company--ADP--to \nhandle his payroll and other data processing needs. He became a client \nand a good friend almost immediately; our friendship grew and grew over \nthe next 40 years.\n  Bob truly was larger than life. We shared common interests like \nskiing, boating, and feasting. Bob had a zest for living that few could \nmatch. He traveled extensively. He enjoyed spear-fishing, often \nsurrounded by sharks and barracuda, and taught his children and his \nfriends to be comfortable in that environment. He owned airplanes and \nwas a great pilot with thousands of hours to his credit, and I spent \nmany hours as his co-pilot. He suggested that I take flying lessons, \nasking me what I might do if he suddenly ``slumped over the wheel.'' My \nresponse was that if that were to happen, I would slump over the wheel, \ntoo! He seemed indestructible.\n  The best thing about Bob's zeal for living was his insistence on \nsharing it with lots of family and friends. He let his 8-year-old \nnephew land a twin-engine plane--at night. That might strike some \npeople as foolhardy but the thing about Bob was that he had so much \nconfidence, so much skill, and so much courage, he inspired it in \nothers.\n  Bob did well in life. He lived in Morristown, NJ, and had homes in \nNantucket, Vermont, and Florida, and lots of friends in many places. \nYet, he was about as unassuming as someone can be.\n  But more important, Bob did so much good in life, too. When Bob's \nbrother and sister-in-law were killed in a plane crash, Bob and his \nwonderful wife Elaine, with their three daughters--Trisha, Laurie, and \nJill--helped raise his brother's children, Jeannie, Ken, and Larry, as \ntheir own.\n  I think we grow or shrink in direct proportion to our generosity. Bob \nwas the most generous person I have ever met and everyone who knew him \nwould say that it was apparent in everything he did. It was a rare \nprivilege to know him and I was proud to call him my friend.\n  Bob was devoted to his family and friends, his business and \ncommunity, and our country. He was a veteran, a philanthropist, and an \nadventurer. Above all, he was an extraordinary human being.\n  In 1899, Robert Ingerson, a known essayist who lost a brother, wrote \nthese words which I think provide a fitting tribute to Bob, who was \nlike a brother to me:\n\n       He added to the sum of human joy; and were everyone to whom \n     he did some loving service to bring a blossom to his grave, \n     he would sleep tonight beneath a wilderness of flowers.\n\n  Few people on this earth have done more than Bob Winer to ``add to \nthe sum of human joy.'' So, while we grieve his death and hold him and \nhis family in our prayers, it's also appropriate to celebrate his life, \na life so richly lived.\n  He will be sorely missed by family and friends, and in my life, a \ntear will fall every time I think of him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S.J. Res. 16, \nthe Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003, which was \nintroduced by myself, Senators Bingaman, Domenici, and Craig on July \n14, 2003. S.J. Res. 16 is the Bush administration's legislative \nproposal codifying 3 years of negotiations on title II of the Compact \nof Free Association between the United States and the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands (RMI) and the Federated States of Micronesia, FSM. I \nhave been monitoring this process very closely since negotiations began \nin 1999.\n  When the Senate returns after Labor Day, we have a very short window \nto enact this legislation, which is critical to the success of the U.S. \npolitical relationship with these two Pacific Island nations. I want to \ntake some time to share with my colleagues the amendments that I intend \nto offer to ensure that the negotiated provisions remain consistent \nwith the intent of the Compact of Free Association since its enactment \nin 1986 and address specific issues as they relate to the costs borne \nby the State of Hawaii over the past 17 years.\n  My interest in these islands first began when I was stationed there \nin World War II, as a soldier in the United States Army. The first \nisland that I landed on was Enewetak, an atoll in what is now the RMI. \nI ended up on Saipan and Tinian where I watched the Enola Gay take off \nfor Hiroshima. I then returned to the islands that are now the FSM and \nRMI as a first mate on a missionary ship and spent six months in the \nislands. After being elected to Congress, I continued to closely follow \nevents in the Pacific islands and continued my relationships with many \nof the families in the RMI and FSM.\n  As a member of the Senate, I have been privileged to serve on the \nSenate Energy Committee which has jurisdiction over insular areas. I \nhave returned to the islands on trips, often with my friend and former \ncolleague, the former Chairman of the Energy Committee, Governor Frank \nMurkowski, and I have continued to meet with Pacific island government \nleaders.\n  I have been very interested in the negotiations which have been \nongoing since 1999, not only because of the impact of the Compact of \nFree Association on the State of Hawaii, but because of my interest in \nensuring that the United States preserves its commitment first under \nthe U.N. Trusteeship agreement and then under the Compact to establish \nsovereign governments and to promote economic development and self-\nsufficiency.\n  I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee, \nSenator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, for their efforts to expedite \nconsideration of this legislation in the Senate, and their appreciation \nof what needs to be done to fulfill our responsibilities to our allies \nin the Freely Associated States, or FAS.\n  The Federated States of Micronesia is a group of 607 small islands in \nthe Western Pacific about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii. While it has \na total land area of about 270.8 square miles, the FSM occupies more \nthan one million square miles of the Pacific Ocean. It is composed of \nfour island states, formerly known as the Caroline\n\n[[Page S10880]]\n\nIslands--Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, and Yap. Today, the FSM Constitution \nprovides for three branches of government--the executive, judicial and \nlegislative branches. The President is the head of state of the \nnational government and there are elected Governors for each of the \nfour states. The estimated population of the FSM is 105,500.\n  The Republic of the Marshall Islands is located about 2,136 miles \nsouthwest of Hawaii and is made up of five islands and 29 atolls. While \nthe RMI's total land area is only about 70 square miles, the RMI covers \nabout 750,000 square miles of sea area. There are three branches of \ngovernment in the RMI--the legislative, executive and judicial \nbranches. The head of state is the President, who is elected by the \nlegislature from its membership. The population of the RMI is \napproximately 56,000.\n  The Compact of Free Association may be new to some of my colleagues, \nparticularly those who were not in Congress in 1986. The United States \nhas a very unique relationship with the FSM, RMI, and Palau, whose \nCompact is not being considered for negotiation. It is unfortunate that \nthere is some misunderstanding about the purpose and intent of the \nCompact of Free Association. The compact established the RMI and FSM as \nsovereign states that conduct their own foreign policies. Both \ncountries were admitted to the United Nations in 1991. However, the \nFreely Associated States remain dependent upon the United States for \nmilitary protection and economic assistance. The compact provides that \nthe United States has the prerogative to reject the strategic use of, \nor military access to, the FAS by other countries, which is often \nreferred to as the ``right of strategic denial.'' The compact also \nprovides that the U.S. may block FAS government policies that it deems \ninconsistent with its duty to defend the FAS, which is referred to as \nthe ``defense veto.'' Under the compact, the United States also has the \nexclusive military base rights in the FAS. In exchange, the U.S. is \nrequired to support the FAS economically, with the goal of producing \nself-sufficiency and FAS citizens are allowed entry into the United \nStates as nonimmigrants for the purposes of education, medical \ntreatment and employment.\n  As we consider S.J. Res. 16, I will be offering a number of \namendments to address the sufficiency of the negotiated provisions to \nfulfill the U.S. commitment to assist the FSM and RMI with economic \ndevelopment opportunities, with the goal of self-sufficiency in 20 \nyears. I am also working on amendments to address issues specific to \nthe costs incurred by Hawaii during the first 17 years of the Compact \nof Free Association.\n  I have a tiered approach to meet these objectives. My long-term \nintent is to improve the education and medical infrastructure in the \nRMI and FSM. Economic development and self- sufficiency cannot occur \nwithout the proper tools of education and health care. These \nimprovements will take substantial investment over time. My short-term \ngoal is to reimburse the State of Hawaii for the costs incurred by the \ncompact. I will discuss those amendments in a few minutes.\n\n  Title II of the compact, Economic Relations, expired on September 30, \n2001. The compact provided, however, a two-year extension if \nnegotiations were underway. Title II expires on September 30, 2003. \nTitle II is critical to the success of the compact as it includes all \nof the Federal funding for the RMI and FSM. It is my understanding that \nthe legislative proposal contains some unilateral changes that were \nmade to the compact without the consent of the RMI and FSM \ngovernments--we will need to examine those provisions closely. In \naddition, I believe we need to examine some of the immigration \nprovisions which are included in S.J. Res. 16 to ensure that they do \nnot circumvent the purpose of the Compact of Free Association.\n  I would now like to turn to the issue of disaster assistance. Under \nthe current compact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, \nprovided disaster relief to the communities in the FSM and RMI. In \naddition, FEMA provides essential services after natural disasters such \nas typhoons or tsunamis. Disaster assistance includes both individual \ngrants and low-interest loans. Most, but not all, Federal assistance is \nin the form of low-interest loans to cover expenses not covered by \nState or local programs, or private insurance. Individuals who do not \nqualify for loans may be able to apply for a cash grant. Cash grants \nare also available for home repair, rental, and funeral services.\n  The public assistance grants for community infrastructure allow \nterritorial, local, or even village-level organizations to respond to \ndisasters, to recover from their impact, and to mitigate impact from \nfuture disasters. While these grants are aimed at governments and \norganizations, their final goal is to help a community and all its \ncitizens recover from devastating natural disasters. The grant \nassistance, provided on a matching basis, helps toward the repair, \nreplacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly-owned \nfacilities. FEMA assistance is critical. In 2002, Typhoon Cha'atan hit \nthe FSM and caused 50 deaths, injured hundreds of people, and resulted \nin $6 million in property damage.\n  S.J. Res. 16 removes FEMA's role in providing disaster relief, and \nreplaces it with the U.S. Agency for International Development, Office \nof Foreign Disaster Assistance, OFDA. This doesn't make sense. OFDA \nassistance is for humanitarian relief of disasters in foreign nations, \nwith direct provision of food and shelter, and assistance in protecting \nhealth and rebuilding water supplies. FEMA's disaster assistance, \nthrough its individual and public assistance grants, provides U.S. \ncommunities with the ability to rebuild and reinvest in their \ninfrastructure. We have invested millions in FSM and RMI to build and \nprotect infrastructure. These investments need to be protected to \nensure that these Pacific island communities will be able to recover \nfrom natural disasters.\n  We cannot terminate FEMA's disaster assistance. We must replace \nUSAID's OFDA with FEMA's disaster assistance programs for the amended \ncompact, maintaining the strong and reliable service that the islands \nneed when peoples' lives are destroyed by natural disasters. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to rectify this situation.\n  As we continue assisting the FAS in building up physical \ninfrastructure and achieving long-term self-sufficiency under a new \nfunding mechanism, I cannot emphasize enough the urgent need to \ncontinue FAS eligibility for federal programs. It is important for us \nto maintain the view that such programs are complementary to the \neconomic assistance under the compact and must continue to be open to \nFAS citizens if we are to succeed in allowing the FSM and RMI to fully \ndevelop.\n  Federal programs in education have been a cornerstone for FAS \ncommunities, particularly in the later years of the original compact. \nThis was when schooling evolved away from--as noted in 1994 by an Asian \nDevelopment Bank study--its use as a tool to advance the interests and \nobjectives of colonial powers. Rather, educational content has become \nmore appropriate to traditional education and changed the lives of many \nFAS citizens for the better, strongly encouraging them to actually \nenroll in school.\n  It is remarkable, for example, that the proportion of those who \ncompleted secondary education in the FSM almost doubled from 25 to 47 \npercent between 1980 and 1994. Today, the FSM Government reports that \nthe literacy rate is quite high and all children are required to attend \nschool at least through the eighth grade. In the RMI, elementary school \nenrollment increased from almost 7,400 in the late, seventies to more \nthan 11,700 in 2000, while secondary school enrollment went from 1,430 \nto 2,586 in the same period.\n  It is imperative that we help to educate young generations in the FAS \nbecause those ages 15 years or younger make up nearly half of the FSM \nand RIM populations and will eventually become parents, workers, and \ngovernment, business, and community leaders. Education is the key to a \nstrong future for these island communities and will ensure that the \nU.S. investments in these populations will reap positive returns.\n  However, despite the great progress that has been made, the FAS \nclearly have a long way to go in improving their educational systems. \nThis is evidenced by FAS citizens' continued migration to Hawaii and \nother parts of\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\nthe U.S. for educational opportunity. Even so, the Micronesians and \nMarshallese have taken education into their own hands and are striving \nmightily to attune it to the needs of their people. In this vein, \nFederal programs such as Head Start, title I for disadvantaged \npopulations, the Individuals with Disabilites Education Act, IDEA, and \nPell Grants have tremendously helped by empowering the FAS and \nproviding vital resources to help them create sound education systems \nthat serve the needs of their people. Indeed, I have been assured that \nwithout Pell Grant assistance, higher education institutions such as \nthe College of Micronesia would be unable to continue operating.\n  Given the importance of such programs to the FAS, I am concerned \nabout recent and ongoing efforts in the other body to limit or \neliminate FAS eligibility for various education and other domestic \nFederal programs. I am not alone in this concern. I was pleased to join \nSenators Domenici, Bingaman, and Craig in writing on May 20 to the \nleaders on the HELP Committee, asking that they maintain support for \nthe FAS through eligibility for various education programs. As we state \nin the letter, ``the loss of such funding could very well mean the end \nof education services at all age levels in the FAS.'' When we return in \nSeptember, I intend to pursue this matter with my colleagues.\n  I would now like to address some compact issues specific to the State \nof Hawaii. Section 104(e)(1) of the Compact (Public Law 99-239) states, \n``it is not the intent of the Congress to cause any adverse \nconsequences for the United States territories and commonwealths or the \nState of Hawaii.'' The compact further authorizes appropriations for \nsuch sums as may be necessary to cover the costs, if any, incurred by \nthe State of Hawaii, the territories of Guam and American Samoa, and \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI.\n  As FAS citizens are allowed free entry into the United States as part \nof the compact, many FAS citizens reside in the State of Hawaii. Since \n1997, when Hawaii began reporting its impact costs, the State has \nidentified over $140 million in costs associated with FAS citizens. In \n2002, the State of Hawaii expended over $32 million in assistance to \nFAS citizens, with the highest costs reported in education. The State \nof Hawaii has received a total of $6 million in compact impact aid, \nlargely due to our efforts in the Senate and the leadership of the \nsenior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Dan Inouye. This modest amount of \nfunding, however, does not adequately reimburse the State of Hawaii for \nits costs over the past 17 years.\n  S.J. Res. 16 includes $15 million in mandatory funds to be \ndistributed annually between the State of Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI for \ncompact impact aid. While it is an improvement to have mandatory \nfunding earmarked for compact impact aid, the amount is not based on \nthe actual costs to the affected areas over the past 17 years. As I \nhave just said, for 2002 alone, the State of Hawaii spent over $32 \nmillion on services for FAS citizens. I plan on offering an amendment \nto increase the amount of annual compact impact aid to the State of \nHawaii and other affected areas. I am also drafting an amendment which \nwould authorize reimbursement for the funds expended by the governments \nof the affected areas between 1986 and 2003.\n  Hawaii's medical providers have also suffered because they are owed \nthousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills. Some of the debt has been \nincurred by individuals, FAS citizens lacking financial resources--who \npresent themselves to medical providers for treatment. Other debt, \nhowever, is a result of the medical referral program, and is to be paid \nby the FSM and RMI governments. The medical referral program allows FAS \ncitizens to travel to Hawaii for medical treatment to be paid by the \nFSM or RMI because such treatment is not available in their country.\n  During its consideration of the original compact, Congress recognized \nthis problem and authorized funding for unpaid debts related to the \nmedical referral program which were incurred prior to 1985. \nUnfortunately, the problem has continued. Hawaii's medical providers, \nwho are already having difficulties meeting the health care needs of \ntheir communities, are unfairly penalized because of the inability of \nthe island governments to pay the medical bills associated with the \nmedical referral program. I will introduce an amendment that would \nextend the authorization for funding for the medical referral program \ndebts to 2003.\n  I also plan to offer amendments which would alleviate the compact's \ncost to the State of Hawaii by restoring and establishing the \neligibility of FAS citizens for programs such as Medicaid, Food Stamps, \nand Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF.\n  It is imperative that we restore eligibility of FAS citizens for non-\nemergency Medicaid. FAS citizens lost many of their public benefits as \na result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity, PRWORA, \nAct of 1996, including Medicaid coverage. FAS citizens were previously \neligible for Medicaid as aliens permanently residing under color of law \nin the United States.\n  After the enactment of welfare reform, the State of Hawaii could no \nlonger claim Federal matching funds for services rendered to FAS \ncitizens. Since then, the State of Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have continued to meet \nthe health care needs of FAS citizens. The State of Hawaii has used \nstate resources to provide Medicaid services to FAS citizens. In 2002 \nalone, the State spent approximately $6.75 million to provide Medicaid \nservices without receiving any federal matching funds.\n  There has been an increasing trend in the need for health care \nservices among FAS citizens. During the current fiscal year, the number \nof individuals served in the State of Hawaii's Medicaid program has \ngrown from 3,291 to 4,818 people based on the average monthly \nenrollment. This is an increase of 46 percent. For only the first half \nof the fiscal year, the State of Hawaii has spent $4.66 million for the \nMedicaid costs incurred for FAS citizens. These Medicaid costs do not \nreflect additional State expenditures on medical care contracts to care \nfor the uninsured, community health care services, and for the \nactivities of the Department of Health's Communicable Disease Branch.\n  The Federal Government must provide appropriate resources to help \nstates meet the healthcare needs of the FAS citizens--an obligation \nbased on a federal commitment. It is unconscionable for a state or \nterritory to shoulder the entire financial burden of providing \nnecessary education, medical, and social services to individuals who \nare residing in that state or territory when the obligation is that of \nthe Federal Government. For that reason, I am seeking to provide \nreimbursement of these costs. It is time for the Federal Government to \ntake up some of the financial responsibility that until now has been \ncarried by the State of Hawaii, CNMI, and Guam, by restoring public \nbenefits to FAS citizens.\n  Eligibility of FAS citizens for nonemergency Medicaid must be \nrestored. In addition, the State of Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and \nthe CNMI should be reimbursed for the Medicaid expenses of FAS citizens \nincurred since 1996. It is the right thing to do.\n  Continuing along the lines of assisting FAS citizens towards long-\nterm self-sufficiency, I would now like to turn to the issue of social \nservices. The need for support provided by a safety net of social \nservices becomes apparent when we take a look at the economic \nconditions FAS citizens face at home. In 2001, per capita income, as \nmeasured by purchasing power parity, was $1,600 in the RMI and $2,000 \nin the FSM. This amounts to almost $8,000 below the poverty threshold \nper capita in the U.S. for that same year. Furthermore, many FAS \nfamilies are single-parent households and face many barriers to \nemployment, including low or no-job skills, low levels of education, \nand disabilities.\n  This is why it is important to provide Federal support through social \nservice programs while continuing to develop new economic opportunities \nfor FAS citizens. Otherwise, the impact of serving FAS citizens will \ncontinue to be felt outside of the FAS. For instance, in Hawaii, \naccording to the state's Attorney General, financial assistance in the \nform of the Temporary Assistance to Other Needy Families, TAONF, \nprogram, a State program, provided $4.5\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\nmillion to FAS citizens in State Fiscal year 2002. This amount is \nsecondary only to the amount spent to provide educational services to \nthe FAS. Of this total, $390,000 went to the General Assistance \nprogram, which supports individuals and couples with little or no \nincome and who have a temporary, incapacitating medical condition; \n$532,000 supported aged, blind, and disabled FAS citizens with little \nor no income who are not eligible for federally-funded Supplemental \nSecurity Income SSI; and $3.6 million went to the State's TAONF program \nthat assists other needy families who are not eligible for federal-\nfunding under the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, \nprogram.\n  The number of FAS citizens served by the Hawaii Department of Human \nServices has increased by almost 20 percent in the span of one year \nalone. The financial assistance that the State of Hawaii provides to \nFAS citizens in the form of TAONF is a great support to those families \nattempting to achieve economic stability.\n  I am also planning on offering an amendment to make FAS citizens \neligible for the Food Stamp Program. The Food Stamp Program serves as \nthe first line of defense against hunger. It is the cornerstone of the \nfederal food assistance program and provides crucial support to needy \nhouseholds and those making the transition from welfare to work. We \nhave partially addressed the complicated issue of alien eligibility for \npublic benefits such as Food Stamps, but again, I must say it is just \npartial. Not only should all legal immigrants receive these benefits, \nbut so too citizens of the FAS. Exclusion of FAS citizens from federal, \nstate, or local public benefits or programs is an unintended and \nmisguided consequence of the welfare reform law.\n  We allow certain legal immigrants eligibility in the program. Yet FAS \ncitizens, who are not considered immigrants, but who are required to \nsign up for the Selective Service if they are residing in the United \nStates, are ineligible to receive food stamps. We must correct this \ninequity. I will work on clarifying current law regarding FAS citizens' \neligibility for various federal assistance programs, including TANF and \nFood Stamps.\n  In addition, I ask my colleagues to support efforts to extend current \nTANF state waivers and reinstate recently expired state waivers. Hawaii \nhas been operating under a waiver approved by the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services since 1996. To date, Hawaii has met all of \nits employment goals, despite experiencing difficult economic times in \nthe 90s and into the current decade. This waiver maintains protections \nfor disabled individuals, including FAS citizens, which were reported \nin the State Fiscal Year 2002 as numbering over 200. I am concerned \nthat proposals that would limit various support services to this \ndisabled population to three months would guarantee failure for many \nHawaii families, including FAS citizens, should Hawaii's waiver be \nallowed to expire. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee on this separate TANF reauthorization issue.\n  I cannot stress the importance of the Compact of Free Association to \nthe Pacific islands, the State of Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. The United States made a \ncommitment to help these countries attain self-sufficiency through \neconomic development and Federal programs based on a political \nrelationship unique to this situation. We must honor this commitment by \nensuring adequate resources to meet our obligations. We cannot treat \nthe FSM and RMI as mere allies and foreign nations--the political \nrelationship of free association calls for more than that. We must \nprovide Federal benefits such as Food Stamps, TANF, and Medicaid to FAS \ncitizens residing in the U.S. We must ensure that the trust funds for \neach country have sufficient funding to ensure that in 20 years, the \nRMI and FSM will be able to function as economically independent \nnations. We must improve the infrastructure of the education and \nmedical systems in the RMI and FSM to alleviate the long-term impact of \nthe Compact on the State of Hawaii and Pacific territories. We must \ncontinue eligibility in federal education programs such as Head Start, \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Act, Pell Grants, title I, and the No \nChild Left Behind Act to ensure that we equip future generations of \nMicronesians and Marshallese with the educational tools necessary to \nsucceed in the 21st century. We must do all of this in a culturally \nsensitive manner.\n  We have a big challenge ahead of us, to keep the commitment we made \nin 1986. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on this \nimportant endeavor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10882-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10882-S10883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               STRENGTHENING THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the \nimportance of the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  Recent and pending cases, before the Supreme Court and the state \ncourt of Massachusetts, raise serious questions regarding the future of \nthe traditional definition of marriage throughout America as embodied \nin the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act. I believe it is important \nthat the Senate consider what steps, if any, are needed to safeguard \nthe institution of marriage that the Defense of Marriage Act has \nexpressly defined since 1996.\n  In very simple and easy to read language, the Defense of Marriage Act \nstated that a marriage is the legal union between one man and one woman \nas husband and wife, and that a spouse is a husband or wife of the \nopposite sex. That declaration did not break any new ground or set any \nnew precedent. It simply reaffirmed the traditional definition of \nmarriage.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act received overwhelming bipartisan support \nin both Houses, as you would expect. The House passed the act by a vote \nof 342-67, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 85-14.\n  President Clinton signed the measure, stating that: ``I have long \nopposed governmental recognition of same-gender marriages, and this \nlegislation is consistent with that position.'' And since that time, 37 \nStates have passed defense of marriage acts at their own level, \ndefining marriage for purposes of State law.\n  In the words of the eloquent senior Senator from West Virginia, a \nsponsor of the Defense of Marriage Act\n\n       Throughout the annals of human experience, in dozens of \n     civilizations and cultures of varying value systems, humanity \n     has discovered that the permanent relationship between men \n     and women is a keystone to the stability, strength, and \n     health of human society--a relationship worthy of legal \n     recognition and judicial protection . . .\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The suggestion that relationships between members of the \n     same gender should ever be accorded the status or the \n     designation of marriage flies in the face of the thousands of \n     years of experience about the societal stability that \n     traditional marriage has afforded human civilization.\n\n  Senator Byrd was echoing an understanding of marriage shared by many, \nif not most, and particularly the late Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who wrote:\n\n       Your love is your own private possession, but marriage is \n     more than something personal it is a status, an office that \n     joins you together.\n\n  Marriage is so fundamental to our culture and to civilization itself \nthat it is easy to forget how much depends on it.\n  Marriage provides the basis for the family, which remains the \nstrongest and most important social unit. A wealth of social science \nresearch and data attest to this commonsense fact.\n  And as columnist Maggie Gallagher writes:\n\n       When men and women fail to form stable marriages, the first \n     result is a vast expansion of government attempts to cope \n     with the terrible social needs that result. There is scarcely \n     a dollar that state and federal government spends on social \n     programs that is not driven in large part by family \n     fragmentation: crime, poverty, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, \n     school failure, and mental and physical health problems.\n\n  Clearly the family is the fundamental institution of our \ncivilization. It fosters successful communities, happier homes, and \nhealthier lives. The family provides the foundation for raising each \ngeneration of Americans. And when families are weakened, it is the \nchildren who suffer most.\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\n  We recognized these facts in 1996, by passing the Defense of Marriage \nAct overwhelmingly, and reiterating the traditional understanding of \nwhat marriage is. Now, by decisions of our courts, concerns have been \nraised again, and I believe that it is the duty of the Senate to \nreexamine and, if necessary, reaffirm this important determination.\n  The great Sam Houston, whose seat I am honored to hold in this body, \nonce said:\n\n       The time is fast arising when facts must be submitted in \n     their simplest dress.\n\n  I believe that time is now. The facts deserve examination and, if \nnecessary, action.\n  The question before us now is whether the popular and bipartisan \nlegislation known as the Defense of Marriage Act will remain the law of \nthe land as the people and, most particularly, the Representatives of \nthis body intend, or whether we will be undermined or overturned by the \ncourts.\n  As many in this body have stated in the past, the Founders could not \nhave anticipated that our Nation would ever reach the point where \nmarriage would ever require such definition.\n  But neither could they have anticipated the method through which the \ncourts would unilaterally upend our Nation's laws, reading penumbras, \nemanations, and ``sweet mysteries of life'' into the legal text as \njustification for overturning legislative acts.\n  On an issue as fundamental as marriage, I believe it is the job of \nthe American people, through their Representatives, to decide. We \nshould not abandon this issue to the purview of the courts alone. Some \nhave suggested a legislative answer. Others have suggested a \nconstitutional amendment is needed. In any case, we must consider what \nsteps are now needed to protect and safeguard the traditional \nunderstanding of marriage as defined in the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  Toward that end, I will convene a hearing of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, which I chair, in the \nfirst week after we return from the August recess to find out what \nsteps, if any, are required to uphold the Defense of Marriage Act and \nthe congressional intent as embodied in that measure. I hope my \ncolleagues, including the bipartisan majority who overwhelmingly \nsupported the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, will join me in these \nefforts.\n  Perhaps no legislative or constitutional response is needed to \nreinforce the status quo. And if it is clear that no action is \nrequired, so be it. But I believe that we must take care to do whatever \nit takes to ensure that the principles defined in the Defense of \nMarriage Act remain the law of the land.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10883-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEATH OF WILLIAM R. BRIGHT\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, our Nation mourns the loss of Bill Bright, \na visionary who founded Campus Crusade for Christ more than 50 years \nago.\n  Bill died last week at his Orlando home from pulmonary fibrosis at \nthe age of 81. In his lifetime, he spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to \nhundreds upon hundreds of thousands of people across the world.\n  I met Bill Bright long before my nephew went to work for Campus \nCrusade more than 10 years ago. I was in awe of both Bill and his wife, \nVonette, for their unwavering commitment to communicating the love of \nJesus Christ.\n  You see, in an amazing act of faith, Bill and Vonette signed a pact \nwith God more than five decades ago--and agreed to leave the business \nworld and the making of money to devote their lives to spreading the \nGospel.\n  Not long after than, in 1951, they began Campus Crusade. The goal, at \nthe time, was to preach the Gospel to students at the University of \nCalifornia at Los Angeles. But God had other plans. The Campus Crusade \nmovement soon spread to other campuses in the United States and \neventually around the globe. Today, it is one of the world's major \nministries and serves people in 191 countries with a staff of 26,000 \nfull-time employees and more than 225,000 trained volunteers.\n  Indeed, I would dare say that Campus Crusade has touched the lives \nnot only of students--but the poor and oppressed on every continent, \nand leadership on every level of society.\n  Bill Bright's life reflected Christ and proclaimed him boldly. He \nmade an eternal impact on our Nation and our world.\n  In the 1970s, Bill came up with the popular ``I Found It!'' signs to \nsignify that ``it'' was faith in Jesus. He later released a film, \ncalled ``Jesus,'' which was a feature length motion picture on the life \nof Jesus of Nazareth. That film has been seen by millions of people and \ntranslated into many languages.\n  Throughout it all, Bill remained a humble man, simply doing the \nLord's work. In 1996, he was awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize \nfor Progress in Religion. That award came with a $1 million gift. Bill \ndonated all of the money to causes promoting the spiritual benefits of \nfasting and prayer.\n  He was, indeed, a true servant of God--a man who lived a life that \nall of us can admire and strive to emulate.\n  When I heard of his passing, I recalled something Bill said two years \nago when Campus Crusade marked its 50th anniversary . . . ``A follower \nof Jesus Christ can't lose,'' he said. ``If we live, we go on serving. \nThat's an adventure. If we die, we're in heaven with him, and that's \nincredible.''\n  I imagine somewhere high up in heaven, Bill Bright is having an \nincredible, miraculous adventure. God bless him!\n  His words made me think of the book of Revelation on the Bible, in \nthe 7th chapter, which reads, ``Therefore are they before the throne of \nGod, and serve him day and night within his temple; and he who sits \nupon the throne will shelter them with his presence. They shall hunger \nno more, neither thirst any more; the sun shall not strike them, nor \nany scorching heat. For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be \ntheir shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of living water, and \nGod will wipe every tear from their eyes.''\n  My thoughts and prayers are with my dear friend Vonette, their two \nsons, and the entire Campus Crusade family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10883-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10883-S10884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion about \njudicial nominees recently. One issue is on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  I mention that because at the time when President Clinton nominated \nhighly qualified people to go there, my friends on the other side said \nthe workload was such that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals didn't need \nextra judges. So they were never given a hearing, never given a vote. \nOne of those nominees is now the dean of the Harvard Law School. In \nfact, the chief judge, as I recall, a Reagan appointee, said they \ndefinitely didn't need more judges; they didn't have the workload. He \ntook that position consistently throughout President Clinton's term.\n  Now we have a new President. The workload has gone down in that \ncourt. But we have several people suddenly nominated for the seats that \njust a few months ago were unneeded, we were told, by all the \nRepublican leadership. We were told by the Republican leadership on \nthis very political court that we didn't need anybody. Suddenly we need \nsomebody.\n  The interesting thing about that is the Washington Post, which has \nbeen very supportive--more supportive than most newspapers in the \ncountry--of President Bush's judicial nominees, no matter who they are, \ntook a different position. Even that paper, which has basically given \nin many ways--and it is their right--a blank check to the \nadministration, wrote an editorial this morning called ``Fueling the \nFire.'' They basically ask what I have: What is the sudden change?\n  I ask unanimous consent that editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 1, 2003]\n\n                            Fueling the Fire\n\n       In nominating people to fill the last two seats on the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\n     D.C. Circuit, President Bush had a unique opportunity to \n     begin de-escalating the war now raging over judicial \n     nominations. The need for judges in these two slots--the 11th \n     and 12th authorized judgeships--is far from clear, as \n     Republicans argued in blocking the confirmation of qualified \n     Clinton administration nominees. Since then, the court's \n     workload has declined. Additional D.C. Circuit nominations \n     should have awaited a more comprehensive understanding of the \n     court's needs. If two more judges were needed, we had hoped \n     that Mr. Bush would have been mindful of the history and \n     nominated qualified candidates who easily could win \n     Democratic as well as Republican support. Instead, Mr. Bush \n     has nominated two people who will only inflame further \n     politics of confirmation to one of this country's highest-\n     quality courts.\n       Both nominees--White House counsel Brett M. Kavanaugh and \n     California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown--are \n     people of substance, nominees whose records and \n     qualifications might well under other circumstances command \n     support. But these nominations could not be better calculated \n     to pour salt on Democratic wounds. Mr. Kavanaugh is a fine \n     lawyer who could be a fine judge. He also has spent the past \n     few years as, first, a key figure in former independent \n     counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation and, more recently, \n     an official in the White House counsel's office working on \n     such politically sensitive matters as judicial nominations \n     and executive privilege. Whatever the merits of his work in \n     these two roles, they are sore spots for Democrats.\n       Likewise, Justice Brown possesses a serious judicial mind. \n     But she also has a long record of opinions that will provoke \n     liberal anxiety; one, for example, declares in its opening \n     section that ``private property, already an endangered \n     species in California, is now entirely extinct in San \n     Francisco.'' It takes nerve for Mr. Bush to ask Senate \n     Democrats to confirm such people to positions whose very \n     necessity Republican senators were busily questioning until \n     only two years ago.\n       The White House appears to believe that any accommodation \n     of Democratic concerns would be a sign of weakness in the \n     face of the filibusters and stalling of the president's other \n     nominees. Mr. Bush's grievances are real; the Senate \n     continues to filibuster the nomination of the qualified \n     Miguel A. Estrada, for example, more than two years after his \n     nomination. But both sides in the past several years have \n     behaved badly in the fight over judicial nominations. Their \n     war may help both political parties rally their bases and \n     raise money. But it is deeply harmful, not least to the \n     public perception of judging as an apolitical task. And it \n     will not end until someone extends an olive branch. That \n     someone has to be the president, the only person with the \n     power to do it meaningfully. The D.C. Circuit would have been \n     a great place to start. Too bad Mr. Bush is too busy playing \n     politics to lead.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Because we have discussed at great length an issue \ninvolving one of the judiciary nominees, I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter from the National Council of Churches addressed to President \nBush regarding the debate on Alabama Attorney General William H. Pryor \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 National Council of Churches,\n\n                                                    July 31, 2003.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As religious leaders from various faith \n     traditions, we are fully committed to religious freedom and \n     separation of church and state as basic tenets of our \n     Constitution. We agree with you that, ``we (America) must \n     continue our efforts to uphold justice and tolerance and to \n     oppose prejudice; and we must be resolved to countering any \n     means that infringe on religious freedom.'' Today, we write \n     to express our grave concern about the attempt to make \n     religion an issue in the consideration of judicial nominees.\n       We were deeply troubled to learn that during a Senate \n     Judiciary Committee hearing last week on the nomination of \n     Alabama Attorney General William H. Pryor, who is being \n     considered for a lifetime position in the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee injected religion into a debate over \n     qualifications for this position. By questioning Mr. Pryor's \n     religious faith, Chairman Hatch supported a scurrilous \n     advertising campaign designed to make those opposed to the \n     Pryor nomination seem guilty of religious bias.\n       Mr. President, we urge you to immediately denounce the \n     reprehensible behavior of the Senate Judiciary Leadership. We \n     ask that you send a clear message to oppose religious \n     interrogation and restore order and dignity to the judicial \n     nomination process. Judicial nominees can be reviewed on a \n     wide range of criteria--but religion must not be one of them. \n     To allow questioning of religious faith during consideration \n     of nominations will set a dangerous precedent with profound \n     implications on future nominees.\n       We urge you to protect the integrity of the judicial \n     nomination process by denouncing this behavior. As religious \n     leaders, who take seriously our charge to promote tolerance \n     and justice, we hope you will act swiftly on our request. We \n     have a lot to lose. Our shared values of religious freedom \n     are at stake.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Rev. Bob Edgar,\n                                                General Secretary.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see the very distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia, the most senior member of this body, on the Senate floor. I \nknow he wishes to speak. As soon as he is prepared, I will, of course, \nyield the floor.\n  Last night we were able to move five of President Bush's judges, to \nget them confirmed in a matter of about 20 or 30 minutes. I thank those \nwho worked with me to make that possible. Senator Lott from the other \nside of the aisle was very helpful in moving those forward. Senator \nMcConnell was very helpful in moving those nominees forward, as well as \na number of Senators on this side of the aisle. Senator Harry Reid, \nSenator Tom Daschle worked with me, along with Senator Lott and Senator \nMcConnell, to move them. So we were able to move them, actually, in a \nmatter of 20 or 30 minutes.\n  I mention that because there was a consensus on these nominees. They \nwere not sent up here to divide us but, rather, they were the rare ones \nwho were sent to unite us.\n  I mention that because we have now confirmed 145 judges for President \nBush. We stopped three. This stands in tremendous contrast to the time \nof President Clinton, when the Republican leadership stopped 60 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees.\n  For very good reasons, because of their ideology, their obvious \nintent to politicize the courts, we have stopped three. So we have \nconfirmed 145 and stopped three. Those who are worried that we have \npoliticized this, I would point out, we have stopped three. When \nPresident Clinton was there, they stopped 60, usually because one \nRepublican, one, would object. So they were not allowed to have a \nhearing or vote.\n  I see my friend from West Virginia, and I yield the floor. I thank \nthe Senator from West Virginia for his usual courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10884-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10884-S10886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A PERFECT STORM\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the remarks I am about to make can very well \nbe written under the title ``Gathering Storm Clouds Over North Korea.'' \nWeather forecasters have a name for one of their worst nightmares of \nviolent atmospheric disturbance, triggered by an unusual convergence of \nweather systems. They call it the ``perfect storm.''\n  As the United States continues to be preoccupied with quelling the \npostwar chaos in Iraq, I worry that the elements of a perfect storm, \ncapable of wreaking devastating damage to international stability, are \nbrewing elsewhere in the world. The forces at play are centered on the \nescalating nuclear threat from North Korea, but they also include the \nemergence of Iran as a nuclear contender, the violence and desperate \nhumanitarian situation in Liberia, the near forgotten but continuing \nwar in Afghanistan, and the unrelenting threat of international \nterrorism.\n  Just a few days ago, the Department of Homeland Security issued a \nchilling alert that al-Qaida operatives may be plotting suicide \nmissions to hijack commercial aircraft in the coming weeks, possibly in \nthe United States--a very sobering thought indeed.\n  Weather forecasters can do little more than watch a storm unfold. \nThey cannot quiet the winds, as Jesus did on the Sea of Galilee, or \ncalm the seas. We require more from the President of the United States \nwhen it comes to international crises. The President cannot afford \nmerely to plot the course of the gathering storms over North Korea, \nIran, Liberia, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The President needs to turn \nhis attention to these countries and work with the international \ncommunity to defuse the emerging crises. The challenge is formidable \nand there are no easy answers. But the price of inaction could be \nruinous.\n  Of all the looming international threats, North Korea is clearly the\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\nmost worrisome. As recently as July 14, former Defense Secretary and \nKorean specialist, Willian Perry, warned that the United States and \nNorth Korea are drifting toward war, possibly as early as this year. In \nan interview published in the Washington Post, Dr. Perry said:\n  The nuclear program now underway in North Korea poses an imminent \ndanger of nuclear weapons being detonated in American cities.\n  Surely, such a stark warning from an official so deeply steeped in \nthe political culture of North Korea should be a wake-up call to the \nPresident. Yet, to date, the administration has steadfastly refused to \nengage in direct talks with North Korea, or even to characterize the \nthreat of North Korea's nuclear weapons program as a crisis. Instead, \nthe President and his advisers have continued to hurl invectives at Kim \nJong Il, while shrugging off increasingly alarming reports that North \nKorea is stepping up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  Since last October, when North Korea revealed that it planned to \nreprocess plutonium fuel rods into fissile material that could be used \nin nuclear weapons, the President and his advisers have consistently \ndownplayed the nuclear threat from North Korea, while hyping the \nnuclear threat from Iraq.\n  Yet while we have strong evidence that North Korea is working \nfeverishly to accelerate its nuclear program, we still have not found a \nshread--not a shread--of evidence that Saddam Hussein's efforts to \nreconstitute Iraq's nuclear weapons program were anything more than \nbluster and hyperbole.\n\n  It is time--if it is not already too late--to drop the false bravado \nof indifference to the threat from North Korea and engage in face-to-\nface negotiations with the North Koreans. Multilateral negotiations are \nfine--preferable even--but they are unlikely to be productive unless \nthe United States takes the lead. We cannot wait for the Chinese or the \nJapanese or the South Koreans to pave the way. We cannot brush off the \nnuclear threat posed by North Korea as just an annoying irritant. There \nis a real threat. Now there is a real threat to the United States, and \nthe United States must act fast to naturalize it.\n  The news on Thursday, July 31, that North Korea has expressed a \nwillingness to engage in six-sided talks, with the participation of \nRussia in addition to the other players, offers a glimmer of \nopportunity that the United States should seize before North Korea \nchanges its mind. As difficult as it is to predict or understand the \nmotivations of Kim Jong Il, one thing is certain: No progress can be \nmade in unraveling the nuclear tangle on the Korean peninsula until the \nparties involved start talking to each other.\n  Not only must the President come to terms with the gravity of the \nsituation in North Korea but the President must also understand that \nthis is not a one-man show, and that this is not the type of discussion \nthat can be sealed with a simple handshake. You don't look into the \neyes here and determine what is in the depth of the soul.\n  Under the Constitution, the Senate has a unique and important role to \nplay in helping to frame the contours and the content of international \ntreaties. Any agreement negotiated between the United States and Korea \nwill have far-reaching implications for the national security of the \nUnited States and, as such, should be subject to the treaty advice and \nconsent provision of article II, section 2, of the Constitution.\n  On a collision course with the nuclear threat from North Korea is the \nquestion of how to deal with Iran's increasingly aggressive nuclear \nposture. A month ago the President hinted darkly that he would not \ntolerate the construction of a nuclear weapon in Iran; but he has been \nlargely silent on the issue in the ensuing weeks. When asked during a \nrare press conference earlier this week about the potential for war \nwith Iran, the President placed the burden for seeking a peaceful \nsolution squarely on the shoulders of the international community, \nwithout suggesting any role for the United States beyond ``convincing \nothers'' to speak to the Iranian Government. When it comes to dealing \nwith the threat from Iran's weapons of mass destruction, it appears \nthat the White House is deferring to some of the same countries and \ninstitutions, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, that it \ndismissed as inconsequential during the runup to war with Iraq.\n\n  Like North Korea, the options for dealing with Iran are limited, but \ndodging engagement in favor of sporadic saber rattling is scarcely the \nwisest course of action. Equally unhelpful are ominous hints that the \nUnited States is contemplating covert action to precipitate regime \nchange in Iran. Unlike North Korea, Iran has not demanded direct \nnegotiations with the United States. Before it comes to that point, and \nthe United States is faced with the perception of being blackmailed \ninto negotiations, the administration should seize the initiative and \nnot abdicate its responsibility to other nations and other \ninstitutions. Here again, the administration cannot afford to ignore \nthe storm warnings and hope the crisis will simply blow over.\n  The situation in Liberia raises a different, but no less volatile, \nset of issues. Rent by violence and reeling from the effects of a \nthree-way conflict between an illegitimate government and the warring \nrebels who want to unseat it, Liberia is desperately seeking help from \nthe United States. The President raised expectations for U.S. \nintervention during his highly publicized visit to Africa earlier this \nmonth, but it has been several weeks now since his return, and still no \nclear policy with regard to Liberia has emerged from the White House.\n  The question of whether the United States should intervene in the \nLiberian crisis is fraught with unknowns and uncertainties. The \nhumanitarian crisis calls out for relief. And yet the solution is \nelusive, and the danger of ensnaring U.S. military troops in an \nintractable civil war is not to be underestimated. Can the Economic \nCommunity of West African States, known as ECOWAS, raise a force \nsufficient to stabilize the unrest in Liberia? Could the United States \nhelp without sending in ground troops? Is the United Nations prepared \nto take over peacekeeping operations once the situation is stabilized? \nCan the United States afford to assist Liberia? Can the United States \nafford to ignore Liberia?\n  The questions are tough, but procrastination is not an acceptable \nresponse. Hundreds of innocent civilians are suffering and dying as a \nresult of the conflict in Liberia. Monrovia is in shambles. Last week, \nJuly 25, the President took the tentative step of ordering several \nthousand U.S. Marines to be positioned off the coast of Liberia, but \nhow or whether any of those troops will be deployed remains unknown. \nIndecisive, half-hearted gestures serve no purpose. As long as there is \nan expectation that the United States will intervene, African states \nare unlikely to take independent action to deal with the situation in \nLiberia. The President needs to determine a course of action, he needs \nto consult with Congress and the United Nations on pursuing that \ncourse, and he needs to explain his reasoning and his strategy to the \nAmerican people.\n  In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week on \nJuly 24, GEN Peter Pace, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \ntermed Liberia ``potentially a very dangerous situation'' that poses \n``great personal risk'' to American troops. Any decision to send \nAmerican troops into that war-torn country is a decision that must be \ncarefully thought through and be made in concert with Congress and the \ninternational community, not simply presented to the American people as \nan after-the-fact notification.\n  The situation in Liberia, and the other crises brewing around the \nworld, require more attention and more explanation from the President \nthan the usual off-the-cuff comments tossed to reporters at the end of \nphoto ops. This is not a summer for the President to spend riding \naround the ranch in his pick up truck. This is not a time to play to \nthe television cameras with the ``bring 'em on'' school of rhetoric. \nThe problems confronting the United States require the President's \nserious and undivided attention. The American people deserve a full \naccounting from the President of where he stands on critical \ninternational issues, and how he intends to deal with them.\n  Against the backdrop of the war in Iraq and the emerging crises in \nNorth Korea, Iran, and Liberia, the largely\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\nforgotten war in Afghanistan--the largely forgotten war in \nAfghanistan--continues to grind on and on and on more than a year and a \nhalf after the United States rousted the Taliban from power and \nobliterated al Qaeda's terrorist training camps. Nearly 10,000 American \ntroops remain in Afghanistan, with no end--no end--to their mission in \nsight--and no clear mission to accomplish--hunting the remnants of the \nTaliban and al-Qaida organizations. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein's sons have \nbeen killed, and one can only hope that we are closing in on Saddam \nHussein himself, but in the wider war on terrorism, Osama bin Laden \nremains at large, and his organization continues to spread its venom \nthroughout the Middle East and perhaps the world.\n  The alert issued earlier this week by the Homeland Security \nDepartment is only the latest reminder that the al-Qaida terrorist \nnetwork remains a potent threat to America and its allies. The warning \nincluded specific details--such as the fact that targets might include \nthe East Coast of the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, or \nAustralia and it raised the possibility that at least one of the \nplanned highjackings or bombings could be executed before the end of \nthe summer.\n  In the face of such a frightening specter, it is somewhat unsettling \nthat on the subject of terrorism, the President is talking tough to \nIran and Syria, but he seldom mentions Osama bin Laden anymore.\n  Is this another example of the President's efforts to change his \nmessage to divert the attention of the American people, the people who \nare watching through those electronic eyes above the Chair's desk? The \nimminent and direct threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was \nused to hoodwink the public into accepting the rush to war, but now \nthat no weapons have been found, the President barely mentions them \nanymore. Instead, he is now talking about how regime change in Iraq was \nreally the catalyst required to stabilize the Middle East. New day, new \nmessage.\n  At the center of America's imperiled relations with its friends and \nfoes alike is the Bush doctrine of preemption, which was first \narticulated in the September 2002 National Security Strategy. This \nunprecedented declaration that the United States has the right to \nlaunch preemptive military attacks against hostile nations in the \nabsence of direct provocation sent shockwaves throughout the \ninternational community.\n  The doctrine of preemption was the justification for attacking Iraq \nwithout provocation, but the ramifications of the policy go far beyond \nthat nation. All so-called ``rogue regimes'' were put on notice that \nthe United States was prepared to act to deter the development of \nweapons of mass destruction that could be used against America.\n  Suddenly, the elite club of nations that formed the President's \n``axis of evil'' found itself caught in the cross hairs of the U.S. \nmilitary. And just as quickly, the hollowness of the doctrine was \nexposed. Iraq could be attacked at will because it did not have nuclear \ncapability. North Korea called for restraint because it plausibly did \nhave nuclear capability. Iran was a question mark. Predictably, both \nNorth Korea and Iran, seeing the writing on the wall, began to scramble \nto accelerate their nuclear programs. In retrospect, the doctrine of \npreemption is beginning to look more and more like a doctrine of \nprovocation.\n  Against this background, the storm clouds of international \ninstability are massing. America's military forces are stretched thin \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Our military leadership is absorbed with Iraq. \nOur military resources, both financial and personnel, are strained to \nthe breaking point. With the exception of Britain, our allies are \nreluctant to commit significant resources or manpower to an operation \nin Iraq in which the United States has a stranglehold on authority and \ndecision-making. The executive branch is preoccupied with the \noccupation of Iraq and seems paralyzed when it comes to meaningful \naction to deal with North Korea or Iran or Liberia. Afghanistan and the \nglobal war on terror have seemingly been relegated to the status of \nafterthoughts. America's foreign policy appears to be adrift in an \nincreasingly tumultuous sea of international turmoil. Meanwhile, the \nnational terror threat continues to hover uneasily in the ``elevated \nrange'' amid new warnings of terrorist attacks being plotted against \ncommercial aircraft.\n  In this moment of great potential peril, the President is preparing \nto retire for a month to his ranch in Texas. The question needs to be \nasked: Who's minding the White House?\n  In a short time, the Senate will recess for the month of August. I do \nnot think we should go very far. I hope that the international \nsituation will remain stable, and that no new crises will erupt. But I \ndo not pretend to be sanguine. I do not pretend to assume that all will \nbe well.\n  A rare combination of volatile and dangerous international events are \npoised to converge in the coming months. In large part, it is a storm \nof this administration's own making, fueled by the fear, confusion, and \ninstability caused by the unprecedented and ill-advised doctrine of \npreemption. I only hope that the President and his advisers can summon \nthe skill, the wit, and the leadership to engage and attempt to tame \nthe elements of international turmoil before it is too late and we are \nswept up into the vortex of the storm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Members, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10886-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SEPTEMBER IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, shortly I will make a statement addressing \nsome of the accomplishments we have been able to achieve over the last \nseveral weeks--indeed, over the last 6 or 7 months--and, at the same \ntime, a note to my colleagues about the future. Most are thinking about \ngetting on airplanes and going home or around the world now or this \nafternoon. It is important over the August recess, from the Senate \nstandpoint and staff standpoint, that people begin working in \npreparation for our return in early September.\n  I mentioned early this morning, most of September will be spent on \nthe appropriations bills. We have been very successful in addressing \nfour of those appropriations bills to date; we have nine to address in \nthe next several weeks. After discussion with the Appropriations \nCommittee and the leadership in the Senate and many colleagues, the \nfirst appropriations bill in September will be the Labor, HHS, and \nEducation appropriations bill. We will start that right off the bat \ncoming back from this recess. Under the leadership of Chairman Specter, \nwe have made huge progress in this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10886-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10886-S10887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2660\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, at this juncture, I ask unanimous consent \nthat at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, September 2, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 197, H.R. 2660, the Labor, HHS, and \nEducation appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will yield to my distinguished colleague \nwho will be managing this very important piece of legislation, someone \nwho has worked very aggressively, very diligently in this regard and \nwho I am confident will lead the Senate in addressing these important \nissues in a timely, efficient, and expeditious way upon our return.\n  I yield a few minutes to Chairman Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his generous comments. I thank him, further, for listing the \nappropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nimmediately on our return on September 2.\n  I have conferred with the ranking member of the Democrats, Senator \nHarkin, about our plan for managing the bill, and have conferred beyond \nthat with Senator Byrd, the ranking\n\n[[Page S10887]]\n\nmember of the full committee, and with many of the Democrats who will \nbe expected to offer amendments.\n  It is a very complex bill governing the Departments of Health and \nHuman Services and Education and Labor, and traditionally it brings a \ngreat many amendments. That is to be expected. It is my thought that we \ncan identify the amendments at an early stage, that we can work out \ntime agreements, and that we can vote on the amendments.\n  I have already talked to some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle about doing some of that work in August, where we will be \nidentifying amendments. We have an excellent staff on both sides of the \naisle already working. It is our expectation, beyond our hope, to have \na very prompt consideration of the bill and to get it completed at an \nearly date. I don't want to say any timeline because this body is too \nunpredictable, even with planning and with management, but it is our \nhope to get short time agreements and, with the consent of the \nleadership, to have the votes stacked. If there are arguments, to go \nover and make use of the evening time and proceed to get the bill \ncompleted.\n  There is one very strong incentive on all sides for completing the \nbill and that is that we have $3 billion more if we have a bill than if \nwe have a continuing resolution. We do not have too much money to start \nwith, and very important items on health, education, and worker safety, \net cetera.\n  So we intend to proceed on that basis. I appreciate the opportunity \nto address my colleagues. As the majority leader has said, people are \nalready on planes en route, some worldwide. I have my plans very well \nset. I am on a train in 25 minutes. August is to be spent by this \nSenator traveling his State.\n  There is rumor that I have an election coming up in 2004, both a \nprimary and a general election. I have a lot of work to do and will be \nattending to it. When we return at the start of September--to the \nSenate business, Senator Harkin and I hope to set the pace to try to \nget these appropriations bills done, to cooperate with the majority \nleader. If there is to be a completion by September 30, the end of the \nfiscal year, this is the giant, once the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill has been finished.\n  So we will be hard at work, trying to get through the bill and have \nthe Senate work its will and get it completed in the public interest.\n  I, again, thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I have \nthe utmost confidence we will be able to get on this bill as soon as we \nget back and that, under his leadership, along with that of Senator \nHarkin, we will be able to very effectively and efficiently address the \nissues before us.\n  Clearly, we seek early, rather than later, completion. One of the \nadvantages of even having this colloquy now and us having the statement \ntogether is that people know what we are coming to. They have plenty of \ntime to look at the appropriations and develop what comments they have \nto make and allow time for preparation of amendments. With that, we \nshould be able to come back and hit the ground running.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I might make one addenda, Mr. President, and that is \nthe option of third reading if people do not have amendments to offer. \nOne of the banes of the Senate procedure is the quorum call, those two \nlights up there when nothing is happening on the floor.\n  I have long been an advocate that, if amendments are not offered, we \nought to go to third reading. When people have more than a month to \nprepare, I think that is a fair position to take. When I last managed \nthis bill in June of the year 2000, we finished the bill on the Senate \nfloor on June 28, which tied a record going back to 1974.\n  We cannot do that; we are already past June 28. But I think we can \nget this bill done. But let the record show: Let the buyers beware. Let \nSenators be on notice that this manager intends to push for third \nreading if we have quorum calls up there. People ought to bring their \namendments to the floor and we will debate them and vote on them and \nwork the will of the Senate and work through promptly.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10887-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10887-S10890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DOING THE NATION'S BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the past 4 weeks have been extraordinarily \nproductive. I thank my colleagues for their participation, for their \ncooperation, and for their patience to make that possible. I thank them \nfor accepting some deadlines that we put forward, accepting the overall \nstrategy, just as we just heard, of setting a goal far in advance so \npeople have the opportunity to prepare and to think so we can most \nefficiently use the time for debate and amendment on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  We have passed major legislation, of which we should all be proud. We \nshould share that with our constituents, as we go back to our States, \nas we travel around the country to seek input and listen but also to \nsay that we are doing the Nation's business.\n  Our leadership has developed a straightforward mission. The mission \nis crystal clear. It is to move America forward. We are doing so in a \nmanner with values such as civility and trust. We do it in a way that \nis relationship centered, meaning that we are working together to get \nthe very best out of our individual Members, in terms of thoughts and \nideas. We do it in a manner that is solution oriented, that is \nsolutions to the problems that we identify, not just rhetoric and not \njust talk about the problems.\n  I think we witnessed that yesterday, in a long day that began at 9 \no'clock or 9:30 in the morning but continued until late at night, with \nthe ultimate passage of an Energy bill, of which passage, early in the \nmorning, people said: No way.\n  All the media questions, people coming up were saying it is going to \ntake another week or 2 weeks or 3 weeks on this Energy bill. Are you \ngoing to stay in on Saturday? Are you going to come back and spend all \nof September?\n  Yet after initial discussion and proposals, both caucuses worked \ntogether and worked within themselves and we came together to pass an \nEnergy bill that will, indeed, move America forward. We did it against \nwhat many people would say are the odds. We did it in a very closely \ndivided Senate. But it shows that even in that environment, of a \nclosely divided Senate, if we keep our eye on a specific goal, we can \nmove America forward.\n  We have set specific goals. As you just heard, we laid out what we \nare going to be doing next far enough in advance for people to prepare.\n  Then we act. Each side has certain strategies, and then we reach that \ngoal to give a solution to the American people. That is what Americans \nexpect. When we talk to our constituents, that is what they say they \nwant. That is why they send us to the Senate. They want to be sure we \nstep up to the plate on growth and jobs.\n  We must be a key partner with the administration in the war on \nterror. We must stand up and act on life and support our values here at \nhome and, indeed, around the world. We have much to do in the realm of \nhealth. We have made progress, but we have much more to do. Our tort \nsystem is badly in need of reform.\n  Of course, during all of this, our utmost responsibility is to \ngovern--to govern responsibly, in a responsive way.\n  Before we leave for our recess today, reflecting over the last 4 \nweeks we have been in session, I therefore jump back to before the \nFourth of July recess. Before the Fourth of July recess, it was at that \npoint that I informed our colleagues we would be doing the Energy bill \nin this final week in July, and we did. I said at that time we would do \neverything possible to finish the Energy bill this week, and we did. As \nlate as yesterday morning, there was doubt. Early in the morning, \npeople said there was no way it could be done. We got it done by \ncooperation--again, on both sides of the aisle--by determination, and \nby going back to one of those values I keep talking about which we are \nexpressing in this Congress--civility. We were successful. We got it \ndone. America will benefit. Americans will benefit.\n  We have a national comprehensive energy policy coming out of this \nbody. Yes, it will be modified. Yes, in part, it will be rewritten over \nthe coming weeks. But with the President laying\n\n[[Page S10888]]\n\nout a plan 2 years and 3 months ago, with the House of Representatives \nhaving acted, and the Senate having acted on energy, we can develop \nthat final product to send to the President to the benefit of all \nAmericans. It is part of government, it is part of leadership, and we \nhave delivered.\n  On the international front, last night we passed two highly \nsignificant trade agreements. One was the Singapore free-trade \nagreement, and the other was the Chile free-trade agreement. Those are \nthe first free-trade agreements to move through Congress under the so-\ncalled fast-track authority since that process was restored a year ago. \nIt is an important achievement for the body itself, but it is an even \nmore important achievement for the world community and for our national \ncommunity as we improve those trade relationships with Chile and \nSingapore.\n  As you just look at the action last night on energy, it was a tough \nchallenge. Everybody said: No, we have to spend days and days and days \nmore. As we look on the success with trade last night, we can say we \nhave added another chapter to our work to grow the economy and to \ncreate jobs. It didn't exist yesterday morning, and now it exists after \nour action last night. As we look at this whole issue of jobs and as we \ntravel around the country, it is the No. 1 issue you hear about because \nit affects people's lives so directly.\n  We passed the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003. Indeed, as most of us are \naware, over the last week or week and a half and over the next several \nweeks, 25 million families will receive checks of $400 or more per \nchild, which is in addition to the $600 they have already received this \nyear. But that additional incremental $400 is because of action here in \nthe Senate and passing the jobs and growth package--25 million \nfamilies--indeed, over 500,000 in my home State of Tennessee. If we had \nnot acted, they would not be getting the checks. They will be spending \nthose checks. Most importantly, they decide how to spend that $400, or \nthat $1,000, because of the action of this body. They are the ones who \ndecide whether it is on clothing, whether it is on food, or whether it \nis on buying a computer to help their child in education. They will be \ndeciding.\n\n  A family of four, because of that jobs and growth package, making \n$40,000 will see their taxes reduced. Remember, that means money in \ntheir pockets--money they can save and invest. A family of four making \n$40,000: $1,133 in 2003. That is how much their taxes will be reduced.\n  The Jobs and Growth Act is the third largest tax cut in history \npassed by this body. The $350 billion package will boost the economy, \nit will grow the number of jobs, and it will allow more Americans to \ncontrol more of their own hard-earned paychecks. This is money they \nhave earned which they paid to the Federal Government that the Federal \nGovernment has returned to them to save and to invest, to boost the \neconomy, to make their lives more fulfilling. That is the sort of \naction and the sort of solution that moves America forward.\n  Because of our commitment to meeting our legislative goals, we are \nhelping to put America on the road to economic security. We are \ncommitted to strengthening America's economy. We are committed to \nproviding each American with more of that economic security. And we are \ncommitted to ensuring that the playing field is fair.\n  On the international front, we funded Operation Iraqi Freedom in less \nthan 2 months. We have liberated the Iraqi people from the clutches of \na vicious and brutal dictator, a mass murderer who has killed thousands \nof his own people, including members of his own family as well as \nthousands of people from lands outside of the Iraqi border.\n  Over the last several weeks, we have had the opportunity to be \nbriefed by people directly in Iraq who are participating in the \nrebuilding of that democracy. They brought to us encouraging news that \nall too often we don't see on the front pages of the newspapers or in \nthe coverage on the television. But we are hearing directly from them. \nWe are making progress. Is it slow? Of course, it is slower than any of \nus would want. But it is steady, consistent progress. The Senate will \ncontinue to support this ongoing war on terror. We will continue our \nfinancial commitment. We will continue our moral commitment until \nAmerica's enemies are defeated.\n  Internationally, we also passed the NATO Expansion Treaty bringing \n700 new nations into that cornerstone organization of freedom in the \nWestern World. We are bringing more and more countries into the orbit \nof democratic nations and providing more of the world's economic \ncitizens with that sort of opportunity, and more of the world's \ncitizens with that economic security that they, too, deserve.\n  The Senate is also flexing its influence to reform countries that \ndefy their citizens their natural, God-given rights to be free. We did \nthat recently with the assistant majority leader, Senator McConnell's \nBurmese Freedom Act just several weeks ago. With a bit of luck, we will \nfinish action on the authorization of our foreign aid programs so that \nwe can further enhance our voice and our values around the world.\n  Again, if we jump back 5 or 6 weeks, before the last recess, I \narticulated my goal to pass major appropriations bills in a timely \nfashion. This, too, we are accomplishing in an organized, systematic \nway.\n  The colloquy that just occurred on the floor with the distinguished \nchairman of the Labor-HHS bill is a manifestation of planning and a \nsystematized approach of a strategy where we can address that very \nimportant bill in a timely fashion. If we do it as he mentioned--as he \nwill be explaining on the floor of this Senate on the Tuesday we come \nback--if we do it instead of delaying, there will be an additional $3 \nbillion available. If it happens to be available the way the law is \nwritten, that committee will not have the incentive later to take the \naction but will address the bill right now.\n  This is in contrast to the last Congress. There was a logjam we had \nin the last Congress where the appropriations bills really got stopped. \nIn fact, it was not until this Congress that we passed 11 of the 13 \nappropriations bills that were supposed to be passed in the last \nCongress. We did that in the first couple months of this Congress.\n  But we are making progress. We built on our success with the FAA \nauthorization bill, the extension of unemployment benefits. When you \nlook at the appropriations, in 3 short weeks we passed the legislative \nbranch, the Department of Defense, military construction, and the \nHomeland Security appropriations bills. That keeps moving America \nforward. And we will come to Labor-HHS when we return.\n  I should mention that on the Homeland Security appropriations bill we \nhad distinguished leadership. I applaud and personally thank Senator \nThad Cochran for his tremendous work in particular because that was the \nfirst time we have had this Department of Homeland Security and, thus, \nit is a new appropriations bill. It was handled magnificently on the \nfloor, and we were able to successfully complete the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill.\n  This whole process of setting goals, implementing a strategy in a \ncivil environment, and working hard through debate and amendment is \nworking. If you look at our commitment on health and health issues, \npeople see the commitment there. They saw it as we set out the agenda \nin early January on a whole range of issues.\n  In January, most people, on Medicare, said: The Senate is not going \nto be able to do it. The House can probably do it. They have done it in \nthe past. In fact, they do it really in every Congress. The rules are \nvery different in the House. But most people said: In the Senate \nMedicare is too partisan. There is too much bickering. People use it \nfor political purposes. It can't be done.\n  Yet, again, we delivered. Now the Senate has passed a bill that, for \nthe first time in the history of this wonderful Medicare program--that \nsimply is out-of-date, but a wonderful program that as a physician I \nhave had direct experience with for 20 years, just about every day \ntaking care of Medicare patients before coming to the Senate, writing \nthousands of prescriptions myself--for the first time those \nprescriptions I was writing become a part of Medicare.\n  Heretofore, these outpatient prescriptions have not been a part of \nMedicare. Yet the way health care has evolved, these medicines today \nare probably the most powerful component, the most powerful tool \ndoctors\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n\nand nurses and health care providers have to give seniors health care \nsecurity, to give patients health care security.\n  In addition, seniors and individuals with disabilities will have the \nopportunity, for the first time in Medicare, to choose a plan or a type \nof health care coverage that best suits their individual needs. We \npassed it in the Senate. We did what a lot of people said we were just \nnot going to be able to do. And it was bipartisan. There were over 70 \nvotes, and it was really kind of driven to get as many votes as \npossible but with good policy, taking the very best of the Democratic \nideas and the very best of the Republican ideas, and melding those \ntogether.\n  We have a challenge I am very hopeful we will meet by late September; \nthat is, to take that House bill, to take the Senate bill--the \nconference is underway now--and, in conference, develop a bill that \nwill be strong, that will guarantee seniors access to good prescription \ndrug coverage, and give them the choice of a plan that best meets their \nneeds.\n\n  I will say--because people don't talk about it very much on the \nfloor; and I am speaking as an individual but also as a conferee--it is \nimportant for us to complete action in this conference by late \nSeptember. The sooner we complete action on the bill, the sooner every \nsenior--people who are listening broadly around the country or near \nseniors--will have a prescription drug card within months--within \nmonths--of the time the President actually signs that bill; every \nsenior will get some help with that card in the very near future if \nthey are buying prescription drugs.\n  So the sooner we complete the bill, the sooner we can get the benefit \nto the seniors, especially those seniors who are hurting, who are in an \neconomic position where this burden of buying prescription drugs is \ngreat, is heavy. The sooner we pass this bill--it has to be a good \nbill; it has to be an appropriate bill; it has to be a balanced bill; \nand it has to be, most importantly, a responsible bill--the sooner \nseniors can benefit from the $400 billion that this body, the House, \nand the President of the United States have all agreed we want to get \nto seniors.\n  So it is ready in terms of the commitment that is made. The money is \nthere. Now we need the vehicle itself. And that is what we are doing in \nconference. So the sooner we can get it done, the sooner seniors will \nbe able to benefit.\n  On health, I will also have to mention the global HIV/AIDS bill this \nbody passed several months ago under the distinguished leadership, \ngreat leadership, of Chairman Dick Lugar. This global HIV/AIDS bill \naddresses the greatest moral, humanitarian, and public health challenge \nof the last 100 years. It shows we are caring. It shows we have \ncompassion. It shows we do not just talk about it, but that we lead on \nit.\n  I commend President Bush, in his State of the Union Message, for \nleading on it, and this body for responding appropriately at a level--\nagain, in a bipartisan way--that most people in this country and, \nindeed, the world would not have anticipated.\n  As a physician, I have had the opportunity over a 20-year period to \ntake care of HIV/AIDS patients personally, both when I was at \nVanderbilt University Medical Center and also as I did my medical \ntraining in Boston, MA, and out at Stanford in California. I can tell \nyou, when you have the opportunity to look back over a 20-year period--\nin 1983 we did not know this virus existed. We did not know about it. \nThe best scientists in the world did not know this virus existed. Then \nit killed five people in the country. Then it killed, in the world, a \nmillion people, then 5 million people, then 10 million people. And now \n23 million people have died over that 20 years since 1983.\n  We are responding. This is the first time we have really stepped up \nand said: We are going to eliminate this virus. I am very proud of my \ncolleagues and gratified that the Senate stepped up with this \ndetermination to dedicate $15 billion, which is the figure people think \nof, but equally important, taking a leadership role for comprehensively \naddressing the ravages of this virus.\n  By passing this legislation, we are helping to prevent 7 million new \ninfections, we are providing antiretroviral drugs for 2 million HIV-\ninfected people, providing care for 10 million HIV-infected \nindividuals, and investing in research so we will find a cure.\n\n  Right now, today, there is no cure for this virus. There is no \nvaccine to prevent this virus. Thus we need to do everything we can to \nboth preserve our great pharmacologic research endeavors in this \ncountry and, at the same time, invest in a responsible way so we can \nencourage and give incentives to encourage investment to find a cure--a \ncure that if you had the virus, you will be able to cure the virus, and \nalso to prevent the virus. And you can do that with a vaccine.\n  In this Congress, we have seen Senator Susan Collins lead the \ncampaign to increase public access to defibrillation of the heart. When \na heart fibrillates, it becomes like a bag of worms. Instead of beating \nregularly, it begins to fibrillate. And that is when people die, \nbecause the heart is not pumping. But if you can get to them quickly \nenough, you can put those paddles on, and you can shock the heart back \nto that normal, constant beating.\n  That public access to defibrillation is important. It is something on \nwhich we are making huge progress, specifically under the leadership of \nSenator Susan Collins.\n  We passed the Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act. So if \ndriving home today you were to have an accident, there will be a trauma \ncenter to respond to you immediately, especially when time and \nexpertise become critically important.\n  Our values have been on display this session as well.\n  We have allotted significant resources to upgrade the technology at \nAmerica's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We took a \nhistoric step in bringing a National Museum of African American History \nand Culture to our Nation's capital by passage of that bill.\n  It has been 80 years of petitions that has led to an understanding of \nhow we might respond. But in terms of developing the museum, it took \npassage on the floor of the Senate for it to take that next step to \nbecome a reality. I have to thank Senator Sam Brownback and Congressman \nJohn Lewis from the other side of the Capitol for their tremendous \nleadership.\n  Senator Lamar Alexander has focused on the American History and \nCivics Education Act. Because of his leadership, America's students \nwill have the opportunity to learn our Nation's great history and civic \ntraditions. I thank Senator Gregg for his bill, the Keeping Children \nand Families Safe Act. We acted on legislation to make it easier for \nStates to continue their efforts to enroll children in health care \nprograms. The SCHIP legislation makes a difference in thousands and \nthousands of families' lives.\n  There were three items passed earlier this year I want to mention. In \nMarch we passed the partial-birth abortion ban. We have an agreement \nwith the other side of the aisle to address this issue for a day \nsometime in September. The following month, we passed the CARE Act, the \nPresident's faith-based initiative. That same month we passed the AMBER \nalert. The lives of millions of Americans and future citizens will be \nprotected by all of these efforts. Each of these items demonstrates our \ndeep compassion for our most vulnerable citizens.\n  The Senate is accomplishing all of this through hard work, through \ncooperation among Members on both sides of the aisle. I thank my \ncolleagues for their efforts. We are overcoming partisanship. We are \nstressing civility and trust. We are making the legislative process \nwork in an orderly and systematic way.\n  One area, however, that is in some ways undermining progress is the \nobstruction we are seeing with regard to Presidential circuit court \nnominees. We have seen it with Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen, and \nWilliam Pryor. Now is not the time to rehearse the history of the last \n7 months, but it is enough to say that the process is broken. The \nprocess is not working. I would only hope as the fall unfolds, we will \nfind ways for the Senate to vote up or down. That is really all this \nside of the aisle is asking for, to have that opportunity to vote yes \nor no, up or down on the President's judicial nominations.\n  When it comes to the fall, we will continue our work to govern \nresponsibly and comprehensively. We will\n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\ncomplete our efforts with regard to the emergency supplemental as well \nas funding the President's request submitted in early July.\n  In those coming weeks of the fall, we will also complete action on \nseveral remaining appropriations bills. As we outlined earlier today, \nwe will begin with the Labor, Health and Human Services legislation. \nThat legislation underwrites many of our Federal efforts to help where \nwe must to make a difference in so many Americans' lives.\n  We will also continue to work this fall on asbestos reform \nlegislation. It is clear that is a pressing national crisis. I am \nconvinced that with goodwill and cooperation, we will be able to \nresponsibly address this issue. I have talked with the Democratic \nleadership repeatedly, and we all agree it is an issue we can address \nand will address sometime in the future.\n  We will also take up at some juncture class action lawsuit reform. It \nis a fairly quiet bill in the background, but it is one that will make \na huge difference in the fair and quick administration of justice \nnationwide. We will also be revisiting medical litigation reform \nsometime in the fall. There are other items we can address in terms of \ntort reform that we in all likelihood will be considering. We will \ncontinue to stand for issues surrounding life. We will complete action \non the partial-birth abortion ban at some point in September, and then \nwe will move ahead on legislation addressing the Unborn Victims of \nViolence Act.\n\n  Yesterday Senator Judd Gregg announced hearings in September on \npublic health issues on tobacco. I know the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. McConnell, introduced legislation on Wednesday with \nregard to buying out quotas from tobacco farmers. We will be addressing \nall of those issues in the coming months. In addition, we will be \nlooking for other opportunities.\n  In closing, I thank my leadership colleagues who have helped me each \nand every day over the last 7 months: Our distinguished President pro \ntempore, Ted Stevens; I talk to Chairman Stevens daily. He is an avid \nuser of e-mail so I get three or four every day, which I quickly \nanswer, a canny veteran whose counsel daily has proven invaluable to me \nand to so many others; our assistant majority leader, Mitch McConnell, \nwhose tireless work day in and day out has kept us together as a team \nand a conference in these months, is really the glue to our conference; \nConference Chairman Rick Santorum, who continues to work in overdrive, \nworking overtime, working with passion to keep an eye on the midterm \nand the long-term issues that are so important to us, focusing so often \non those basic values we share; Jon Kyl, our policy committee chairman, \nwhose attention and focus and study, by leading the policy committee, \nall ensures that we legislate the very best we can, with the very best \ninformation at every opportunity; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, our \nvice chairman, who stands so often as our public persona in addressing \nissues and explaining those issues in a way that is important for the \nAmerican people to understand, addressing issues in a sophisticated, \nsubstantive way, but at the same time explaining those so Americans can \nindeed fully understand where this institution is moving; George Allen, \nour senatorial chairman, whose instincts are so often right and right \non target; Judd Gregg, who I rely on daily for counsel, whose word I \ntrust and whose support so often makes a huge difference in this \nChamber; Senator Bob Bennett, our chief deputy whip, whose work with \ncolleagues we simply could not do without; Senator Arlen Specter, who \nwas just on the floor, whose thoughts and advice inform so many of the \ndecisions we make here.\n  I am grateful to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \nshare a thought, who share with me that single word, that piece of \nadvice out of their busy day. I am proud that together as Senators we \nhave preserved what our predecessors have given us and are working to \npass on to our successors even something a little bit better.\n  I thank all the Senators for their hard work, their diligence, and \ntheir cooperation. I look forward to returning in September to continue \nour work on the people's business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10890-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10890-S10892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to speak about \nthe economy, an issue that is of increasing concern to so many families \nacross the country. Measured in terms of employment alone, this has \nbeen a very difficult and demanding time for Americans across the \nNation. At the President's urging, Congress has passed three major tax \ncuts in what is becoming an annual ritual. I call it a ritual, because \nit is based on an ideological belief that tax cuts are a one-size-fits-\nall fix to all of our Nation's economic woes.\n  Regardless of the specifics of our economic situation, regardless of \nthe growing number of unemployed Americans, and regardless of our \nrecord budget deficits, the Administration has pushed on with its \nmisguided, one-track approach.\n  Mr. President, I do not think anyone would invest a dollar in a \nproject if they only expected to receive 10 cents back. But that is \nessentially what has happened under the trickle-down economic approach \nof the Administration. A March 2003 report by the Democratic staff of \nthe Joint Economic Committee estimated that in the best case scenario, \nthe first year return of the 2003 tax cuts would be less than 10 cents \non the dollar.\n  What this means is the American people massively overpaid, committing \nourselves to transferring hundreds of billions of dollars to the \nNation's wealthiest individuals for a pittance of economic stimulus.\n  We have all become extremely anxious and hopeful to hear anything \npositive about the economy. At first blush, the recent data coming from \nthe Department of Commerce offers a suggestion of hope. But after \nconsidering the reports at longer length, and in the context of all the \nparticipants in our economy, I am convinced the reports about our gross \ndomestic product are something of a letdown.\n  As Senator Conrad has stated, 70 percent of the growth in this \nquarter's GDP estimate is caused by increased defense spending, without \nwhich the economy would have grown at less than 1 percent. This 1 \npercent growth would be the slowest economic growth of any \nadministration in half a century. So what we are seeing is one of those \nissues in which one sector, for obvious reasons--because of our buildup \nin Iraq and our subsequent operations there--is generating a \ndisproportionate share. One can ask the question fairly, how long can \nthat continue?\n  The National Bureau of Economic Research announced last month that \nthe recession ended 20 months ago. But this announcement simply \nconfirms what many have long suspected--that we are in the midst of a \n``jobless recovery.'' The economy is in as much trouble as it was in \nthe early 1990s, if not worse. More than 3.2 million private sector \njobs have been lost during this Administration, with 1.2 million jobs \nlost even after the so-called end of the recession 20 months ago. And \n6.2 percent of the civilian labor force was unemployed, which is down \nslightly from the previous numbers of 6.4 percent. But the July decline \nis instructive because it doesn't represent a growth in jobs, it \nrepresents the fact that there is a drop in the number of people \nlooking for jobs. The way we measure unemployment is by looking up the \nnumber of people actively pursuing employment, that is the basis of the \ncalculation. What we are seeing is people giving up hope, becoming \ndisheartened, understanding that it is hard to find jobs and therefore \ndropping out of the search for jobs.\n  Indeed, if you look at the ratio of employment to population, total \nnumber of people working versus the population of the U.S., we have \nseen that ratio decline. Nine million workers were unemployed in July \nacross the country.\n  But for the current President Bush, this is not his father's jobless \nrecovery. By this period in the 1991 economic recovery, private nonfarm \npayrolls were rising again. Not only are private sector jobs failing to \nrise again, they are continuing to fall at an even faster rate. \nCorporate layoffs are continuing. For Americans who have suffered the \nmost from the recession, this is not an economic recovery because there \nare simply no jobs.\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\n  In my State, we received notice that a major department store is \nclosing, a flagship store in one of our prominent malls, Lord & Taylor, \nwhich will lay off workers. We are seeing other retail operations \nclose. For the families of Rhode Island and the Nation, the news they \nare getting is of more job losses.\n  Persistent unemployment is only one piece of evidence that passing \ntax cuts does not fix the Nation's economy. The next place to look is \nthe budget.\n  This week, for the first time, President Bush acknowledged the role \nthe tax cuts played in mortgaging our Nation's economic future by \nturning budget surpluses into record budget deficits. In the Rose \nGarden, the President said: ``And so part of the deficit, no question, \nwas caused by taxes; about 25 percent of the deficit.'' That is \naccording to the President. But according to economists, these figures \nare conservative at best.\n  The administration's Midsession Review reveals that the budget \ndeficit for fiscal year 2003 is expected to be an astonishing $455 \nbillion. This is the largest budget deficit in our history. This \ndeficit is placed into stark relief by the Bush administration's \nforecast upon coming into office of a $334 billion surplus for 2003. So \nin just 2 years, we have seen a swing of more than three-quarters of a \ntrillion dollars and that is just for this fiscal year.\n  The causes of the deficit are plain to see if you look at what is \nhappening to revenues as a share of GDP--they have gone into a \nfreefall. According to the Midsession Review, revenues in 2003 will \nequal 16.3 percent of gross domestic product, the lowest level relative \nto the size of the economy since 1959. The administration would like \nthe public to believe this is some sort of natural decline due to \nrecession and war. But we have been in recession before and we have \nseen war before, without getting into such a low level of revenue.\n  In fact, we can look at where revenues relative to GDP were in 1990 \nand 1991 and see that for President Bush, this is not his father's tax \npolicy either. The truth is the administration's tax cuts actually \naccount for 36 percent of the $7.6 trillion reversal in what was the \n10-year budget outlook for fiscal years 2002-2011.\n  This is not even taking into account the administration's soaking up \nof Social Security surpluses, thereby reneging on a campaign promise \nnot to raid Social Security. Moreover, the tax cuts take away resources \nnecessary to ensure both Social Security and Medicare long-term \nsolvency.\n  We need to save for the retirement of the baby boomers, and we are \nnow less than a decade away from that wave of retirement. We don't have \ntime to ``grow out'' of the deficits as we might once have back in the \n1980s. That makes these efforts even more pernicious to the economy.\n\n  The administration has leveled the claim that the deficits would only \nbe temporary. The first chart appearing in the Administration's \nMidsession Review shows that deficits as a share of GDP will be cut by \nmore than half by 2006. As Senator Conrad has pointed out, cutting a \ndeficit in half after you have quadrupled or tripled it isn't exactly \nimpressive management. Yet, I don't believe this Administration will \neven accomplish that reduction of the deficit. The deficits in the \nlatter half of their 6-year window are not going to be as small as they \nclaim they will be.\n  There are many reasons why we should be skeptical of the \nadministration's predictions of much smaller deficits in the future \nyears. First, the budget projections don't include lots of things that \nwill surely increase the deficit; for example, the continuing costs of \nthe Iraqi occupation--estimated today at $4 billion a month--and the \ncontinuing cost of military operations in Afghanistan, estimated today \nat $1 billion a month.\n  Secondly, the administration's tax cuts are unlikely to boost GDP--\nand tax revenue relative to GDP--as much as the administration thinks. \nTheir forecast for the years 2005 through 2008 is simply too \noptimistic. The Midsession Review shows an increase in revenue relative \nto GDP of more than 2 percentage points in just 3 years, 2004 through \n2007. But this sharp increase is unprecedented. It didn't even happen \nduring the ``revenue surprises'' of the 1990s when revenues seemed to \nexplode.\n  Such dramatic growth in revenues is much less likely now, because the \nadministration's tax cuts have reduced the mechanisms that were the \nmain drivers of the 1990s revenue surprises--capital gains taxes and \nthe progressivity of the individual income tax system.\n  Then there is the other administration response to the deficit \nissue--that it simply doesn't matter.\n  Federal Chairman Allan Greenspan repeatedly has emphasized that \nhigher deficits do, in fact, lead to higher interest rates. As the \nFed's monetary report to Congress stated, deficits have already led to \na downswing in national saving, and ``if not reversed over the longer \nhaul, such low levels of national saving could eventually impinge on \nthe formation of private capital that contributed to the improved \nproductivity performance of the past half-decade.'' At last month's \nBanking Committee hearing, Chairman Greenspan clearly stated that he \nwould oppose the continuation of large deficits in the face of full \nemployment. Yet the administration's own overly-optimistic forecast \nshows deficits persisting after the economy is back to full employment \nand robust economic growth.\n  By choosing tax cuts over less costly and more immediate stimulus for \nthe past several years, the President has allowed the manufacturing \nsector, a hallmark of our country's economy, to fall into a spiraling \ndecline. This neglect for a vital sector of the economy has especially \nhurt the Northeast and the Midwest.\n\n  Just this week, the Wall Street Journal stated:\n\n       While hundreds of factories close in any given year, \n     something historic and fundamentally different is occurring \n     now . . . Most of these basic and low skilled factory jobs \n     aren't liable to come back when the economy recovers or when \n     excess capacity around the world dissolves.\n\n  The manufacturing industry cut 56,000 more jobs in June alone, the \n35th consecutive monthly decline. From manufacturing to information \ntechnology, midcareer workers have been especially hard hit, and with \nmany of these jobs lost forever to other countries, there is even more \nreason to act fairly and pass additional assistance for the long-term \nunemployed and to provide them with new skills through job retraining \nprograms when you consider the record of job loss.\n  We should not limit unemployment and job retraining assistance to \nthose laid off from manufacturing jobs, however. With so many Americans \nout of work for far too long and the persistence of job losses, there \nis an incredibly pressing need to extend benefits to those workers who \nhave exhausted all of their unemployment benefits and yet still found \nno work. It is not their fault that jobs are not being created for them \nto fill.\n  Finally, there is no question that state fiscal crises are also \nrestraining the economic recovery. These crises are predicated in no \nsmall part on insufficient Federal grant-in-aid to the States, along \nwith decreased state tax revenues that are tied to reduced Federal tax \nrates.\n  Indeed, what we have here is a push-and-pull phenomenon. As the \nadministration claims they are cutting taxes to stimulate the economy, \nState and localities are forced to raise taxes and cut expenses under \ntheir rules and their budgets, thus creating a situation in which our \neffect is counteracted by their necessary actions.\n  The official labeling of an ``economic recovery'' by the National \nBureau of Economic Research sadly does not mean an end to the economic \nsuffering that too many Americans feel. I think we should all be deeply \nconcerned about the state of our economy--the persistent unemployment, \nand the huge budget deficits that are only likely to grow worse as the \nadministration continues to push its tax-cutting agenda. Contrary to \nthe administration's claims that its tax-cutting agenda is necessary to \nget the economic growth to bring surpluses back, those tax cuts will \nreduce our economic capacity for many, many years to come. We have \nalready seen clear evidence of that, even in the administration's own \nestimates.\n  Just this week, a trio of Cabinet Secretaries has been traveling \nacross the country on a so-called Jobs and Growth Tour Bus. But there \nhave been no jobs, very limited growth.\n  And this tour is less of a victory lap than a further underscoring of \nthe serious economic issues that face American families.\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\n  It appears that for some, the problem of working families struggling \nto get by merely serves as an excuse to pass massive, ineffective, \nirresponsible, and untargeted tax cuts. We must stay focused and pass \nmeasures that make sense and will put our economy on the right course \nboth now and into the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10892-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10892-S10896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                LIBERIA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate concerning my \nconcern--I think there are others who feel similarly--about the crisis \nsituation that is rapidly developing in Liberia and the decision \nframework that has confronted, is confronting, and will confront our \nGovernment.\n  I carefully use the word ``Government'' because when men and women in \nthe Armed Forces are sent into harm's way, there is a constitutional \nresponsibility on the President as Commander in Chief and the principal \narchitect of our foreign policy to make the decision to send them into \nharm's way. In no way in my 25 years in the Senate have I ever once \nquestioned that constitutional authority. In fact, I will match my \nrecord--humble as it is--against any Member of this body with regard to \nparticipation in the war power debates, participation in the \nresolutions regarding the use of force, when we, as a body, are \naddressing our responsibilities with regard to the men and women of the \nArmed Forces.\n  The President has a constitutional right. There is always debate, as \nreflected in the history of the War Powers Act, to what extent should \nhe consult and, indeed, to what extent should he receive the specific \nconcurrence of the Congress before exercising that very heavy \nresponsibility.\n  There are volumes written on this subject. But for simplicity, \nclarity, and brevity today, I simply say the Constitution gives that \nright to the President and should not be ever in question. To the \nextent that Congress has the opportunity, through consultation and \nthrough other actions working with the administration, I believe it is \nwise that Congress speak to this issue.\n  About 4 weeks ago, I appeared on ``Meet the Press'' and somewhat \nindirectly referenced my concern about Liberia at that time. I \nexpressed that the need to make a decision was coming down upon this \nGovernment, as indeed it has, and that it would be wise for the \nCongress to take a role. I cannot predict how this body would vote on \nit if it got to a vote. But I think the involvement of Congress when \nmen and women go in harm's way is a very important responsibility as \ncoequal branches of the Government, the executive and the legislative, \nand, indeed, an obligation.\n  I have tried each day to spend some time on these issues. I read what \nI can from the press, which has been rather interesting and good \ncoverage so far, and from other documents, official and otherwise.\n  The complexity of this situation is really considerable. We do have \nthese historical ties dating to the 1840s to this small country. At \ntimes, we have taken actions there. At times through the history of \nthis country, we have sort of looked the other way. We have gone in \nbefore to try to quell disruption and violence, but I do not find a \nlong history of strong involvement. We now have a despot who has been \nelected to the highest official post in that country, who has made \nrepresentation that he will leave subject to certain contingencies. The \nPresident of the United States has indicated he wants to try and help \nthe people subject, again, to the Liberian leader taking certain \nactions. This whole framework is quite unclear.\n\n  The Secretary General of the United Nations visited here 2 weeks ago. \nI was privileged to sit in a small meeting hosted by the distinguished \nmajority leader, at which time we expressed our views. He was quite \nconcerned, as I am quite concerned--I think everybody is quite \nconcerned who has followed this--about the extraordinary dimensions of \nhuman suffering, there is no dispute about that, human suffering as a \nconsequence of the frightful public record of the current leader in \nLiberia, that leader who has indicated he is willing to leave.\n  As I stand here addressing the Senate, on orders from the President, \na very significant force, largely of marines, has progressed from the \nHorn of Africa around to the Mediterranean and is approaching, probably \nin the next 72 hours, a location somewhere off the coast of Liberia, \nwhere the ships will be positioned to await such further orders as the \nPresident may direct.\n  Now, what of the role of the Congress? As chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, I had hearings--at least a briefing--at my \nrequest on July 8. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs provided a very \nfine team of briefers where my committee, in S-407, heard their \nreports. A day or so ago, recognizing the Congress would soon be \nleaving for its August recess, I felt it wise to set a second briefing \nof the Armed Services Committee to which I invited really anyone in the \nSenate who wished to join, and also specifically a group of Senators, \nof which I am one, who soon will be embarking on a trip to the African \ncontinent. I was privileged to be included in that trip and expressed \nan interest to go primarily because of my concerns of national security \nin that region and the impending Liberian conflict. It had been my \nexpectation that several of those Senators would have joined today had \nthat briefing gone ahead.\n  Yesterday afternoon, the Department of Defense, following the regular \nprocedures we always follow, sent up the names of three briefers--2 \nfrom the Joint Staff and one from OSD policy--and it all seemed to be \nready to go this morning when quite unexpectedly we received word from \nthe Department of Defense that the briefers would not come.\n  I will not dwell further on that procedure. I will say in my 25 years \nin the Senate, it is most unusual to conduct our affairs in that way \nbetween the Senate and the Department of Defense. Indeed, I am not sure \nI know of a precedent of that type of abrupt cancellation, but I will \nput that to one side and press on. I did feel it would have been \nhelpful, certainly, to this Senator and several others--I know one or \ntwo on the Foreign Relations Committee yesterday expressed to me their \nconcerns of where could they get information. Both of those Senators \nwere invited to attend this morning. One of them is on the Subcommittee \non African Affairs and he expressed to me his concern and asked how \nbest he could get involved in learning more.\n  I will move on now to this question about the seriousness of this \nproblem. This type of civil war, regrettably, has persisted in Liberia \nfor many years. There are essentially three factions now. There is one \nfaction to the sort of fragile, if almost inconsequential, government \nthat is in place today with this despotic leader. Then there is a group \nto the south that refers to themselves as the Model, M-O-D-E-L. There \nis a group in the north that refers to themselves as the Lurd, L U-R-D. \nBoth of them are a mixture of groups of Liberians and others from other \nareas. Both groups are now converging on the central part of the \ncountry, Monrovia, and we have witnessed this outbreak once again of \ncivil war and the devastation being wrought on innocent civilians.\n\n  So what to do about it? Again, I am not prepared to give a clear \nanswer. I would presume the administration is proceeding and in due \ncourse will share this information, but it is likely one or more \ndecisions will be made in the absence of the Congress in formal \nsession, so that concerns me because I feel strongly that congressional \ninvolvement in this situation is very important. I go back to our \nobligation to the men and women in the Armed Forces.\n  Once this military force--that is the force at sea--is on station, I \nanticipate that will increase the international pressure on our \nGovernment--and I continue to use the phrase ``government''--to become \nmore actively involved and send these forces in. Again, under the \nConstitution, the President has every right to make that decision on \nhis own initiative, with or without consultation with the Congress, and \nto proceed.\n  In doing that, I call the attention of the Senate to the military \ndoctrine that has evolved since Vietnam. It was my privilege to serve \nin the Department of Defense for over 5 years during the Vietnam \nconflict as Navy Secretary. That period of history is indelibly etched \nin my memory, a period of\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\nhistory which reflected the Congress breaking away from successive \nadministrations that were involved in that conflict, and the animosity \nin the Congress against the Department of Defense. I shared my burden \nof that animosity, along with three Secretaries of Defense whom I \nserved with in that period. Two remain very dear friends and valued \nadvisers to me to this day. The third has passed on.\n  Out of that conflict, America began to examine the criteria by which \nthis Nation should send men and women in uniform into harm's way--a \nvery introspective, deep reflection on the tragic losses. My \nrecollection is close to 50,000 men and women gave their lives in that \nconflict in Vietnam, and many more were wounded.\n  So often in the evening hours of our duties in the Pentagon in those \ndays, I would, as did the other service Secretaries, call families and \nattend funerals. I frequently met with groups regarding their deep \nconcern about that conflict and their losses. I remember meeting with \nthe wives of the prisoners of war on regular occasions. Then this \ncountry unfortunately, in many respects, turned its discontent on the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces themselves. When they would return \nhome from their tours of duty in Vietnam, indeed there were instances \nin commands in the European theater of breakdown in discipline and \nmorale, because of the uncertainty surrounding that conflict, the \nenormity of the casualities that we would take.\n\n  I mentioned the background because it was important America sit down \nand reflect on those criteria that Presidents--and indeed to the extent \nthe Congress renders its approval--that Presidents and the Congress \nshould follow.\n  A brief summary of that doctrine would be that military action should \nbe used only as a last resort and only if there is a clear risk to \nnational security interests of the United States of America; and at \ntimes we take into consideration the security interests of our valued \nallies.\n  So, is there a clear risk to national security by the intended target \nof our military action? What measure is the risk to the uniformed \nAmerican? What measure is the risk to his or her life and limb?\n  The force when used should be overwhelming and disproportionate to \nthe force used by the enemy. There must be strong support for the \ncampaign by the general American public and there must be a clear exit \nstrategy from the conflict in which the military is engaged.\n  I have generalized this but I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record following my statement a very important set of guidelines \nfor the use of force that have been articulated through the years by \nour distinguished Secretary of State, Colin Powell--the so-called \n``Powell Doctrine.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I have fairly stated the basic precedents that I embrace \nwholeheartedly. The Members of the Senate, in general, embrace these \nprecedents.\n  Therefore, I pose rhetorically the question: As the decision process \nis made at this time, given the Congress will be out of town, that \nprocess will be made by the executive branch, the President of the \nUnited States, assuming, as he does, full accountability, will those \ncriteria for the use of force be the guideline or are we somehow going \nto make a departure, and if so, what is that departure?\n  I fully recognize the dimension of human suffering today and the \npotential for even greater human suffering tomorrow, perhaps the next \nday. But at the same time, I fully recognize to the best I have been \nable to assertain, and I have not been able to assertain it to my \ncomplete satisfaction, but there will be an element of risk. I have \nasked not one, not two, but half a dozen distinguished military \nofficers--some active duty, some not--whether they share my concern \nthat there will be a measure of risk should we send troops into \nLiberia.\n  I made reference to this in hearings we have had in the Armed \nServices Committee in connection with the reappointment of the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Myers and of the Vice Chairman, \nGeneral Pace.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an excerpt from \nrenomination hearing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. WARNER. My concern is not just of today; it has been there for \nsome significant period of time. This Senator has pressed the questions \non that situation at every opportunity I have had to date.\n  I will also reflect on the personal involvement I have had in \naddition to the period in Vietnam. When I first came to the Armed \nServices Committee, I worked under some of the greatest men I have ever \nknown in the Senate: Scoop Jackson, John Stennis, Barry Goldwater, John \nTower. I try, as best I can, in my duties as Senator today to draw on \nthe wisdom they imparted to me in their teachings. Those men were \nhistoric in proportion to the Senate. I shall never achieve but a small \nfraction of their stature but, nevertheless, having the responsibility, \nI do my very best.\n  I remember John Stennis asked me to work on a report for him of the \neffort we made to rescue the hostages illegally taken by the Government \nof Iran at the embassy. We all remember that challenge. The Pentagon \nprepared what I thought was a well thought through plan to rescue those \nhostages. It was the right thing to do. We put our military at great \nrisk. It was a plan to use covert action and helicopters. I will not \ndwell on it because I did write that report for Senator Stennis. It is \nsomewhere in the archives.\n  The bottom line, a series of primarily mechanical failures, due to \ndust being taken into the intake systems, prevented the consummation of \nwhat I still to this day say could have been a successful operation. \nCertainly the heroics of the men involved who volunteered for that \naction were extraordinary.\n  John Tower, when he was chairman, we went together, just the two of \nus, to Beirut shortly after the bombing of the marine barracks in \nBeirut, marines who were sent there for the best of purposes to try to \nalleviate the suffering. The tragic loss.\n  Later, I was entrusted to work on the report for Somalia. My \ndistinguished colleague, good friend, Carl Levin, and I went to \nSomalia. We worked on that report. It took us months to interview many \nindividuals. How could we have experienced that tragic loss of men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces at the hands of savage attacks? That is a \nmatter of record, the observations and conclusions Senator Levin and I \nput in that report.\n  I don't want to take any more time of the Senate on what I personally \nhave done. Many have done as much, if not more, in respective \nresponsibilities, but I do draw on some experience.\n  I am not hesitant to express my own concerns about some situations. \nIf I were asked today, What should be done with respect to Liberia, I \nwould simply say, I do not have the facts to make an informed \ndecision. I hope in the executive branch there are those who do have \nsufficient facts to make an informed decision. Is this situation \nfollowing the doctrine in our national security interests? I have even \nseen the word ``vital'' national security interests used. It has not \nbeen answered to my satisfaction.\n\n  If we are going to make a departure from the doctrine, is that \npredicated on sound principles that equate, somehow, to violation of \nsecurity interests? If so, should we state them? If so, should we \nexplain to the people?\n  I strongly believe, as I pointed out, that as we ask our men and \nwomen to take risks, we should, an as executive branch, as a \nlegislative branch, have informed the American people, prepared the \nAmerican--prepared them in a way to accept such losses as might occur. \nHas that been done? I fear, in my judgment, it has not been done.\n  I have tried my best to respond to my constituents. I have been \nquestioned about it a number of times. I do not have the facts to my \nsatisfaction. But it is very clear throughout the history of that \nVietnam experience, we should have, as I stated, gained the support of \nthe general public, the support of the families of the men and women in \nthe Armed Forces who must go in harm's way. That has not, to my \nsatisfaction, been done.\n  It is my hope that whatever decision process has to be made in the \nabsence\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\nof the Congress will be made and carefully thought through. If we are \ngoing to depart from this doctrine on the use of force, if there are \ngeopolitical pressures, if there are domestic political pressures--\nwhatever it is, spell it out: What were the factors taken into \nconsideration to make such decisions as may--and I underline may--be \nmade by the executive branch when the Congress is gone, assuming that \nsome decisions will be made--I don't predict in any way what they may \nbe, but assuming some decisions are made. Maybe the decision is not to \nbe involved.\n  I do fervently hope the Congress becomes engaged when we return, that \nwe consider whether we have a resolution--first at the request of the \nadministration, with the concurrence of the Senate leadership, and \nperhaps maybe some consultation with the committee chairmen and ranking \nmembers who are involved in the oversight committees--mine, Foreign \nRelations, certainly the Subcommittee on Appropriations, and others. So \nwe go through a process.\n  I was privileged--I remember it so well--in 1991 to be asked by then \nthe distinguished leader, Robert Dole, to prepare a resolution for the \nutilization by the President of force in the Persian Gulf in the 1991 \nconflict. How well I remember that debate--3 days, 3 nights on this \nfloor of the Senate and then the vote. And only by a margin of 5 votes \ndid the Senate adopt a resolution in support of then the first \nPresident Bush to utilize force in that conflict.\n  We had a larger vote with regard to the operations in Afghanistan and \nIraq. We had some closer votes. I worked on these resolutions and so \nforth and decisionmaking by the Congress in the Balkan situation. I \nwatched, carefully, all of those matters as they were addressed by this \nbody.\n  Now, as we look at this situation in Liberia, we have a background of \nan ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and an ongoing conflict in Iraq. \nThis mighty Nation is mourning the losses of uniformed members of the \nArmed Forces every week for some weeks now, doing the best we can \nindividually to comfort and share the grief of the families.\n  Just this week, one Senator approached me: His State suffered a loss, \nand how could we facilitate the interment that this brave soldier \ndeserved in Arlington in a timely way? Those steps are being taken. But \na number of Senators have approached me, and I am glad to help as best \nI can with this situation back home in the context of the loss of the \nbrave men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  This decision regarding Liberia could superimpose on those losses \nanother level. It could. The risk, it seems to us, to be there--some of \nus who looked at this issue. Are we prepared as a nation to accept \nanother circumstance in another theater that poses the threat of more \ncasualties? I come back, is the United States of America--its \ncitizens--prepared?\n  Our Armed Forces today, in my humble judgment, are stretched. We have \nseen some questioning the morale. I happen to think the morale is quite \nhigh. The recruiting, to the everlasting credit of the American spirit, \nis still strong; the retention is still strong. The All-Volunteer Force \nhas exceeded every expectation we had.\n  I was privileged to be part of the framework in the Pentagon, under \nthe leadership of a distinguished Secretary of Defense by the name of \nMelvin Laird, and a successor Secretary by the name of Jim Schlesinger, \nto envision and create and establish the All-Volunteer Force. It \nworked, and worked well. But that has its breaking points. Like \neverything else in life, it has its breaking points. I am not \nsuggesting we have reached that limit, but we should never take our eye \noff the fact of that framework, that concept that everyone in uniform \ntoday is there because he or she has raised their arm and pledged \nallegiance to the Constitution of the United States and obligated \nthemselves to accept the risks of military service. They do so thinking \nthat the President, whoever that President may be, and the Congress, \nwhatever the composition may be, are standing guard, protecting them \nand their families, protecting them and following the doctrine on the \nuse of force, which presumably they have some knowledge of before \naccepting these obligations, that doctrine that I have enunciated and \nothers have enunciated.\n  That is a heavy obligation upon us. We have to make certain that, as \nthese conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq are concluded and the goals \nthat we stated are reached--goals which enable both of those nations to \nachieve a measure of democracy and freedom that they never have had, \ncertainly not in the last 30 years--after that, those successive \ngoals--and there is no doubt that we must be steadfast in our resolve \nto achieve them--we have to make certain our Armed Forces remain strong \nto meet the unexpected contingencies that arise around the world. Those \ncontingencies that could challenge the vital security interests of this \nNation. That means a strong, active, All-Volunteer Force, a strong \nGuard and Reserve.\n  We have to take those steps now to ensure that they are in place as \nwe complete our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq, and indeed in many \nways where our troops are throughout the world. I think they are on the \nborder of being overdeployed and overextended, and we have to keep a \nvery watchful eye.\n  Early this week, the Secretary of Defense came up to the Hill along \nwith General Keane and went over a rotation policy which is going to \ncorrect--and I repeat in their words--that ``some mistakes were made'' \nof late with regard to our troops currently engaged in the Iraqi \nconflict. I commend the general. He recognized that some mistakes have \nbeen made. They are going to correct them.\n  I think now our forces will have a much clearer understanding, and \ntheir families--and I repeat--and their families will have a clear \nunderstanding as to their obligation. But always keep in mind that \nthere is a tomorrow and a tomorrow, and what we do today in many ways \nestablishes the foundation of what we can and cannot do on a tomorrow.\n  I wish our President Godspeed to make his decision. And I am hopeful \nthat this body will engage itself when it returns from this recess.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                u.s. senate committee on armed services\n\n       Sir/Madam: There will be a meeting of the Committee on \n     Armed Services, Room SR-325, the Caucus Room, Russell Senate \n     Office Building, Thursday, July 24, 2003-9:30 a.m.\n       To consider the following nominations: General Richard B. \n     Myers, USAF, for reappointment as Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff and reappointment to the grade of general; \n     and General Peter Pace, USMC, for reappointment as Vice \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and reappointment to \n     the grade of general.\n       The nominees will be present.\n                                  ____\n\n       Chairman Warner. My last question would relate to Liberia \n     and the decision process now underway by which the President \n     is trying to make an assessment as to the force level and \n     composition that could be put in by the United States to \n     stabilize a very tragic situation in terms of human \n     suffering.\n       But, on the other hand, in my judgment it is a situation \n     that poses great personal risk to forces such as our forces \n     that could be injected into that very fast-moving and \n     volatile situation there in Monrovia and the greater Liberia.\n       General Myers. If you will permit me, Mr. Chairman, let me \n     just describe the situation that we currently have in \n     Liberia. It hasn't changed dramatically in the last 24 hours.\n       But we have a situation where you have a leader who has got \n     to go who, as we know, is not a good leader, has not done \n     good things for Liberia or, for that matter, has not been--\n     been a lot less than helpful to the countries in the region, \n     and so President Taylor must leave, and that part is being \n     worked.\n       The other thing is that the two rebel groups, the two major \n     rebel groups, the LURD and the MODEL, it is unclear--in fact, \n     it's, I think the intelligence community would tell us that \n     it is probably not going to happen that you are going to get \n     political leadership out of these rebel groups, that they are \n     not a replacement for Taylor. So it is not clear who is going \n     to step forward in a political sense when the situation \n     settles down in Liberia, to take over the political \n     leadership.\n       In the meantime, you have a humanitarian situation where \n     food, clean water, medical care is a problem. All the \n     nongovernmental organizations that were in there providing \n     those kinds of capabilities have left because of the \n     security situation. So it is a situation that is, as you \n     have described it, is not a pretty situation. It is not \n     going to give way to any instant fix. Whatever the fix is \n     going to be is going to have to be a long-term fix.\n       Currently, we have the West African nations surrounding \n     that area, to include Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, others, are \n     looking to put a force in there to help stabilize the \n     situation in Liberia. They, of course, have asked for U.S. \n     support and what the administration is doing right now is \n     trying to determine what is going to be the character of that \n     support.\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\n       As a military person, I am concerned, like you, that \n     whatever we do, that we have a very clear mission, we \n     understand the mission we are asked to do, that we have an \n     idea of when the mission is going to be over, in other words, \n     when can we come out of the mission, and that we have \n     sufficient force to deal with the security situation, that we \n     do not go in on a shoestring when we need adequate force.\n       There are other things we can consider, but those are \n     probably the three main things.\n       We have looked at options, all sorts of options. There has \n     been no decision made--taken on this. I think I will just \n     leave it there, I think. I think in the next few days we \n     will--\n       Chairman Warner. I would also add, for myself, and I draw \n     that from statements made by our President in earlier days, \n     that there be a clear and identifiable strategic interest, \n     security interest, of this country. That to me remains \n     somewhat to be defined in this situation, should the decision \n     be made to go forward.\n       Can I just draw by way of conclusion your remarks that you \n     concur, that in my judgment, this is not a risk-free \n     operation, if we were to undertake it?\n       General Myers. Mr. Chairman, I don't think any operation \n     like this is risk-free. We have three, at least three warring \n     factions, the LURD, the MODEL, the two rebel groups, and the \n     government forces themselves. They are all armed. They are \n     not disciplined troops as we know them. There are a lot of \n     young people fighting in these groups. It is potentially a \n     dangerous situation.\n       So when you go into it, you need to go into it knowing \n     that. It may be that we can go in terms of support for these \n     ECOWAS forces. And ECOWAS countries have come forward and \n     volunteered forces. They will need some equipping and some \n     training, some of the forces will, before they go in. So \n     it is a little longer-term issue and it is a matter of \n     months, probably not weeks, for some of those forces. Some \n     of them probably can get in there fairly quickly, but \n     small numbers.\n       And then eventually I believe Kofi Annan up at the U.N. \n     said this will become a U.N. mission at some point. And that \n     all has to be blended into this.\n       But I will go back to the larger issue. There is a \n     political situation there with the president of a country, a \n     `'democracy,'' and how they deal with President Taylor, where \n     he goes, what this interim government is also important to \n     our security situation. And that is a somewhat cloudy picture \n     today.\n       Chairman Warner. General Pace, you had experience in your \n     previous command before becoming Vice Chairman, in terms of \n     Central and South America, do you have any views to add to \n     those of the Chairman, General Pace?\n       General Pace. Sir, my experience in Somalia is a little \n     more akin to the potential experience in Liberia. And I would \n     echo what General Myers just said, that it is potentially a \n     very dangerous situation. And when we--if we are asked to do \n     something militarily, we need to make sure we do it with the \n     proper numbers of troops and that we be prepared for the \n     eventualities of having to take a military action.\n       Chairman Warner. Thank you, Senator Levin.\n       Senator Levin. Just on that Liberian issue, would you \n     recommend going in unless Taylor is either gone or on his way \n     out as we arrive?\n       General Myers: So far, that has been one of the planning \n     assumptions that we made, that otherwise, you get into a \n     situation that General Pace knows only too well, and it would \n     define your mission, and the mission would be quite different \n     if Taylor were to remain there than if he were gone. And so \n     one of our planning assumptions is that he will leave, either \n     before or simultaneously with the troops entering, whether \n     they are ECOWAS troops or U.S., or U.S.-supported ECOWAS \n     troops.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   [The first public articulation of the ``Powell Doctrine,'' a most \n   influential mindset throughout the 1990s--and through the current \n                        administration, as well]\n\n  Excerpts From Colin Powell, ``U.S. Forces: The Challenges Ahead,'' \n                      Foreign Affairs, Winter 1992\n\n       To help with the complex issue of the use of ``violent'' \n     force, some have turned to a set of principles or a when-to-\n     go-to-war doctrine. ``Follow these directions and you can't \n     go wrong.'' There is, however, no fixed set of rules for the \n     use of military force. To set one up is dangerous. First, it \n     destroys the ambiguity we might want to exist in our enemy's \n     mind regarding our intentions. Unless part of our strategy is \n     to destroy that ambiguity, it is usually helpful to keep it \n     intact. Second, having a fixed set of rules for how you will \n     go to war is like saying you are always going to use the \n     elevator in the event of fire in your apartment building. \n     Surely enough, when the fire comes the elevator will be \n     engulfed in flames or, worse, it will look good when you get \n     in it only to fill with smoke and flames and crash a few \n     minutes later. But do you stay in your apartment and burn to \n     death because your plans call for using the elevator to \n     escape and the elevator is untenable? No, you run to the \n     stairs, an outside fire escape or a window. In short, your \n     plans to escape should be governed by the circumstances of \n     the fire when it starts.\n       When a ``fire'' starts that might require committing armed \n     forces, we need to evaluate the circumstances. Relevant \n     questions include: Is the political objective we seek to \n     achieve important, clearly defined and understood? Have all \n     other nonviolent policy means failed? Will military force \n     achieve the objective? At what cost? Have the gains and risks \n     been analyzed? How might the situation that we seek to alter, \n     once it is altered by force, develop further and what might \n     be the consequences?\n       As an example of this logical process, we can examine the \n     assertions of those who have asked why President Bush did not \n     order our forces on to Baghdad after we had driven the Iraqi \n     army out of Kuwait. We must assume that the political \n     objective of such an order would have been capturing Saddam \n     Hussein. Even if Hussein had waited for us to enter Baghdad, \n     and even if we had been able to capture him, what purpose \n     would it have served? And would serving that purpose have \n     been worth the many more casualties that would have occurred? \n     Would it have been worth the inevitable follow-up: major \n     occupation forces in Iraq for years to come and a very \n     expensive and complex American proconsulship in Baghdad? \n     Fortunately for America, reasonable people at the time \n     thought not. They still do.\n       When the political objective is important, clearly defined \n     and understood, when the risks are acceptable, and when the \n     use of force can be effectively combined with diplomatic and \n     economic policies, then clear and unambiguous objectives must \n     be given to the armed forces. These objectives must be firmly \n     linked with the political objectives. We must not, for \n     example, send military forces into a crisis with an unclear \n     mission they cannot accomplish--such as we did when we sent \n     the U.S. Marines into Lebanon in 1983. We inserted those \n     proud warriors into the middle of a five-faction civil war \n     complete with terrorists, hostage-takers, and a dozen spies \n     in every camp, and said, ``Gentlemen, be a buffer.'' The \n     results were 241 Marines and Navy personnel and a U.S. \n     withdrawal from the troubled area.\n       When force is used deftly--in smooth coordination with \n     diplomatic and economic policy--bullets may never have to \n     fly. Pulling triggers should always be toward the end of the \n     plan, and when those triggers are pulled all of the sound \n     analysis I have just described should back them up.\n       Over the past three years the U.S. armed forces have been \n     used repeatedly to defend our interests and to achieve our \n     political objectives. In Panama a dictator was removed from \n     power. In the Philippines the use of limited force helped \n     save a democracy. In Somalia a daring night raid rescued our \n     embassy. In Liberia we rescues stranded international \n     citizens and protected our embassy. In the Persian Gulf a \n     nation was liberated. Moreover we have used our forces for \n     humanitarian relief operations in Iraq, Somalia, Bangladesh, \n     Russia and Bosnia.\n       All of these operations had one thing in common: they were \n     successful. There have been no Bay of Pigs, failed desert \n     raids, Beirut bombings or Vietnams. Today American troops \n     around the world are protecting the peace in Europe, the \n     Persian Gulf, Korea, Cambodia, the Sinai and western Sahara. \n     They have brought relief to Americans at home here in \n     Florida, Hawaii and Guam. Ironically enough, the American \n     people are getting a solid return on their defense investment \n     even as from all corners of the nation come shouts for \n     imprudent reductions that would gut their armed forces.\n       The reason for our success is that in every instance we \n     have carefully matched the use of military force to our \n     political objectives. We owe it to the men and women who go \n     in harm's way to make sure that this is always the case and \n     that their lives are not squandered for unclear purposes.\n       Military men and women recognize more than most people that \n     not every situation will be crystal clear. We can and do \n     operate in murky, unpredictable circumstances. But we also \n     recognize that military force is not always the right \n     answer. If force is used imprecisely or out of frustration \n     rather than clear analysis, the situation can be made \n     worse.\n       Decisive means and results are always to be preferred, even \n     if they are not always possible. We should always be \n     skeptical when so-called experts suggest that all a \n     particular crisis calls for is a little surgical bombing or a \n     limited attack. When the ``surgery'' is over and the desired \n     results is not obtained, a new set of experts then comes \n     forward with talk of just a little escalation--more bombs, \n     more men and women, more force. History has not been kind to \n     this approach to war-making. In fact this approach has been \n     tragic--both for the men and women who are called upon to \n     implement it and for the nation. This is not the argue that \n     the use of force is restricted to only those occasions where \n     the victory of American arms will be resounding, swift and \n     overwhelming. It is simply to argue that the use of force \n     should be restricted to occasions where it can do some good \n     and where the good will outweigh the loss of lives and other \n     costs that will surely ensue. Wars kill people. That is what \n     makes them different from all other forms of human \n     enterprise.\n       When President Lincoln gave this second inaugural address \n     he compared the Civil War to the scourge of God, visited upon \n     the nation to compensate for what the nation had visited upon \n     its slaves. Lincoln perceived war correctly. It is the \n     scourge of God. We should be very careful how we use it. When\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\n     we do use it, we should not be equivocal: we should win and \n     win decisively. If our objective is something short of \n     winning--as in our air strikes into Libya in 1986--we should \n     see our objective clearly, then achieve it swiftly and \n     efficiently.\n       I am preaching to the choir. Every reasonable American \n     deplores the resort to war. We wish it would never come \n     again. If we felt differently, we could lay no claim \n     whatsoever to being the last, best hope of earth. At the same \n     time I believe every American realizes that in the \n     challenging days ahead, our wishes are not likely to be \n     fulfilled. In those circumstances where we must use military \n     force, we have to be ready, willing and able. Where we should \n     not use force we have to be wise enough to exercise \n     restraint. I have finite faith in the American people's \n     ability to sense when and where we should draw the line.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a very special \nperson, Joseph C. Chase, of the Senate Appropriations Staff who retired \nyesterday after 31 days of service in the Senate.\n  When asked for his wisdom and advice after such a long period of \ndistinguished service, Joseph smiled and easily responded by saying \n``deal with people as they are and always in a positive way.''\n  Joseph C. Chase was born on March 18, 1948. He was raised in \nBrandywine in Prince Georges County. He is a graduate of Gwynn Park \nSenior High School in 1967 and attended Bowie State University from \n1968 to 1970 where he majored in physical education and studied to be a \nteacher.\n  Joseph comes from a large family. He is the tenth child in a family \nof 11, nine boys and two girls. In 1988, he donated a kidney to his \nbrother Andrew Chase who worked for the Sergeant at Arms.\n  He has been married to his lovely wife Peggy Elsey Chase for 29 \nyears. The Chases met in 1969, and were married on July 27, 1974. Peggy \nhas been a teacher for over 30 years. The Chases have two children, a \ndaughter JoVonna, born August 1, 1977, and a son Joseph Jr., born \nAugust 21, 1983. The have one granddaughter, Kylah who is 3\\1/2\\.\n  Joseph's family legacy on Capitol Hill started over 60 years ago with \nhis uncle Lewis Brooks, age 89, who worked on the House side as a \ndoorkeeper. Over the years, more than 20 members of Joseph's family \nhave worked on Capitol Hill. After working as a driver for Master \nDistributors and Brody Brothers Trucking, Joseph started working for \nthe Senate Sergeant at Arms in July of 1972. He then came to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee in March of 1973 under the chairmanship of \nSenator John McClellan. In total, Joseph has worked for the Senate for \nover 31 years.\n  Since that time, Joseph has witnessed the growth in size and power as \nwell as a host of other changes on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nWhen Joseph started it consisted of only 30 people--today we have 95. \nFull committee meetings and conferences were held in the Old Supreme \nCourt Chamber, would last for days and days, and were usually closed to \nonly members and very few staff.\n  Joseph is actively involved in his church and community. He is a \nsenior member of Asbury U.M. Church in Brandywine which is pastored by \nW. Otto Kent. In addition to being a member of the Prince Hall Masons, \nhe is a vice president of the Danville Floral Park Citizens \nAssociation.\n  In closing, I just want to offer a special thank you to Joseph for \nall his outstanding contributions to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee over the past 31 years and wish him the best of luck in all \nhis future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10896-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DR. BILL MADIA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a true leader in \nthe science community and to thank him for his hard work on behalf of \nTennessee and the Nation. After 3 years as Director of the Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory, Dr. Bill Madia will be stepping down to return to \nBattelle headquarters in Columbus, OH as the Executive Vice President \nfor Laboratory Operations. During his tenure in Oak Ridge, Bill has had \na tremendous impact not only on the laboratory, but on the Oak Ridge \ncommunity as well.\n  Bill Madia came to ORNL to continue the lab's tradition of world-\nclass scientific research dating back to the Manhattan Project, and to \nadvance its work on critical Department of Energy missions. His \npresence was felt immediately, as he took on an ambitious laboratory \nrevitalization effort which included building new facilities to expand \nresearch capabilities, upgrading existing facilities to enhance ongoing \nresearch, and tearing down outdated facilities to relieve the lab from \nunnecessary overhead costs.\n  The cornerstone of this revitalization effort is the Spallation \nNeutron Source, a $1.4 billion dollar user facility that will be the \nmost powerful machine of its kind in the world. Under Bill's watchful \neye, the SNS has remained on schedule and on-budget. Alongside the SNS \nis the site for the new Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, the \nfirst of DOE's cutting-edge nanoscience centers. Down the hill is the \nupgraded High Flux Isotope Reactor; the combination of these three \nfacilities has ORNL poised to become a premier neutron science \nlaboratory.\n  Bill's vision for ORNL also includes scientific computing, and with \nthe recent completion of the Center for Computational Sciences, one of \nthe most modern computer laboratories in the world, ORNL is ready to be \na major participant in the Department of Energy's high-end \nsupercomputing programs.\n  On the biological sciences front, the old ``Mouse House'' is being \nreplaced with a new facility, the Laboratory for Comparative and \nFunctional Genomics. This updated lab will keep ORNL on the cutting \nedge of genetic research utilizing the mouse colony to address the need \nto study gene function and apply that knowledge to curing human \ndiseases. For this research ORNL is participating in a statewide effort \nknown as the Tennessee Mouse Genome Consortium, a group that includes \nthe University of Tennessee/Knoxville, the University of Tennessee/\nMemphis, Vanderbilt University, the University of Memphis, St. Jude \nChildren's Hospital, Meharry Medical College and East Tennessee State \nUniversity.\n  Bill's leadership and commitment have truly made a difference at ORNL \nand throughout Tennessee, and I thank him for his service. I wish him \nall the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10896-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10896-S10897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SENATE ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL SECTION 205\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before we adjourn for the August recess, \nI'd like to make a brief statement related to Section 205 of the Senate \nEnergy and Water appropriation bill. While we have not yet taken up \nthis bill on the Senate floor, I expect that we will do so very quickly \nonce we return from the August recess. I would therefore like to \nprovide my views on a provision that has received significant attention \nin New Mexico.\n  Section 205 is a provision that addresses endangered species issues \nin the Middle Rio Grande in New Mexico. As a threshold matter, let met \nstate that I support the approach taken in Section 205 to address the \nongoing conflict between water use and the ESA in the Middle Rio Grande \nbasin. While there is a remaining issue about the interpretation of one \naspect of the language in that section, I have worked with Senator \nDomenici to address that issue and we will follow-up on that matter \nwhen the bill comes to the floor.\n  The conflict in the Middle Rio Grande was exacerbated by a recent \ndecision by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Section 205 responds to \nthat decision. I think it is an appropriate response because it \nprovides a level of certainty for water users in the basin but leaves \nintact the requirements and goals of the Endangered Species Act. Let \nmet explain that in more detail.\n  As many of my colleagues have already heard, the decision by the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Rio Grande Silvery Minnow \nv. Keys requires the Bureau of Reclamation to reallocate water from the \nSan Juan-Chama project if necessary to meet the requirements of the \nEndangered Species Act. What is remarkable about this decision--which \nneeds to be redressed in my view--is that the San Juan-Chama project \nwater is not native to the Rio Grande basin. It is water that \noriginates in the San Juan River basin, and is brought over as a \nsupplemental water supply for use in the Rio Grande basin. Use of this \nwater--quite simply--has not caused the decline of the Rio Grande \nsilvery\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\nminnow, nor does it further jeopardize the existence of that species. \nThe Court's decision, however, disregards these facts and erroneously \ndirects the Bureau of Reclamation to reduce water deliveries to project \ncontractors such as the cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe, if \nnecessary to meet the needs of endangered species. This result is not \nconsistent with the intent of section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, and therefore \nunreasonably creates an uncertain water supply situation for a number \nof communities in New Mexico.\n  This situation needs correction and the intent of section 204 is to \ndo just that. It eliminates reclamation's discretion to unilaterally \ntake water from San Juan-Chama contractors and reallocate it for ESA \npurposes. Section 205, however, preserves voluntary transactions by \nwhich Reclamation can meet the needs of the endangered fish. This is \nhow business has been done since 1996, and that process is allowed to \ncontinue.\n\n  Section 205 also includes a subsection that legislates the \nsufficiency of the ten-year biological opinion addressing water \noperations in the Middle Rio Grande. I understand that protecting a \nbiological opinion through Federal legislation is not insignificant. \nNonetheless, there are several reasons why I believe this approach is \nappropriate in this content. First, there has been an endless cycle of \nlitigation over water operations in the Middle Rio Grande. We simply \nneed some level of certainty for water users if we are to proceed to \naddress the long-term requirements of the ESA. Second, it is important \nto keep in mind that compliance with the biological opinion not only \nensures compliance with the ESA, but should serve to improve water-\nsupply and habitat conditions in the Middle Rio Grande. The Biological \nOpinion contains a reasonable and prudent alternative, or ``RPA'', that \nemphasizes a broad approach to conserving endangered species in the \nMiddle Rio Grande. It requires minimum river flows based on the annual \navailable water supply, and includes spring releases to trigger silvery \nminnow spawning activity. The RPA also contains No. 1, requirements for \nsignificant habitat improvements, including fish passage at the San \nAcacia diversion dam; No. 2, population enhancement activity; and No. \n3, water quality improvements in the basin.\n  As a fall-back, to ensure continued survival of the silvery minnow if \nthe RPA does not significantly improve its status, the legal coverage \nprovided by the biological opinion lapses if minnow mortality exceeds \nthe limits defined in the opinion's incidental take statement. In that \nevent, the Federal agencies will need to re-consult with the U.S. Fish \n& Wildlife Service to ensure that the survival of endangered species is \nnot jeopardized.\n  As a final matter, although I believe that the approach in Section \n205 will maintain progress in recovering the minnow, mere compliance \nwith the biological opinion is not the end of the story. I also expect \nthat the Secretary of the Interior will aggressively pursue other \nactions to promote the recovery of endangered species in the Middle Rio \nGrande, including support for the efforts of the Middle Rio Grande ESA \nCollaborative Program. The Collaborative Program has been very \nsuccessful in bringing together a diverse group of parties to work \ntowards common restoration goals in the Middle Rio Grande. It will \ncontinue to be key to the recovery effort and I will continue to \nsupport funding its work.\n\n  Before yielding the floor, I want to specifically address some \nongoing concerns with Section 205. First, Governor Richardson in New \nMexico has been working with all the parties to the ongoing litigation \nto try and develop a comprehensive settlement to the difficult issues \nin the Middle Rio Grande. That settlement, while not yet secured, is \nwithin reach. If finalized, it will likely address a broader range of \nissues than the approach in Section 205. The concern being expressed is \nwhether the Section 205 could be modified to accommodate legislation \nassociated with any potential settlement. I want to ensure Governor \nRichardson and the parties at the table that I will remain open to \nconsider any settlement proposal that may be developed as part of that \nprocess. A more comprehensive solution, particularly one developed by \nall the parties together, is a preferred approach that deserves \nsubstantial attention and consideration.\n  The Middle Rio Grande Pueblos have also expressed concern that their \nwater supplies are not protected in Section 205. On this point, I think \nit is clear that the Tenth Circuit's decision does not provide any \nbasis for the Secretary of the Interior to assert discretion over the \nPueblos' available water supply and unilaterally reallocate such water \nfor endangered species purposes. The Pueblos' legal status is different \nfrom the project contractors covered by the Tenth Circuit's decision. \nIn fact, it is highly questionable whether any provision of law gives \nthe Secretary discretion over the Pueblos water similar to that \ndetermined by the Tenth Circuit. Nonetheless, it is premature to \nconclusively address that issue at this time. I will, however, continue \nto work with the Pueblos, as well as Senator Domenici on this issue, to \ndetermine if a modification to this legislation should be considered.\n  I hope this statement provides a clear explanation on why I am \nsupporting the legislative approach set forth in Section 205.I believe \nthat it is a reasonable response to the issues confronting my state--\nand one that should avoid being the basis for an Endangered Species Act \nfight. I thank Senator Domenici for working with me on this provision \nand I urge my colleagues to support this language.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10897-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n             EXTENSION OF CHAPTER 12 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the majority \nhas finally cleared H.R. 2465, to extend Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy \nCode for another six months. As a consponsor of companion legislation, \nS. 1323, I have been working to get this done ever since the House \npassed its bill on June 23 by a vote 379-3. Chapter 12 expired at the \nend of June. It is unfortunate that it took an entire month for the \nSenate to take up this simple bill that keeps in place special \nsimplified bankruptcy provisions for family matters. But with the \nharvest season just around the corner in many of our States. I am \npleased that the Senate has taken this action. We have helped many \nfarmers who are in difficult financial straits. That is a good thing.\n  It is high time that the Congress made chapter 12 permanent. It has \nbeen in place since the mid-1980s and has worked well. Along with the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, I have championed taking this step \nalong with the number of important improvements to chapter 12, \nincluding adjusting the income limitations for inflation, which has \nnever been done. The major bankruptcy bill that has been before the \nCongress for a number of years includes those improvements. I oppose \nthe overall bankruptcy bill, but I believe that the provisions dealing \nwith chapter 12 can and should be passed independently. Family farmers \nin difficult financial situations deserve our support. I applaud the \nSenate for finally passing this short extension, and I hope we will \nmake chapter 12 permanent before the end of the year, when another \nextension will be necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10897-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10897-S10898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                       PASSAGE OF THE ENERGY BILL\n\n Mr. KERRY. Although I was not present to vote on the Energy \nbill passed last night, I would like the Record to reflect my \nopposition to the bill and the process by which it was passed.\n  I voted for the Democratic Energy bill, H.R. 4, last Congress. When \nthe same bill came up for a vote last night as S. 14, I was announced \nagainst it. The reason is that debate on the Energy bill was closed \ndown prematurely before consideration of important provisions such as \nrenewable portfolio standards, clean air standards, and climate change \ncould even take place.\n  Furthermore, there is no indication that the Senate and House \nconference committee is going to lead to any type of meaningful \nbipartisan negotiations. In fact, the Republican leadership has already \nboasted they will do little if anything to defend the Senate position.\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\nInstead, they have announced that intention to rewrite the bill in \nconference. Apparently the Senate process has little meaning in this \nregard. It was just a ticket to a conference committee and a free hand \nin drafting a partisan bill.\n  The Nation needs a progressive, forward-looking energy policy that \nstrengthens our national energy security, safeguards consumers and \ntaxpayers, and protects the environment. Unfortunately, I believe \npassage of this legislation has put us on a fast track towards creation \nof an extreme Energy bill in conference that abandons each and every \none of those core principles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10898-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                    OUR DEMOCRACY, OUR AIRWAVES ACT\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators John McCain and Russ Feingold, in introducing S. 1497, the Our \nDemocracy, Our Airwaves Act of 2003. This legislation complements the \nreforms accomplished through the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 \nby addressing an essential element omitted from the law: the demand \nside of fundraising.\n  As I emphasized during the Senate debate two years ago, simply \ndealing with the supply side of political campaigns--the sources of \ncampaign contributions--misses the point. If we truly want to reform \npolitical campaigns in America, we must address the role of television. \nTelevision was once a tiny part of political campaigns, but it has \ngrown exponentially.\n  Spending on television in political campaigns has skyrocketed. The $1 \nbillion spent in 2002 by candidates, parties, and issue groups for \npolitical spots set a record for any campaign year and doubled the \namount spent in the 1998 midterm election. It represented a four-fold \nincrease in what was spent in 1982, even adjusting for inflation. What \nwe are witnessing is ever more intensive efforts by candidates of both \npolitical parties to raise money for television and radio stations to \ndeliver their messages to the American people.\n  What is often overlooked in this discussion is that the airwaves \nbelong to the American people. Broadcasting stations are trustees of \nthe lucrative electromagnetic spectrum. Broadcasters pay nothing for \ntheir exclusive licenses and are allowed to use the publicly-owned \nairwaves on one condition: that they serve the public interest.\n  Since 1971, Federal law has required that in the 45 days preceding a \nprimary election and the 60 days prior to a general election, \ncandidates are entitled to the lowest unit charge for broadcast media \nrates for the same class and amount of time for the same period. But \nfor all practical purposes, this mandate has been meaningless. In order \nto secure their preferred time slots and guarantee that their ads are \nnot bumped to a less desirable time, many candidates in competitive \nraces end up paying premium prices instead of the lowest unit charge.\n  Television stations have taken this law, intended to benefit public \ndiscourse and to ensure that candidates are not penalized prior to an \nelection, and have turned it upside down. Candidates end up paying \ndramatically more than the lowest unit rate. And as the costs to \ncampaigns balloon, candidates, incumbents and challengers alike, must \nscramble for funds so they can give them right back to the television \nstations.\n  A $200,000 media program buys a few 30-second slivers of time to \ndeliver ideas and views on the public airwaves. It takes just a moment \nto broadcast it, and if a viewer-voter gets up to get a sandwich in the \nkitchen when it airs, they miss it. But raising the funds to pay for \nthe ill-fated spot still requires asking 4,000 people to make a $50 \ncampaign contribution. As former Senator Bill Bradley observed several \nyears ago: Today's political campaigns are collection agencies for \nbroadcasters. You simply transfer money from contributors to television \nstations.\n  And as time ticks down to election day and the demand for television \nads goes up, the stations raise their rates dramatically. Not only are \nrate costs for political ads inflated, stations are not covering the \ncampaigns in their news segments in any significant way. Last week, \nfindings from two instructive studies were published, which amplify \nthese problems and underscore why enacting the Our Democracy, Our \nAirwaves Act is so important.\n  A study published by the Alliance for Better Campaigns based on a \nsurvey of more than 37,000 political ads on 39 local television \nstations in 19 states found that the average price of a candidate ad \nrose by 53 percent from the end of August through the end of October of \nlast year. According to findings in another nationwide survey released \nlast week by the Lear Center Local News Archive, a collaboration \nbetween the University of Southern California Annenberg School's Norman \nLear Center and the Wisconsin NewsLab at the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison, viewers looking for campaign news during the height of the \nelection season last year were four times more likely, while watching \ntheir top rated local newscast, to see a political ad rather than a \npolitical story. At the same time, those stations took in record-\nbreaking amounts of political advertising revenue.\n\n  The Our Democracy, Our Airwaves Act addresses these concerns in three \nways. First, it requires that television and radio stations, as part of \nthe public interest obligation they incur when they receive a free \nbroadcast license, air at least two hours a week of candidate-centered \nor issue-centered programming during the period before elections. \nSecond, it enables qualifying federal candidates and national parties \nto earn limited ad time by raising funds in small donations. Up to $750 \nmillion worth of broadcast vouchers would be made available to be used \nto place political advertisements on television and radio stations in \neach two-year election cycle. As conceived in our bill, this system \nwill be financed by a spectrum use fee of not more than one percent of \nthe gross annual revenues of broadcast license holders. And third, it \ncloses loopholes in the ``lowest unit rate'' statute in order to ensure \nthat candidates receive non-preemptible time at the same advertising \nrates that stations give to their high-volume, year-round advertisers.\n  Until we get to the heart of what is driving up the cost of political \ncampaigns, we cannot achieve real campaign finance reform. And at the \nheart of skyrocketing campaign costs is the cost of television. Our \nlegislation will help reduce the amount of money in politics by making \nthe public airwaves more accessible for political speech. The airwaves \nbelong to America and to the taxpayers, and the network stations simply \nmust give time back to challengers and incumbents across the United \nStates if we're going to succeed in putting a stop to the money chase \nand the millions of dollars being spent on campaigns.\n  Only by providing candidates an opportunity to purchase time at \naffordable rates and imposing a modest and reasonable obligation on \nbroadcasters to air at least two hours per week of candidate or issue-\ncentered programming in the weeks before election day can we hope to \nreturn Our Democracy, Our Airwaves to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10898-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF DANIEL BRYANT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, today I recognize the centennial \nof Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, KS. The institution that is \ntoday Pittsburg State University opened its doors on September 8, 1903, \nin a borrowed building in downtown Pittsburg with 54 students and five \nfaculty. From these humble beginnings, Pittsburg State University has \ngrown into a comprehensive state university of regional, national and \ninternational stature.\n  In 1903, the fledgling school offered only elementary courses in \nmanual training, domestic science, domestic art, and a few basic \nacademic subjects. Yet by 1912 the school's enrollment had increased to \n1,183 students and it was described as a ``College for Teachers.'' In \nthe coming years, dedicated administrators and faculty worked to raise \nthe standards of the institution to the point that it merited and \nreceived recognition as a liberal arts college.\n  Following World War II, the campus grew rapidly. Soldiers returning \nfrom the war came in droves, thanks to the G.I. Bill, and new buildings \nemerged all over campus. The college's mission and enrollment continued \nto expand as well. In 1977, the college achieved university status and \nassumed its current name, Pittsburg State University.\n  The decade of the 1990s was a time of unprecedented growth of PSU. \nEnrollment passed the 6,000 mark for the first time in 1991. Major \nadditions ranged from a renovation and expansion of the football \nstadium to the addition of a 100,000-watt public radio station and the \ninstallation of a world-class mechanical organ in McCray Hall. In 1997, \nthe university completed its largest single capital project with the \nconstruction of the Kansas Technology Center, a $28-million facility to \nhouse the university's nationally recognized technology programs. The \nKansas Technology Center continues to play a vita role in the \nuniversity's growth and development and is a significant economic \ndevelopment tool for the four-state region.\n  As it celebrates its centennial, Pittsburg State University now has \nan enrollment of more than 6,700 students. The university offers a wide \nvariety of highly regarded programs in its Colleges of Business, Arts \nand Sciences, Education and Technology. Known as a comprehensive \nregional university serving Kansas and the four-state region that \nincludes Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas, Pittsburg State attracts \nstudents from more than 25 states and 40 countries.

BRENT McKNIGHT TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE \n                   WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that last night \nthe Senate voted to confirm Brent McKnight, an outstanding North \nCarolina lawyer and jurist, to the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina.\n  Judge McKnight, currently serving as US. Magistrate, has a stellar \nrecord of achievement and excellence. A native of Mooresville, North \nCarolina, he received his BA from the University of North Carolina \nChapel Hill and his law degree at the University of North Carolina \nSchool of Law. He was a Rhodes Scholar, earning an MA and Diploma in \nTheology at Oxford University.\n  Judge McKnight served as Assistant District Attorney for the State of \nNorth Carolina from 1982 through 1988, when he was elected District \nCourt Judge for the 26th North Carolina Judicial District. During this \ntime, we in North Carolina first saw the superior qualities that Judge \nMcKnight brought to the bench--temperance, fairness, attention to \ndetail and an abiding commitment to and concern for equal justice under \nthe law. In fact, after just four years on the bench, Judge McKnight \nreceived a 97% approval rating from attorneys polled by Court Watch of \nNorth Carolina.\n  After four years of exemplary service on the North Carolina state \ncourt, Judge McKnight was appointed a United States Magistrate in May \n1993. Judge McKnight has continued to build his reputation as an \noutstanding judge, earning the respect of lawyers and litigants \nthroughout the state.\n  I can't tell you how many calls and letters I have received from \npeople from across North Carolina telling me what an exceptional jurist \nand person Brent McKnight is. These folks attest to Judge McKnight's \nimpeccable legal professionalism, both as a prosecutor and a Judge. I \nhave no doubt that Judge McKnight will continue this record of \nexcellence as a United States District Judge.\n  I was delighted to wholeheartedly support the nomination of Brent \nMcKnight and am pleased that the full Senate has confirmed him to the \nUnited States District Court for the Western District of North \nCarolina. I wish him and his family--his wife Beth and their three \nboys, Brent, Matthew and Steven--well as he embarks on this next phase \nof his admirable career. I am confident that Judge McKnight, a \nconsensus nominee who represents the mainstream of our state, will \ncontinue to serve the people of North Carolina and the United States \nwith distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10899-3", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10899-S10900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MYRA HYDE\n\n Mr. BOND.

A native Georgian, President \nGogue received his doctorate in horticulture from Michigan State \nUniversity. He then held many significant positions including: chief \nscientist for the National Park Service, vice president for research at \nClemson University and provost at Utah State University.\n  From the outset, President Gogue's highest priority has been \nincreasing academic opportunities for New Mexico State University \nstudents and faculty. Under his outstanding leadership, the university \nexpanded distance education programs, increasing enrollment by about 70 \npercent last year. Additionally, President Gogue encouraged private \ndonations, considerably increasing funds for the university. \nRecognizing the long-term benefits of solid relationships within the \nlocal and state arenas, he built strong associations between the \nuniversity, alumni and the New Mexico legislature.\n  Throughout his tenure at New Mexico State University, President Gogue \nhas continually been an exceptional, consummate leader and tireless \nadvocate for New Mexico State University; his accomplishments will be \nlong remembered. I wholeheartedly thank him for his dedication and wish \nhim well in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10900-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BIRTHDAY GREETINGS TO LINDA MAXWELL ROBERTSON\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nextend warm birthday greetings to a constituent of mine, Linda Maxwell \nRobertson. Linda will be turning 50 on September 1st.\n  Linda is an unusual woman who pursued a career in commercial film \nproduction in New York City right out of high school. She started as a \nproduction assistant and rapidly rose through the ranks so that, at the \n``ripe old age'' of 26, she co-founded her own production company with \na partner, Mark Ross. Within a few years, her company had annual \nbillings in excess of $8 million. Later, Linda established a commercial \nproduction company in New York for noted Hollywood directors Ridley and \nTony Scott and Patrick Morgan. Linda is a Past President of the East \nCoast Chapter of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers, \nAICP, and a current member of the Directors Guild of America.\n  In addition to her work-related responsibilities, Linda served as a \nmedia consultant to the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and was the \nExecutive in Charge of Production for the United Nations' worldwide \ncampaign to celebrate its 50th anniversary. In that capacity, she \nproduced commercials in North America, South America, England, \nThailand, South Africa, Mozambique, Australia, and the Czech Republic.\n  These accomplishments would be enough to satisfy most people, but not \nLinda! In her mid-40s, she went to college to New School University, \nwhere our friend and former colleague, Bob Kerrey, now serves as \nPresident. Linda earned her Bachelor's degree in Psychology in 2000, \ngraduating with a 3.9 grade point average, GPA. While she was earning \nher BA, Linda started Black/Max Productions with her friend, Ann Black. \nThe two of them are busy developing innovative and educational \nchildren's programming.\n  In July 2000, Linda and her husband Mike, daughter Charlotte, and dog \nSally moved to Newport Beach and now live in Laguna Beach. At present, \nLinda is a few semesters shy of earning a Master's degree in clinical \npsychology from Pepperdine University's Graduate School of Education \nand Psychology. This September, she'll begin work as a trainee in \nmarriage and family therapy at Pepperdine's Community Counseling \nCenter. She is currently working as head of marketing and special \nevents coordinator at the Cannery Restaurant in Newport Beach.\n  Linda finds the time, somehow, to get her poetry published and to be \nactive in charitable affairs in her community and at St. Margaret's \nEpiscopal School in San Juan Capistrano, where her daughter Charlotte \nwill be entering the 10th Grade this fall. Meanwhile, her husband Mike \nis Creative Director at Heil-Brice Retail Advertising, HBRA, in Newport \nBeach and the two of them are on the brink of opening one or more \n``It's a Grind'' coffee shops in Orange County.\n  I know that Linda is an inspiration to all who know her, especially \nher family--her younger brother, Gray, served as my legislative \ndirector for two years. It's a pleasure to send her birthday greetings. \nI could tell her to keep up the great work, but I don't think it's \nnecessary!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10900-3", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced \nthe Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in \nManchester, NH. On October 15 and 16, 2001, a 43-year-old woman bumped \nand elbowed her Muslim neighbor while the two women passed in the \nstairwell of their apartment building. The victim fell, bruising her \nelbow and hip. On the previous day, the woman approached her Muslim \nneighbor, pushed and harassed her with insults and epithets, calling \nher ``Middle East Trash'' and ``terrorist.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10900-4", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10900-S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF RACHEL M. CLEMENTS AND LEAH M. CROWDER\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work \nand inquisitive spirit of two young New Mexicans: Rachel Clements and \nLeah Crowder. These two home-schooled eighth graders from Albuquerque, \nNM, captured top honors at the Northwestern New Mexico Regional Science \nFair for their project: ``The Effect of Bosque Fires on Saltcedar \nGrowth.''\n  As we all know, science fairs are held every year, in nearly every \npart of the Nation. Likewise, there are many remarkable projects \nexhibited at these events. The Clements-Crowder project focused on a \nscientific issue that is of great concern to New Mexico: the tamarisk \nplant, also known as saltcedar. They conducted their study over the \nspan of 2 years, and their results are noteworthy.\n  On the west side of the Rio Grande, Rachel and Leah enthusiastically \nsought to understand how cottonwood canopies affect saltcedar growth \nand explore the usefulness of prescribed burning as a means of \neradication. Their findings showed that more saltcedars grew in burned \nthan in unburned areas. The results of their project reinforce the \nnecessity of moving quickly to restore the hundreds of acres of the \nBosque that were recently burned.\n  While visiting our Nation's Capital this past month, they were kind \nenough to share their findings with me. While further study is \nnecessary to verify them, their conclusions add to the knowledge \nnecessary to deal with this threat to our water. This is the sort of \ninformation that I hope my bill, the Saltcedar Control Demonstration \nAct, will uncover and put to use. We must discover the best ways to \neradicate this invasive species, as it will help New Mexico to conserve \nits most precious resource, water.\n  As those of us who reside in the Southwest are well aware, water is \nscarce. On the other hand, saltcedar is an exotic, invading water \nthief. The majority of the large rivers and tributaries within the \nState have become overrun with saltcedar which drives out desirable \nvegetation and reduces the ability of riparian areas and waterways to \nprovide habitat diversity for wildlife. These invaders must be dealt \nwith decisively and quickly.\n  Through their curiosity and keen sense of purpose, Rachel and Leah \nhave provided insight into a devastating problem for New Mexico. In a \nsense,\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\nthey have issued an even bigger challenge to address the saltcedar \nproblem. I am proud of these two young people, and I salute their \npursuit of knowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10901-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OXFORD UNIVERSITY AWARDS JOHN BRADEMAS HONORARY DEGREE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I was among a number of former \nRhodes Scholars present on July 3, 2003 at the Sheldonian Theatre in \nOxford, England, when our distinguished former colleague in the House \nof Representatives, John Brademas, was awarded the honorary degree of \nDoctor of Civil Law by Oxford University. Dr. Brademas, who served in \nthe House of Representatives from 1959 to 1981, 22 years, the last 4 as \nmajority whip, represented the then Third District of Indiana.\n  Described in the degree citation as ``a man of varied talents and \nextraordinary energy, the most practical of academics, the most \nscholarly of men of action,'' Dr. Brademas was praised for sponsoring \nlaws in Congress ``which gave important support to colleges, libraries \nand cultural activities'' and for promoting ``legislation to help the \nweak by Federal subventions for those in need.''\n  The citation, presented by Oxford University's new Chancellor, Chris \nPatten, also hailed Dr. Brademas, who served as President of New York \nUniversity from 1981 until 1992, on having become ``president of one of \nthe greatest universities'' and for ``collecting enormous sums of \nmoney'' for NYU.\n  Read in Latin by Oxford's Public Orator, the citation noted that Dr. \nBrademas had studied at Harvard, earned a Ph.D. at Oxford with a study \nof Spain and, ``mindful of his Greek ancestry, is a founder of the \nCenter for Democracy and Reconciliation in Southeast Europe.'' Said \nChancellor Patten, in presenting the degree to Dr. Brademas:\n\n       You have had an outstanding career; you have played a \n     distinguished role in political life, while for the academy \n     you have caused a golden stream of benefaction to gush forth.\n\n  In commenting on the award, John Sexton, current President of New \nYork University, said:\n\n       John Brademas shaped the transformation of NYU into the \n     great university it is today. He came to us already a world \n     citizen and he made us a world university. And today, as our \n     President Emeritus, he continues to play a major role through \n     his counsel and his enormous efforts on our behalf.\n\n  Dr. Brademas was the only American so honored by Oxford during \nceremonies marking the Centenary of The Rhodes Trust, which administers \nthe Rhodes Scholarships. The other former Rhodes Scholars awarded \ndegrees were Robert J. L. Hawke, former Prime Minister of Australia; \nRex Nettleford, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of the West \nIndies; and David R. Woods, Vice-Chancellor of Rhodes University, South \nAfrica.\n  A graduate, B.A., magna cum laude, of Harvard University, Dr. \nBrademas studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, from 1950 to 1953.\n  Having myself enjoyed the great experience of studying at Oxford \nUniversity on a Rhodes Scholarship, I naturally take pride in the \nachievements of John Brademas. I am sure that members of both the \nSenate and House of Representatives, on both sides of the aisle, join \nme in congratulating our former colleague on this high honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10901-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PINEWOOD DERBY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to \nrecognize the 50th Anniversary of the Pinewood Derby. In 1953, Donald \nMurphy of Torrance, CA, initiated the first Pinewood Derby, an activity \nthat has been enjoyed by millions of Cub Scouts and their families to \ndate.\n  Mr. Murphy devised a miniature race car from a block of pinewood and \nasked his employer, the North American Aviation, to sponsor a race of \nthe miniature cars for his son's Cub Scout troop. He hoped the event \n``would foster a closer father-son relationship and promote \ncraftsmanship and good sportsmanship through competition.'' The \nPinewood Derby quickly became a staple event for Cub Scout Packs.\n  Today, Pinewood Derbies are fun family endeavors that encourage \ncreativity, develop skills, and promote teamwork. At each race, cars \nwith unique paint jobs and designs demonstrate the pride and sense of \naccomplishment that participants have in their Derby entries.\n  As the ``father'' of the Pinewood Derby, Mr. Murphy can be proud that \nthe Derby has enriched the lives of children and families across the \ncountry for half a century. Please join me in recognizing the Pinewood \nDerby and Mr. Murphy's role in its success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10901-3", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ORANGE HIGH SCHOOL AND 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                     ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to reflect on the proud \nhistory of Orange High School, which is celebrating its centennial this \nyear. This is a particularly special moment because the Orange Unified \nSchool District is also celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.\n  Earlier this summer, more than 220 friends and alumni gathered at an \nevent called ``From Kibby to French'' in honor of the district's first \nsuperintendent, Harold Kibby, and current superintendent, Bob French. \nThe high school and district have come a long way since its humble \nbeginnings many years ago.\n  Orange High School opened in the ``Dobner Building'' on September 21, \n1903 as Orange County's fourth high school. In its first year, it had \nan enrollment of 81 students. A few years later, it moved from the \n``Dobner Building'' to a building at Palm Avenue and Glassell Street, \nwhich is now Chapman University's Wilkinson Hall. It was not until 1953 \nthat it moved to its current site on Shaffer Street.\n  As those close to Orange High School celebrate this special occasion, \nthey can reflect on the school's progress and historical milestones. \nThe school newspaper, ``The Reflector,'' celebrated its first issue in \n1916. The following year, the Class of 1917 painted a large ``O'' on a \nlocal hillside, which started a well-known tradition lasting through \nthe 1960s. 1928 marked the beginning of another famous school practice, \nthe ``Dutch/Irish Days,'' with a basketball game played between \ngraduates of St. John's Lutheran School, the ``Dutch,'' and Orange \nIntermediate School, the ``Irish.'' The game was last played in 1965. \nIn 1970, Orange High opened a stadium in honor of 1912 Olympic champion \nand class of 1911 alumnus, Fred Kelly. On the school's 75th anniversary \nin 1978, a museum opened in the Townsend Room.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks by describing a tradition some \nalumni from the Class of 1943 started about 15 years ago. They started \nto meet for breakfast once a month at Watson's Drug and Soda Fountain, \na place near the ``Dobner Building.'' David Hart, an Orange High \nalumnus, was quoted in the Orange County Register on the centennial as \nsaying, simply, ``We like each other . . . I have breakfast with kids I \nwent to kindergarten with . . . Other schools don't have that.'' This \nunique feeling of closeness and friendship clearly shows the meaning of \nOrange High School its alumni.\n  I congratulate both Orange High School and Orange High School \nDistrict on this important milestone, and wish them many more years of \nsuccess.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10901-4", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10901-S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to reflect on the proud \nhistory of Hollywood High School, which is celebrating its centennial \non September 13. In some ways, Hollywood High School lives up to its \nname. Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, and Lana Turner were on the school's \nroster. Carol Burnett was the editor of the school paper. And scores of \nother celebrities received their education at Hollywood High. Hollywood \nHigh has certainly grown significantly from its humble beginnings.\n  It opened in 1903 on the second floor of a former bakery located on \nHighland Avenue. It had an enrollment of 56 students, and only three \nteachers were on the payroll. Two years later, construction on a Roman-\ntemple style building was underway at the intersection of Sunset \nBoulevard and Highland Avenue, and this is where the school still \nstands today.\n  Over the years, Hollywood High's student population grew to include \nnot\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\nonly Hollywood celebrities, but also leaders in American government, \nand in many other fields. Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher \ngraduated from Hollywood High, as did Judge John Aiso, the first Nisei \nappointed to the federal bench.\n  Hollywood High School provides a myriad of services to students \ninterested in the performing arts. In partnership with Paramount \nStudios, it administers the New Media Academy. Hollywood High also has \na winning debate team, award-winning dance and drill teams, and a \nPerforming Arts Magnet Center.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that Hollywood High has enjoyed a colorful \nand successful history, and I congratulate the school, staff and \nstudents on this special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10902-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF CAMP SAN LUIS OBISPO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to reflect on the 75-year \nhistory of Camp San Luis Obispo in my home State of California. A \ncelebration of this special anniversary will be held on August 22, \n2003. Established in 1928, Camp San Luis Obispo then Camp Merriam has \nserved our state and nation well: as a training site for the California \nNational Guard, as a training and staging base for the U.S. Army during \nWorld War II and the Korean War, and now as the home of the Guard's \nCalifornia Military Academy.\n  Camp San Luis Obispo was established in the years following World War \nI, when it was recognized that a training site for the Guard was \nneeded. The federal government began using the camp just before World \nWar II. The camp was active throughout the war, and by the end of the \nwar in 1944, it had expanded to 15,433 acres and had the ability to \nserve more than 20,000 troops. During the Korean War, the Army trained \nsoldiers at the Southwest Signal School that opened in 1951.\n  In July 1965, the State of California regained control of the camp. \nWith the closure of California military installations during the past \nten years, the centrally-located Camp San Luis Obispo has served as a \nresource for Guard and Reserve units.\n  During the past 75 years, Camp San Luis Obispo has provided an \nimportant service to the California National Guard and to our nation. \nThis historic camp has served as a training site during some of our \nnation's most difficult national security challenges.\n  I congratulate Camp San Luis Obispo on this milestone, and commend \nthe California National Guard for their noble service over the \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10902-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MAJOR ANTHONY W.

His \nleadership as Wing Executive Officer enabled the Wing Commander to \nfocus his time on combat sorties and the successful delivery of weapons \non target in Afghanistan. He is cited for ``exemplary leadership, \npersonal endeavor, and devotion to duty'' which reflects ``great credit \nupon himself and the United States Air Force.''\n  Major Hamel's accomplishments also show great credit to the Rhode \nIsland Air National Guard and the state of Rhode Island.

Mr. President, late last month South Carolina \nlost one of our most distinguished citizens, and I rise today to salute \nRichard ``Dixie'' Walker.\n  Dixie was a scholar in East Asian studies. He brought an \ninternational studies institute to the University of South Carolina in \nthe 1960s, when such programs were not being offered anywhere in the \nSouth. In the 1980s President Reagan asked him to be the Ambassador to \nSouth Korea, and he was one of the most successful ever.\n  To share with my colleagues just how much Dixie meant to all of us \nback home, I ask that this very eloquent homage to him be printed in \nthe Record. It was written by John McAlister, who studied under Dixie \nat Yale University in the 1950s.\n  The homage follows:\n  Ambassador Richard L. Walker has brought inspiration and irony to all \nwho have had the privilege to be his friend, student, or compatriot in \nthe cause of freedom. He inspired us by his eloquent testimony to the \nuniversal values of freedom, by his articulation of the human anguish \nat freedom's lack, by his insistence on the cultural foundation of \nfreedom, and by his emphasis that freedom depends on our respecting the \ndiversity and dignity of the cultures of humanity. He evoked irony to \nsignal the paradox of life, the necessity for good humor in all things, \nand the need to see things as they really are rather than how they may \nappear.\n  His nickname artfully combined both inspiration and irony. The \noriginal ``Dixie Walker'' was, as those of us old enough to remember \nthat irreverent baseball player, the antithesis of our elegant friend \nand mentor ``Dixie.'' Perhaps that is why our ``Dixie's'' nickname \nseemed so comfortable. It calls attention to the ever present ironies \nand tragedies of life and how they can be surmounted with humor and \nhumility as well as with virtue, excellence, and compassion. He left us \nan enduring legacy of good jokes, profound cultural insights, and \nadmonitions to check our self-assuredness by deeper reflection. The \nnickname ``Dixie'' made the point without heavy handed fanfare.\n  Time has happily eroded the identity of the original profane ``Dixie \nWalker'' and our ``Dixie'' has given a distinguished luster of \nscholarly and ambassadorial dignity to the nickname. Transforming \nseemingly valueless and unfamiliar things into new and greater worth is \nhis legacy that goes far beyond the burnishing of an old nickname into \na mark of honor. The name ``Dixie Walker'' will forever be inseparable \nfrom the dramatic defense and then flourishing of freedom in East Asia \nover the past six decades. Many brave Americans and courageous Asians \nof all cultures and social conditions deserve our reverence for their \nsacrifice and dedication to this still incomplete and perilous cause \nthat at this very hour is threatened by potential nuclear conflict. \n``Dixie's'' legacy in the cause demands to be honored for reasons that \nmay still not be widely understood yet are fundamental to an \nappreciation of his enduring endowment to freedom, not alone in Asia.\n  Conspicuous in our memory is ``Dixie's'' historic ambassadorship to \nthe Republic of Korea, the longest serving in our history, punctuated \nwith tension-filled drama in the aftermath of assassinations, the \nbloody military suppression of a popular uprising, the Soviet \ndestruction of a Korean commercial airliner with total and tragic loss \nof life, and student protests advocating democratic reforms to mention \nonly a few. Navigating the treacherous shoals of the Korean spirit was \nnever expected to be the ideal of a morning calm. In the storms, \n``Dixie'' was a firm unflustered pilot whose navigational \nrecommendations helped steersmen set the course to a safer harbor of \nKorean democracy, to winning the Olympic Games for Seoul, to campuses \nnow filled with free debate, and to a prosperity of today unimagined at \nthe beginning of his ambassadorship.\n  Conspicuous also to us is ``Dixie's'' historic leadership in bringing \nnew\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\nvigor and distinction to one of America's oldest universities. Carolina \nnow has global reach thanks in part to graduates of the Institute of \nInternational Studies that now bears ``Dixie's'' name. These graduates \nnow are leaders in their own right in positions of great responsibility \nin the cause of freedom, endowing their own colleagues, students and \nfriends with the inspiration given to them by ``Dixie Walker.'' Their \nnames may sometimes be awkward for the native Carolina tongue to \npronounce or for the Carolina ear to comprehend. But these \ndistinguished foreign leaders will forever be linked in their hearts \nand spirit to Carolina and to the undying example of their mentor.\n\n  Less widely known than his history-making ambassadorship and Carolina \nleadership is his landmark scholarship on communism in China, the \ncontroversy it sparked a half century ago when it first appeared, the \nfierce criticism he endured, and the rightful vindication he never \nsought and not even grudgingly received. In the winter of 1956-57, the \nYale University Press published ``China Under Communism: The First Five \nYears'' one of the first scholarly analyses of China under Chairman \nMao. The book was the focus of a front page review in the Sunday New \nYork Times Book Review. Praise came from the informed public and was \nwidespread.\n  But there were academic critics who lamented the book as an ``anti-\ncommunist tract.'' At the heart of the controversy was the assertion in \ncertain scholarly quarters that communism in China was legitimate \nbecause it was founded on timeless Chinese cultural traditions. \n``Dixie's'' view was the reverse. He asserted that Maoist \nauthoritarianism would not last precisely because of its attempted \ndestruction of Chinese culture. Twenty years and millions of lives \nlater, ``Dixie's'' view prevailed because Maoism was what he said it to \nbe. Maoism did not outlive Mao. Chinese culture suffered deterioration \nfrom which full recovery will not be quick. Many past and current \nleaders and their families were jailed, some killed. The pain for China \nlingers on but cultural renewal is accelerating. A kind of ``Dixie \nWalker'' focus on underlying fundamentals of culture is steadily \ngaining momentum in music, dance, visual arts, motion pictures, \nscience, religion, and in public debate. China is on its way to new \nlevels of cultural achievement as he said it would when freedom began \nto take hold.\n  Why should the controversy and unpleasantness of China a half century \nago be retold at a time of homage and remembrance? Why not let the past \nremain in the past? After all, a vaunted tradition among Carolina \nnatives is the warning not to look too deeply into the past lest \nunwanted things be found. What is to be gained? An understanding of the \nessence of ``Dixie's'' life and his insights into the character of \nfreedom is what awaits our reflection. What has been true for China is \ntrue elsewhere. Tyrants don't endure. Freedom prevails when peoples \nunite in their common humanity while giving respect and dignity to \nthose things that make them different from one another. Power by the \nfew yields to the freedom of the many when unity is based on cultural \ndiversity and dignity.\n  Brave Americans are once again risking their lives for freedom, our \nown and that of subject peoples, fighting in far off lands whose \ncultures defy our popular comprehension and confound our leader's \npredictions. Our military strength is absolutely indispensable for this \nfight. Alone, it is insufficient. Once again as so frequently over the \npast half century, we find how closely our own freedom is linked to \nlanguages, cultures, religions, family patterns, and traditions that we \ndo not know and for which there has been limited study. What to do? \n``Dixie Walker's'' living legacy will always be there to remind us that \nfreedom is never to be taken for granted and cannot be assured without \nour learning about, understanding, respect, and nourishing of the \ncultures of the human family on which it is founded.\n  Farewell beloved friend! You will live forever in our hearts and \neverywhere that freedom is cherished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10903-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF KEMAPHOOM CHANAWONGSE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I honor the memory of Marine CPL \nKemaphoom Chanawongse, of Waterford, CT, who was killed in action \nearlier this year in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, those of us who are privileged to live in this great \nNation of ours know that its greatness is rooted in its people--people \nwho have come to this country over the years from lands near and far, \nand have succeeded in making extraordinary contributions to their new \nhome. And there is no greater contribution, no greater sacrifice, than \nthe one made by Kemaphoom Chanawongse.\n  CPL Chanawongse, who was known as ``Ahn,'' came to this country from \nThailand with his mother and stepfather when he was just a young boy. \nHe soon learned to speak English, but also retained his native Thai. He \nenjoyed architecture and engineering, and was a budding artist.\n  From the very beginning, Ahn seemed destined to serve his country. \nHis family had a proud tradition of military service--his grandfather \nand his uncle were both veterans of the Thai Air Force, and his \nstepfather served in the United States Navy. Even at an early age, Ahn \nwould dress up in his stepfather's uniform, perhaps knowing that \nsomeday, he would proudly wear one of his own.\n  Ahn graduated from Waterford High School in 1999, and joined the \nMarines shortly afterwards. He served with the 1st Battalion, 2nd \nMarine Regiment, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade. His fellow soldiers \ncalled him ``Chuckles'' for his outgoing personality and sense of \nhumor.\n  When it came to serving his country, though, Ahn was all business. He \nknew that the path he had chosen was a dangerous one, but he also knew \nthat the causes he represented--freedom, democracy, and opportunity--\nwere worth fighting for.\n  Ahn Chanawongse's American dream was a dream cut short--but his story \nis an inspiration to us all. And his bravery, heroism, and valor will \nnot be forgotten.\n  On behalf of the United States Senate, the State of Connecticut, and \nall of America, I offer my deepest gratitude to Corporal Kemaphoon \nChanawongse for his service to the United States of America. My utmost \nsympathies go out to Ahn's mother, Tan Patchem, his stepfather Paul, \nhis brother Kemapawse, and to all of his friends and family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10903-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10903-S10904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HALINA GRABOWSKI\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and remember \nthe life of an extraordinary woman--a woman who experienced events that \nexist to most of us merely as stories in our history textbooks. I am \nproud to call this woman a fellow Ohioan--one who, as a teenager, \nfought in the Warsaw Uprising against the invading Germans.\n  This woman, Halina Grabowski, lived her life with a rare courage and \nloyalty, and her level of service to humanity is something to which we \nall should aspire. Halina recently passed away in Cleveland at the age \nof 75. I would like to share her amazing story with my colleagues in \nthe Senate.\n  Halina was born in 1928 to a homebuilder and his wife in Warsaw, \nPoland. She grew up as one of 12 children living comfortably in the \ncity. However, the outbreak of World War II changed forever the kind of \nlife she and her family knew.\n  The German army swept through Poland in September 1939. As we know \nall too well, the atrocities the Nazis inflicted on the Polish people \nwere truly horrific. Halina and her family were unable to escape the \noccupiers. Her house was burned to the ground and her brother died in \nher arms following a brutal beating by German soldiers. Halina's mother \nwas killed when German planes bombed the church in which she was \nseeking refuge. At this point, most of us would give up--but not \nHalina. In the midst of this devastation, she decided to join the \nresistance movement in Warsaw.\n  The Warsaw Uprising erupted out of the city's ghettoes on August 1, \n1944. After the Jews resisted early efforts to quell the rebellion, \nmasses of German reinforcements entered the city with an order to kill \nall of its inhabitants. Despite the threat, Halina joined the Armia \nKrajowa, or Home Army.\n  Even though the Home Army was greatly disadvantaged, they fought\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\nfiercely and bravely. Halina was assigned to duties as a messenger, \nnurse, and guard. During the resistance, her foot and arm were severely \ninjured by German shells. However, rather than succumbing to her \ninjuries, Halina bandaged herself and returned to her unit. Several \ntimes, she and her comrades escaped enemy troops by crawling through \nsewers and fighting off rats.\n  Despite their courageous efforts, the Home Army eventually ran out of \nfood, medicine, and ammunition. The Germans captured Halina and her \nunit and sent them to concentration camps in Germany.\n  The resistance engaged the German occupiers for 63 days of intense \nfighting--the longest Polish resistance battle fought during World War \nII. In addition to its length, the Warsaw Uprising was the greatest \nmilitary operation undertaken by any resistance movement in Europe at \nthe time. It was an amazing act of courage and overwhelming valor. When \nit was over, more than 200,000 Polish people had lost their lives \nfighting for their freedom.\n  Halina survived the War. She survived the ghetto, the resistance, and \na German concentration camp. Throughout this, she also managed to find \nthe love of her life--George Grabowski. They married in England in 1948 \nafter they left Germany. In 1952, Halina and George moved to Cleveland, \nand although she lived as an American for the next 50 years, her ties \nto her home country were never severed.\n  Halina served as an officer in the Polish American Congress, PAC, an \numbrella organization of 3,000 Polish-American organizations and clubs. \nThe PAC promotes civic, educational, and cultural programs designed to \nfurther not only the knowledge of Polish history, language, and \nculture, but also to stimulate Polish-American involvement in the \nUnited States. Additionally, Halina served as a member of the \norganization of Polish Veterans Combatants and the SPK Polish service \norganization.\n  While much of her new American life was dedicated to Polish causes, \nHalina was also a devoted mother and wife. She had a daughter and a \nson, who she raised while working for twenty years in the payroll \ndepartment of Society National Bank.\n  Halina lived through one of the most harrowing events the world has \never seen. However, she did not let it overwhelm her. Rather, she \ncourageously fought for her freedom and never gave up. Halina was \nawarded Poland's A.K. Cross and four other medals for her service in \nthe Home Army. I offer my condolences to her entire family--especially \nto her husband George; their two children, Theresa and John; and their \nseven grandchildren.\n  Halina Grabowski was an amazing woman--we will never forget \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10904-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BIRUTE SMETONA\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to Birute Smetona--an exceptional woman and an exceptional \nOhioan who passed away recently at the age of 91. Birute was a gifted \nmusician, who lived a life of great courage and perseverance. She was a \nbeloved figure and an inspiration to all who knew her in her Cleveland-\narea community.\n  Birute, born in Subacius, Lithuania, began her distinguished career \nas a concert pianist by soloing with the symphony orchestra in Kaunas--\nthen the capital of Lithuania. She went on to graduate from the \nLithuanian National Conservatory in 1935, where she met her future \nhusband Julius, an athlete and an assistant law professor who was also \nthe son of Lithuania's President Antanas Smetona. After the start of \nWorld War II, she had to leave a respected music conservatory in Paris \nto return to Lithuania with her husband and infant son, Anthony. During \nthe trip, they sometimes had to get off their train and walk alongside \nbecause sections of track had been destroyed as a result of the War.\n  When they arrived in Lithuania, the Smetona family found their native \nland changed. Birute's life, which up until that point may have seemed \nlike a modern-day fairy tale to some, was about to be thrown into a \nstate of upheaval. Amidst the ever-present dangers of a war creeping \ncloser and closer to home, Birute and her family made the difficult \ndecision to leave Lithuania--the home they loved so dearly--in search \nof a better life.\n  Birute and her family left Lithuania in June 1940, just as the Soviet \narmy was entering the country. While Russian troops initially stopped \nthem at the border, they ultimately allowed them to pass into Germany. \nFrom there, the family was constantly on the move, living in \nSwitzerland, France, Spain, and Brazil all in the space of a little \nover a year.\n  Eventually, Birute and her family arrived in Chicago in 1941, before \nfinally settling in Cleveland, where Birute's husband found work as a \nfactory laborer for just 65 cents an hour. The Smetona family was \nliving on the second floor of a house on Ablewhite Avenue when a sudden \nfire consumed it. Tragically, Birute's father-in-law, the former \nPresident Smetona, lost his life in the blaze, unable to escape from \nwhere he lived in a converted attic on the floor above them.\n  These were difficult times for Birute and her family. After all that \nBirute and her family had been through--from having to leave their \nhomeland of Lithuania to losing Julius's beloved father and having \ntheir home destroyed--Birute and her family started over yet again. As \na testament to her strength of character, Birute endured at a point in \nher life when many others less determined and courageous than she would \nhave crumbled under the sheer pressure of all the adversity her young \nfamily suddenly faced.\n  Birute held steadfast, however, and truly flourished in Euclid, Ohio. \nTo help support her family, Birute took buses for a time from her \nfamily's public housing in Euclid to homes in Shaker Heights to give \npiano lessons. But eventually, she was able to build a full schedule at \nher own home. She soon returned to the concert stage and went on to \nperform in major cities, including New York, Chicago, and Washington.\n  In Cleveland, she belonged to and performed for the Fortnightly, \nCecilian, and Music and Drama clubs of Cleveland. While living in \nCleveland Heights, Birute shared her gift with the community and taught \nfor years at the Cleveland Music School Settlement and Ursuline \nCollege. Birute was also a visiting instructor at Youngstown State \nUniversity, Appalachian State University, and the School of Fine Arts \nin Willoughby.\n  While known as a gifted performer, Birute Smetona was also a devoted \nmother and exceptional teacher. Her two surviving sons, Anthony of \nCleveland Heights and V. Julius of Medina, both followed in their \nmother's footsteps to become concert pianists and teachers. Birute was \ndedicated to her students. She taught them to avoid a stiff appearance \nwhen playing by using a supple, flowing motion of hand, wrist, and \nforearm. Most of all, Birute was well known for her unique ability to \nclearly explain difficult musical concepts in a way that even children \ncould understand.\n  Birute was a strong, courageous, and exceptionally talented mother, \ninstructor, and pianist. She was a vibrant member of the Cleveland \ncommunity, and I am proud to honor her life--a 91-year journey and \nadventure. I extend my condolences to her entire family--to her two \nsons, her nine grandchildren, and to all who knew and loved her. She \nwill be truly missed, but will remain forever a testament to the \ncharacter and depth of courage of the Lithuanian community in \nOhio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10904-2", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10904-3", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10904-4", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10904-S10905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 2799.

A bill to provide for secondary school reform, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to introduce a bill \nthat will help America's teenagers graduate from high school, go on to \ncollege, and enter the working world with the skills they need to \nsucceed. I'm proud to introduce the PASS Act--which stands for the \nPathways for All Students to Succeed Act. Today, far too many students \ndrop-out of school and never have a chance for college and a better \nlife. My bill will reach out to vulnerable students during high school \nby providing the training, guidance and resources they need to stay in \nschool and go on to college.\n  Specifically, the PASS Act will: help schools hire literacy coaches \nto strengthen essential reading and writing skills. It will provide \ngrants for high-quality Academic Counselors to ensure each student has \nan individualized plan and access to services to prepare for college \nand a good job. And finally, the PASS Act targets resources to those \nhigh schools that need the most help, so they can implement research-\nbased strategies for success.\n  Many of America's high schools and high school students are in \nserious trouble, and it's only getting worse.\n  With each new school day, 3,000 secondary students drop out of \nschool. This year alone, nearly 540,000 young people will leave school \nwithout attaining a high school diploma. Our Nation's high school \ngraduation rate is 69 percent. And in urban areas, that figure is even \nworse. Many urban school districts graduate fewer than half of their \nstudents. Dropping out has an enormous cost to these students, their \nfamilies and our communities. Sadly, even those students who do receive \na high school diploma are not guaranteed success in college or in life.\n  Many graduate from high school unprepared for the academic rigor of \npost-secondary study. About 40 percent of four-year college students \nand 63 percent of community college students are enrolling in remedial \ncourses in reading, writing, or math when they enter college.\n  And although approximately 70 percent of high school graduates enroll \nin college, only 7 percent from low-income families will have earned a \nbachelor's degree by age 24--in part because they have not been \nproperly prepared for college academics.\n  That's why today I'm introducing a bill to improve our Nation's \nsecondary schools, especially those serving high-need students. First, \nthe PASS Act would ensure that middle or high school students who are \nstill struggling to master literacy will get additional help. About 60 \npercent of students in the poorest communities fail to graduate from \nsecondary school on time, in large part because they don't have the \nreading or writing skills they need. We took a good step in creating \nthe Reading First program to strengthen students' reading skills in the \nelementary grades. These skills are the foundation of their success \nthroughout their academic careers. However, many middle and high school \nstudents struggle with serious reading deficits and substandard \nliteracy skills that have gone unattended for years.\n  The 2002 National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that the \nreading achievement of 12th grade students has declined at all \nperformance levels since 1998. Thirty-three percent of 12th grade boys, \nand 20 percent of 12th grade girls read below the ``basic level.''\n  While the percentage of 4th and 8th graders writing at or above a \nbasic level has increased between 1998 and 2002, the percentage of 12th \ngraders writing at or above basic has gone down.\n  These numbers show that our concentrated efforts for elementary and \nmiddle school students have improved their writing skills, but by \nneglecting the needs of secondary school students. We are squandering \nthese gains.\n  In response, Title I of my bill creates a $1 billion ``Reading to \nsucceed'' grant program.\n  Building on the strong foundation of the Reading First program, this \ngrant program will establish effective, research-based reading and \nwriting programs for students in our middle and high schools, including \nchildren with limited English proficiency and children with \ndisabilities.\n  These grants will provide resources for schools to hire literary \ncoaches at a ratio of at least one for every 20 teachers. The coaches \nwill help teachers incorporate research-based literary instruction into \ntheir core subject teaching. This will strengthen the reading and \nwriting skills of all students, while identifying and helping those \nstudents whose skills are especially poor. These coaches will assess \nstudents and coordinate services to address significant reading and \nwriting deficits.\n  In addition to hiring literacy coaches, funds can be used to provide \nrelevant professional development, strengthen curricula in secondary \nschools, and implement diagnostic assessments, research-based \ncurricula, instructional materials, and interventions in middle and \nhigh schools.\n  These literacy coaches can help us make sure that no more students \nslip through the cracks because they never learned to read.\n  In addition to strong literacy skills, careful planning, sound advice \nand strong academic support are critical to guiding students to \nsuccess. Too many high school students make it to graduation, only to \nfind that they cannot attend the school of their choice or enter a \nchosen career because they are not prepared. Many high school students \nare floundering--unable to find out what courses they need to take or \nhow they can get past academic or other barriers.\n  Unfortunately, most of our school counselors serve too many students \nwith too few resources. High school counselors work with an average of \n450 students each, making it impossible to guide each individual \nstudent along the pathway to high school graduation and work or \ncollege. Title II of my bill seeks to address this problem by creating \ngrants for thorough, high-quality academic and career counseling for \nour high school students.\n  These grants will cultivate and promote parent involvement in their \nchild's education, and will coordinate support services for at-risk \nhigh school students across the country.\n  This ``Creating Pathways to Success Program'' would complement other \nexisting successful high school programs by providing $2 billion to \nsupport systemic change in the way we guide our high school students to \nsuccess.\n  The funds could be used to hire and train Academic Counselors to work \nwith no more than 150 students each, and to equip these counselors with \nthe time, skills, and resources to work directly with students, \nparents, and teachers to give each student the individualized attention \nand service they need.\n  Academic Counselors will work with students and parents to develop 6-\nyear plans outlining the path each student will take to reach his or \nher goals.\n  They will coordinate new resources with existing ones such as GEAR \nUP, TRIO, Title I, IDEA and Perkins Vocational and Technical Education \nprograms to ensure students receive the services identified in their \nplans and to facilitate a smooth transition to postsecondary education \nor a career.\n  Schools that get these new funds must offer a rigorous college \npreparatory curriculum to all students, including access to Advanced \nPlacement or International Baccalaureate courses.\n  Working together we can make sure that our adolescents graduate \nprepared for any dream they may choose to pursue.\n  Finally, my bill includes a third title called ``Supporting \nSuccessful High Schools'' to ensure that we take action to help turn \naround our low-performing high schools.\n  Approximately 10 percent of the schools which have been identified so \nfar as ``in need of improvement'' according to the requirements of No \nChild Left Behind are high schools.\n  In about 1100 high schools, 75 percent or more of the students \nenrolled are living in poverty.\n  Despite these numbers, most reform efforts are focused on elementary \nschools. We've overlooked struggling middle and high schools.\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\n  Under the No Child Left Behind Act, Title I funding should be used to \nhelp all schools that need improvement, but high schools receive only \n15 percent of Title I funds, even though they enroll 33 percent of low-\nincome students.\n  Until Title I is fully-funded, it is unlikely that high schools will \nreceive a significant amount of these funds to address the problems \nthey have identified.\n  Meanwhile, high schools are being held to the requirements of No \nChild Left Behind without a targeted source of funding to turn around \nschools in need of improvement.\n  Our states and districts have worked hard to figure out which high \nschools need improvement the most, and now it's time we improve them.\n  That's why my bill would create a $500 million grant program that \nallows districts to identify, develop, and implement reforms that will \nturn around these low-performing schools.\n  School districts can use funds for research-based strategies and best \npractices that will improve student achievement and bring success.\n  Districts would work with parents, teachers, students and communities \nto choose any effective reform such as small schools, block scheduling, \nwhole school reforms or individualized learning plans.\n  For example, since research shows that small schools enhance student \noutcomes by allowing teachers to offer personalized assistance and \nconnect with students, some districts may reduce the size of low-\nperforming high schools by creating smaller schools or academies within \nlarger schools.\n  Working together, we can do more than identify our schools in need of \nimprovement--we can improve them.\n  In conclusion, the Pathways for All Students to Succeed Act provides \nthe grants America's students need to promote adolescent literacy, \nsupport college and career pathways for all our students, and to \nimprove struggling high schools nationwide.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and \naddressing the needs of our high school students.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1555. A bill to designate certain public lands as wilderness and \ncertain rivers as wild and scenic rivers in the State of California, to \ndesignate Salmon Restoration Areas, to establish the Sacramento River \nNational Conservation Area and Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, history books written about California \nalways comment on the natural beauty of the State because our natural \ntreasures have always been one of the things that makes California \nunique. But that beauty must not be taken for granted. That is why I am \nintroducing the California Wild Heritage Act of 2003 in an effort to \npass the first statewide wilderness bill for California since 1984.\n  I introduced a similar bill last year and was thrilled that the 107th \nCongress passed legislation to designate 56,000 acres of my bill as \nwilderness within the Los Padres National Forest. It was a wonderful \nfirst step. The California Wild Heritage Act of 2003 represents the \nnext step.\n  This legislation will protect more than 2.5 million acres of public \nlands in 81 different areas, as well as the free-flowing portions of 22 \nrivers. Every acre of wild land is a treasure. But the areas protected \nin this bill are some of California's most precious, including: the old \ngrowth redwood forests near the Trinity Alps in Trinity and Humboldt \nCounties; the pristine coastline in the King Range in Humboldt and \nMendocino Counties; the Nation's sixth highest waterfall, Feather \nFalls, in Butte County; the ancient Bristlecone Pines in the White \nMountains in Inyo and Mono Counties; and the oak woodlands in the San \nDiego River area.\n  The bill protects these treasures by designating these public lands \nas ``wilderness'' and by naming 22 rivers--including the Clavey in \nTuolumne County and the Owens in Mono County--as ``wild and scenic'' \nrivers. These designations mean no new logging, no new dams, no new \nconstruction, no new mining, no new drilling, and no motorized \nvehicles. Mining, logging and grazing activities that are currently \npermitted would be allowed to continue.\n  Protection of the areas in this bill is necessary to ensure that \nthese precious places will be there for future generations. Because \nmuch of our state's drinking water supply is made up of watersheds in \nour national forests, this bill also helps ensure California has a \nsafe, reliable supply of clean drinking water.\n  This bill would also mean that the hundreds of plant and animal \nspecies that make their homes in these areas will continue to have a \nsafe haven. Endangered and threatened species whose habitats will be \nprotected by this bill include the bald eagle, Sierra Nevada Red Fox, \nand spring run chinook salmon, among others.\n  In short, this bill preserves, prevents, and protects. It preserves \nour most important lands, it prevents pollution, and it protects our \nmost endangered wildlife.\n  That is why this bill is so widely supported. Thousands of diverse \norganizations, businesses, and others see the importance of this \nlegislation and have given it their support. Additionally, over 400 \nlocal elected officials have voiced support for the protection of their \nlocal areas.\n  Despite the tremendous support for this bill, it is not without \nopponents. They will say this bill is too large and goes too far. Yet \nthis bill is similar in size to other statewide wilderness bills that \nhave already passed Congress. The 1984 California Wilderness Act \nprotected approximately 2 million acres and 83 miles of the Tuolumne \nRiver. A more recent wilderness bill, the California Desert Protection \nAct, protected approximately 6 million acres of desert areas.\n  It is important to note that only 13 percent of California is \ncurrently protected as wilderness. This bill would raise that amount to \n15 percent. During the last 20 years, 675,000 acres of unprotected \nwilderness--approximately the size of Yosemite National Park--lost \ntheir wilderness character due to activities such as logging and \nmining. As our population increases, and California becomes home to \nalmost 50 million people, these development pressures are only getting \nworse. If we fail to act now, there simply will not be any wild lands \nor wild rivers left to protect.\n  The other big question that has been raised is whether this bill will \nlimit public access to these areas. I do not believe this will be the \ncase. While wilderness designation means the wilderness areas are \nclosed to mountain bikers, they remain open to a myriad of recreational \nactivities, including horseback riding, fishing, hiking, backpacking, \nrock climbing, cross country skiing, and canoeing. Mountain bikers and \nmotorized vehicles have 100,000 miles of roads and trails in California \nthat are not touched in my bill. Furthermore, numerous economic studies \nsuggest wilderness areas are a big draw that attract outdoor recreation \nvisitors, and tourism dollars, to areas that have received this special \ndesignation.\n  One important change has been made to the legislation after concerns \nwere raised about wildfire prevention and control near at-risk \ncommunities. The bill I am introducing today protects communities by \nallowing Federal, local and State agencies to perform fire and \nemergency response activities in wilderness areas. I worked extensively \nwith the California Department of Forestry on this legislation, and \nthey have expressed their support for the language in the bill.\n  Those of us who live in California have a very special responsibility \nto protect our natural heritage. Past generations have done it. They \nhave left us with the wonderful and amazing gifts of Yosemite, Big Sur \nand Joshua Tree. These are places that Californians cannot imagine \nliving without. Now it is our turn to protect this legacy for future \ngenerations--for our children's children, and their children. This bill \nis the place to start and the time to start is now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1556. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nrestore, increase, and make permanent the exclusion from gross income \nfor amounts received under qualified group legal services plans; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Legal\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\nServices Benefit Act of 2003. My friends and colleagues from the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senators Breaux, Kerry, Lincoln, Rockefeller, and \nSnowe, join me in introducing this important bill. This bill will amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code to restore and make permanent the exclusion \nfrom gross income for amounts received under qualified group legal \nservices plans.\n  When Congress first enacted Internal Revenue Code Section 120 in \n1976, employers were provided with an incentive to provide their \nworkforce with group legal services benefits at modest cost. These \nbenefit programs enabled employees to contact an attorney and get \nadvice and, if necessary, representation. Most plans covered the \neveryday legal events that we all expect to encounter in life, from \nhouse closings and adoptions to traffic tickets and drafting wills. The \nprovision sunsetted in 1992, however, eliminating this valuable \nbenefits' favorable tax status.\n  Qualified employer-paid plans have proven to be highly efficient. \nThese arrangements make substantial legal service benefits available to \nparticipants at a fraction of what medical and other benefit plans \ncost. For an average employer contribution of less than $150 annually, \nemployees are eligible to utilize a wide range of legal services often \nworth hundreds and even thousands of dollars, which otherwise would be \nwell beyond their means.\n  In addition to the efficiency with which these plans can deliver \nservices, their ability to make preventive legal services available \nresults in additional savings in our economy. Group legal plans give \ninvestors access to legal services before they are induced to make \nunwise investments. Having a lawyer available to review the investment \ndocuments could mean the difference between a comfortable retirement \nand lost life savings. Group legal plan attorneys add a layer of \nsecurity to the system.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant proposal to provide efficient access to our legal system for \nworking Americans.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell, in introducing legislation to grant PNTR \nto Armenia.\n  Since becoming an independent sovereign state in 1991, with the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia has pursued comprehensive \neconomic reforms within a democratic framework. Armenia's accession to \nthe World Trade Organization this year reflects its continuing progress \nin adopting and implementing economic and trade reforms, and it now \nranks 44th among the 161 nations surveyed in the ``2003 Index of \nEconomic Freedom'' that the Wall Street Journal and the Heritage \nFoundation have jointly published.\n  As a one-time Soviet republic, Armenia continues to be subject to the \nfreedom-of-emigration requirements set out in Title IV of the Trade Act \nof 1974, the Jackson-Vanik amendment, and therefore its trade status is \nsubject to annual review by the President. Since becoming independent \nArmenia has annually received the waiver provided under Jackson-Vanik, \nand indeed for the past 6 years Armenia has been found to be fully in \ncompliance with the amendment.\n  So long as Armenia remains subject to the Jackson-Vanik provision, \nthe United States is precluded from extending PNTR status and \nnormalizing U.S.-Armenian trade relations. At the same time, however, \nWTO rules require the United States to grant PNTR to all other WTO \nmembers without condition. Our legislation would resolve this \ncontradiction by authorizing the President to terminate the Jackson-\nVanik provision with respect to Armenia and extend PNTR. Without PNTR, \nneither Armenia nor the United States will be able to realize the full \nbenefits of Armenia's accession to the WTO.\n  PNTR will bring the United States into compliance with WTO rules. And \nit will significantly expand opportunities for bilateral trade between \nthe United States and Armenia.\n  In addition, it will enable Armenia to deal more effectively with the \nchallenges of building a vigorous and prosperous economy, at a time \nwhen 50 percent of the population lives in poverty and the poverty rate \nhas dropped from 55 percent only in the last 2 years. These challenges \nare made all the more daunting by the blockades that Azerbaijan and \nTurkey continue to impose; according to the World Bank, these blockades \nraise the cost of doing business in Armenia by 30 percent. Expanded \nU.S.-Armenian trade will act as a spur to greater economic activity in \nArmenia, which in turn will lead to more and better-paying jobs and \nease the hardships that Armenians confront in their daily lives.\n  The ties between our country and Armenia are strong, and \nnormalization of trade relations will make them stronger still. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1558.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto making progress toward the goal of eliminating tuberculosis, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Inouye, Senator Landrieu, Senator Bingaman, \nand Senator Murray in introducing the ``Comprehensive Tuberculosis \nElimination Act''. With the evolution of modern medicine, especially in \nrecent years, we have the actual opportunity to do that now--eliminate \nthis century-old public health threat in the United States. \nTuberculosis was once the leading cause of death in America. In recent \ndecades, developments in science and public health have transformed \ntuberculosis into a preventable and treatable disease. Yet, every year, \nthousands of Americans still become infected and die from tuberculosis.\n  Experts agree that we have the ability to eliminate it. What's \nlacking is a strong national commitment to do it. More than 50 years \nago, when the first effective drugs to treat TB were introduced and \ncase rates began to decline, we began making slow but steady progress, \nand we might have eliminated it. But instead, the declining number of \ncases led to complacency and neglect. In fact, Federal categorical \nfunding for TB control and prevention was discontinued in 1972, and \nwasn't restored until 1981. Efforts to control the disease broke down \nin many parts of the country.\n  In the late 1980s, cases rose by 20 percent increase in TB and drug-\nresistant strains began nationwide systems for dealing with the \ninfection had been allowed to deteriorate. In New York City alone, more \nthan $1 billion was needed to regain control of TB.\n  After considerable effort, TB control was re-established and rates \nagain began declining. Today, with the low number of infections and the \nexpertise of public health officials, we have the opportunity to \neradicate TB from the Nation once and for all.\n  The Institute of Medicine has developed guidelines to do so, and in \nthis bipartisan legislation, my colleagues and I proposed to implement \nthe guidelines by authorizing $235 million for the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention to expand and intensify our prevention, control, \nand elimination efforts.\n  Our bill also expands support for vaccine development at the National \nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Experts estimate that \n$240 million will be needed to develop a safe and effective vaccine. \nOur legislation authorizes $136 million in 2004 and $162 million in \n2005, with the goal of committing the necessary resources to make the \nvaccine available by 2008 at the latest.\n  We cannot allow tuberculosis to take more American lives when we have \nthe ability to prevent it. It's time for a new and sustained commitment \nto the fight against tuberculosis. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation, and I look forward to its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 1560. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for the work-related expenses of handicapped individuals; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Disable \nWorkers Empowerment. Under current law, millions of disabled Americans \nare unable to claim a tax deduction for many of the expenses they incur \nas a result of their disabilities. This creates a significant barrier \nto their leading productive and rewarding lives through employment. For \nexample, in order to work, an individual who uses a wheelchair might \nneed to hire a personal attendant to provide transportation to and from \nthe job site.\n  At a time when we are doing everything in our power to assist \nindividuals looking for employment, it is counterintuitive to retain \nlegislation that prevents some from seeking employment. While current \nlaw allows a limited deduction for disabled workers' expenses, this \ndeduction is limited to expenses that are necessary for the individual \nto perform work satisfactorily. This means, for example, that a blind \nindividual could only claim a deduction for the cost of using a reading \nservice at the workplace and during normal work hours. In addition, if \nthis individual does not itemize his or her tax returns, the individual \nwould receive no deduction.\n  This legislation would correct this inequity. Under this bill, \nwhether or not the individual itemizes, he or she would be able to \nclaim a deduction for the overtime services that they require, \nregardless of itemizing his or her return. This is just one example of \nthe dozens of, often expensive, services that better enable people with \ndisabilities to do their jobs.\n  I believe we need to do more to encourage individuals with \ndisabilities and the desire to seek out employment. Current law \nperpetuates an iniquity that discourages people from living the fullest \npossible life. I believe this legislation goes a long way in correcting \na shortcoming in current law, and will remove a barrier for millions of \ndisabled workers. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation, and hope to see its passage this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to preserve existing judgeships on the Superior Court \nof the District of Columbia; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that would \npreserve existing seats on the District of Columbia Superior Court. I \nam pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Voinovich and \nDurbin.\n  The Superior Court is the local court of general jurisdiction in the \nDistrict of Columbia. The Associate Judges on the Court are selected \nthrough a two-step review process. When a vacancy on the Court occurs, \nusually because of a retiring judge, the District of Columbia Judicial \nNominations Commission, solicits applicants to fill the vacancy. They \nnarrow the possible number of candidates to three and send those three \nnames to the President. The President then selects one of those three \ncandidates to nominate and sends the nominee to the Senate for \nconfirmation. Existing law caps the total number of judges on the \nSuperior Court at 59.\n  Recently, I was informed that nominations, currently pending in the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, and an additional candidate expected \nto be nominated in the coming months, may not be able to be seated on \nthe Court, even if they are confirmed by the Senate. The three seats \nthat these candidates are intended to fill were left open by retiring \njudges, so they are not new seats on the Court. The cause of this \nunusual problem is the District of Columbia Family Court Act, enacted \nlast Congress. That Act created three new seats for the Family Court, \nwhich is a division of the Superior Court, but failed to increase the \noverall cap on the number of judges seated on the Court. As a result, \nthe Family Court Act effectively eliminated three existing seats in the \nother divisions of the Court, including the criminal and civil \ndivisions.\n  Because of this, the Governmental Affairs Committee currently has \nfour nominations pending for the Superior Court, but only two seats \nleft to fill. I also understand that there is yet another nomination \nexpected in the coming months. Because existing law sets strict \nrequirements on both the D.C. Judicial Nominations Commission as well \nas the White House on how quickly they must process potential \ncandidates and make a nomination, it is unclear whether they have legal \ngrounds to halt their processes. Nor is it clear as to whether, had \nthey known of this problem, they would have had the power to not make \nthe nominations they have already made.\n  This is a highly unusual situation. Mr. President, for this body to \nhave nominations pending before it for which there are no open \npositions. The bill I introduce today would rectify this problem by \namending the District of Columbia Code to increase the cap on the \nnumber of Associate Judges on the Superior Court. This is not intended \nto create new seats on the Court; that was already done when the D.C. \nFamily Court Act was enacted. Instead, this would preserve existing \nseats on the Court and remedy a problem that is effecting not only the \nCourt, but the Senate as well. I believe that it is also important to \nnot only remedy the immediate problem before the Senate, but also to \nensure that all of the divisions of the Superior Court are fully \nstaffed. This is more than just a procedural issue. It is also \nimportant for the citizens of the District of Columbia to know that all \nof the divisions, including criminal and civil, are operating at full \ncapacity. Eliminating existing seats in the criminal and civil \ndivisions will not improve the administration of justice in the \nDistrict, but can only result in increased judicial case-load and \ndelays at the Courthouse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 1562. A bill to amend selected statutes to clarify existing \nFederal law as to the treatment of students privately educated at home \nunder state law; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``The Home School \nNon-discrimination Act'' (HONDA). This bill would clarify several \nexisting Federal statutes which inadvertently exclude home schoolers. I \nam pleased the Senator Allen is joining me in sponsoring this measure.\n  All to often, Federal laws relating to education have left out the \nmillions of children across the Nation who are benefitting from home \nschooling. For example, home schoolers generally cannot qualify for the \neducation savings accounts, unless they live in one of 13 states where \na home school is treated as a private school. Also, home schooled \nstudents have found themselves to be ineligible for student aid in some \ncircumstances.\n  Nearly 2 million American children were home schooled during the \n2000-2001 school year. These are good students who frequently \noutperform their public school peers. For example, in 2002 home \nschoolers as a whole averaged over 70 points higher on the Scholastic \nAptitude Test (SAT). Also, although home schoolers only make up about 2 \npercent of the U.S. school-age population, in 2003 they made up 12 \npercent of the 251 spelling finalists and 5 percent of 55 geography bee \nfinalists.\n  These students consistently score at the highest levels of \nachievement tests and get into some of the best colleges and \nuniversities in our Nation. They are hard working, intelligent, and \nactive in their communities. However, these students may be denied \nservices available to other students because of an oversight in Federal \nlaw. That is not right, and HONDA will rectify the situation. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me and Senator Allen in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a section-by-section analysis of \nHONDA as well as the text of the bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-section analysis\n\n       Sec. 1--Title.\n       Sec. 2--Findings. This section merely states the findings \n     of Congress that parents have the right to home school their \n     children, home schooling is effective, and the Congress and \n     the Courts recognize the right of parents to home school \n     their children. It also states that certain federal laws \n     inadvertently exclude home schoolers, and that these laws are \n     in need of clarification.\n       Sec. 3--Sense of Congress. This section states that it is \n     the sense of Congress that\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\n     home schooling has made a positive contribution to our nation \n     and that parents who choose to homeschool should be \n     encouraged in their efforts.\n       Sec. 4--Clarification of Provisions on Institutional and \n     Student Eligibility Under the Higher Education Act of 1965. \n     To receive federal student aid, both a student and the \n     institution accepting that student must be ``eligible'' under \n     the Higher Education Act. It's been clear since 1998 that \n     home schoolers are eligible, but regulations promulgated in \n     the late 1990's called that eligibility into question. This \n     section would merely clarify that institutions which accepted \n     home schoolers would remain eligible for federal aid.\n       Sec. 5--Clarification of the Child Find Process Under the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Under IDEA, \n     local school officials must seek out students who may qualify \n     for special education services. There is no requirement under \n     current law that forces school personnel to ignore the wishes \n     of the parent and evaluate that parent's child under the \n     child find process when they are found, though. Some schools, \n     however, continue to force parents to submit their children \n     for evaluation, even when those parents intend to home school \n     their children. This section clarifies that if a parent does \n     not give his or her consent, then officials are not required \n     to evaluate their child.\n       Sec. 6--Clarification of the Coverdell Education Savings \n     Account as to its Applicability for Expenses Associated with \n     Students Privately Educated at Home under State Law. This \n     section states that parents would be eligible to use money \n     saved in Coverdell Savings Accounts for qualified home \n     education expenses, just as parents of private and public \n     schooled students can now use that money for qualified \n     education expenses.\n       Sec. 7--Clarification of Section 444 of General Education \n     Provisions Act as to Publicly Held Records of Students \n     Privately Educated at Home Under State Law. The Family \n     Educational Records and Privacy Act makes the records of \n     public school students unavailable to the general public. In \n     many states, though, home schooled students must file \n     information with public education officials. This information \n     is not protected by the Family Educational Records and \n     Privacy Act, even though similar records of public school \n     students are. This section would rectify this situation.\n       Sec. 8--Clarification of Eligibility for Students Privately \n     Educated at Home Under State Law for the Robert C. Byrd \n     Honors Scholarship Program. This section would allow home \n     schooled students to apply for the federally funded Robert C. \n     Byrd Honors Scholarship Program.\n       Sec. 9--Clarification of the Fair Labor Standards Act as \n     Applied to Students Privately Educated at Home Under State \n     Law. This section would allow students who are home schooled \n     to work during traditional school hours. Since home schooled \n     students are not bound by the traditional school day and \n     since many families choose home schooling for its \n     flexibility, it makes sense for the law to accommodate this \n     flexibility. This would not affect any other child labor \n     laws.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \nreport to Congress regarding the ownership and control of broadcast \nstations used to serve language minorities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Clinton and I are proposing \nlegislation to protect the voices of language minorities in our \ncountry. Representative Robert Menendez will be introducing a companion \nbill in the House after the August recess. Our bill is called the \nNational Minority Media Opportunities Act. Its goal is to see that \nAmericans who are members of any ``language minority'' groups under the \nVoting Rights Act--defined as American Indian, Asian Americans, Alaskan \nNatives, and Hispanic Americans--are not injured by excessive media \nconcentration of companies that broadcast primarily in their native \nlanguages.\n  Neither the Federal Communications Commission's new broadcast \nownership regulations adopted on June 2 nor the previous regulations \ndeal with the effects of growing media concentration on citizens \nrelying on minority-language broadcasts for their news and information.\n  The FCC's new rules are already controversial because they allow \nexcessive concentration, in spite of its effect on competition, the \ndiversity of views, and other major national, State, and local \npriorities. Unfortunately, the specific and often more harmful effects \nof such concentration on minority populations have gone largely \nunnoticed.\n  For instance, surveys show that the majority of the nearly 40 million \nHispanic Americans rely significantly on Spanish-language broadcast \nmedia for their news and information. Forty percent--nearly 16 \nmillion--of them rely predominantly on Spanish-language broadcast \nmedia, and 25 percent--nearly 10 million--rely exclusively on it.\n  Additional measures are clearly needed to guarantee that Americans \nwho are members of minority language groups will continue to have \naccess to diverse sources of news, information and cultural \nprogramming, and to opportunities for ownership of their media.\n  Our bill addresses these concerns by requiring the FCC to hold public \nhearings, with notice and opportunity to comment, before approving the \ntransfer of a license for a station serving a minority-language \naudience. It also requires the FCC to report to Congress on issues \ninvolving the concentration of ownership and control of minority-\nlanguage broadcast media and the effects of excessive concentration on \ncompetition and diversity in these minority-language markets.\n  The bill will continue the Nation's strong commitment to competition \nin broadcast media and the fullest possible participation in the \npolitical process for all our citizens, including the growing number of \nthose whose first language is English. We look forward to working with \nour colleagues in Congress to enact this needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1564. A bill to provide for the provision by hospitals of \nemergency contraceptives to women who are survivors of sexual assault; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, every two minutes a woman is sexually \nassaulted in the United States, and an estimated 25,000 annually will \nbecome pregnant as a result of rape. Though there is widespread \nconsensus in the medical community that emergency contraception is a \nsafe and effective means of preventing pregnancy after unprotected \nintercourse, studies indicate that many hospitals still do not provide \nemergency contraception to rape survivors. That is why today, along \nwith my colleagues Senators Kerry, Murray, Durbin, Lautenberg, and \nCantwell, I am introducing the Compassionate Assistance in Rape \nEmergencies Act, or CARE Act, which will ensure that women who are \nsurvivors of sexual assault have access to and information about \nemergency contraception regardless of where they receive medical care.\n  Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs) are the most commonly used \nmethod of emergency contraception. ECPs are birth control pills taken \nin larger doses that can reduce a woman's risk of becoming pregnant by \nup to 95 percent when taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. \nI want to be clear that emergency contraception does not cause \nabortion. Instead, emergency contraception works by inhibiting \novulation or fertilization, or by preventing the implantation of a \nfertilized egg before a pregnancy can occur.\n  Despite the documented benefits of emergency contraception, many \nhospitals neglect their responsibility to offer emergency contraception \nto sexual assault survivors. For example, a survey of emergency rooms \nin New York State found that 54 percent did not consistently provide \nemergency contraception to women who had been raped. In Pennsylvania, \nonly 28 percent of hospitals routinely offer and provide emergency \ncontraception to sexual assault survivors.\n  In short, survivors of sexual assault are not consistently getting \naccess to all the treatment options available to them to prevent an \nunwanted pregnancy. I believe it is unacceptable that a rape victim's \naccess to standard care depends on the hospital to which she is taken. \nAll healthcare institutions that counsel or treat women who have been \nraped should consistently inform, provide or meaningfully refer women \nfor emergency contraception. Indeed, the emergency care standards of \nthe American Medical Association recommend that rape survivors seeking \nmedical care be counseled about their risk of pregnancy and offered \nemergency contraception.\n  The legislation, which is identical to legislation recently \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives James \nGreenwood and Steven Rothman, would require hospitals that receive \nfederal funds to offer information about and access to emergency \ncontraception for victims of rape. This commonsense legislation will \nhelp ensure that women who have survived a heinous sexual attack will \nhave access to comprehensive and compassionate emergency medical care.\n  We must not sit idly by while so many sexual assault victims are not \ngiven the opportunity to safely and effectively prevent a pregnancy \ncaused by their assault. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis effort to help sexual assault victims across the country receive \nthe medical care they need and deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Compassionate Assistance for \n     Rape Emergencies Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become \n     pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest. An \n     estimated 22,000 of these pregnancies could be prevented if \n     rape survivors had timely access to emergency contraception.\n       (2) A 1996 study of rape-related pregnancies (published in \n     the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology) found that \n     50 percent of the pregnancies described in paragraph (1) \n     ended in abortion.\n       (3) Surveys have shown that many hospitals do not routinely \n     provide emergency contraception to women seeking treatment \n     after being sexually assaulted.\n       (4) The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault has been \n     estimated to be 4.7 percent in survivors who were not \n     protected by some form of contraception at the time of the \n     attack.\n       (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n     contraception to be safe and effective in preventing \n     unintended pregnancy, reducing the risk by as much as 89 \n     percent.\n       (6) Medical research strongly indicates that the sooner \n     emergency contraception is administered, the greater the \n     likelihood of preventing unintended pregnancy.\n       (7) In light of the safety and effectiveness of emergency \n     contraceptive pills, both the American Medical Association \n     and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     have endorsed more widespread availability of such pills.\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\n       (8) The American College of Emergency Physicians and the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agree \n     that offering emergency contraception to female patients \n     after a sexual assault should be considered the standard of \n     care.\n       (9) Nine out of ten women of reproductive age remain \n     unaware of emergency contraception. Therefore, women who have \n     been sexually assaulted are unlikely to ask for emergency \n     contraception.\n       (10) New data from a survey of women having abortions \n     estimates that 51,000 abortions were prevented by use of \n     emergency contraception in 2000 and that increased use of \n     emergency contraception accounted for 43 percent of the \n     decrease in total abortions between 1994 and 2000.\n       (11) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n     emergency medical treatment provide emergency contraception \n     as a treatment option to any woman who has been sexually \n     assaulted, so that she may prevent an unintended pregnancy.\n\n     SEC. 3. SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT; PROVISION BY HOSPITALS \n                   OF EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTIVES WITHOUT CHARGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Federal funds may not be provided to a \n     hospital under any health-related program, unless the \n     hospital meets the conditions specified in subsection (b) in \n     the case of--\n       (1) any woman who presents at the hospital and states that \n     she is a victim of sexual assault, or is accompanied by \n     someone who states she is a victim of sexual assault; and\n       (2) any woman who presents at the hospital whom hospital \n     personnel have reason to believe is a victim of sexual \n     assault.\n       (b) Assistance for Victims.--The conditions specified in \n     this subsection regarding a hospital and a woman described in \n     subsection (a) are as follows:\n       (1) The hospital promptly provides the woman with medically \n     and factually accurate and unbiased written and oral \n     information about emergency contraception, including \n     information explaining that--\n       (A) emergency contraception does not cause an abortion; and\n       (B) emergency contraception is effective in most cases in \n     preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex.\n       (2) The hospital promptly offers emergency contraception to \n     the woman, and promptly provides such contraception to her on \n     her request.\n       (3) The information provided pursuant to paragraph (1) is \n     in clear and concise language, is readily comprehensible, and \n     meets such conditions regarding the provision of the \n     information in languages other than English as the Secretary \n     may establish.\n       (4) The services described in paragraphs (1) through (3) \n     are not denied because of the inability of the woman or her \n     family to pay for the services.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) The term ``emergency contraception'' means a drug, drug \n     regimen, or device that is--\n       (A) used postcoitally;\n       (B) prevents pregnancy by delaying ovulation, preventing \n     fertilization of an egg, or preventing implantation of an egg \n     in a uterus; and\n       (C) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n       (2) The term ``hospital'' has the meanings given such term \n     in title XVIII of the Social Security Act, including the \n     meaning applicable in such title for purposes of making \n     payments for emergency services to hospitals that do not have \n     agreements in effect under such title.\n       (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services.\n       (4) The term ``sexual assault'' means coitus in which the \n     woman involved does not consent or lacks the legal capacity \n     to consent.\n       (d) Effective Date; Agency Criteria.--This section takes \n     effect upon the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on \n     the date of enactment of this Act. Not later than 30 days \n     prior to the expiration of such period, the Secretary shall \n     publish in the Federal Register criteria for carrying out \n     this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1565. A bill to reauthorize the Native American Programs Act of \n1974; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, August 11, 2003, will mark the 25th \nAnniversary of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978.\n  I am proud to have served as one of nine original co-sponsors of this \nAct, joining Senators Abourezk, Goldwater, Gravel, Hatfield, Humphrey, \nKennedy, Matsunaga and Stevens to introduce the Joint Resolution on \nDecember 15, 1977.\n  The American Indian Religious Freedom Act states that it is the \npolicy of the United States to preserve and protect the traditional \nreligions of the American Indians, Aleuts, Eskimos and Native \nHawaiians. It was necessary to declare this policy to begin to counter \nthe ill effects that stemmed from the policy of the 1880s to the 1930s \nthat sought to ban the exercise of Native American traditional \nreligions.\n  With the American Indian Religious Freedom Act policy in place, \nCongress built on this foundation to develop more specific legislation \nin 1989 and 1990 to provide for the repatriation of Native American \nhuman remains, sacred objects and items of cultural patrimony that were \ntaken from Native Americans during the time of that Federal policy \nattempted to eliminate the practice of their religions.\n  From time to time, the Congress has also returned certain sacred \nlands to Native Americans for their traditional religious use.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs has been conducting a series of \noversight hearings on Native American sacred places and has found that \nmany of these areas are being systematically damaged and destroyed, and \nNative Americans have no specific statutory authority that would enable \nthem to defend their traditional religious areas in court.\n  I believe that this twenty-fifth anniversary year of the American \nIndian Religious Freedom Act is a fitting time for Congress to amend \nthe Act, to assure that Native Americans have the legal means to \nprotect their places of worship.\n  I believe it is time that we join together in enacting legislation \nthat will fulfill the policy promise of the American Indian Religious \nFreedom Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1566. A bill to improve fire safety by creating incentives for the \ninstallation of automatic fire sprinkler systems; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fire Safety \nIncentive Act of 2003, legislation to improve fire safety and save \nlives by creating incentives for business owners to install automatic \nfire sprinkler systems. This bill would classify automatic fire \nsprinkler systems as five-year property for purposes of depreciation \nunder the Tax Code.\n  In 2001, fire departments across the United States responded to 1.7 \nmillion fires. Not including victims from the September 11 terrorist \nattacks, 3,745 people died in fires, 99 of whom were firefighters. \nFires also caused almost 21,000 civilian injuries and $8.9 billion in \ndirect property damage.\n  On average, fire departments respond to a fire every eighteen \nseconds, with fires breaking out in a structure every sixty seconds and \nin a residential structure every eighty seconds.\n  Recent tragedies have demonstrated how the lack of effective fire \nsafety precautions can have disastrous consequences. In February, 99 \nconcertgoers were killed when a pyrotechnic display erupted into a fire \nthat devastated the concert venue in the deadliest fire in Rhode Island \nhistory. Unfortunately, the building was not equipped with fire \nsprinklers to respond to the fire. In my home state of New Jersey, a \nfire on the campus of Seton Hall killed three college students and \ninjured 58 more people. In response to that tragedy, I introduced the \nCampus Fire Safety Right to Know Act of 2003, S. 1385, which calls for \ndisclosure of fire safety standards and measures with respect to campus \nbuildings.\n  The Fire Safety Incentive Act would go further by providing economic \nincentives to business owners to install automatic fire sprinkler \nsystems.\n  It is difficult to dispute the effectiveness of sprinklers in \ncontrolling fire and saving lives and property. According to the \nNational Fire Prevention Association, over a 10-year period ending in \n1998, buildings with fire sprinkler systems were proven safer. There \nwere 60 percent fewer deaths in manufacturing buildings equipped with \nfire sprinkler systems than in those without. Similarly, in hotels, \nthere were 91 percent fewer deaths in buildings with fire sprinkler \nsystems. In fact, the NPFA has no record of a fire killing more than \ntwo people in a public assembly, educational, institutional, or \nresidential building in which a fire sprinkler system was installed and \noperating properly. The same study showed that property loss from fires \nwas significantly reduced by the presence of fire sprinklers, from a \nlow range of 42 percent in industrial buildings to an impressive high \nof 70 percent in public assembly occupancies.\n  While the effectiveness of fire sprinkler systems is well \nestablished, the major impediment to their widespread use has simply \nbeen their cost. Moreover, many State and local governments lack any \nrequirements for structures to contain automatic fire sprinkler \nsystems.\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\n  This bill would encourage businesses to install fire sprinkler \nsystems by creating tax incentives to do so. Under the current Tax \nCode, assets are classified under different schedules of depreciation. \nThe often-employed ``straight-line'' depreciation method uses an \naverage deduction from year-to-year for 39 years. This legislation \nallows businesses to classify sprinklers under a 5-year schedule, \ncreating a meaningful tax incentive to install automated sprinkler \nsystems.\n  This legislation would save lives and prevent many tragedies. I hope \nmy colleagues will support it, and I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1567. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to improve the \nfinancial accountability requirements applicable to the Department of \nHomeland Security, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Financial Accountability Act. I am \njoined in introducing this legislation by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Akaka, who serves as the ranking member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on Financial Management, the Budget, \nand International Security, which I chair.\n  This bill is a companion bill to H.R. 2886 that Congressman Todd \nPlatts, chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and \nFinancial Management, introduced in the House of Representatives on \nJuly 24, 2003. The House bill has bipartisan support from the \nleadership of the House Government Reform Committee, including Chairman \nTom Davis, Ranking Minority Member Henry Waxman, and the vice chairman \nand ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Government \nEfficiency and Financial Management, Marsha Blackburn and Edolphus \nTowns.\n  The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is included in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as \namended, and is subject to the same audit requirements that currently \napply to over 100 Federal agencies.\n  Improving financial management in the Federal Government to eliminate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, has long been a priority for me. The Chief \nFinancial Officers Act (CFO Act) is regarded as one of the most \nimportant statutes that contributes significantly towards accomplishing \nthis objective. The original CFO Act required 24 Federal agencies to \nsubmit audited financial statements to the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB) and the Congress, thereby improving the accountability of \nFederal agencies to the taxpayer. In the 107th Congress I sponsored the \nAccountability of Tax Dollars Act that extended this audit requirement \nto all Federal agencies with budgets over $25 million, unless the \nOffice of Management and Budget provided a waiver from the requirement. \nPresident Bush signed the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act into law on \nNovember 7, 2002, as Public Law 107-289.\n  As my colleagues may know, an auditor may certify a financial \nstatement as unqualified, also known as a clean audit, or as \nunqualified. An unqualified opinion means that an agency's financial \nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \nposition, results of operations, and cash flows of the agency. A \nqualified opinion contains an exception to the standard opinion, but \nthe exception is not of sufficient magnitude to invalidate the \nstatement as a whole. Finally, an agency may also receive a disclaimer \nof opinion. A disclaimer is the worst case because it indicates that \nthe agency's accounts are in such disorder that the auditor is not in a \nposition to make any certification.\n  This past year we have seen dramatic improvement by Federal agencies \nregarding their financial reporting and audit compliance. In February \n2003, the Office of Management and Budget announced that a record 21 of \nthe 24 CFO Act agencies submitted unqualified financial audits, \nincluding for the first time the Agriculture Department. As a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I raised \nthe issue of financial management with Secretary Ann Veneman at her \nnomination hearing on January 18, 2001, and stressed the importance of \nunqualified opinions. I was, therefore, pleased to see that the USDA \nreceived its first unqualified opinion this year, demonstrating \nremarkable improvement in the department's financial management.\n\n  I also discussed financial management recently with the Department of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Tom Ridge, when he testified before the \nGovernment Affairs Committee on May 1, 2003. At that time, Secretary \nRidge assured me that financial management is a top priority for the \nDepartment, and every effort will be made to comply with the provisions \nof the CFO Act. While Secretary Ridge and the Office of Management and \nBudget have demonstrated their commitment to financial accountability, \nthe bill I am introducing today will ensure that future secretaries and \nfuture administrations also will comply with the CFO Act.\n  The legislation I propose will ensure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is subject to the same financial management requirements as \nall other cabinet departments by accomplishing the following: It will \ninclude the Department in the list of agencies covered by the CFO Act, \nand make necessary adjustments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 so \nthat it is consistent with the provisions of the CFO Act; it will \nensure that the Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is subject to the same requirements as all other similarly \nsituated CFOs in cabinet-level departments by providing that the CFO is \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate; it will require \nthe CFO at the Department of Homeland Security to report directly to \nthe Secretary and be a part of the statutorily created CFO Council; and \nit will require the Department of Homeland Security to include in each \nperformance and accountability report an audit opinion of the \nDepartment's internal controls over its financial reporting.\n  Application of the Chief Financial Officers Act to the Department of \nHomeland Security is essential to ensure that effective financial \nmanagement and reporting requirements are adhered to by the newest, and \none of the largest, cabinet-level departments in the Federal \nGovernment. The Department of Homeland Security is in the process of \nintegrating 22 agencies, many with disparate financial systems and a \nnumber with their own CFOs. Inclusion of the Department within the \nmanagement requirements of the CFO Act will help ensure that the \nfinancial process is properly managed by requiring full financial \ndisclosure of the Department's financial activities. Therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues to support passage of this bill to protect against \nfinancial waste, fraud, and abuse within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1567\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n      SECTION 1.

Mr. President. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee \non Financial Management, the Budget, and International Security, I am \nhonored to work with my colleague Senator Fitzgerald, Chairman of the \nSubcommittee, to introduce the ``Department of Homeland Security \nFinancial Accountability Act.''\n  Our bill would add the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to the \nChief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act), P.L. 101-576. It is a \ncompanion measure to bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2886, introduced in \nthe House on July 24, 2003. Adding DHS would ensure that Congress will \nhave timely and accurate financial information imperative for good \ngovernance of the resources of the Department entrusted to making our \nhomeland safe.\n  The CFO Act recognizes the responsibility of governmental agencies to \nbe accountable to taxpayers. This bill would require the President to \nappoint, subject to Senate confirmation, a Chief Financial Officer for \nDHS, who would report directly to the Director of the Department \nregarding financial management matters. It also requires the DHS CFO to \nbe a member of the CFO Council. This Council is charged with advising \nand coordinating the activities of its members' agencies on such \nmatters as consolidation and modernization of financial systems, \nimproved quality of financial information, financial data and \ninformation standards, internal controls, legislation affecting \nfinancial operations and organizations, and any other financial \nmanagement matters. In addition, the bill would require the DHS CFO to \nprepare and provide for audit, annual financial statements that are \nsubmitted to Congress, which will aid in congressional oversight of the \nDepartment.\n  Although the DHS bill adopted by the Govermental Affairs Committee \nlast year, S. 2452, would have put the new Department under the CFO \nAct, the enacted version of the bill, P.L. 107-296, did not. All other \nFederal departments and major agencies are under the requirements of \nthe Act. Since the passage of the CFO Act in 1990, tremendous \nimprovements have been made in agency financial management. For \nexample, all CFO Act agencies, except for the Department of Defense and \nthe Agency for International Development, achieved clean opinions from \ntheir auditors on their financial statements in fiscal year 2003. \nInitially, none of the agencies were able to do so. Also, the General \nAccounting Office has reported that the number and severity of internal \ncontrol problems reported for CFO Act agencies have been significantly \nreduced. We expect good corporate governance from the private sector; \nwe should also expect good governance from federal agencies.\n  Adding DHS to the CFO Act would also require that it meet the \nrequirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of \n1996 (FFMIA), P.L. 104-208, which mandates that all agencies subject to \nthe CFO Act meet certain financial system conditions. The goal of FFMIA \nis for agencies to have systems that provide reliable financial \ninformation available for day-to-day management.\n  It is our responsibility to ensure the Federal Government is \naccountable to the American taxpayers. I am pleased to join with the \nChairman of our Subcommittee to ensure that DHS has the financial \nmanagement systems and practices in place to provide meaningful and \ntimely information needed for effective and efficient management \ndecision-making.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lott, and \n        Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1568. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify certain provisions applicable to real estate investment \ntrusts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, along with my good friends and colleagues, \nSenators Breaux, Smith, Lott, and Snowe, I rise today to introduce the \nReal Estate Investment Trust Improvement Act of 2003. This legislation \nwould update the tax rules governing real estate investment trusts, \ncommonly referred to as REITs, by making a number of minor but \nimportant changes to remove uncertainties in the law and improve their \ninvestment climate. Identical legislation has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  REITs are publicly traded real estate companies that pass through \ntheir earnings to individual shareholders. Congress originally created \nREITs in 1960 to enable small investors to make investments in large-\nscale, income producing real estate. By doing so, Congress made \ncommercial real estate more accessible, more liquid, more transparent, \nand more attuned to investor interests. REITs have evolved to own \nproperties across the country, including office buildings, apartments, \nshopping centers, and warehouses. As a result, these entities play a \nkey role in helping our economy move forward by promoting investment \nand creating jobs.\n  The Internal Revenue Code includes detailed rules governing the \noperations of REITs, the types of income they can earn, and the assets \nthey hold. Congress last amended these provisions in 1999. The REIT \nImprovement Act is the product of almost two years of discussions with \nthe staffs of the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation on how to find solutions to several thorny problem areas where \nthe rules are in need of clarification or modification.\n  The REIT Improvement Act includes three titles: Title I--REIT \nCorrections; Title II--FIRPTA Corrections; and Title III--REIT Savings.\n  Title I includes several corrections to the REIT tax rules to remove \nsome uncertainties and provide corrections largely arising from \nenactment of the REIT Modernization Act in 1999. Although these \nprovisions have very little effect on revenue to the Treasury, they are \nof considerable importance to REITs because they remove uncertainties \nthat interfere with the efficient operation of their businesses.\n  Because publicly-held REITs have to report quarterly to the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission that they are in compliance with the \nspecialized income and asset tests applicable to REITs, the uncertain \napplication of these tax rules creates greater difficulties in REIT \nbusiness operators than unclear tax rules generally do for other \ncorporations.\n\n  The most important, time-sensitive provision in this title deals with \nwhat is called the ``straight debt'' rule. This rule, which was adopted \nin the REIT Modernization Act of 1999, prohibits REITs from owning more \nthan 10 percent of the value of any other entity's securities. Although \nthis rule was intended to prevent REITs from owning more than 10 \npercent of the equity of another corporation, as drafted the rules \npotentially apply to many situations when individuals and businesses \nowe some sort of debt, ``security'' defined broadly, to a REIT.\n  There are many situations in which REITs make non-abusive, ordinary \nloans in the course of business for which they could face loss of REIT \nstatus because the loans do not qualify as\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\n``straight debt.'' The most common context for this situation is in the \nREIT's relationship with its tenants. For example, the REIT might lend \nthe tenant money for leasehold improvements. In some circumstances such \na loan could represent more than 10 percent of the tenant's total debt \nobligations. In such a case, although the amount owed could be small, \nit could lead to REIT disqualification. The bill we are introducing \ntoday would exempt from the 10 percent rule certain categories of loans \nthat are non-abusive and present little or no opportunity for the REIT \nto participate in the profits of the issuer's business. This includes \nany loan from a REIT to an individual or to a government, and any debt \narising from a real property rent arrangement.\n  Other provisions in this title clarify the related party rent rules \nthat limit the amount of space a taxable subsidiary may lease from its \nparent REIT, update the hedging definitions in the REIT rules, remove a \nsafe harbor protection for a taxable subsidiary providing customary \nservices to a REIT's tenants, and restore a formula for imposing a tax \non REITs that fail to meet the 95 percent gross income test.\n  Finally, the bill would modify a safe harbor to the prohibited \ntransaction rule that imposes a 100 percent tax on the income REITs \nearn from sales of ``dealer property.'' Currently, the safe harbor is \nlimited to sales of property held for the production of rental income \nthat meet a series of tests. The change proposed in this title would \nextend the safe harbor to other REIT property, not just that held for \nthe production of rental income.\n  Title II of the bill would modify the Foreign Investment in Real \nProperty Tax Act (``FIRPTA'') to remove barriers to foreign investment \nin REITs. Today, there is very little foreign investment in REITs. We \nunderstand that U.S. money managers routinely receive assignments to \nplace foreign investment capital in the United States under which they \nhave complete discretion to invest in any U.S. stocks except REITs. The \nreason they are expressly told to avoid REITs is that under FIRPTA, \nforeign investors that receive REIT capital gains distributions are \ntreated as doing business in the United States.\n  Title II would modify the FIRPTA rules so that a publicly traded \nREIT's payment of capital gains dividends to a foreign portfolio \ninvestor would no longer cause the REIT investor to be considered doing \nbusiness in the United States. The effect of this would be to threat \ninvestments in REITs like investment in other corporations, and the \nprovision would parallel current law governing a portfolio investor's \nsale of REIT stock.\n\n  Title III of our bill, REIT Savings, would modify a number so-called \n``death trap'' provisions in the REIT tax rules that result in the \ndisqualification of the REIT if various rules are not met. The loss of \nREIT status would be a catastrophic occurrence that the management of a \nREIT tries to avoid at all costs, so much so that they expend \nsignificant resources to put in place compliance measures to avoid such \na result. A better, simpler alternative would be to build in some \nflexibility to the REIT tax rules and impose monetary penalties, in \nlieu of REIT disqualification, for the failure to meet these strict \nrules that lead to REIT disqualification.\n  For example, under current law, a REIT is disqualified if more than 5 \npercent of its assets are comprised of the securities of any entity, or \nif it owns more than 10 percent of the voting power or value of any \nentity. In lieu of disqualification of the REIT status for violations \nof these rules, our bill would first give REITs an opportunity to \ncomply with the asset tests with respect to any violation that does not \nexceed 1 percent of their total assets. Assets in excess of the 1 \npercent de minimis amount would be subject to a tax of the greater of \n$50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income \nfrom the assets if the violation was justified by reasonable cause.\n  Under current law, a REIT is disqualified if it does not meet certain \nother tests relating to its organizational structure, the distribution \nof its income, its annual elections to the IRS, the transferability of \nits shares, and other requirements. In lieu of this disqualification, \nTitle III would change the law, assess a monetary penalty of $50,000 \nfor each reasonable cause failure to satisfy these rules. This is a \nmuch more reasonable solution.\n  These changes are similar to ``intermediate sanctions'' legislation \nthat Congress approved a few years ago dealing with nonprofit \norganizations. That legislation imposed monetary penalties on nonprofit \norganizations for violation of certain tax rules in lieu of a \ndevastating loss of the organizations' tax-exempt status. Those \nchanges, like the ones we are proposing today, recognize that it is far \nmore likely that an entity will be sanctioned under a penalty regime \nthan under draconian rules that entirely disqualify the organization.\n  The REIT Improvement Act would provide reasonable and much needed \nreforms to the rules governing a key component of our economy. We urge \nour colleagues to join with us in sponsoring this legislation and \nsupporting its inclusion in tax legislation heading for passage this \nyear.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nHatch in the introduction of the REIT Improvement Act of 2003. Through \nthis legislation we hope to remove a number of uncertainties in the tax \nlaws that hinder the management of REITs, and to improve the investment \nclimate for REITs, particularly with respect to their ability to \nattract foreign capital.\n  Real estate investment trusts (``REITs'') were created by Congress in \n1960 as a means of enabling small investors to invest in real estate \nthrough professionally managed companies. While REITs remained a very \nsmall sector of the real estate industry for many years--primarily as \nmortgage owning companies--with the enactment of tax reform in 1986, \nand the collapse of the real estate markets in the late 1980s--the REIT \nstructure rapidly grew in the 1990s as an attractive means of owning \nreal estate. Unlike the traditional form of real estate ownership, \nREITs are publicly traded corporations that go to the public capital \nmarkets to raise capital for their operations. Today, REITs are \ncorporations or business trusts that combine the capital of many \ninvestors to own, operate or finance income-producing real estate, such \nas apartments, storage facilities, hotels, shopping centers, offices, \nand warehouses.\n  Because REITs are publicly traded corporations that must show results \nto the financial markets, the REIT structure injects better market \ndiscipline into the real estate sector. This minimizes the wild \nvaluation swings that have characterized the real estate sector in the \npast. It also limits the exposure of federally insured depository \ninstitutions that have been traditional lenders to private real estate \ncompanies.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today, the REIT Improvement \nAct of 2003 (RIA), has three objectives. Number one, to make a number \nof minor corrections in the REIT tax rules, including most importantly \nfixing an unintended problem arising from the REIT Modernization Act of \n1999 that now causes a company to lose its REIT status by holding \nordinary debt, e.g., a loan to a small tenant to finance tenant \nimprovements.\n  Number two, to eliminate a major barrier to foreign investment in \npublicly traded REITs that now treats portfolio investors as doing \nbusiness in the U.S. merely because they receive REIT capital gains \ndistributions. The change would parallel the existing Tax Code rule for \na foreigner's sale of a publicly traded REIT's stock.\n  Number three, to replace the penalty for reasonable cause violations \nof REIT tests from a loss of REIT status to a monetary penalty. This is \nsimilar to a test that was enacted as part of the REIT Simplification \nAct of 1977, as well as ``intermediate sanction'' legislation Congress \npassed a few years ago for tax-exempt organizations.\n  Twenty-nine members of the Ways and Means Committee are cosponsoring \nidentical legislation in the House of Representatives, H.R. 1890. I \nexpect we will eventually have similar support for this legislation in \nthe Senate Finance Committee. I invite may colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors of this legislation in the weeks ahead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1569. A bill to amend title IV of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S10919]]\n\nAct of 1974 to require the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, in the \ncase of airline pilots who are required by regulation to retire at age \n60, to compute the actuarial value of monthly benefits in the form of a \nlife annuity commencing at age 60; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation Pilots Equitable Treatment Act to ensure \nfair treatment of commerical airline pilot retirees. This bill will \nlower the age requirement to receive the maximum pension benefits \nallowed by Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to age 60 for \npilots, who are mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \nto retire before age 65. With the airline industry experiencing severe \nfinancial distress, we need to enact this legislation to assist pilots \nwhose companies have been or will be unable to continue their defined \nbenefit pension plans. This bill will slightly alter Title IV of the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation to take into account the fact that the \npilots are required to retire at the age of 60 when calculating their \nbenefits.\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was established to ensure \nthat workers with defined benefit pension plans are able to receive \nsome protion of their retirement income in cases where the employer \ndoes not have enough money to pay for all of the benefits owed. After \nthe employer proves to the PBGC that the business is financially unable \nto support the plan, the PBGC takes over the plan as a trustee and \nensures that the current and future retirees receive their pension \nbenefits within the legal limits. Four of the ten largest claims in \nPBGC's history have been for airline pension plans. Although airline \nemployees account for only two percent of participants historically \ncovered by PBGC, they have constituted approximately 17 percent of \nclaims. For example, Eastern Airlines, Pan American, Trans World \nAirlines, and US Airways have terminated their pension plans and their \nretirees rely on the PBGC for their basic pension benefits.\n  The FAA requires commercial aviation pilots to retire when they reach \nthe age of 60. Pilots are therefore denied the maximum pension benefit \nadministered by the PBGC because they are required to retire before the \nage of 65. Herein lies the problem. Mr. President, if pilots want to \nwork beyond the age 60, they have to request a waiver from the FAA. It \nis my understanding that the FAA does not grant many of these waivers. \nTherefore, most of the pilots, if not all, do not receive the maximum \npension guarantee because they are forced to retire at age 60.\n  The maximum guaranteed pension at the age of 65 for plans that \nterminate in 2003 is $43,977.24. However, the maximum pension guarantee \nfor a retiree is decreased if a participant retires at the age of 60 to \n$28,585.20. This significant reduction in benefits puts pilots in a \ndifficult position. Their pensions have been reduced significantly and \nthey are prohibited from reentering their profession due to the \nmandatory retirement age. They are unable to go back to their former \njobs.\n  It is my sincere hope that existing airlines are able to maintain \ntheir pension programs and that the change this bill makes will not be \nneeded for any additional airline pension programs. However, due to the \ndifficult financial conditions of many or the airlines, I feel that we \nmust enact this protective measure. My legislation ensures that pilots \nare able to obtain the maximum PBGC benefit without being unfairly \npenalized for having to retire at 60, if their pension plan is \nterminated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code, of 1986 to allow \nindividuals a refundable credit against income tax for the purchase of \nprivate health insurance, and to establish State health insurance \nsafety-net programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President I rise to join my colleague Senator \nLindsey Graham in reintroducing the Fair Care for the Uninsured Act, \nlegislation aimed at ensuring that all Americans, regardless of income, \nhave a basic level of resources to purchase health insurance. I am \npleased that Congressman Mark Kennedy of Minnesota has joined in \nintroducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives that \nnow has 120 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  As we all know, the growing ranks of uninsured Americans--currently \nmore than 40 million--remains a major national problem that must be \naddressed as Congress considers improvements to our healthcare delivery \nsystem.\n  An Urban Institute study released earlier this year estimated that \nthe nation annually spends about $35 billion on uncompensated care \nreceived by the uninsured, both those who are uninsured for a full year \nand those who lack coverage for part of a year. About two-thirds of \nuncompensated care, almost $24 billion, is provided by hospitals caring \nfor uninsured people in emergency rooms, outpatient departments, and as \ninpatients. This study also estimated that a substantial portion of \nuncompensated care, perhaps as much as $30 billion, is already being \nfinanced by taxpayers through programs such as: Medicare and Medicaid \nDisproportionate Share Payments; Medicaid Upper Payment Limit payments; \nstate and local tax appropriations, primarily to public hospitals and \nclinics; federal grants to community health centers, and federal direct \ncare provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indian \nHealth Service.\n  These sobering statistics reveal that the price of being uninsured is \nvery high, and they ought to serve as a catalyst for us to address the \nproblem of uninsured Americans in a deliberate yet responsible fashion.\n  The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act represents a major step toward \nhelping the uninsured obtain health insurance coverage through the \ncreation of a new refundable tax credit for the purchase of private \nhealth insurance, a concept which again, enjoys bipartisan support.\n  This legislation directly addresses one of the main barriers now \ninhibiting access to health insurance for millions of Americans: \ndiscrimination in the tax code. Most Americans obtain health insurance \nthrough their place of work, and for good reason: workers receive their \nemployer's contribution toward health insurance completely free from \nfederal taxation, including payroll taxes. The Federal Government \neffectively subsidizes employer-provided health insurance to the tune \nof more than $80 billion per year. By contrast, individuals who \npurchase their own health insurance get virtually no tax relief. They \nmust buy insurance with after-tax dollars, forcing many to earn twice \nas much income before taxes in order to purchase the same insurance. \nThis hidden health tax penalty effectively punishes people who try to \nbuy their insurance outside the workplace.\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\n  The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act would remedy his situation by \ncreating a parallel system for working families who do not have access \nto health insurance through the workplace. Specifically, this \nlegislation creates a refundable tax credit of $1,000 per adult and up \nto $3,000 per family, indexed for inflation, for the purchase of \nprivate health insurance; would be available to individuals and \nfamilies who don't have access to coverage through the workplace or a \nfederal government program; enables individuals to use their credit to \nshop for a basic plan that best suits their needs and which would be \nportable from job to job; and allows individuals to buy more generous \ncoverage with after-tax dollars. And of course the States could \nsupplement the credit.\n\n  I would like to apprise our colleagues of one improvement in \nparticular which we have added to last session's bill that we believe \nwill help bring about an even more positive impact on America's \nuninsured population. In an effort to keep premiums affordable for \nolder, sicker Americans, our Fair Care legislation augments funding \nprovided in the Trade Act of 2002, P.L. 107-210, to State-run safety \nnet insurance programs, currently operating in 30 States, and \nencourages more States to establish these important programs. And, as \nin our legislation last session of Congress, we seek to help further \nreduce premiums by permitting the creation of Individual Membership \nAssociations, through which individuals can obtain basic coverage free \nof costly state benefit mandates.\n  This legislation complements a bipartisan consensus which is emerging \naround this means for addressing the serious problem of uninsured \nAmericans: Instead of creating new government entitlements to medical \nservices, tax credits provide public financing to help uninsured \nAmericans buy private health insurance. President Bush has proposed a \nsimilar tax credit for health insurance coverage, and Congress has \nalready acknowledged the promise of this idea in passing into law the \nnew Health Coverage Tax Credit, which helps folks who are eligible to \nreceive Trade Adjustment Assistance or pension benefit payments from \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Some 200,000 people across \nthe country who meet eligibility requirements--nearly 200,000 of whom \nreside in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania--now can obtain a tax credit \ncovering 65 percent of qualified health insurance premiums. They can \nget this assistance in two ways. First, they can claim it on their tax \nforms in a lump sum next year on April 15th. Or, beginning in August, \nthe Health Coverage Tax Credit program will allow eligible individuals \nand their families to directly apply the credit to their health \ninsurance premiums every month. This advance payment option could make \na big difference for families that are just getting by month-to-month \nor week-to-week.\n  In reducing the amount of uncompensated care that is offset through \ncost shifting to private insurance plans, and in substantially \nincreasing the insurance base, a health insurance tax credit will help \nrelieve some of the spiraling costs of our health care delivery system. \nIt would also encourage insurance companies to write policies geared to \nthe size of the credit, thus offering more options and making it \npossible for low-income families to obtain coverage without paying much \nmore than the available credits.\n  It is time that we reduced the tax bias against families who do not \nhave access to coverage through their place of work or existing \ngovernment programs, and to encourage the creation of an effective \nmarket for family-selected and family-owned plans, where Americans have \nmore choice and control over their health care dollars. The Fair Care \nfor the Uninsured Act would create tax fairness where currently none \nexists by requiring that all Americans receive the same tax \nencouragement to purchase health insurance, regardless of employment.\n  It is my hope that our colleagues will join Senator Graham and me in \nendorsing this legislation to provide people who purchase health \ninsurance on their own similar tax treatment as those who have access \nto insurance through their employer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that \naddresses the issue of anonymous ``holds'' that Senators use to prevent \nconsideration of legislation and nominations. I am pleased to be joined \nin this effort by the distinguished former Majority Leader, Senator \nByrd, along with the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, and the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden.\n  The resolution we are submitting today builds on the work of Senators \nGrassley and Wyden who have pursued this issue for years. On June 17, I \nchaired a hearing at the Rules Committee to consider a resolution, S. \nRes. 151, that Senators Grassley and Wyden introduced that would have \namended the Senate's Rules to require the publication of the names of \nSenators who have placed holds on legislation or nominations.\n  Many Senators and witnesses who testified before the Committee \nexpressed concern about the propriety of incorporating an informal \ncustom designed to obstruct--the hold--in the Senate's rules. Others \nwere concerned that there could be unintended consequences to making \nthis permanent change in the rules of the Senate.\n  As a result of that hearing, I worked with the sponsors of the \nresolution and with Senator Byrd to develop what we believe is an \nappropriate way to resolve the problem of anonymous holds. The \nresolution we are introducing today reflects that work.\n  During my tenure as Majority Leader, I, along with Senator Daschle \nattempted to address the issue of secret holds. We sent a letter to all \nSenators and indicated that members placing holds on legislation or \nnominations would have to notify the sponsor of the legislation, the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, and the leaders. Unfortunately, we had no \nmechanism to enforce those requirements and secret holds continue to \nplague the Senate.\n  The resolution we are submitting today would place a greater \nresponsibility on Senators to make their holds public. Our resolution \ncreates a Standing Order that would stay in effect until the end of the \n108th Congress. The Order requires that the majority and minority \nleaders can only recognize a hold that is provided in writing. Moreover \nfor the hold to be honored, the Senator objecting would have to publish \nhis objection in the Congressional Record, three days after the notice \nis provided to a leader.\n  New sections would be created in the Legislative and Executive \nCalendars that would identify the names of Senators with holds on \nparticular measures and nominations. The order also provides a brief \nwritten format that a Senator must use to indicate his opposition to \nproceeding. In addition, a format is provided to remove a hold.\n  I believe that holds, whether anonymous, or publicly announced, are \nan affront to the Senate, the leadership, the Committees and to the \nindividual members of this institution. As leader, I could not \nestablish a rational and timely agenda for the institution to perform \nits business without having to first consult with, effectively, every \nother member of the Senate.\n  One day, a Senator would have a hold on a bill and after I convinced \nhim to lift the hold, the next day I was told another Senator had \nplaced a hold on the same bill. And don't get me wrong, these weren't \njust holds from Democrats, they were holds from some of my best friends \non this side of the aisle.\n  This Order does not eliminate the right of a Senator to place a hold. \nSome day, the Senate may decide that holds, in and of themselves, are \nan undemocratic practice that should no longer be recognized. I, for \none, would consider eliminating the hold, by for example, limiting \ndebate on the motion to proceed. However, I believe before we consider \nsuch a drastic step, we should, at the very least, eliminate the secret \nhold and I believe this Order will achieve that goal.\n  Secret holds have no place in a publicly accountable institution. A \nmeasure that is important to a majority of the American public and a \nmajority of Senators can be stopped dead in it's tracks by a single \nSenator. And when that Senator can hide behind the anonymous hold, \ndemocracy itself is damaged.\n  How do you tell your constituents that legislation they have an \ninterest in, legislation that has been approved by the majority of a \ncommittee, is stalled and you don't know who is holding it up? What \ndoes that say about this institution? I think the secret hold has no \nplace in this revered institution.\n  I believe that if we adopt this Resolution, the public will have \ngreater trust in the Senate. Secrecy and anonymity in an institution of \nthe people does not engender trust among our constituents. Holds belong \nin the wrestling ring, not in this hallowed chamber.\n  This resolution is an experiment in making the Senate and Senators \nmore accountable. At the end of the 108th Congress, the Senate will be \nable to determine whether it wants to make this a permanent Standing \nOrder or whether it wants to modify the Order. I hope my colleagues \nwill give the Senate the opportunity to see if this approach will \neliminate the secrecy surrounding holds and facilitate dialogue that \nbreaks the logjam on legislating in this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text a copy of the February, 1999, \nletter I sent with Senator Daschle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 1999.\n       Dear Colleague: As the 106th Congress begins, we wish to \n     clarify to all colleagues, procedures governing the use of \n     holds during the new legislative session. All Senators should \n     remember the Grassley and Wyden initiative, calling for a \n     Senator to ``provide\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\n     notice to leadership of his or her intention to object to \n     proceeding to a motion or matter [and] disclose the hold in \n     the Congressional Record.''\n       While we believe that all members will agree this practice \n     of ``secret holds'' has been a Senatorial courtesy extended \n     by party Leaders for many Congresses, it is our intention to \n     address some concerns raised regarding this practice.\n       Therefore, at the beginning of the first session of the \n     106th Congress, all members wishing to place a hold on any \n     legislation or executive calendar business shall notify the \n     sponsor of the legislation and the committee of jurisdiction \n     of their concerns. Further, written notification should be \n     provided to the respective Leader stating their intentions \n     regarding the bill or nomination. Holds placed on items by a \n     member of a personal or committee staff will not be honored \n     unless accompanied by a written notification from the \n     objecting Senator by the end of the following business day.\n       We look forward to working with you to produce a successful \n     new Congress.\n           Best regards,\n     Trent Lott\n       Majority Leader, U.S. Senate\n     Tom Daschle\n       Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to say just a few words about the \nSenate Resolution being submitted today by Senator Lott along with the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, myself and \nSenator Wyden. This resolution aims to end the practice of secret holds \nin the Senate; an issue on which Senator Wyden and I have worked long \nand hard.\n  On May 21 of this year, I resubmitted with Senator Wyden our simple \nresolution to amend the Senate Rules to require Senators placing a hold \nto make that hold public in the Congressional Record. I was very \npleased by the support and encouragement we received from Chairman \nLott, who subsequently held a hearing on our resolution in the Senate \nRules Committee. This was a very positive step in bringing this issue \nto the forefront. In fact, I was gratified by the many positive \ncomments and expressions of interest from members of the Rules \nCommittee in response to the testimony from myself and Senator Wyden.\n  Following the hearing, my staff and Senator Wyden's staff were able \nto engage in very productive discussions with Chairman Lott's staff and \nstaff for Ranking Member Dodd and Senator Byrd. The product of those \ndiscussions is this resolution and I'm very pleased with the result. \nThis resolution is a little longer and not as simple as our original \nresolution, but it does precisely what Senator Wyden and I have been \nseeking. In some ways it is even better than what we started with.\n  Unlike our previous resolution, this measure establishes a standing \norder instead of amending the Senate Rules. Some Senators are \nunderstandably nervous about making a permanent change to the Senate \nRules. In fact, this order is only written for the remainder of the \n108th Congress to allow Senators to see what effect this change has in \npractice before deciding whether to renew to requirement or make \nchanges. Nevertheless, it's important to point out that a standing \norder has essentially the same force and effort in practice as a Senate \nRule. Also, I'm confident based on my own experience in practicing \npublic disclosure of holds in the Congressional Record, that Senators \nwill find public holds don't hurt a bit. Therefore, it's my expectation \nthat this standing order will be renewed in future congresses.\n  This new standing order would also spell out the exact format and \ncontent required when Senators publish notices of holds so there is no \nambiguity or room for misunderstanding. Having a standard format will \nalso make it easier in practice for Senators to submit notices of holds \nfor the Record. It will be as simple as adding a cosponsor to a bill. \nOur resolution would also provide for publication in the Senate \nCalendars of notices of holds on legislation or nominees as well as a \nstandard procedure for removing a Senator's name from the calendar when \na hold is released.\n  One other change we made from our previous resolution was to allow \nfor three session days instead of two after a hold has been placed for \nthe public notice to be included in the Record. I want to be clear that \nI support immediate public disclosure of holds because I believe in the \nprinciple of open government and I can find no legitimate reason why a \nSenator placing a hold should remain anonymous. However, it's necessary \nto allow for a short window of time to permit Senators and their staff \nto prepare a notice and submit it for the Record. I've found that two \nsession days has been more than adequate for myself and my staff, but \nnot all Senators' offices are the same. Senator Byrd suggested that \nthree session days might be more appropriate and since the practice of \ndisclosing holds will be uncharted territory at first for most \nSenators, a deadline of three session days to publish holds seems \nreasonable.\n  I should add at this time that I'm very honored to have the support \nof Senator Byrd on this initiative. No one knows Senate procedure \nbetter or has more institutional knowledge of the Senate than Senator \nByrd. Both he and Senator Lott have a unique understanding of the \nproblem of secret holds, having both served as Senate Majority Leader. \nHaving Senator Byrd's name on this resolution should send a strong \nmessage to the Senate that secret holds are a serious problem that \nshould be dealt with for the good of the Senate as an institution.\n  I believe that this change will lead to more open dialogue and more \nconstructive debate in the Senate. Moreover, it will make the Senate \nprocess more transparent and reduce public cynicism. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Senator Lott, Senator Byrd, and the rest of the \nRules Committee to move this needed reform through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the submission of this resolution marks a \nvery important milestone in the seven-year effort I have pursued with \nSenator Grassley to bring the Senate practice of holds out of the \nshadows and into the sunshine. Throughout this time we have labored as \na bipartisan team to champion the cause of the ``sunshine'' hold. I \nespecially want to thank Rules Chairman Lott and the Senate's foremost \nauthority on the Rules, Senator Byrd, for their commitment to working \nwith us on this resolution. They know all too well the havoc ``secret'' \nholds can wreak on the Senate agenda.\n  Whether public or secret, the hold in the Senate is a lot like the \nseventh inning stretch in baseball: there is no official rule or \nregulation that talks about it, but it has been observed for so long \nthat it has become a tradition. Its capacity to tie the Senate and \nSenators in knots is notorious, and it has even given birth to several \nintriguing offspring: the hostage hold, the rolling hold and the Mae \nWest hold.\n  The secret hold is a practice of Senatorial courtesy extended by the \nrespective Leaders. Even though it is one of the Senate's most popular \nprocedures, it cannot be found anywhere in the United States \nConstitution or in the Senate Rules. It is one of the most powerful \nweapons any Senator can wield in this body, and in its stealth version, \nknown as the secret hold, it is even more potent.\n  The target of this resolution is specifically ``holds,'' which we \ndefine as a Senator's intent to object to proceeding to a motion or \nmatter. The resolution does not deal with so-called ``consults,'' which \nare confidential communications between a Senator and the respective \nLeader informing the Leader of a Senator's interest in a bill or \nnomination. This resolution would say to those who want to kill or stop \na bill or nomination that they must come forward and notify their \nrespective party leaders. It would not affect the process known as the \n``consult'' insofar as it is used to alert a Senator when a bill or \nnomination is moving toward the floor so that the Senator may prepare \nfor floor consideration.\n  The resolution would establish a Senate Temporary Standing Order for \nthe duration of the 108th Congress allowing ``sunshine'' holds. The \nresolution would require a Senator who wishes to object to a motion or \nmatter to publish notice of the intent in the Congressional Record \nwithin 3 session days of notifying the respective Leader. The \nresolution would in no way limit the privilege of any Senator to place \na ``hold'' on a measure or matter, it would simply say that the notice \nof intent to object to a measure or matter be published.\n  Throughout the Senate's history some of the most potent weapons--\nprocedural and otherwise--often have not\n\n[[Page S10925]]\n\nbeen rules but rather the absence of them.\n  Beginning in 1997 and again in 1998, the United States Senate voted \nunanimously in favor of amendments Senator Grassley and I sponsored to \nrequire that a notice of intent to object be published in the \nCongressional Record within 48 hours. The amendments, however, never \nsurvived conference.\n  So, Senator Grassley and I took our case to the leadership, and to \ntheir credit, Tom Daschle and Trent Lott agreed it was time to make a \nchange. They recognized the need for more openness in the way the \nSenate conducts its business. The leaders sent a joint letter in \nFebruary 1999, to all Senators setting forth a policy requiring ``all \nSenators wishing to place a hold on any legislation or executive \ncalendar business [to] notify the sponsor or the legislation and the \ncommittee of jurisdiction of their concerns.'' Their letter said: \n``written notification should be provided to the respective Leader \nstating their intentions regarding the bill or nomination,'' and that \n``holds placed on items by a member of a personal or committee staff \nwill not be honored unless accompanied by a written notification from \nthe objecting Senator by the end of the following business day.''\n  At first, this action seemed to make a real difference: many Senators \nwere more open about their holds, and staff could no longer slap a hold \non a bill with a quick phone call. But after some time, the clouds \nmoved in on the sunshine hold, obscuring the progress that had been \nachieved. Legislative gridlock resumed, and the Senate seemed to have \nforgotten the Lott/Daschle letter.\n  The problem the Senate faces today is not that a significant number \nof our colleagues make their holds public, but that a small number of \nSenators do not. It is their abuse of secret holds that contributes to \nlegislative gridlock. By calling for publication of the intent to \nobject in the Congressional Record, I believe the resolution puts the \nburden where it ought to be: not on the leadership, where it is today, \nbut squarely on the shoulders of the objector. An objector who seeks to \nkill a bill by hiding behind a curtain of secrecy is hurting the \nleaders' ability to run the body and is obstructing rather than \nfacilitating the Senate's business.\n  Public notice of holds may be an inconvenience for a few, but not a \nhardship. In any given week, Senators insert more than two dozen \nstatements in the Record on subjects such as sports teams winning \nchampionships and charitable fundraisers. These important events should \nbe recognized, and I would hope that the intent of a Senator to block \naction on a bill or nomination would be considered of equal importance.\n  The sponsors of the resolution have discussed at great length, most \nrecently at the Rules Committee hearing on the subject, the matter of \nenforcement. My sense is that no Senator will ever go to jail for \nfailing to give public notice of a hold, just as no Senator has gone to \njail for violating the Standing Order adopted in the 98th Congress \nrequiring Senators to vote from their assigned desks during the \n``yeas'' and ``nays.'' There are any number of provisions even in the \nSenate.\n  Rules that are not enforced at all or rarely today. Senate Rule XXVI \nrequires the inclusion of various items of information in written \ncommittee reports, but Senate Rules do not require committees to file \nwritten reports on bills. Senate Rule VII, para. 5, provides committees \nshall make every reasonable effort to have printed hearings available \nfor Senators before a measure comes to the floor for debate, although \nthe Senate has debated any number of measures without the benefit of a \nprinted report.\n  This resolution signals to all members the Senate's preferred manner \nof doing business. I think most Senators believe the Senate's business \nshould be conducted in public, and I think the American people would \nagree.\n  Sunshine holds would strengthen the Leaders' hands as well as their \noptions. A Leader may opt to continue to honor a secret hold, but a \nLeader wishing to move a measure or matter would be under no obligation \nto honor a hold unless the objecting Senator had complied with the Rule \nand published notice in the Record.\n  The resolution is constructed so as to become a part of the Temporary \nStanding Orders, or the series of unanimous consent agreements that are \nrenewed at the outset of each new Congress. Because there may be \nunintended consequences and because I have no desire to inflict \nirreparable harm on the Senate Rules, I deferred to the experience and \nwisdom of Senator Byrd whose wise counsel urged that the terms of the \nresolution be limited to the 108th Congress. My intent is to revisit \nthe matter with Senators Grassley, Lott, and Byrd at the end of the \n108th Congress to determine the benefits of making the resolution part \nof the Senate Rules at that time.\n  As United States Senators we occupy a position of public trust, and I \nbelieve the exercise of the power that has been vested in us should \nalways be accompanied by public accountability. I would argue that it \nis not the hold, but the anonymity of the hold that is so odious to the \nbasic premise of our democratic system. The Lott-Byrd-Grassley-Wyden \nresolution would bring the anonymous hold out of the shadows of the \nSenate. It would assure that the awesome power possessed by an \nindividual Senator to stop legislation or a nomination would be \naccompanied by the sunshine of public accountability.\n  At its hearing in June, the Rules Committee weighed the merits of the \nGrassley-Wyden Resolution, and considered several fundamental \nquestions: Whether the practice of secret holds is consistent with a \ndemocratic system; whether the elimination of the secrecy would disrupt \nthe Constitutional balance of power between the various branches of \ngovernment; and whether the removal of the secrecy would tip the \nbalance between the rights of the majority and the minority in the \nSenate.\n  My response is that removing secrecy from the hold will not alter the \npractice, merely its form. Removing secrecy from the hold will not tip \nthe balance in Senate Rules and procedures between majority and \nminority rights. And removing the secrecy will not alter the balance of \npowers created under the Constitution. On the contrary, surrendering \nsecrecy will strengthen public accountability and lessen the gridlock \nthat has increasingly come to plague the world's greatest deliberative \nbody.\n  I would like to close by quoting the foremost authority on Senate \nRules, who served as Majority Leader in the 95th, 96th and 100th \nCongresses. In Chapter 28, ``Reflections of a Party Leader,'' of Volume \nII of The Senate, the Honorable Robert C. Byrd wrote: ``To me, the \nSenate rules were to be used, when necessary, to advance and expedite \nthe Senate's business.'' Giving the sunshine hold a place in the \nSenate's Rules would surely serve this worthy goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 217--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n    GOALS OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE DOHA ROUND OF THE WORLD TRADE \n                 ORGANIZATION AGRICULTURE NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Harkin) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n                              S. Res. 217\n\n       Whereas the cap on trade-distorting domestic support \n     available to producers in the European Union under the \n     Agreement on Agriculture of the World Trade Organization is 3 \n     times higher than the cap on domestic support available to \n     producers in the United States;\n       Whereas according to the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 2002 government \n     support provided to agricultural producers in the European \n     Union was twice the level provided to producers in the United \n     States, and United States agricultural support was just 58 \n     percent of the average level provided in all 30 OECD-member \n     countries;\n       Whereas in 2000 the European Union accounted for more than \n     87 percent of the world's agricultural export subsidies, and \n     the United States represented just 1 percent;\n       Whereas according to the Congressional Budget Office, \n     expenditures under United States farm and conservation \n     programs are expected to remain at least 20 percent below the \n     average of such expenditures during the years 2000 and 2001;\n       Whereas the results of the Doha Development Agenda of the \n     World Trade Organization negotiations on agriculture are \n     critically important to the future of farming and ranching in \n     the United States;\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\n       Whereas the World Trade Organization will hold a \n     Ministerial Meeting in Cancun, Mexico, in September 2003, at \n     which members of the World Trade Organization are expected to \n     make decisions that will determine the broad outlines of any \n     agreement on agriculture reached in the Doha Development \n     Agenda; and\n       Whereas the Chairman of the World Trade Organization \n     Agriculture Negotiations Committee has proposed a modalities \n     framework to serve as the basis for discussion and decisions \n     at the Ministerial Meeting in Cancun: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the goals of the United States in the Doha Round of the \n     World Trade Organization agriculture negotiations are to \n     achieve significantly increased market access, to harmonize \n     allowed levels of trade-distorting domestic support for all \n     countries, to immediately eliminate export subsidies, and to \n     achieve a more level playing field in the world market for \n     United States farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers;\n       (2) the Chairman of the World Trade Organization \n     Agriculture Negotiations Committee has properly sought to \n     move the negotiations forward, but the proposed modalities \n     framework he has released fails to meet the goals described \n     in paragraph (1) because--\n       (A) the framework accepts the European formulation of equal \n     percentage reductions from unequal levels of support that \n     locks in place the European Union's current advantage on \n     trade-distorting domestic support levels;\n       (B) while the framework recognizes that high tariff levels \n     should be reduced more quickly, it nevertheless fails to \n     sufficiently open export markets for United States products \n     by allowing countries to maintain prohibitively high tariffs;\n       (C) while the framework eliminates trade-disrupting export \n     subsidies, it phases out the elimination of export subsidies \n     over too long a period of time;\n       (D) the framework contains a potentially unlimited tariff \n     reduction loophole that would disadvantage United States \n     agricultural products exported to developing countries, and \n     would also limit trade between developing countries; and\n       (E) the framework preserves trade-distorting direct \n     payments under production-limiting programs that are not \n     subject to commitments to reduce domestic support under the \n     Agreement on Agriculture of the World Trade Organization; and\n       (3) the United States should not agree to the proposed \n     framework unless and until it is substantially improved in \n     order to result in significantly increased market access, the \n     harmonization of allowed levels of trade-distorting domestic \n     support, and a more level playing field for United States \n     farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10926-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1540.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 178, S. 888.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 888) to reauthorize The Museum and Library \n     Services Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will consider \nand pass today a Substitute Amendment to H.R. 13, the Museum and \nLibrary Services Act of 2003. This substitute mirrors my bill, S. 888. \nSince I first introduced this legislation in April with several of my \ncolleagues, it has been a bipartisan process. Over the past several \nmonths we have worked to build support for this language, so that today \nS. 888 has over 50 Senators as cosponsors. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir support. I particularly want to thank Senator Reed, Senator \nFrist, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Enzi for their efforts.\n  This bill recognizes the importance of libraries and museums and \nprovides them with continued federal support through the Institute of \nMuseum and Library Services. In addition, it authorizes a doubling of \nthe minimum state allotment under the Grants to State Library Agencies \nProgram, up to $680,000. That provision allows for an increase, if \nappropriated, of 50% for New Hampshire's Federal library allotment \nunder the law.\n  Recognizing the key role that libraries play in fostering the \nacademic achievement of our nation's schoolchildren, the Museum and \nLibrary Services Act of 2003 also requires that the director, where \nappropriate, ensure that the library activities of the IMLS are \ncoordinated with the school library provisions of the No Child Left \nBehind Act.\n  Furthermore, this bill increases the indemnity limits in the Arts and \nArtifacts Indemnity Act, thereby facilitating the international \nexchange and display of works of art, books, rare documents and other \npublished materials, artifacts, and films and other audiovisual media. \nThis will ensure that people throughout the world are exposed to \nAmerican culture and that our own citizens will have richer educational \nopportunities available as well.\n  In addition, S. 888 supports the efforts of President Bush and Mrs. \nBush to recruit more librarians by allowing funds to be used for the \nrecruitment of persons in library and information science. Over the \nnext 16 years, America's libraries are projected to lose 58 percent of \ntheir professional librarians, and more than one-quarter of all \nlibrarians with master's degrees will reach the age of 65 before 2009. \nThis bill will help to alleviate this shortage.\n  The legislation contains a number of other important provisions. It \nprohibits projects determined to be obscene from receiving Federal \nfunds, requires the Institute to conduct analyses of the need for \nmuseum and library services and the effectiveness of funded projects in \nmeeting those needs, consolidates the library and museum advisory \nboards into one entity, and prohibits funds appropriated under the \nAct's authority from being used for library or museum construction.\n  We have worked hard to reach an agreement on this language with our \ncolleagues in the House, and expect that when the House returns from \nthe August recess, they will pass this bill as well and send it on to \nthe President for his signature. Again, I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport of this important legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Museum and Library \nServices Act. Federal support of museums and libraries is appropriate \nand often essential to maintain the cultural and educational centers \nthat provide valued resources for communities across the country. These \ninstitutions encourage learning, understanding, and respect for others \nin our diverse society, and their benefits are found in every \nneighborhood in America.\n  As technology's role in our society becomes more significant than \never, wider access to the internet and other resources is increasingly \nimportant. Greater Federal funding for libraries and museums is \nespecially important when local budgets are so hard-pressed.\n  This bill supports the use of a wide range of media in both museums \nand libraries, enhancing access to exhibits and programs, and improving \nlearning in a variety of formats. Library and museum advisory boards \nare consolidated into one body under this bill as a way to improve \nnetworks among museums, schools, and other community organizations.\n  This bill is intended to increase the efficiency of library services \nand provide much-needed financial assistance. It encourages library \nservices for peoples of all backgrounds, especially in under-served \nurban and rural communities, so that access to technology will be much \nmore widely available to all.\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\n  Support for museums is equally important. They help to preserve and \nmaintain and explain the nation's history and heritage. They impart \nknowledge of other cultures as well. They inspire citizens of all ages \nto learn more about history, art, and science. Few experiences can more \nvividly excite the imagination of a child about our Nation's history \nthan seeing an actual relic of an event they've read about or been told \nabout. With this legislation, we can do more to enable museums to \nincrease their services, bring more exhibits into more communities, and \nencourage the use of new technology and variety of media.\n  Also, to ease the burden of insurance, our bill authorizes increased \nindemnity for art exhibits that might not otherwise take place because \nof rising costs.\n  The House has passed a similar version of the bill by an overwhelming \nmajority, and I hope the Senate will do the same. I particularly \ncommend the leadership Senator Gregg, the Chairman of our HELP \nCommittee, and the principal sponsor of this bipartisan legislation. I \nalso commend Senator Reed, the principal cosponsor of the bill, who has \nso effectively carried on the commitment on this issue by his \npredecessor from Rhode Island, Senator Claiborne Pell. Our committee \nunanimously approved this bill, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate \nto approve it now.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support passage of \nthe Museum and Library Services Act of 2003.\n  I thank the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, Senator Gregg, and the Ranking Member, Senator Kennedy, for \nworking closely with me on this bill and for getting us to this point. \nThis has been a long time in coming, and I am glad that we have worked \nout a bill with the other body that we can be proud to support. Indeed, \nthe bill before us today is essentially the bill we approved in \nCommittee on June 26th.\n  Last year, during the hearing I chaired on the Museum and Library \nServices Act, we heard directly from the museum and library communities \nabout the recommendations for updating this law so its meets the future \nneeds of museum and library users. I also extend my thanks to the \nmuseum and library communities for their efforts in this process.\n  Like S. 238, the legislation I introduced earlier this year, and S. \n888, which I joined Senator Gregg in introducing, this bill doubles the \nminimum state allotment under the Library Services and Technology Act, \nwhich will enable smaller States like Rhode to benefit and implement \nthe valuable services and programs that larger States have been able to \nput in place.\n  It also ensures that library activities are coordinated with the \nschool library program I authored, which is now part of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act of 2001.\n  The bill includes an increase in the indemnity limits under the Arts \nand Artifacts Indemnity Act to ensure continued support for American \nmuseums as they facilitate international cultural exchanges through \ntouring exhibitions here in the U.S. and loans of American art around \nthe world.\n  The bill also establishes a reservation of 1.75 percent of funds for \nmuseum services for Native Americans, to match the reservation \ncurrently provided for library services under the Library Services and \nTechnology subtitle.\n  The bill updates the uses of funds for library and museum programs \nand increases the authorization levels for the Library Services and \nTechnology Act and the Museum Services Act.\n  We should meet these funding levels in the appropriations process due \nto this bill's strong bipartisan support. I personally believe that our \nlibraries and museums should be more robustly funded, particularly as \nthese institutions play increasingly important roles in our lives.\n  Again, I congratulate and thank my colleagues, in particular, \nSenators Gregg, Kennedy, Frist, and Enzi, on passage of this important \nlegislation. I look forward to working with them to get this bill to \nthe President's desk in September so that the bill's increase in the \nminimum state allotment will take effect in Fiscal Year 2004, as well \nas on ensuring increased funding for our Nation's libraries and \nmuseums.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Gregg \nsubstitute amendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill be read a third \ntime; that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof H.R. 13, and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; \nthat all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 888, \nas amended, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third \ntime, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that \nS. 888 be returned to the calendar, and any statements related to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1541) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 13), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10931-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 2799 AND H.R. 2861\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Yet, as always, we enjoy the \nengagement with our constituents and visits to places in our State. So \nthis is a well-earned recess for the Senate. We have had a very active \nsession.

Mr. President, let me preface my intended remarks. I \nseldom have occasion to take exception to the remarks made by the very \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee on which \nI am honored to serve, but I must say that I respectfully disagree with \nthe modesty by which he characterized himself as anything less than one \nof the real greats in the Senate. In my estimation, the Senator from \nVirginia ranks up among the greats of the Senate from the beginning of \nour Nation's proud heritage and through the years.\n  I believe the Senator has now completed 25 years of extraordinary \nservice on behalf of not only the citizens of Virginia but also the \ncitizens of Minnesota and the citizens of this country. When I was one-\nhundredth in Senate seniority for my first 2 years, I had some doubts \nabout the worth of the seniority system. I was dissuaded whenever I \nwould see the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, act as chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, then as its ranking member, and now as \nchairman again, of that most important committee.\n  When I recently had a chance to travel with him to Iraq and saw his \nfortitude and his determination to serve the best interests of our \ncountry, or when matters of great importance to the future of this \ncountry and this world came before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nI was always reassured by the knowledge that the Senator from Virginia, \nMr. Warner, was chairman of that committee, and acting with the very \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Levin from Michigan. I believed \nthat our democracy was in the best possible hands. The wisdom of the \nseniority system with a man of that stature serving in that role was \ncertainly upheld. I would just like to acknowledge that his own modesty \nprevented him from saying what I know that my colleagues join with me \non both sides of the aisle in saying, that this man is one of the true \ngreats of the Senate on this day or any day.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague. He is \na very active member of the Armed Services Committee. Indeed, he did \nmake reference to our excellent trip of nine Senators into Iraq, 3 days \nin country. It was a very important mission, defining exactly what I \ntried to enumerate in my remarks earlier, our responsibility to the men \nand women of the Armed Forces and their families. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank also the Presiding Officer for his forbearance in \npermitting my remarks this afternoon. I had the opportunity to serve on \nmany of these occasions in the previous 2 years as Presiding Officer. I \nknow how my heart sank when yet another Senator would arrive on the \nfloor to make his or her remarks. I thank the Presiding Officer for \nthis opportunity and his forbearance as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10932-8", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10932-S10935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AVIATION ADMINISTRATION CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, yesterday and this morning I placed holds \non the nominations of 15 men and women\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\nfor appointments in the executive branch. They have one characteristic \nin common. They all come from States of Senators or Members of the \nHouse of Representatives who have signed the Federal Aviation \nAdministration conference report. This report, which will come before \nthe Senate and the House after the August recess, steals the rightful \nauthority of the Minnesota Metropolitan Airports Commission, which is a \npublic body, its members appointed by the Governor, to make decisions \nabout the lives of Minnesotans who live near our major international \nairport. The Report would prohibit Federal funds from being used for \nnoise insulation of homes or apartment buildings where the airplane \nnoise ranges from 60 to 64 decibels.\n  This clause was not in the Senate bill and it was not in the House \nbill. It was neither considered nor acted upon by either body, nor by \nany of the committees of jurisdiction in the Senate or the House. There \nwas no public notification about this intent. There were no hearings, \nno testimony, nothing about this particular clause.\n  It appears in the conference report reportedly because a lobbyist \nrepresenting a client found a Senator from another State far removed \nfrom my State, where citizens will bear the burdens and the \nconsequences of this action. To slip this contemptible language into \nthe final conference report, which will become, if it is acted \nfavorably upon by the Senate and House, the final bill, the law of the \nland if the President signs it, this action reminds me of the old \ncontest called limbo, where the object was to ``see how low you could \ngo.'' This action is very low. It is low because it is a perversion of \nour public process for making laws which govern the lives of the \ncitizens of this country; in this case, the lives of people who live in \nover 8,000 homes and over 3,200 apartments which surround the \nMinneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Airport.\n  Some 300 years ago, even before the formation of this democracy, one \nof the first leaders of English settlers arriving here was William \nPenn. He wrote that people are free under a government where the laws \nrule and the people are a party to those laws. Those are the two \nconditions under which the people are free.\n  The several thousand people who would be affected by this clause if \nit were to become law--and it will not become law--were not a party to \nthat decision because the people they elected to represent them in \nCongress, their two Senators and their Congressman, were not a party to \nthis clause. I am not myself a supporter of the idea of a unicameral \nlegislative body, but if there were ever consideration given, this \nwould be exhibit number 1 in support of one, because a unicameral \nlegislative body would eliminate these conference committees, where a \nfew Members of the House and Senate go into some back room or private \noffice and write one final bill out of the two versions passed by the \nSenate and the House, and then the rest of us--all of the elected \nSenators and Representatives--have to vote that final report up or \ndown, with no changes, no additions, no subtractions.\n  Conference committees recently have taken a very dangerous turn. The \nDemocratic conferees are being excluded from their deliberations and \ndecisions. Republicans make up the majority of the conferees from both \nthe House and Senate, as they should because they hold the majority in \nboth bodies. So if those Republican conferees concur among themselves, \nthey will prevail on every vote, and they will get the final bill they \nwant to create. They have that right based on the rules of the Senate \nand the House.\n  For some reason, however, that is not enough these days because, \nincreasingly, the Democratic conferees are not allowed in meetings \nwhere those deliberations and decisions are being made. They are not \neven allowed to object or agree, or to try to persuade otherwise. I \nhave to ask myself, as someone who has been here only 2\\1/2\\ years, why \nis it they are not even allowed to participate? Is it to make it easier \nto sneak in these kinds of terrible additions to bills that will become \nlaw and hope they won't be noticed by the rest of us before the final \nbill is acted upon?\n  This exclusion from the process and the inclusion of another \nprovision that was not previously passed by the Senate or the House, to \nprivatize this Nation's air traffic control system, which ranks as one \nof the most unwarranted, unjustified, destructive, and dangerous ideas \nof this new century, were the major reasons that not a single \nDemocratic conferee from either the Senate or the House signed the FAA \nconference report. There were 38 conferees--24 Republicans and 14 \nDemocrats. All 24 Republicans signed the conference report. None of the \nDemocrats, out of 14 Democratic conferees, signed that conference \nreport.\n  So much for ``changing the tone'' in Washington. So much for \n``bipartisanship.'' So much for honest Government reflecting the will \nof the people, who elected all of us to represent them in the Senate \nand in the House. The majority caucus of the Senate is comprised of 51 \nMembers, and the minority caucus has 49 members. If the then-incumbent \nsenior Senator from Minnesota had not been killed in a plane crash last \nOctober, the Senate would be 50/50 evenly divided, as it was when I \narrived here 2\\1/2\\ years ago. The people of America have recently \nvoted for a closely divided Government, to which the 2000 Presidential \nelection also bears witness to.\n  It is fundamentally wrong for the barely majority party to usurp the \nresponsibility for good government, and in conformance to the expressed \npolitical will of the American people. It is terribly wrong to do so \nfor the purpose of writing bills behind closed doors and putting in \ngarbage like this airport noise clause, which affects the people of \nMinnesota. They ought to be ashamed, they should be better than that, \nand they ought to stop doing it.\n  Where does this legislative dropping come from? Reportedly, I have \nheard from several sources, it was added by a Senate conferee. Neither \nmy Minnesota colleague nor I were aware of it, which obviously was the \nintent of both its author and originator. I am deeply offended that one \nof my colleagues would behave in such an underhanded fashion and harm \nthe people in my State for no apparent reason.\n  What would induce another Member of the Senate to do something like \nthat? Now, he didn't make up the idea by himself. We have enough to do \nin these jobs that we don't have to hunt for issues affecting airports \nin other States to make our sneak attacks upon--at least I hope not. We \nhave our disagreements here, as we should. We have our political \narguments, as we must. But I certainly hope we are not here to do \ndamage to people in other Members' States.\n  If we are going to engage in such a practice, I certainly expect that \nwe will all have the integrity to do so in the proper and public \nlawmaking processes of this Senate and this Congress. I certainly \nexpect the decency to be informed by my colleague that he intends to do \nso. If that integrity and that decency do not prevail here, then the \nformer Chaplain of the Senate, Dr. Edward Everett Hale, was right when \nasked if he prayed for the Senators. ``No,'' the Senate Chaplain \nreplied, ``I look at the Senators and pray for the country.''\n  The Senate Chaplain spoke those words 100 years ago. I believe, and \nfor the sake of our country I pray, that the Senate of 2003 is far \nbetter than the Senate of 1903, if that is what caused the Chaplain \nthen to make such a remark. Let all of us be sure to make it better \ntoday by our own conduct here.\n  There is someone else who is also responsible for this sneaky, slimy, \nand sordid shenanigan, and that, I regret to say, is Northwest \nAirlines, a major Minnesota company, founded in Minnesota, \nheadquartered in Minnesota, employing over 18,000 people in Minnesota. \nIt is one of Minnesota's most important companies. It is our link to \nthe world.\n  Northwest Airlines controls 85 percent of the gates at the \nMinneapolis-St. Paul Airport. It is comprised of 18,000 tremendous \npeople in Minnesota--executives, pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, \nbaggage handlers, reservation agents, skycaps. One by one they are \ngreat people: hard working, dedicated, loyal, courteous, and skilled in \nwhat they do.\n  As a corporate entity, however, Northwest Airlines more often acts \nlike Darth Vader than the Caped Crusader. The company is capable of \nwonderful acts of charity. Last year it helped to transport 10,000 \nboxes of Girl\n\n[[Page S10934]]\n\nScout cookies to soldiers stationed abroad. Every quarter it partners \nwith a worthwhile charity, and on every flight it asks passengers to \ndonate either their money or accumulated frequent flier miles, \nequivalent to money, to that worthwhile cause.\n  However, during my entire public career, going back 25 years as \nMinnesota's commissioner of economic development to being a Senator \ntoday, no other Minnesota company has ever asked for as much from the \npublic, received as much from the public, asked as much again and again \nfrom the public, received as much again and again from the public, and \nshowed as little gratitude, graciousness, or respect for the public as \nNorthwest Airlines.\n  In 1989, Northwest Airlines was subject to a hostile takeover. A \ncompany that at the time had a cash balance of over $700 million became \none saddled with over $2 billion in corporate debt. With the economic \ndownturn that began in 1990 and went into 1991, Northwest fell into \nserious financial difficulty and was near bankruptcy, we were informed. \nThat condition was caused by loss of revenues compounded by the debt \nload of their takeover. So Northwest Airlines came to the people of \nMinnesota for help, and the people of Minnesota responded.\n  The Minnesota Legislature authorized $710 million in grants and in \nlow-interest secured loans. The Metropolitan Airports Commission \nessentially remortgaged the airport to provide a loan of $350 million. \nThat is the same Metropolitan Airports Commission which Northwest \nAirlines now criticizes for every spending decision, for its supposed \nlack of frugality, forgetting it would be even more frugal if it had \nsaved the cost of carrying that loan for the last 12 years.\n\n  At the same time as that corporate bailout by the people of \nMinnesota, our State also began a 7-year agreed-upon timetable, a dual-\ntrack process to decide where to locate the new airport for our State \nand for the entire region: whether it should be the expansion of the \nexisting airport or building a new one at a more remote site.\n  By the mid-1990s, in the middle of that timetable, based on the \nseeming experience of the costly new airport in Denver and its effects \nfinancially on the airline industry, particularly those who had their \nhubs there, Northwest Airlines took a legitimate position in its own \ncorporate interest to oppose building a new airport elsewhere. But they \nwere so insistent on getting their own way that they convinced the \nGovernor and the Minnesota Legislature to abrogate after 6 years the \nfinal year of that intended 7-year process, cutting off the last year \nof public debate, cutting off the opportunity by those who are opposed \nto that decision, those who lived in the surrounding areas who were \nplagued by airport noise. They were denied their opportunities to make \ntheir last cases to the public decision makers.\n  Their lives were being made worse also, I note, by the noise of \nNorthwest Airlines' aging fleet of airplanes, the oldest of any of the \nmajor carriers at the time, which were not being replaced by the newer \nplanes originally on order because of the financial difficulties that \nthe corporate takeover put on the company. But at least in this \ninstance, Northwest went through the public process, and they \nprevailed.\n  As part of that agreement, they reportedly agreed to contribute $70 \nmillion to this next phase of noise insulation of homes and apartments \nin the surrounding areas. Northwest was hard hit on September 11, 2001, \nand its aftermath, as were other air carriers in this country, as were \nmany other businesses throughout this country, many of which went out \nof business as a result of the disruption to our economy caused by \nthose dastardly events.\n  They sought financial assistance from this body and from the \ninstitution of Congress. On September 22, Congress provided $5 billion \nof grants to the airline carriers, of which Northwest Airlines received \n$428 million in public funds, grant money, not to be repaid.\n  On April 3 of this year, as part of the supplemental appropriation, \nthis body, and its counterpart, authorized another $2.3 billion in \ngrant money of which Northwest Airlines will receive $205 million. In \naddition, we granted a 4-month ticket tax holiday. I supported every \nsingle one of those measures, and if Northwest Airlines' survival were \nat stake, I would support it again because it would be in the interests \nof both the company and the people of Minnesota.\n  For a company to be the recipient of all of that public support, to \nreceive all of that support from this institution of Congress, and then \nshow so little respect for the public and so little regard for the \nCongress or for the integrity of our public process, I find to be \ndeplorable, detestable, and deranged.\n  The money this airline company seeks to prohibit being expended to \nimprove the lives of their neighbors in Minnesota is not their money. \nIt is the public's money. It is Federal money that comes from general \nfunds, from ticket taxes or from passenger taxes. It is beyond \nirresponsible for any one person or any one corporation to try to \ndestroy the public will expressed through the legitimate public process \nby this kind of back-door maneuver. No one has that right. No one \ndeserves to have that right. And no one who shows such disrespect and \ndisregard for our Democratic process, which exists to represent the \ninterests of all of the people of this country, to protect the best \ninterests of all the people of this country, no one who tries to \nabrogate that democratic authority should get away with it. They must \nnot get away with it. It is too destructive to our democracy if they \ndo. It is too damaging to our citizens' faith in their Government and \nto their trust in their Government, which is their Government.\n  Northwest Airlines will not get away with this deviant, dastardly, \nand undemocratic action. Northwest Airlines will not get its way this \nway. This deed will not stand. It will not become law. The people of \nMinnesota have my word, it will not become law.\n  Before I began these remarks, I withdrew my 15 holds on those \nexecutive branch nominations at the specific request of the White \nHouse, out of my respect. I am mindful that a year ago, when I put 60 \nholds on nominations for various executive positions, the White House \nstaff responded in a most impressive way.\n  They worked with my office and other Senators' offices to rescue over \n200 Cambodian orphans from orphanages in Cambodia who were being \nprevented by the INS to be brought to this country by their adoptive \nparents.\n  To the great credit of the President of the United States, the White \nHouse used his ultimate authority to override that decision by INS and \nto make it possible for those children to come to loving homes in \nMinnesota and other States; and for that reason, and for my respect \ngenerally, I yielded to that specific request by the White House and \nwithdrew those 15 holds.\n  I have equally the greatest regard for this institution of the \nSenate, for all of its procedures, its protocols, and its proud \ntraditions.\n  I listened earlier today to the words of the majority leader, a man \nwhom I greatly respect. By his invitation, I was privileged to \naccompany him to China, Taiwan, Japan, and the Republic of Korea 2 \nmonths ago. I watched with the greatest of admiration how he led our \ndelegation and sat down face to face with some of the most important \nleaders of other nations in this world. He brought nothing but great \ncredit to this Senate. He and his predecessor in that position, now the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle are two men with dignity and with \nhonor. I am in awe of their continual patience. When they have \ndisagreements about policy or legislation, they are honest and they are \nhonorable. We have debates. We have votes and the majority prevails.\n\n  I also respect the desire of the majority leader to proceed with an \norderly schedule which he outlined when we return in September. In \nfact, I share that desire. But I must give fair warning and advance \nnotice that I will not permit the Senate to proceed with business as \nusual when we return on September 2, while this FAA conference report, \nwith this poisonous paragraph a part of it, is before the Senate. I \nwill put a hold on every nomination that comes before the Senate. I \nwill object to every motion to proceed after the prayer and the Pledge \nof Allegiance, and I will not yield on those matters until this \nlanguage is removed from that conference report. You have my word.\n  We have over a month until we return. That is plenty of time for \nthose who are party to this detestable act, to\n\n[[Page S10935]]\n\nwork it out and to get it out of that conference report.\n  Do not doubt my resolve. That language must be removed or I will not \nallow the business of the Senate to proceed. You have my word. You have \nmy word.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/08/01/senate-section/article/S10935-1", "month": "08", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2003 AT 9:30 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
