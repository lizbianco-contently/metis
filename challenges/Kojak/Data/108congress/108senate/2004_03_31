Mr. President, on leader time, I would like to just make a \ncouple comments on two events that took place last Wednesday.\n  On that day, two organizations made decisions that were very \ndisappointing to me. One of those organizations was the European Union \nand the other was the Senate Democrats. I was disappointed by the \nSenate Democrats because they chose to filibuster a very important \npiece of legislation that is critical to our jobs base, to our \nmanufacturing jobs base. That bill is called ``Jumpstart Our Business \nStrength, (JOBS) Act,'' which is an important bill. In fact, the title \nitself--``Jumpstart Our Business Strength''--underscores the importance \nof this manufacturing jobs bill.\n  I was also disappointed by the European Union's action to impose a \nrecord fine of $610 million against a company, Microsoft, because it, \nfrankly, demonstrates arrogance, I think--arrogance--requiring \nMicrosoft to sell a version of Windows that we are all familiar with \nwithout the built-in ability to play audio files or video files.\n  I mention both of these incidents really almost in the same breath \nbecause they occurred on the very same day last week, and they are \nillustrative of the choice that is facing America and Americans today.\n  I released a statement last week and pointed out these overreaching \nattempts to register e-commerce. They\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\ninclude trade barriers against American beef and other agricultural \nproducts, and they all demonstrate the European Union relentlessly \npursuing these protectionist policies that disproportionately harm \nAmerica's workers.\n  The JOBS Act is a bill that is absolutely critical for us to address. \nAs I said, the fact that the Democrats chose to filibuster that bill \nhas been very disappointing to me. It was developed in a strong \nbipartisan fashion, coming through the Finance Committee with every \nsingle Democrat on the committee voting in favor of the bill, including \nthe Democratic leader and the junior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  It is absolutely essential that we address this bill and that we pass \nthis bill in order to accelerate job creation in this country. The \npurpose of it is to bring our trade laws in compliance with our trade \nagreements and at the same time provide some of the badly needed \nreforms to further stimulate manufacturing growth. I mention both of \nthese issues because I think both need to continue to be addressed. I \nhope we can work out an appropriate arrangement to address the JOBS \nbill in the very near future.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with enormous enthusiasm and pride I rise \ntoday to commend President Bush and his national security team for the \ncontinually strong leadership they are providing in the ongoing global \nwar on terrorism, and particularly as they assist the Iraqi people in \ntheir imminent transition to sovereignty.\n  Almost 1 year ago, a coalition of nations, led by the U.S. Armed \nForces, and, indeed, those from Great Britain, liberated the Iraqi \npeople from decades of repressive, tyrannical rule at the hands of \nSaddam Hussein. That day, April 9, will long be celebrated in the \nhistory of Iraq.\n  Our President did the right thing--he did the right thing--in \ngathering a coalition of nations to rid Iraq of a leader who had used \nweapons of mass destruction against his own people, who had a regime of \nover 30 years of tyrannical oppression, murdered indiscriminately. This \nindividual simply had to be brought to the terms of accountability, \naccountability to his own people. That orderly process is now under \nway. He defied international law for over 12 years. Clearly America and \nthe world are safer today, and Iraq is a better place with a hopeful \nfuture as a result.\n\n  Tragically, the effort to make America and the world safer and to \ndefend freedom around the world is not without an enormous cost to this \nNation in terms primarily of lost lives and those who bear the scars \nand the wounds of war, and their families who must bear these losses. \nThey have our deepest compassion. I extend my heartfelt sympathies to \nthe families of the loved ones of those who have died and those who \nbear the wounds of combat. We are fortunate as a Nation to have \ndedicated citizens who willingly volunteer to make such great \nsacrifices to defend this Nation's liberty.\n  Just weeks ago, together with the distinguished Senator from Alaska \nand the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, I went to Iraq and \nAfghanistan and again looked into the faces of those brave young men \nand women and thanked them on behalf of the people of this Nation.\n  In just 3 months--91 days to be exact--the sovereignty that has been \nheld in trust by the Coalition Provisional Authority since Iraq was \nliberated on April 9, 2003, will be returned to the Iraqi people. This \nwill represent an important milestone on Iraq's path to freedom and \ndemocracy, but it is a path fraught with continuing dangers.\n  The recently adopted ``Transitional Administrative Law'' states that \n``the work of the [Iraq] Governing Council shall come to an end'' upon \nthe assumption of sovereignty by an Iraqi Interim Government on June \n30, 2004. The TAL further states that this Iraqi Interim Government \n``shall be constituted in accordance with a process of extensive \ndeliberations and consultations with cross-sections of the Iraqi people \nconducted by the Governing Council and the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority and possibly in consultation with the United Nations.''\n  Yesterday, the Armed Services Committee, which I am privileged to \nchair, received testimony from several Department of Defense officials \nregarding on-going military operations and activities in Iraq, and \npreparations for this transition to sovereignty. While some concerns \nabout details of the transition remain, I was greatly encouraged by the \ntestimony the Committee received. A coordinated process of deliberation \nand consultation with the Iraqi people is underway by the Coalition \nProvisional Authority, the Iraqi Governing Council, and representatives \nof the United Nations to define and select an Iraqi Interim Government.\n  Much remains to be done in this process, but it is a process that \nmust not be delayed. The moment has arrived for the coalition to move \nfrom occupying power to partner. The moment has arrived for the Iraqi \npeople to assume responsibility for their destiny.\n\n  The path to full freedom and democracy in Iraq will not be without \ndifficulty and missteps. That is to be expected, but we must not be \nafraid to continue that journey. Symbolically, much will change on June \n30. Iraq, after 30 plus years of isolation, will rejoin the community \nof nations and resume responsibility for its actions and relations with \nother nations. In terms of the reconstruction and security efforts \ninitiated by the Coalition Provisional Authority and coalition forces, \nlittle will change on July 1. Ongoing training of Iraqi Security \nForces, assistance in restoring security, revitalization of essential \ninfrastructure, and institutionalization of democratic processes will \ncontinue.\n  Two weeks ago, I traveled to Iraq, together with Senator Stevens and \nSenator Hollings. I was impressed by the progress that has been made \nsince I last visited that nation in July. The challenges ahead are \ndaunting, but the\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nspirit of our men and women in uniform, and that of the Iraqi people, \nwas reassuring and inspiring.\n  While the progress made in Iraq is substantial, it must be viewed in \nthe context of the entire Middle East. Iraq can serve as an example and \na beacon of hope, but much more complex issues must be addressed.\n  During my recent trip to the region for consultation with both U.S. \nand foreign leaders, there was a consistent expression of concern about \nthe continuing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The lack \nof progress toward a peaceful resolution continues to fan the flames of \ndiscontent across the entire region. The continuing violence breeds \nmore violence that will undermine positive developments anywhere else \nin the region. We must redouble our efforts to find common ground on \nthis difficult issue, if we are ever to achieve a peaceful world and \ntriumph over terror and violence.\n  There are more challenges ahead, and there will be disappointments. \nThat is clear. It is equally clear that President Bush and his national \nsecurity team are up to the challenge. President Bush has provided \nsteady, strong leadership in troubled times and will lead us to a \nsafer, more secure future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask Senator Allard if I could proceed for \n3 minutes and then he could finish the balance of the time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That would be fine.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that that be so.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3391-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE 9/11 COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I stood in this general area a couple years \nago and spoke out against the need for the 9/11 Commission. I am not \ngenerally an advocate of commissions. I think it is an abdication of \nour responsibility when we do it repeatedly. As a matter of fact, we in \nthe Senate should do the job of investigating what happened or what \ndidn't happen that perhaps should have been leading up to the events of \n\n9/11 and in the aftermath, as we went into Iraq. That is why we have \nthe Armed Services Committee. That is what Senator Warner, the \nchairman, is working on. That is why we have the Intelligence \nCommittee. I serve on that committee. We work assiduously to take a \ngood look at the intelligence, to see where the problems have been and \nsee what the solutions are.\n  Having said that, I think this Commission has shown a great deal of \ncalm and maturity. The leadership of the two senior members, former \nGovernor Kean and former Congressman Hamilton, has been thoughtful. \nMembers on both sides of the Commission have asked good and tough \nquestions. I may regret saying this when their final report comes out, \nbut I think they have been doing a good job. It is not an easy job \nbecause you are trying to deal with hundreds of witnesses and thousands \nof pages of evidence.\n  That leads me to the real point. I have had occasion to watch a \nnumber of national security advisers to Presidents over my 32 years in \nCongress, seven different Presidents and their national security \nadvisers. There have been some good ones of both parties but none \nbetter than Condoleezza Rice. This is an outstanding individual with a \nbrilliant mind, tremendous insight into what is going on in the world. \nI could give some anecdotes of why I believe that. For that reason, I \nam pleased she is going to come before the Commission. She is going to \ntake every question on and give a thoughtful, complete, thorough, and \nconvincing argument. She will do fine. I think it is unnecessary. Maybe \nthis whole process of whether she would testify has been unnecessary.\n\n  From a public relations standpoint, yes, she should have gone from \nthe very beginning. But there are some important separation-of-powers \nprinciples involved. Executive privilege is not insignificant. It is \nsomething that is woven in the very fabric of this country. We cannot \nhave a process where slowly but surely, in President after President \nafter President, executive privilege and separation of powers have been \neroded.\n  I have watched it. Yes, former national security advisers have waived \ntheir executive privilege and gone before Congress. I thought it was a \nmistake, regardless of party. I have always spoken out against that. So \nI do think it is important we say this is not a precedent. It should \nnot and cannot be a precedent, or you are not going to have men and \nwomen willing to give in confidence the best advice to the President or \nto give him the information he needs to hear without concern that some \nday some congressional person will have that person before them \ntestifying.\n  This is not an insignificant matter. It is very significant. Under \nthese extraordinary circumstances, we need to have everybody we can \ntestify in full, not so we can blame somebody but so we can plan for \nthe future and do a better job next time.\n  Condoleezza Rice will be the key to that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Virginia and \nMississippi for their comments. I want to talk a little bit about the \neconomy.\n  First of all, I want to point out this President inherited a bad \neconomy. When he inherited this bad economy, he could have taken the \nold solution to all of our problems: You increase taxes and spending \nand somehow the other things are going to be better.\n  He took a new approach. The new concept was you need to cut taxes. By \ncutting taxes, you are going to stimulate productivity and the economy \nis going to grow. So the President courageously stepped forward, got \nhis tax package passed out of the House and the Senate. The major tax \npackages were in 2001 and 2003. We did some in other years. We did a \nlittle dribbling and working to reduce taxes. The fact is, by reducing \ntaxes during a time when we had taxes at an all-time high, we have \nhelped the economy.\n  There is a lot of talk on the floor about how bad the economy has \nbeen, but that reaches back into the bad economy this President \ninherited when he moved into the Presidency.\n  The President's tax package is now beginning to work. Look at the \neconomic indicators put out by the Joint Economic Committee in February \nof 2004. We talk about the unemployment rate, and that is going down. \nEmployment is going up. Wages are going up. We have a chart that shows \nreal gross private domestic investment going up. Corporate profits are \ngoing up. We have another chart here that shows farm income is going \nup. We have sources of personal income. That is going up. Total output, \nincome and spending, those are going up. Production and business \nactivity is now going up. Common stocks, prices, and yields are all \ngoing up in response to the President's economic package.\n  I went on the Internet this morning to see what was being said there: \nConsumer spending strong, and business investment rebounding. It had a \nchart showing how those factors were coming together. That is this \nmorning. Then we see another chart that shows jobless claims continuing \nto trend downward. It shows an increase in the jobless rate at the time \nthe President inherited this economy, and now we see, as his tax \npackage has had an opportunity to go into effect, the jobless rate is \ngoing down.\n  The President's package for stimulating our economy has worked. It \nwould be a shame if we walked away from that and went back to the old \nsolutions which were to increase spending and raise taxes. That is the \nwrong solution at the wrong time.\n  The right solution is what the President has talked about. We need to \ncut taxes and spending in order that this economy continues to prosper, \nas we have seen in the figures from the last several months.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The new concept was you need to cut taxes. By \ncutting taxes, you are going to stimulate productivity and the economy \nis going to grow. So the President courageously stepped forward, got \nhis tax package passed out of the House and the Senate. The major tax \npackages were in 2001 and 2003. We did some in other years. We did a \nlittle dribbling and working to reduce taxes. The fact is, by reducing \ntaxes during a time when we had taxes at an all-time high, we have \nhelped the economy.\n  There is a lot of talk on the floor about how bad the economy has \nbeen, but that reaches back into the bad economy this President \ninherited when he moved into the Presidency.\n  The President's tax package is now beginning to work. Look at the \neconomic indicators put out by the Joint Economic Committee in February \nof 2004. We talk about the unemployment rate, and that is going down. \nEmployment is going up. Wages are going up. We have a chart that shows \nreal gross private domestic investment going up. Corporate profits are \ngoing up. We have another chart here that shows farm income is going \nup. We have sources of personal income. That is going up. Total output, \nincome and spending, those are going up. Production and business \nactivity is now going up. Common stocks, prices, and yields are all \ngoing up in response to the President's economic package.\n  I went on the Internet this morning to see what was being said there: \nConsumer spending strong, and business investment rebounding. It had a \nchart showing how those factors were coming together. That is this \nmorning. Then we see another chart that shows jobless claims continuing \nto trend downward. It shows an increase in the jobless rate at the time \nthe President inherited this economy, and now we see, as his tax \npackage has had an opportunity to go into effect, the jobless rate is \ngoing down.\n  The President's package for stimulating our economy has worked. It \nwould be a shame if we walked away from that and went back to the old \nsolutions which were to increase spending and raise taxes. That is the \nwrong solution at the wrong time.\n  The right solution is what the President has talked about. We need to \ncut taxes and spending in order that this economy continues to prosper, \nas we have seen in the figures from the last several months.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3392-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we have heard all these glowing figures \nfrom the other side of the aisle about this economy. I want to give a \nlittle dose of reality.\n  Today the unemployment insurance extension runs out. This Senate \nrefused to act. I don't know how many times Senator Cantwell has made \nthat unanimous consent request.\n  In my State, it is estimated if unemployment benefits are not \nextended, 314,344 workers will lose benefits in the first 6 months of \nthe year. This is outrageous.\n  This is the first time I can ever remember where a political party in \ncharge could care less about people who are unemployed. Look at the \nrecord here. This is real. Let's go back to the Hoover administration, \nwhen there was a decrease in job creation. During every other \nadministration--Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, \nCarter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton--private sector employment increased.\n  Not now. Here we are at a moment when people are running out of their \nunemployment extension. I will read you a letter written by Kathleen \nFontana of Scotts Valley, CA:\n\n       Dear Members of Congress: I am a single parent of two \n     teenage boys and unemployed and unable to apply for the \n     extension of UI. I was laid off July 2, 2004 . . . after 38 \n     years with TWA. Needless to say, I am 60 years old, having \n     been forced to live off my home equity loan in order to make \n     ends meet. The unemployment extension needs to be passed and \n     reinstated for us American citizens that are having these \n     financial difficulties in the career area. More jobs are \n     leaving the U.S. and more money is leaving here, too. Iraq is \n     only one example. Things need to change and people at home \n     need help too. . . . We need your votes to change this and \n     have the extension of UI benefits.\n\n  As I go around my State--and I have been doing that a lot--the basic \ntheme I am hearing is this: Senator, it is time for this country; it is \ntime for America; it is time to think about our people and our workers.\n  I could not even believe it. I went into farm country and the rice \nfarmers there who are sending their sons and daughters off to war--the \ncontracts for rice are for the people of Iraq; they went out of the \ncountry. This is taxpayer dollars, American taxpayer dollars. Instead \nof saying, OK, we are going to rebuild Iraq and do it with American \nbusiness and farmers, oh, no, we could not do that. Our State \nDepartment would not like that.\n  I am here to tell you there is something brewing in the countryside. \nPeople are angry about the fact that they seem to be last in line.\n  Let's look at some of these job loss numbers since this President \ncame into power. Under Ronald Reagan, we had 165,000 jobs created per \nmonth. That was terrific. He was a beloved President. Under George H.W. \nBush, 47,604 jobs were created a month. That was not very good. Under \nBill Clinton, there was an extraordinary leap, to 236,625 jobs created \nper month. That is why kids got lifted out of poverty.\n  I saw a chart Senator Santorum had and it is beautiful. It shows how \nthe African-American children are seeing poverty decline--up until last \nyear. It is because during the Clinton administration we did welfare \nreform and we had a great economy. Then under George W. Bush, 58,815 \njobs have been lost per month. It is a pathetic situation. If you \ntranslate that to my State, what we see in this situation is, again \nwhat has happened here and why we have to at least, A, be compassionate \nto the people who need extended unemployment benefits; B, we need to \nraise the minimum wage; C, we need to kill this administration's crazy \nidea to take overtime away from hard-working people.\n  Let's get this country back on track. It should be time for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3392-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3392-S3393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE COURSE OF MILITARY OPERATIONS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my concerns about the \ncourse of our military operations in Iraq.\n  I returned about 10 days ago from a trip to Iraq with my colleagues. \nAfter a brilliant offensive campaign to destroy the Iraqi military \nforces, we have settled into a very dismal and dangerous occupation. In \nthe last few hours, five more American military personnel were killed \nby an improvised explosion device. There were four more civilians who \nwere killed. Iraqi security forces have died in much higher numbers.\n  The administration has not responded appropriately to the military \ndemand within Iraq today. One of the leading points that illustrates \nthis, I think, irresponsible approach to Iraq is the failure to budget \nproperly to fund this effort. The operation in Iraq costs approximately \n$4 billion a month. Yet in the 2005 budget that was submitted by the \nadministration, there is no money for operations in Afghanistan or \nIraq. They are still working off the supplemental that was passed last \nyear. But the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps testified they are \nseriously concerned that on October 1 they will begin to run out of \nmoney. They are already being forced to reprogram funds, to rob Peter \nto pay Paul in order to continue this operation.\n  Having committed ourselves to Iraq, we must prevail, and to prevail, \nwe must fund all of the requirements for our military. We must do it \nadequately and promptly, and the administration is doing neither. We \nhave a requirement for many pieces of equipment. But probably \nemblematic of the difficulties of this operation, the two most pressing \nitems of equipment are body armor and armored vehicles, principally \nuparmored Humvees. When we went into this operation, we did not \nunderstand the consequences of the occupation, the threats to our \ntroops, the political rivalries in Iraq, the ethnic and sectarian \ndivisions of the country.\n  As a result, we found ourselves with troops in the field without \nproper equipment. Many lacked body armor, the kind of sophisticated \narmor with ceramic insert plates that provide a margin of safety for \nour troops. The Army and Department of Defense claimed they fixed it. \nBut as late as March 26, reports in the San Diego Union, Boston Globe, \nand USA Today stated soldiers in Iraq are calling home and asking their \nfamilies to buy them body armor and send it to them, or they are buying \nit before they deploy. That is unacceptable. That is one example.\n  With respect to uparmored Humvees, last July I got off of the \naircraft in Baghdad and approached the military policemen from the \n118th Military Police Battalion from Rhode Island. The first request I \nhad was: Get us uparmored Humvees. We are driving through these \ndangerous cities and we need that protection.\n  We have not reached the number of uparmored Humvees we need for \ncritical troops in Iraq. This might be accomplished by November of this \nyear, but it is a long time from the need of over a year ago and \nfinally filling the requirement.\n  We also have to armor other Humvees, and armor kits have been \nprovided to do this armoring. Again, the administration's budget is not \nsufficient. The Secretary of the Army said: We are going to get all \nthis equipment done. We are going to run the production line at top \nspeed.\n  Yet the money is not there in the budget. We have to do more.\n  Last September, Senator Hagel and I offered an amendment to the \nsupplemental to increase the size of the Army by 10,000 troops. This \nwas vehemently objected to by the Secretary of Defense, but I think \nthey eventually got the message. A few months ago, the Department of \nthe Army announced they were going to increase the size by 30,000 \ntroops. But they are not going to ask for the money in the budgetary \nprocess. They are once again going back to the supplemental--to take \nmoney from the supplemental, which already is strapped to pay for \noperations. As a result, we will have, I hope, additional forces in the \nmilitary,\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nbut we will not have the ordinary budget authority they need to \ncontinue to be funding when we run out of this supplemental.\n  Those are examples of some of the failures on our part, but they are \nfailures multiplied with the situation with respect to Iraqi security \nforces. Our plan is to transfer, we hope one day, security operations \nto the Iraqis. Yet we have not provided sufficient equipment for these \nforces.\n  Senior commanders in Iraq have commented persistently about the lack \nof adequate equipment for the security forces, and a March 22 New York \nTimes article stated:\n\n       Senior American commanders in Iraq are publicly complaining \n     that delays in delivering radios, body armor and other \n     equipment have hobbled their ability to build an effective \n     Iraqi security force that can ultimately replace United \n     States troops here.\n\n  MG Charles Swannack, commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, has \nreturned from Iraq and his frustrations on this point are extremely \nsignificant. He said, in retrospect, if he knew the equipment was not \ncoming, he would have used his own resources to buy body armor, radios, \nand vehicles for these Iraqi security forces. We are not doing enough \nto provide replacement for our own forces, and we are not adequately \nfunding our present forces in the field.\n  Those points are examples, I believe, of the failings in terms of \noccupation planning and military occupation of Iraq. But there are also \npolitical failures. We are less than 100 days away from transferring \nauthority to an interim government, and yet no one can tell us what \nthat interim government will look like. Will it be an increased \ngoverning council with 20, 30, 40 more people? Is it going to be a \nthree-person presidency with a prime minister? We are 100 days or less \naway from that transfer of authority. We have yet to have a nominee to \nbe the new ambassador to Iraq. Mr. Bremer leaves on June 30, but we \nhave yet to have a name submitted to us for consideration and \nconfirmation for someone who will have extraordinary challenges, \nextraordinary responsibilities. And yet we are 100 days or less away \nfrom the new ambassador of the United States to Iraq taking his or her \npost.\n  Probably most emblematic, most symbolic of the political difficulties \nis the de-Baathiciation program. One of the key problems of this \nprogram is it is being run by Chalabi. Chalabi is an individual in the \nIraqi National Congress who provided most of the misinformation to the \nadministration as they made their judgments about the imminence of a \nthreat in Iraq. He has been on our payroll to the tune of about \n$300,000 a month funneled through the Iraqi National Congress for many \nyears. He is still on the payroll. He has seized all the security files \nof the former Iraqi security agency which perhaps are a treasure trove \nof names of people who collaborated both inside Iraq and outside Iraq \nwith the Saddam Hussein regime. But most importantly for the moment, he \nis in charge of vetting former Baathists to take positions in this new \ngovernment.\n  He is sitting at the crossroads of billions of dollars of contracts \nfrom his position on the Iraqi Governing Council. He is also an \nindividual who has the right to deny people their civil rights, if you \nwill, in Iraq, and he is someone whose record does not, I think, \nsuggest he is capable of discharging those responsibilities in the \ninterest of Iraq or in the interest of the United States. The key to \nMr. Chalabi is self-interest and always has been.\n  As a result, we are giving this individual inordinate power. This is \nnot just a theoretical political argument. When I was in Iraq last \nNovember, I spoke to the division commander, and he complained to me he \nhad 1,000 schoolteachers who could not teach because they had been \nnominal members of the Baath Party. Back in the days of Saddam Hussein, \nin order to have a job in Iraq of any consequence, you had to have a \nBaath affiliation. These people cannot work. Schools cannot open. \nAnd so this new Iraq we are desperately trying to build based upon not \njust security, but also economic development and education, has not yet \ntaken off.\n\n  This is just one example of the political miscalculation I believe in \nwhich the provisional authority, Ambassador Bremer, has engaged in \nIraq.\n  All of this is very important. We are, again, weeks away from \ntransferring authority to some form of government of which we know not \nthe exact details. We are also in a situation where each day we see the \ncost in terms of American lives.\n  Let me make one final point. When I was in Iraq talking with American \nsoldiers about 10 days ago, the palpable concern they had with these \nexplosive devices was obvious. We have soldiers who are paying Iraqis \nto put some type of armor on their doors because canvas doors do not \nstop a lot of small arms rounds or anything else.\n  We owe much more to those troops. We owe a budget that is real and \ntimely, and we owe leadership here that will respond to their needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3393-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota controls 60 minutes, and the Senator from \nOklahoma controls 30 minutes for debate only. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I \nbelieve we are going to have debate that will last about an hour and a \nhalf. My colleague from North Dakota will be in control of an hour and \nmyself or Senator Gregg will be in control of 30 minutes. At the \nconclusion of that debate time, we expect to appoint conferees. The \nHouse has already appointed conferees. They appointed conferees on \nMonday. We expect to appoint conferees at the conclusion of our debate \ntime. And for the information of our colleagues, and especially the \nconferees--hopefully they have been notified--we will have a conference \nthis afternoon beginning at 2:30. We will go as long as necessary to \nhear everybody's viewpoints on both the House and Senate budget \nproposals and any constructive suggestions they might have to improve \nthem. I look forward to that discussion.\n  I would love to see us come out of conference with a bipartisan \nbudget. That usually has not happened in the recent past, but I would \nlove for it to happen in this case.\n  Again, we look forward to going to conference and resolving the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate. There are not a lot of \ndifferences. The numbers are pretty close on the outlay side, and the \nnumbers are pretty close on the revenue side. There are some \ndifferences, and we will have to work those out. There are some \ndifferences in enforcement provisions. We will work those out. That is \nwhat conferences are for. They are compromises between the House and \nthe Senate.\n  I compliment our colleagues in the House for passing a budget. We \nactually passed a budget the week before last. I thank all of our \ncolleagues. We actually ended up passing the budget after 4 days. The \nlast day was a fairly long day. It lasted into Friday morning, about \n1:30 in the morning. We did it with 25 votes. That was half the number \nof votes we had the previous year. The previous year we had 51 votes. \nThose votes dealt with a lot of different issues. Hundreds of billions \nof dollars in new taxes were proposed, and hundreds of billions of \ndollars in new spending were proposed, most of which were defeated. We \naccepted some amendments, and we will work through those amendments.\n  We have other issues, I will tell my colleague, and he is well aware \nof it. My colleague from North Dakota is very familiar with the budget. \nThere is a reserve fund, and there are a lot of different issues. The \nHouse has some, and we have some. We have to work those out. That is \nwhat budgets are for.\n  The House intends to pass this bill this week. That means we have to \ndo a lot of work. Some work has already happened behind the scenes. \nChairman Nussle and I have been trying to resolve issues and lay the \ngroundwork, but a lot of major decisions have yet to be made. Again, \nthat is what conferences are for.\n  So I look forward to working with all of our colleagues in the \nSenate, especially the conferees, to come up with a budget resolution \nthat will significantly reduce the deficit. I say significantly reduce \nthe deficit, the budget we passed in the Senate would reduce the \ndeficit, which is far too high, by half in 3 years.\n  I hope we can meet that goal coming out of the conference committee. \nThat is not easy. It is not easy in any way, shape, or form. So I want \nto make sure everyone is aware of that.\n  Again, I thank our colleagues for their cooperation. I thank my \ncolleague from North Dakota for his cooperation today because we will \nget conferees appointed, we will go to conference, and, frankly, we \nwill meet as long as necessary to get this job done. That certainly is \nour intention.\n  I had hoped that possibly the Senate could pass the budget resolution \non Friday. I believe it is the majority leader's intention, if the \nconference agreement is reached and the House passes it this week, that \nwe would take it up on the Senate floor next Thursday. That is \ncertainly acceptable with this Senator, and I will be happy to work \nwith all of our colleagues to make that happen.\n  For the information of our colleagues, once a conference agreement is \nreached, the rules of the Senate provide for 10 hours of debate and a \nvote on the budget resolution. Unless things change, I expect that \nwould be sometime next Thursday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I inquire of the chairman and make sure I have \nheard this correctly, that the chairman has indicated the leader \nintends to bring the budget conference agreement up for final debate \nand a vote on Thursday next?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct, a week from Thursday.\n  Mr. CONRAD. A week from Thursday?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairman for his courtesies as we have gone \nthrough the process. I think because we both worked together \nproductively yesterday, we came to a reasonable conclusion about how to \nproceed today.\n  I want to thank the chairman for his patience yesterday as we worked \nthrough a number of issues with a lot of colleagues to avoid many more \nvotes that, in my judgment, would have been unnecessary and not \nadvanced the ball in any constructive way. So I thank the chairman for \nhis patience yesterday.\n  I was somewhat surprised to read in the New York Times this morning \ncomments of certain House Republican leaders, specifically the majority \nleader, yesterday about where we are headed in this country with these \nmassive deficits. We have the largest deficits in the history of the \ncountry by almost any measure, and we see going forward deficits even \nmuch larger than these as the baby boomers retire, which is of much \ngreater concern to this Senator. That is the course the President is \ntaking us on. In my judgment, it is a reckless course and a course that \nwill\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\nthreaten the economic security of this country for a long period of \ntime. So this morning when I read the New York Times and I saw that \nRepublican Congressman DeLay of Texas, the majority leader in the \nHouse, `` . . . restated a view that has been cited by other Republican \nHouse leaders: tax cuts pay for themselves by generating economic \ngrowth that more than makes up for lost revenue.''\n  Mr. DeLay went on to say:\n\n       We, as a matter of philosophy, understand that when you cut \n     taxes, the economy grows, and revenues to the government \n     grow. The whole notion that you have to cut spending in order \n     to cut taxes negates that philosophy, so I'm not interested \n     in something that would negate our philosophy.\n\n  I am a lot less interested in philosophy than I am in what works in \nthe real world. The philosophy that Mr. DeLay has espoused, and others \nhave as well, that somehow taxes are cut and that produces more \nrevenue, the problem is it has not worked. Let's be direct. Let's go \nback to what the Congressional Budget Office told us back in 2001. \nLooking forward, they said there was a range of possible outcomes with \nrespect to the budget surpluses. Remember then they were telling us we \nwere going to have these massive budget surpluses, but they said there \nwas a range of possible outcomes expressed. By this chart, I call it \nthe fan chart, the forecast that was adopted was right in the middle of \nthis range of possible outcomes.\n  Now, this is how this is relevant to what Mr. DeLay is telling us. I \nwas told by a Republican colleague, a Senator: You are being much too \nconservative. Do you not understand that these surpluses are going to \nbe bigger than CBO is forecasting because of the tax cuts?\n  I was told repeatedly by my Republican colleagues when I warned them \nthat betting on a 10-year forecast of these surpluses was risky, that \nit was dangerous, that it was unlikely that it was going to be such a \nrosy scenario, and over and over again my Republican colleagues told \nme: Senator, you are too conservative. Do you not understand that when \ntaxes are cut, there is more revenue? Do you not understand these \nsurpluses, after we pass the tax cut, will be even bigger than the \nCongressional Budget Office has forecast, even bigger than the \nPresident's Office of Management and Budget has forecast?\n\n  I said: Well, that is a nice theory but I do not believe it. I do not \nthink we are going to wind up with bigger surpluses because of these \ntax cuts. In fact, I think we are going to find the surpluses \nevaporate, and I said so dozens of times on the Senate floor. I said so \ndozens of times in the Budget Committee.\n  Now we can go back and check the record. Let's see what happened in \nthe real world, not based on some philosophy, not based on some \nideology. Here are the range of projected surpluses the Congressional \nBudget Office told us about. The midline is their official forecast. We \npassed the tax cuts. In fact, we have passed three rounds of tax cuts. \nDid we get more revenue and, as a result, did we get even bigger \nsurpluses, which is what our Republican friends told us was going to \nhappen? No. Here is what has happened in reality.\n  This is the red line. With all the tax cuts, we have wound up with \nnot surpluses but deficits. So the philosophy that apparently was the \nguiding hand, that said cut taxes and there will be more revenue, and \nas a result even bigger surpluses, did not work in the real world.\n  In the real world, what we got was not surpluses but massive \ndeficits. What we got in the real world was not a tax-cut-driven surge \nin surpluses, what we got is massive record deficits. So everybody is \nentitled to their own philosophy, everybody is entitled to their own \nideology, but all of that gets measured against what happens in the \nreal world.\n  What has happened in the real world is the surpluses have evaporated \nand now we have record deficits. All of these claims by our friends, \nthat if we had just had this massive package of tax cuts we would get \nmore revenue, we would get more surpluses, did not work out. It did not \nwork out.\n  So now I say to my friends, we better get serious about getting this \ntrain back on the track because we are headed for very big trouble.\n  If we look at the record on deficits over a very long period of time \ngoing back to 1969, here is what we see: Under the President's plan, we \nhave now seen the deficits absolutely skyrocket. This theory that we \nwere going to get more revenue and bigger surpluses did not work out. \nInstead, we got a massive increase in deficits and a massive increase \nin debt. Some of our friends on the other side say not to worry, that \nas a share of the gross domestic product the deficits are not as big as \nthey have been in the past.\n  I say to my colleagues, if one does a fair analysis of the operating \ndeficits of the country--that is, take out Social Security instead of \nusing Social Security funds to float this boat; do as the law requires \nwhen calculating the deficits and not include the Social Security funds \nand look at this budget on an operating basis--what we find is that as \na share of GDP, the deficit this year has been only exceeded once since \n1947. That was back in 1983, when it was 6 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. Now it is 5.5 percent.\n\n  Those who seek to minimize the size of these deficits by this claim \nare misleading the American people as to the true fiscal condition of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On the previous chart, am I to understand that in \ndollar terms the deficit now is at a record level?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. In dollar terms the deficit this year----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the highest it has ever been?\n  Mr. CONRAD. By $100 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is the highest it has ever been.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It exceeded last year's deficit, which was the previous \nrecord, by $100 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I also understand when they try to put it in percentage \nterms as a share of the economy, that it is almost at the highest level \nit has been since the end of World War II. Of course, we had to fight \nWorld War II. We had a significant deficit and ran up the debt. But it \nis almost at the highest it has ever been, and it is projected, as I \nunderstand it, to go higher; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. If we look ahead, look over just the next few years, \nwhat we see, under the President's own calculations, the deficit as a \nshare of our Nation's income is even going to get larger. These are \nrecord deficits. As we can see, even as a share of the national income, \nthis deficit is the second highest it has been since World War II, only \nexceeded by 1983.\n  Interestingly enough, I would say to my colleague, in 1983 the Social \nSecurity surplus was only several hundred million dollars.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Million?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Million. Now the Social Security surplus is $160 billion, \nand under the President's plan, under the Republicans' plan, they are \ntaking every dime of Social Security money and using it to pay for tax \ncuts and using it to pay for other expenditures.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Isn't it interesting, if you will put the \nother chart up there--Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding \nfor a question--how the old labels don't mean anything anymore--what is \nconservative and what is liberal. We are now looking at record \ndeficits, and they say this is a conservative budget? It seems to me it \nis exactly the opposite, that the reckless spending and tax policies \nthat end up with fiscal policy that is running the country into debt \nare exactly the opposite of conservative fiscal policy. To the \ncontrary, it is reckless liberal policy that is driving our country \ninto economic doldrums.\n  Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to the Senator, we look at each of these budget \nproposals from the other side and, under any one of them, they are \ngoing to add $3 trillion to the national debt over the next 5 years. \nAnd the next 5 years is the good times. After that, the baby boomers \nretire and the full cost of the President's tax cuts explode. Then you \nsee the real effect of these policies.\n  Frankly, I am less concerned about the deficits we face in the near \nterm. I\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\nam much more concerned that under the President's plan we don't see any \nend to these deficits. In fact, the additions to the debt absolutely \nexplode and at the worst possible time, right before the baby boomers \nretire.\n  The President has said it is the slowdown in the economy that is the \nproblem. The Congressional Budget Office issued a report just the other \nday. This is the New York Times report on the CBO research. It says:\n\n       When President Bush and his advisers talk about the \n     widening Federal budget deficit, they usually place part of \n     the blame on economic shocks ranging from the recession of \n     2001 to the terrorist attacks that year. But a report \n     released on Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \n     Office estimated that economic weakness would account for \n     only 6 percent of a budget shortfall that could reach a \n     record $500 billion this year.\n       The new numbers confirm what many analysts have predicted \n     for some time: That budget deficits in the decade ahead will \n     stem less from the lingering effects of the downturn and much \n     more from the rising Government spending and progressively \n     deeper tax cuts.\n\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle don't want to talk about \nthe effect of the tax cuts. That is missing in action as part of the \ncontributor to these massive deficits. The fact is, deficits are the \ncreation of the relationship between spending and revenue. It is the \ntwo of them that have to be focused on if we are going to deal with \nthese deficits. We are hearing from the other side that the President \nsays he is going to cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years.\n  Here is what we see. He does that by just leaving out things. He \nleaves out any war costs past September 30 and he leaves out the \nalternative minimum tax, which was the old millionaire tax, and has now \nbecome a middle-income tax trap.\n  When you put those things back in, what you see is additions to the \ndebt are not being reduced. Additions to the debt are not being cut in \nhalf. Additions to the debt continue at extraordinarily high levels for \nthe entire rest of the decade, and, again, right before the baby \nboomers retire.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator, I think it is an extremely \nimportant point. Even if you reduce the deficit--and the President is \nmaking these enormously favorable assumptions about how much he can \nreduce the deficit. Every analysis has, in effect, undercut the \nadministration's statement and said the deficit, year to year, will be \nlarger. But any deficit you run becomes an addition to the debt, so the \ndebt continues to grow.\n  As the chart of the Senator shows, it grows in alarming proportions. \nThat is a burden that then is saddled on the next generation which they \nhave to pay off almost indefinitely into the future.\n  I say to the Senator, I think he is making an extremely important \npoint, to underscore the fact that the debt continues to explode even \nunder favorable assumptions by the administration.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is one of the most startling things, if you examine \nthe President's proposals. The President, who has represented himself \nto the American people as conservative, has the most radical budget \nplan ever put before this country. That is because he is absolutely \nexploding the debt right before the baby boomers retire. When he says \nhe is going to cut the deficit in half, what he has done is he has left \nout things that we all know are going to be expenses. For example, he \nhas left out funding for the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, the \nwar on terror. He says there is no cost past September 30 of this \nyear--none.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the cost is $280 billion over \nthis next period of time. The House and the Senate have put in these \nmuch smaller amounts, $50 billion in the House, $30 billion in the \nSenate. But the Congressional Budget Office says that is not what this \nis going to cost. It is going to cost $280 billion.\n  We see that same pattern with other elements in the President's plan. \nHere is the cost in the 10 years of the President's tax cuts. Do you \nnotice a pattern? This dotted line is the end of the 5-year budget \nproposal of the President. In previous years he did 10-year budgets. \nNow he is down to 5 years because I am afraid he wants to hide from the \nAmerican people the full effect of his budget plan. Just looking at the \ntax side of it, you can see the cost of his proposed tax cuts \nabsolutely explode outside the 5-year budget window. In effect, he is \nhiding from the American people the true fiscal condition of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as the Senator did yield, I ask \nthe Senator, our ranking member on the Budget Committee, isn't it \ninteresting that when we voted on all these issues in the Budget \nCommittee and on the floor of the Senate, that organizations that rate \nthe votes, even respected organizations such as the National Journal, \nwhen they determined what is liberal and what is conservative, in the \nvotes the Senator from North Dakota and I were casting against raising \nthe deficit in the outyears, lo and behold, they rated our vote as \nliberal when, in fact, our vote is conservative, not to run the \ncountry, over the next 10 years, into this extraordinary national debt \nthat is going to build up like it is a rocket taking off.\n  Mr. CONRAD. What one calls these things and what label one puts on \nthem is striking. The fact is, whatever one calls it, what is being \ndone is not conservative--to run record deficits not just at a time of \neconomic weakness, and not just at a time that we are engaged in a \nconflict, but for the foreseeable future, for 10 years in the future, \nmassive increases in debt under the President's plan.\n  I showed this chart which talks about the pattern of the President's \ntax cuts that explode beyond the 10-year window. We see the same thing \nwith the alternative minimum tax--a billionaire's tax--now becoming a \nmiddle-income tax trap with 3 million people affected. At the end of \nthis period, it is going to be 40 million people.\n  The President's budget only provides for dealing with that crisis in \nthe first year.\n  Look at the pattern of the cost of fixing it beyond that first year. \nIt absolutely skyrockets. The President provides nothing past the first \nyear, again hiding from the American people the full effect of his \nbudget plan. The President told us repeatedly he would not use Social \nSecurity money for other purposes. But when you look at his budget \nplan, that is not the case. He is taking every penny of Social Security \nsurplus over the next 10 years and using it to pay for tax cuts and for \nother things--$2.4 trillion, every penny of which has to be paid back, \nand the President has no plan to do so. That is a reckless plan; again, \nsomething the President pledged not to do.\n  The result is this is what we see happening to the debt of the United \nStates.\n  Remember in 2001 when the President told us he would have maximum \npaydown of the debt. He would be able to pay off all of the debt that \nwas available to pay off.\n  Now what we see is not debt being paid off but debt exploding from \nabout $6 trillion when he took over. We now anticipate it will be \napproaching $15 trillion by 2014.\n  Where is the money coming from?\n  I have already indicated we are borrowing every penny of Social \nSecurity surplus. It is not surplus at all because all that money is \ngoing to be needed when the baby boomers retire. It is borrowing every \npenny of Social Security surplus--$2.4 trillion. But he does not stop \nthere. He is borrowing money from all over the world: over $500 billion \nfrom Japan, and over $140 billion from China. Under the President's \nplan, we have even borrowed $69 billion from so-called ``Caribbean \nBanking Centers.'' He has borrowed over $40 billion from South Korea.\n  Think about this: America, the most powerful Nation in the world, and \nhere we are reduced to borrowing money from countries all over the \nworld, including South Korea.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Those are huge sums we are borrowing from these various \nnations in order to cover our deficit. This is debt they hold which the \nUnited States has to pay back.\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\n  The fact is, if you connect everything, what is happening in effect \nis, in order to give tax cuts to the elite, to the very wealthy, we are \nborrowing money, and we end up borrowing money from all of these \ncountries in order to finance the deficit that results from the tax \ncuts, and then saddling the next generation with the responsibility of \npaying on this debt out into the future.\n  It is incredible when you stop and think about it; that in order to \nfinance tax cuts here we are borrowing money from over there in order \nto do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't think the American people have yet had a chance \nto fully focus on where this is all headed. That is the thing that is \nmost alarming. I am less concerned about the current deficits even \nthough they are a record and they are appalling. I am much more \nconcerned about where the President's plan takes us. Even when he sees \neconomic growth reviving, his plan runs massive deficits and runs up \nthe debt in a dramatic way--meaning more borrowing and more borrowing \nand more borrowing.\n  Let me conclude. The result is we are seeing the effect on the value \nof our own dollar. The dollar has declined in value almost 30 percent \nagainst the euro in just the last 2 years.\n  Let me conclude with this: Economists are worried about the long-term \neffects of this weakening dollar and this heavy U.S. borrowing because \nnot only are we borrowing to finance the budget deficit, we are also \nborrowing because we are running massive trade deficits. This was in \nthe Washington Post on January 26 of this year:\n\n       Currency traders fretting over that dependency have been \n     selling dollars fast and buying euros furiously. The fear is \n     that foreigners will tire of financing America's appetites. \n     Foreign investors will be dumping U.S. assets, especially \n     stocks and bonds, sending financial markets plummeting. \n     Interest rates will shoot up to entice them back. Heavily \n     indebted Americans will not be able to keep up with rising \n     interest payments. Inflation, bankruptcies, and economic \n     malaise will follow.\n\n  This is a warning that is being sent to us about the recklessness of \nthe course that we are on.\n  If we need to have a reality check, 3 weeks ago, in the Wall Street \nJournal, they indicated Asian central banks have made a decision to \ndiversify out of dollar-denominated securities.\n  Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest man in this country, is \nreported, 2 weeks ago, as having made a $12 billion bet against the \nvalue of U.S. currency.\n  In article after article, we are seeing the danger and the warning \nsigns of the reckless course the President is taking us on.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, is it the case \nthat the former Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill, was fired for \nsaying essentially what the Senator from North Dakota is saying on the \nfloor today, talking about a fiscal policy that doesn't add up, about \nproposals to increase spending on defense, homeland security, and then \ncut taxes mostly for wealthy Americans, saying that it would result in \nbalance; is it not the case the Treasury Secretary under this \nadministration was fired for believing that this is irresponsible \nfiscal policy?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think it is very clear that the Secretary of the \nTreasury was fired because he resisted additional tax cuts.\n  I think in the short term, all of us supported tax cuts to give lift \nto the economy. We supported a much different package of tax cuts than \nthe President did because we thought it ought to go more toward middle-\nincome people and less to the high-end people to give more lift to the \neconomy.\n  If you put it in the hands of middle-income people, they are more \nlikely to spend it and give lift to the economy. In the short term, we \nproposed tax cuts that are actually larger than the President's to give \nlift to the economy. For the long term, we proposed about half as much \nin tax cuts because we were worried about sending this country into a \ntailspin created by exploding deficits and debt.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, to \nclarify what the Senator from Maryland asked and the question about \nborrowing money from South Korea, in fact the perversity is we actually \nborrow money from South Korea so we can reconstruct Iraq. It is not \neven money to invest in the strength of this country.\n  Aside from that, President Reagan talked about $1 trillion in debt \nwhen he took office. He said $1 trillion in debt is $1,000 bills \nstacked 67 miles high. As I look at what this President is proposing, \nhe is proposing a fiscal policy that says let us have another stack of \n$1,000 bills that goes 335 miles high in debt. Who is going to carry \nthat? Who is going to take care of that? Isn't it the case that the \nPresident is saying somebody else, somebody behind the tree, maybe our \nkids, maybe our grandkids but not us?\n  Is it the case that these proposals, this budget on the floor and the \nbudget submitted by the President, is a budget which is so seriously \nout of balance that we will in the long term have the largest deficit \nand the biggest debt in the history of humankind with no provision at \nall of asking anybody to own up to that responsibility?\n  Is it the case that the question Senator Conrad is asking here has to \ndo with accountability? When do we decide we have to make a u-turn and \nbegin moving toward responsibility? That is the point.\n  If I might make one final comment. I say to Senator Conrad, you are \nright, we proposed tax cuts, but in 2001 we also said: Let's not put in \nplace something permanent that could get us in trouble because we might \nhave some unforeseen circumstances. The other side said: No. Katie bar \nthe door. Let's do it all and don't worry. Be happy. Then we had a \nrecession, a terrorist attack, a war in Afghanistan, a war in Iraq.\n  The fact is, we had all kinds of unforeseen circumstances, and now we \nhave a situation that is calling for dramatically increased spending, \nas requested by this President. We have these long-term tax cuts and \nthe largest debt in history.\n  The Senator uses the term ``irresponsible.'' This is an irresponsible \nfiscal policy. The Senator does the Senate a great service, in my \njudgment, by coming to the floor with these charts and describing \nexactly to the American people what this fiscal policy is about.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perhaps nothing reveals more clearly than this next slide \nwhere this is all leading. This chart shows--and this is not my \nprojection; this is not a Congressional Budget Office projection--this \nis the President's own projection of where his budget policies are \ntaking it. This is from his budget, and the assumption is his tax \npolicies and his spending policies are adopted.\n  Look what it shows. These are record deficits, the biggest we have \never had. But they are dwarfed by what is to come, under the \nPresident's own analysis of where his policy is leading.\n  This shows as the baby boomers retire and the full cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts are realized, the President's plan takes us right \nover the cliff into deficits that dwarf the ones we are having now, \nwhich are of record size.\n  What could be more clear than we are on a course that is utterly \nunsustainable?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, do those projected deficits \nrise into double figures as a percent of the GDP? Am I correct in \nreading that chart? It is well up over 10 percent of GDP would be in \ndeficit? Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is actually over 12 percent of GDP. Economists say it \nis utterly unsustainable. This is the course the President is taking us \non. The President's plan is not conservative. This is a reckless plan. \nIt is a radical plan. It is a plan that cannot be allowed to continue.\n  This plan will jeopardize not only Social Security and Medicare, but \nmost of the rest of what the U.S. Government does, including our \nability to defend ourselves.\n  One does not need to take my word for it. We have been alerted by the \nhead of the Federal Reserve, who has told us we ought to now consider \ncutting Social Security benefits because we are, in his words, \n``overcommitted.'' And it is not just him. We can go to group after \ngroup that are responsible on budget issues that are saying: Look, you \nare on a course that is utterly reckless.\n  The President told us on the issue of Social Security: None of the \nSocial Security surplus will be used to fund other spending initiatives \nor tax relief.\n  That is what he told us in his 2002 budget. But what we see is \nsomething\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\nquite different. In fact, he is taking every penny of Social Security \nsurplus--again, it is really not surplus; it is surplus for the moment \nbecause when the baby boomers retire, all that money is going to be \nneeded--he is taking every penny, $2.4 trillion over the next decade, \nand using it to fund primarily tax cuts.\n  It is very interesting, when you do the analysis, the cost of his tax \ncut proposals over the same period is almost the identical amount--$2.5 \ntrillion of income tax cuts, being funded by $2.4 trillion of Social \nSecurity money.\n\n  So you have the specter of taking money from payroll taxes and using \nit to fund income tax cuts that overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest 1 \npercent in this country.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion, I ask our leader on the Budget Committee: How in the world \ncould our friends, who call themselves conservatives, vote for anything \nbut a conservative budget such as this that, as the Senator from North \nDakota has characterized it, is radical?\n  How could our friends, who claim they want to protect the Social \nSecurity surplus, vote for a budget that raids all of that surplus to \nfinance tax cuts, primarily for the more well-to-do?\n  How could our friends, who call themselves conservative, in fact, \nfinance a lot of this budget for a prescription drug benefit that was a \nbailout to the pharmaceutical and insurance companies, and, lo and \nbehold, was not what it was sold as--$400 billion over 10 years--but, \ninstead, $535 billion?\n  How could our conservative friends vote for a budget like this?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not know. But I know this: History will not treat \nthem kindly. When people have a chance to look back and see the \ndecisions that were made here and now, and where it is leading, history \nwill not treat them kindly.\n  On this question of spending and revenue, here is the historical \nchart on spending, again, as a share of gross domestic product. You can \nsee it goes back to 1981. In the 1980s, spending, as a share of GDP, \ngot to 23.5 percent. At the end of the Clinton years, spending was down \nto 10.4 percent of GDP. It is very interesting. Spending, as a share of \ngross domestic product, went down each and every year of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Now we have had a significant bump up. Ninety-one percent of that \nincrease is defense, homeland security, rebuilding New York, and the \nairline bailout. That is where the money has gone. But even with that \nincrease, you can see spending is well below where it was in the 1980s \nand 1990s as a share of GDP.\n  The revenue side of the equation, however, which our friends never \nwant to talk about--and I started this morning by quoting Mr. DeLay, \nwho said: You cut taxes, you get more revenue.\n  Well, that is a theory. It is a philosophy. It is an ideology. The \nproblem is, it does not work in the real world.\n  Here is what has happened to revenue. Revenue has collapsed to the \nlowest level as a share of national income since 1950. So their \ntheories are not working in the real world, and the result is, we have \na weakening economy.\n  I ask the Chair, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-three minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have 23 minutes. The other side has?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-six minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Twenty-six. Mr. President, I will just move through this \nquickly, and ask others to comment if they would like the opportunity, \nand give time to the other side to respond. I see Senator Gregg is here \nand Senator Grassley is here.\n  We see a job loss that is very unusual. The pattern of this job loss, \nin comparison to every other recession since World War II, is very \ninteresting. The dotted red line on this chart is the average of every \nrecession since World War II. You can see, 17 months after the business \ncycle peaked, of all the other recessions, you saw us pulling out of \njob loss. Jobs were being created in a very favorable way in each of \nthe other nine recessions.\n  But look at this downturn. We still do not see job recovery \noccurring, and we are 35 months past the business cycle peak. Something \nis wrong. Something is not working. We are now 5.4 million jobs short \nof the typical recovery. We have all seen this chart. For private \nsector jobs, 3 million have been lost since January of 2001.\n  Now we turn to the budget our friends have proposed on the other \nside. They say they are going to cut the deficit in half over the next \n3 years. Well, I say to our friends, I look at what is being added to \nthe debt under their plan: $612 billion this year, and every year \nthereafter over $550 billion being added to the debt. I do not see any \nbig improvement here in terms of what is being added to the debt. In \nfact, I see almost no change under the proposal by our Senate \nRepublicans.\n  I hear them say they are reducing the deficit, cutting it in half \nover the next 3 years. The fact is, if you put this thing on automatic \npilot and we made no policy changes, the deficit would decline more \nrapidly. They are actually increasing the deficit with this plan by \n$178 billion over the next 5 years, compared to doing nothing.\n  If you look at the priorities, you have to question those as well. \nThose who are the wealthiest 1 percent, earning over $337,000 a year, \ntheir tax cut for this coming year is $45 billion. On the other hand, \nto restore the cuts of the education program No Child Left Behind would \ncost $8.6 billion. So we are saying it is more important that the top 1 \npercent, those earning over $337,000, get every penny of their tax cut \nthan to restore the money for No Child Left Behind.\n  The same is true with other important priorities: The firefighters, \n$250 million to restore the cuts on them compared to $45 billion for \nthe cost of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent, those earning \nover $337,000 a year.\n  If we look at the House budget resolution, we see the same thing in \nterms of additions to the debt, only it is even worse. I don't see any \nbig improvement here. They say they are going to cut the deficit in \nhalf. But if you look at increases to the debt, what you see is they \nare going to be adding $600 billion to the debt year after year of the \nentire budget window. Just like our Senate colleagues add to the \ndeficit, they add $301 billion to the deficit over the next 5 years, in \ncomparison to doing nothing.\n  Interestingly enough, when I look at the discretionary spending limit \nthat was set in the Senate a year ago, the budget the Republican House \nhas sent us exceeds that limit, that self-imposed limit that was put on \nhere. They are going to spend $871 billion under their plan. A year ago \nthey put a spending limit of $814 billion.\n  The other point that needs to be made is, additions to the debt. \nThere is almost no difference between the Bush budget. He is adding $3 \ntrillion to the debt in the next 5 years; the Senate budget, $2.9 \ntrillion; the House, $3 trillion. So there is very little difference.\n  Finally, on the issue of PAYGO--this is the procedure to make it \nharder to spend the money and to pass tax cuts given our fiscal \ncondition--Mr. Greenspan has said:\n\n       I would, first, Mr. Chairman, restore PAYGO and \n     discretionary caps. Without a process for evaluating various \n     tradeoffs, I see no way that any group such as Congress can \n     come to set priorities which will effectively reflect the \n     will of the American people.\n\n  We restored the provisions to make it more difficult to spend new \nmoney for past tax cuts in the Senate. The House did not. They failed \non a tie vote of 209 to 209. This is going to be the critical test in \nconference. For those who say they are fiscally conservative, this is \ntheir chance to prove it. Because if we don't put in place the budget \ndisciplines that have worked in the past to eliminate deficits and to \nget us on a more firm financial footing, we will have failed the \nAmerican people.\n  I ask the Chair how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And the Senator has 26 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-six minutes, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Gregg has been waiting patiently. I think it is \nprobably more useful that they would take some of their time at this \npoint.\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am, of course, always impressed by the Senator from North Dakota, \nalthough there is a darkness to his presentation. There is a sense of \ndoom he puts forward I am not necessarily a subscriber to. But he \ncertainly is a person who has committed himself to understanding the \nnumbers and trying to present them in a form that most adequately and \nappropriately reflects his view of where we are as a Nation fiscally.\n  It is hard to guess, but I suspect it was in the range of 50 \ndifferent charts. There were a lot of charts. Some of them were charts \nthat were charts on top of charts which restated the chart that came \nbefore the chart, but they were good charts. They were excellent \ncharts--very colorful and nicely presented.\n  What we did not see was a chart that presented the Democratic budget. \nWhere is it? Where is the budget from the other side of the aisle that \naddresses all these concerns which have been raised by the other side \nof the aisle about the Republican budget? It does not exist. No budget \nhas been offered. No budget was offered in the committee, and no budget \nis going to be offered here in the Chamber. Why is that? Because if you \nlook at the substance of what is being presented by the other side, \nthey are basically saying, in order to address this problem, they are \ngoing to raise taxes. That is the only logical conclusion you can reach \nby looking at their position.\n  What does a tax increase in the middle of a recovering economy do? It \nstifles it. It creates a compression of that economic recovery, causes \nit to retract itself, and it will cost jobs. The worst fiscal policy we \ncould pursue would be to raise taxes. Maybe that isn't their proposal, \nbut we don't have a proposal from them to reflect what it would be. No \nresponsibility is put forward for actually answering the questions \nwhich have been raised, assuming they are even legitimate questions, \nfrom the other side of the aisle.\n  So let's turn to the nominee of their party to see if that individual \nhas maybe put forward his concepts on how we address the fiscal \npolicies of the United States. Yes, he has. In his campaign through New \nHampshire--where he spent a considerable amount of time, and we very \nmuch appreciated it because he spent a considerable amount of money--he \npresented programs which totaled $1.7 trillion of new spending over the \nnext 10 years. That is a budget proposal--a budget buster, but a budget \nproposal. He offset that with tax increases of approximately $700 \nbillion during that same time. So he is going to add to the deficit, \nwhich has been outlined by the Senator from North Dakota in very \ncolorful terms, an additional trillion dollars over the next 10 years.\n  I can understand why they don't want to bring their budget forward. \nIf their nominee, who is a Member of this body, is proposing he is \ngoing to increase the deficit by a trillion dollars, by increasing \nspending by $1.7 trillion and taxes by $700 billion, such a budget \ncould be appropriately called a tax-and-spend budget.\n  Let's look at the substance of what the practical effect of the \nproposal would be that has been brought forward by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, his $700 billion tax increase, for example. What would \nthat effect be? If you are going to look at the Senator's charts over \nthe next 4 years, where he claims if we went on under current law, the \ndeficit would go down by another $135 billion, which is essentially a \ntax increase, because what he is saying is under current law, taxes \nwill go back up because taxes expire, what taxes are they talking about \nincreasing on that side of the aisle under that theory? They are \ntalking about repealing our expansion of the 10-percent bracket so the \npeople in the low-income areas would have a 10-percent bracket. That \nwould be repealed. They are talking about repealing our increase in the \nchild tax credit, rolling it back from a $1,000 credit to a $700 \ncredit.\n  They are talking about repealing our efforts to reform the marriage \ntax penalty so when you get married, you don't get hit with an extra \ntax. All of those taxes would have to be repealed to meet the Senator's \nproposal relative to reducing the budget over the next few years by \n$135 billion, because those are the ones that expire.\n  If you look at the proposals of the Senator from Massachusetts, the \nsame effect would occur. His proposal for $700 billion of new taxes is \na proposal to repeal, as a practical matter, the child tax credit, to \nrestart the marriage penalty, and to make it difficult for people in \nlow-income brackets, in the 10-percent area, to get a 10-percent tax \nburden versus kicking it back up to 15 percent.\n  Now, all these initiatives, under the leadership of the Senator from \nIowa, which are targeted to low-income Americans, were taken as an \nattempt to address those legitimate concerns about people who are in \nthe middle- and low-income brackets and want to have a fair tax rate. \nWe passed those laws, but they will expire. I guess it is clearly the \nposition of the other side of the aisle that those expirations should \nbe allowed to occur, and therefore the taxes should go back up. That \nappears to be the core of their budget. It is coupled, of course, with \nthis spending initiative.\n  We had debate on the budget on the floor of the Senate. During the \nbudget debate, the other side of the aisle, which never brought forward \na budget, proposed spending increases of $379 billion. They proposed \ntax increases of $276 billion. I believe those are the numbers, but \nthey may not be exact. Those were the amendments brought forward from \nthe other side of the aisle--massive tax increases, massive spending \nincreases. They have now been confirmed by the policies of the nominee \nof their party--or the presumptive nominee--who has proposed $1.7 \ntrillion of new spending, $700 billion of additional tax increases, for \na $1 trillion add-on to our deficit.\n  So I don't think, when the other side of the aisle comes forward and \npresents--very expansively and very well, obviously, because the \nSenator from North Dakota is a well-spoken individual who understands \nhow to make a good presentation, and he always has--I don't think they \ncan do that in good conscience if they don't also present their budget \nat the same time, their answers to this problem. If they are going to \nbe fair about it, they have to bring forward the answers of their \ncandidate for President, because they keep referring to our President, \nPresident Bush, who happens to be everybody's President right now and \nhopefully will be for the next 4 years. But they have to present it in \njuxtaposition to what their candidate for President is talking about. \nIf he had a budget on the floor today, it would be a $1.7 trillion \nincrease in spending, increase in taxes, adding $1 trillion to the \ndebt, and a lot of people who don't deserve to have their tax \nincreased--people in the 10-percent bracket, married people, people who \nhave children going to college--would be stuck with a brandnew tax \nbill.\n  That is a brief response. There is a much more extensive response, \nbut my time is limited. The Senator from Iowa wishes to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we heard testimony from the other side on the fiscal \ncondition of the U.S. Government, how bad it is and they are sounding \nalarms. I think all that is very legitimate. I am not here to dispute \nspecific figures, I am not here to say that the other side has been \nintellectually wrong, but at least to say they have left some \nmisimpressions about some aspects of this budget. I will start with the \nchart shown about borrowing from foreign countries.\n  The U.S. Government does not go to other countries and say, hat in \nhand: Will you lend us X number of dollars? What the U.S. Government \ndoes is say to the 270 million Americans, and anybody else in the \nworld: We have X amount of debt that we have to refinance, or finance, \nand people come to bid on that. The market determines who gets what.\n  Now, we do have a lot of foreigners that own American debt. Why do \nthey want to invest in America's national\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\ndebt? Because they have confidence in America and because they want a \nreturn on their money. It ought to be somewhat satisfying to the \nAmerican people that the rest of the world thinks so well of the \nAmerican economy and the soundness of our Government that they are \nwilling to invest in the national debt, just as American citizens \ninvest in the national debt, because they want the return; they want \nthe certainty of it.\n  The impression was left that we go, hat in hand, to a lot of foreign \ncountries to beg for money. We don't do that. It is our policy, through \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, to say that we are offering so much \ninvestment, and you can come and make your claim to it under these \nconditions.\n  The other misimpression is that something different is happening to \nthe Social Security surplus. Why is that being said? Because people \nwant to get seniors concerned about what Congress might be doing to \nruin their Social Security. I say to the seniors of America--and people \non the other side of the aisle, if they don't know it--that nothing has \nchanged since 1936 as far as the way the Social Security surplus is \nhandled. Nothing has changed since 1936.\n  Starting in 1936 and for every year since then except 1981 and 1982, \nthere has always been a positive cashflow coming in from the payroll \ntax to what was paid out. We decided in 1936 to invest that surplus in \nTreasury bonds. Why? Because it is a good, safe investment for seniors, \nfor their retirement. It is the way the Federal Government can show to \nthe seniors of America and to all of the people of America that we are \ngoing to make sure your Social Security surplus is safe and that the \nobligations in the future are met. Except for in 1981 and 1982, when \nthere was a negative cashflow, that has been done. We made it up by \nborrowing to keep the checks going.\n  As far as the Social Security surplus is concerned, today, yesterday, \nand tomorrow--at least until 2018, as best we can project--there will \nbe a positive cashflow, and that money is going to be invested in \nTreasury notes that are obligations to keep Social Security benefits at \n100 percent at least through 2042, until all that surplus is used up. \nSo for the seniors of America, nothing has changed.\n  I think we also ought to remember that we dealt with dozens of \namendments on the other side of the aisle when the budget was up. Every \none of those amendments was for spending more money. They will say, \nyes, they wanted to raise taxes; they had tax offsets to spend that \nmoney. But they were not interested in raising taxes to lower the \nnational debt; they were interested in raising taxes to spend more \nmoney. So just the tax cut cannot be considered a reason for the debt. \nIn fact, if you want to know why we have a debt, we have a debt of 25 \npercent because of tax cuts, 25 percent because of increased spending \nfor the war as well as homeland security, and 50 percent because of the \ndownturn in the economy.\n  When did that downturn in the economy start? In the year 2000, not in \nthe year 2001. The manufacturing index started going down in March of \n2000. Do you know NASDAQ lost half of its value in 2000? President Bush \nsaw that economic situation and, hence, the tax cut of 2001 to turn the \neconomy around, and it has worked. But that is only 25 percent of the \nreason for the deficit. The other is just the downturn in the economy \nand what happened on September 11 and a recovery that was delayed \nbecause of attacks by terrorists on America, the second time only since \nthe War of 1812 that Americans have been attacked and it had an impact \non the economy. And it was a negative impact on the economy that led to \n3 years of downturn of income coming into the Federal Government for \nthe first time since the 1930s; in other words, less income this year \nthan the year before, than the year before.\n  That has never happened, even when we had tax cuts in the past. We \nhave to go back to the 1930s. I hope the other side is willing to admit \nthese are very unusual times we are in.\n  Then, what about the fact that we are in a war? What about the fact \nthat we were attacked on September 11? Do you want to fight the \nterrorists in the United States or do you want to fight them in Iraq \nand Afghanistan? This Commander in Chief decided to fight them in \nAfghanistan and Iraq instead of in New York City and Washington, DC.\n  Wars cost money. We only go to war to win. If we are going to go to \nwar to win and put American men and women on the battlefield, we are \ngoing to give them the resources it takes to win. We have been attacked \nby the other side because somehow we do not account for the cost of a \nwar. On December 8, 1941, when FDR was addressing the Congress of the \nUnited States after the attack on Pearl Harbor, if Members of Congress \nhad said at that time, How much is this war going to cost, they would \nhave been laughed at. How come they are not laughed at now, Mr. \nPresident? We are going to spend what it takes to win the war. We are \nnot going to leave our men and women hanging without support. If we had \ntaken that attitude toward World War II, Hitler would have been in New \nYork City. So we ought to have some leeway when it comes to budgets to \nwin a war and backing our men and women and not being harassed because \nof what the war is going to cost, just as we are going to know that in \nthe month of September we are going to fire off so many cruise \nmissiles.\n  The last point I will make is, I might be willing to consider an \nincrease in taxes, but I have never found anybody on the other side of \nthe aisle who has said to me how high taxes can go to satisfy their \ndesire to spend more money. For 50 years, we have had a policy in this \ncountry of taxing in the Federal Government at about 17 to 19 percent \nof gross national product. It seems to me that is pretty good policy \nbecause of two reasons: No. 1, the American people do not tend to \nattack us for taxing too high when it is in that band; and, No. 2, it \nhas not been harmful to the economy, as we have seen tremendous growth \nin the economy for the last 50 years.\n  What we are trying to do is keep the level of taxation within that \nband of 17 to 19 percent. Right now it is a little bit lower. Sometimes \nit might be a little bit higher, but our policy is to keep it within \nthat band and to keep spending within that band. But in times of war, \nthat spending policy has to have some give if you want to win a war.\n  Even though the presentation that has been made by the other side may \nbe totally accurate as far as the statistics are concerned, I think \nthere is a bigger picture than just charts and statistics. There is \nwhat America is all about and the role of Government in America and the \nimportance of responding to attacks on America and winning a war and \nbacking up our troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I always enjoy listening to the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, who is my friend, and despite our \ndisagreement today, he will be my friend at the end of the day, just as \nhe was when we began this day.\n  I say to my friend, this is not a question of whether we win wars or \ndo not win wars. All of us are committed to winning this war. We must \nwin this war. But part of winning a war is not just leaving the cost of \nthe war out of the budget. That is not credible.\n  The President says it is difficult to say how much the war is going \nto cost. Certainly it is difficult, but the right answer is not zero. \nThat is what the President put in his budget. He says for the next year \nthere is no cost to the war on terror, there is no cost to the war in \nIraq, there is no cost to the war in Afghanistan. That is not credible. \nThat is not a serious budget. That is not leveling with the American \npeople on our true fiscal condition to put out a budget that says there \nis no war cost past September 30 and present that as an accurate \npicture to the American people of our fiscal condition. That is not \nserious. That is not credible. People deserve better.\n  The Senator also indicated nothing has changed with respect to Social \nSecurity financing. That is not true. In the last 3 years of the \nClinton administration, we stopped the raid on Social Security. We \nstopped taking Social Security funds and using it for other purposes.\n  What has changed now is we have gone right back to the bad old days \nof taking every dime. And under the President's plan, he is not just \ntaking\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\nevery dime of Social Security surplus this year to pay for tax cuts, he \nis doing it for the whole next decade--every dime, something he pledged \nnot to do.\n  The Senator also said we have had a policy of only spending 17 to 19 \npercent of GDP and having taxes of that same amount. I don't know what \nhe is talking about. That is not the fact. The fact is, spending as a \nshare of GDP in 1928 was 23.5 percent. During this whole period of the \neighties, it was above 21.5 percent. It was only during the Clinton \nyears that we brought spending down to 18 percent of GDP. Now we are \nback up to a little over 20 percent of GDP. If we want to have balanced \nbudgets, we have to have that amount of revenue. Hello. Deficits are a \nfunction of spending and revenue, not just of spending.\n  When we look at the revenue side of the equation, revenue has \ncollapsed. Of course, we are talking about needing more revenue. We \nhave the lowest revenue since 1950. We are at 15.8-percent revenue as a \nshare of the gross domestic product, and spending is 20 percent. That \nis why we have a deficit.\n  Obviously, we need more revenue. I would say the first place to look \nis not a tax increase, but going after the tax gap, the difference \nbetween what is owed and what is being paid because we know for 2001, \nthat difference was over $250 billion.\n  Now we ought to go to those who are not paying what they owe, that \nsmall share of the American people, that small share of companies, and \nsay, look, you ought to pay what you owe.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire said, where is our budget? We offered \namendment after amendment in the committee and on the floor to alter \nthis budget plan. That was our strategy, to try to alter the outcome, \nand we were defeated.\n  When the Senator from Iowa says we did nothing to reduce the deficit \nin our amendments, please, that is not true. Go back and look. \nVirtually every amendment we offered was to reduce the deficit, and \nthat is a fact. I challenge the Senator to come up with a list of the \namendments we offered and show we did not repeatedly offer amendments \nto reduce the deficit.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire attacked Senator Kerry, said Senator \nKerry had a trillion-dollar hole in his budget over 10 years. First, \nSenator Kerry, as the Senator knows, has not presented a budget. They \nhave fabricated a budget in his name. It is not Senator Kerry's budget. \nWe all know it is not Senator Kerry's budget.\n  They have double-counted Senator Kerry's proposals. They have \nincluded things he did not include. So claiming that is Senator Kerry's \nbudget is a fiction. It is a fabrication. Senator Kerry has not yet \npresented his budget proposal.\n  In the analysis the Senator from New Hampshire provided, he included \nprograms Senator Kerry has never proposed, including a multibillion-\ndollar, high-speed rail network. He excluded savings Senator Kerry has \nspecifically proposed, like hundreds of billions of dollars in health \ncare savings, closing corporate loopholes, and eliminating corporate \nwelfare. They double-counted some of his proposals, for example, \ndouble-counting energy proposals Senator Kerry has made.\n  Interestingly enough, he says there is a trillion-dollar hole in a \nKerry budget Senator Kerry has not even presented. We know the budget \nthis President has presented in 5 years adds $3 trillion to the debt. \nThey are talking about a $1 trillion hole in a nonexistent Kerry budget \nover 10 years. They ought to be up here explaining the $3 trillion this \nPresident adds to the national debt in just 5 years.\n  If we applied the same rationale to the President's proposals he \napplied to Senator Kerry's proposals, we would see there is a $4.5 \ntrillion hole in the President's plan compared to their alleged $1 \ntrillion difference in Senator Kerry's plan.\n  Is the Senator from Delaware seeking time?\n  Mr. CARPER. He sure is.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I spoke several weeks ago as we were taking up the budget resolution. \nI quoted a fellow from Great Britain, Dennis Healey, who used to be the \nChancellor of the Exchequer. Dennis Healey used to talk about the \ntheory of holes. The theory of holes is pretty simple. It says, when \nyou find yourself in a hole, stop digging.\n  In 1990, we as a country were in a pretty big hole with respect to \nour budget deficit. Some people in the House and the Senate, the White \nHouse, Democrats and Republicans, decided to stop digging. What they \ndecided to do was to adopt a commonsense approach to budgeting, which \nwe call ``pay as you go.''\n  The idea is if Senator Coleman, our Presiding Officer, were to come \nto the Senate and propose new spending, he would have to come up with \nan offset, either cut spending some place else or raise revenue to \noffset it. Or if Senator Carper came up with a tax cut, I would have to \ncome up with an offset to make sure we did not make the hole any \ndeeper. For about 12 years, it was the law of the land.\n  During those 12 years, from 1990 to 2002, we actually were able to \nreduce the deficit and for the first time in 30 years we actually \nbalanced the Federal budget for several years in the late 1990s and the \nbeginning of this decade.\n  That law lapsed in 2002. We voted in the Senate that it should be \nreinstated. They very nearly voted in the House yesterday, kept the \nvote open over an extended period of time so they could twist some arms \non the other side in order to defeat the effort to instruct the House \nconferees to go back and adopt this pay-as-you-go principle.\n  We ought to do that. If the House conferees will not, we should at \nleast adopt those provisions, this standard, for the Senate, for the \nway we conduct business.\n  There was a great editorial in the Washington Post called ``Dodge as \nYou Go.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed for the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 31, 2004]\n\n                            Dodge as You Go\n\n       For a vote it derided as meaningless symbolism, the House \n     Republican leadership certainly pulled out all the stops \n     yesterday. At issue was a motion that would have put the \n     House on record as supporting real ``pay as you go'' budget \n     rules--that is, rules that would require tax cuts as well as \n     spending increases to be paid for at the time they're \n     adopted, with offsetting spending cuts or tax increases. The \n     Senate narrowly adopted such a rule in its budget resolution, \n     the House didn't, and the matter is about to go to \n     conference. Yesterday's motion to instruct the conferees \n     would have put the House on record as supporting the Senate \n     rule.\n       You wouldn't think this is such a big deal. After all, the \n     motion wasn't binding on the conferees. And the budget rule, \n     even if it survives the conference, would apply only to the \n     Senate, not the House. As to the merits: In the 1990s, \n     Republicans seemed to agree that budget discipline was good \n     for the country. They supported a stricter version of this \n     pay-as-you-go rule, they made sure it applied to the House as \n     well as the Senate, and it did some good. But Republican \n     leaders are no longer concerned about fiscal integrity. \n     Making certain that tax cuts can be enacted and extended \n     without any procedural hurdles has become the central--you \n     might say the only--budgeting principle of the Bush \n     administration and its congressional allies.\n       Thus yesterday's scene of legislating-by-strong arm. In a \n     familiar episode of rule-stretching and bullying, a vote \n     scheduled for five minutes was stretched to nearly half an \n     hour. At one point, 19 Republicans defied their leadership to \n     support the motion. But eight eventually switched their \n     votes, creating a 209 to 209 tie. That meant the motion \n     failed--and at that point, the vote was hurriedly gaveled to \n     a close. ``A meaningless vote but an important principle,'' \n     said a spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) \n     explaining the need to make certain that tax cuts would be \n     exempt from pay-as-you-go constraints.\n       Other principles used to carry some weight in the U.S. \n     House of Representatives: allowing lawmakers to vote their \n     consciences, not manipulating voting rules to get the desired \n     result, and opposing a reckless amassing of budget deficits \n     selfishly left for other generations. But that was under the \n     leadership of other speakers, and other presidents.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I will quote one or two sentences out of the editorial.\n\n       Other principles used to carry some weight in the U.S. \n     House of Representatives: allowing lawmakers to vote their \n     consciences, not manipulating voting rules to get the desired \n     result, and opposing a reckless amassing of budget deficits \n     selfishly left for other generations. But that was the \n     leadership of other speakers, and other Presidents.\n\n  We can do something about it. Our conferees can do something about \nit. My hope is they will stick by our guns\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\nto try to make sure at least for the Senate we adopt those rules that \nserved us so well for 12 years.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we had another one of our colleagues in \nthe Senate assert support for the PAYGO provisions means one is opposed \nto the middle-class tax cuts. I would ask my colleague from Delaware, \ndoes he believe support for the budget disciplines that requires new \nspending or new tax cuts to be paid for means he opposes the extension \nof middle-income tax cuts?\n  Mr. CARPER. If I could respond, the answer is absolutely no.\n  My dad used to say something to my sister and me when we were kids \ngrowing up. The Senator's father and mother probably did the same \nthing. Senator Nickles' mom and dad probably did the same thing, as \nwell as Senator Coleman's. They harp on something over and over again. \nWhen my sister or I used to pull some boneheaded stunt, my dad would \nalways turn to us and say, just use some common sense. He must have \nsaid that to us, because we pulled a lot of boneheaded stunts, day \nafter day, week after week, year after year. Finally, it worked and \ninternalized.\n  Whenever we approach an issue in the Senate or when I was Governor of \nDelaware, I would oftentimes say to my cabinet, just use some common \nsense.\n  Pay as you go is common sense. It is flat in-your-face common sense. \nIt works in State governments. Frankly, it worked here for about 12 \nyears and it will work again. It is not the only thing we need to do \nbut, by golly, it is a big part of it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  I say in response to our colleague who suggested those of us who \nfavor the reenactment of the budget disciplines that worked so well in \nthe 1990s, I also favor extension of the middle-class tax cuts, but I \nam willing to pay for them. I am willing to pay for extension of the \n10-percent rate. I am willing to pay for extension of the marriage \npenalty relief. I am willing to pay for the child tax credit. I am \nprepared to vote to do precisely that. That is what we need to do.\n  The other fact is, under PAYGO, if we get a supermajority, tax relief \ncan be extended or have new spending of an emergency nature. There has \nto be a supermajority vote. That is what the budget discipline is \nabout. It is to make it more difficult to enact new spending or new tax \ncuts that are not paid for. It can be done, but there has to be a \nsupermajority.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much on the other side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes 36 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from North \nDakota. I appreciate the cooperation. We will soon be appointing \nconferees. That is my objective.\n  I want to thank Senator Gregg and Senator Grassley for their remarks.\n  A couple of things. It is important we pass a budget. We will appoint \nconferees and then we will go to work out the differences between the \nHouse and the Senate. We have differences between the House and the \nSenate, but in my 24 years in the Senate we are probably closer with \nthe House in the 2 budget resolutions--the Senate resolution is \nprobably closer to the House resolution than most times in the past. In \nthe past, we have had cases where the House resolution was 5 years, our \nresolution was 10, and we never reconciled that difference, or we had a \nhard time reconciling it. We had 1 year we didn't pass a budget in the \nSenate. They did in the House. This year the numbers are pretty close.\n\n  I have a couple of comments. I heard a statement in the budget debate \non the floor. I would say, my staff has compiled the amount of spending \nthat was in the amendments that were debated on the floor. Our Democrat \ncolleagues offered amendments that would have 1-year tax increases of \n$86 billion and 1-year spending increases of $81 billion for 2005. For \n5 years, that figure would be tax increases of $443 billion, and 5-year \nspending increases, $382 billion. That is assuming no inflation. If you \ntake the first year and extrapolate, some said we only spend for 1 \nyear, but there are programs which would obviously be spent further. I \nhave a chart that extrapolates and continues those. That is how I came \nup with those figures. I ask unanimous consent to have those printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Senate Budget Committee Tallies Democrat Amendments Offered During \n                             Budget Debate\n\n       1-year tax increases: $86 billion:\n\n     $20 billion from ``closing loopholes''\n     $57 billion from ``raising taxes on millionaires''\n     $9 billion in ``other'' (tobacco, Superfund)\n\n       5-year tax increases: $443 billion:\n\n     $104 billion from ``closing loopholes''\n     $291 billion from ``raising taxes on millionaires''\n     $47 billion in ``other''\n\n       1-year spending increases: $81 billion.\n       5-year spending increases: $382 billion.\n\n       Note.--Totals for Senate Democrat amendments to the 2005 \n     budget resolution, adjusted to exclude duplicative \n     amendments. Five-year cost assumes increased discretionary \n     spending in 2005 would continue in future years, but does not \n     include baseline inflation or debt service costs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                                     Ba/revenue\n         No. and description                Sponsor        Party    Adopt     Tax/ spend         M/loop/other      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                        2005         2006         2007         2008         2009        5-yr.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            TAX INCREASES\n2803  Health security...............

I want my colleagues to know we keep tally and keep \nmeasures of how much some of these amendments cost. This is an accurate \nportrayal. We had amendments that would increase taxes and spending by \nhundreds of billions of dollars. Those are now entered in the Record.\n  I also heard some comments on pay-go. I might mention for our \ncolleagues, last week Senator Murray had an amendment. I raised a point \nof order on it that most all of our colleagues on the Democrat side \nsaid, let's waive pay-go. Let's spend an extra $18 billion. We have a \ntax credit, but basically it was to spend more money, $18 billion.\n  We didn't waive it, but most of our colleagues on the Democrat side \nwho profess belief in pay-go voted to waive pay-go--for a bill, \nincidentally, that had never had a hearing before the Finance \nCommittee, never been vetted. It is just proposed on the floor. I \nhappen to be a supporter of pay-go.\n  Incidentally, people act like we have not had pay-go for the last \nyear. That is false. The budget we passed last year had pay-go for \nanything that wasn't assumed in the budget resolution, period. We used \npay-go and other points of order, some of which are redundant. You can \nmake a budget point of order because a committee exceeds its \nallocation, or you can make a pay-go point of order. I used both. We \nmade 61 or 62 budget points of order, on most of which we prevailed, \nwhich saved over $800 billion in new spending.\n  It seems a lot of people who are now pro pay-go are trying to make \nsure the tax cuts that are presently law are not extended. I hope that \nwill not be successful.\n  I just make those comments. I think I would much prefer to have the \ndebate, whether it is on pay-go, the amount of money we spend for \ndefense or the amount of money we spend on nondefense, or new budget \nrules--incidentally, these rules apply only to the Senate--but I think \nit would be appropriate for us to have those in conference.\n  For the information of all our colleagues, the Budget House and \nSenate conferees will be meeting at 2:30 this afternoon in the Senate \nbudget room on the sixth floor of the Dirksen Building. We tried to \nfind a room in the Capitol and were not successful.\n  For the information of our colleagues, I think we had a good debate \ntoday. I look forward to a constructive, positive conference, one in \nwhich we will hear all sides and all viewpoints and consider \nconstructive suggestions for making improvements. It is my hope we can \nconclude the Budget conference in a very short period of time. The \nHouse would like to vote on it Thursday or Friday. I think that is \npossible. I think it would be important for us to actually pass a \nbudget that will show we can get the deficit down, in half, in 3 or 4 \nyears. I expect that will be our result. That is my objective. I hope \nto do that and I hope we can accomplish that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma and the chairman \nof the Budget Committee will not be surprised that I completely \ndisagree with his characterization of the amendments offered on our \nside during the budget fight. We did not offer a package of amendments, \nso you can't total the spending of each individual proposal. We would \noffer an amendment, but in each case we would pay for the amendment. We \nwere not adding to the deficit.\n  If you take our proposals in total--which you cannot do because they \nwere not offered as a package, they were offered individually. We are \njust going to be intellectually honest here. You can't cumulate \nsomething that was not offered as a cumulative amendment. We offered an \namendment, it would be defeated, but in each of the amendments we \noffered, we offered offsets.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that chart printed in the Record as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  FLOOR AMENDMENTS TO SENATE GOP FY 2005

Amount of each amendment includes estimated costs of any\n  contingent reserve funds (which may or may not be released).\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. What it shows is if you do cumulate the spending over 5 \nyears, it was $222 billion, but the deficit reduction was $231 billion. \nThat is a fact.\n  On the other side, they increased by $28 billion, and added to the \ndeficit by $9.3 billion. So the only folks who had cumulative totals \nhere on the floor that added to the deficit were our friends on the \nother side of the aisle. That is a fact.\n  We have been very careful to insist amendments on our side be paid \nfor and reduce the deficit. We insisted that not only amendments \noffered on this side be deficit neutral, but they actually reduced the \ndeficit in addition to any change in funding priorities.\n  The Senator once again says the budget before us will reduce the \ndeficit in half in 3 years. The problem is, if you look at increases to \nthe debt in each of those years, you don't see a reduction. The debt \ncontinues to be increased between $500 and $600 billion a year in every \nyear of this budget proposal--$3 trillion. On the Senate budget, in \nfairness, $2.9 trillion added to the debt in just the next 5 years.\n  The President's plan adds $3 trillion to the national debt in just \nthe next 5 years. That is a mistake. That is a mistake because it is \ncoming at a critical time, right before the baby boomers start to \nretire. That will happen in the fifth year of this 5-year budget plan.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to conclude by thanking the chairman. We have had \ndifferences on budget policy; we have had differences in how we should \nproceed; but we have done it, I think, in a way that should be done in \nthe Senate. We have done it in a way where there is respect and a \nserious listening to both sides in order to achieve a result and a \nrational process for this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate disagrees to the House amendment \nto S. Con. Res. 95, agrees to the request for a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair is authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate with a ratio of 4 to 3.\n  The Acting President pro tempore appointed Mr. Nickles, Mr. Domenici, \nMr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Sarbanes \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3407-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3407-S3448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EVERYONE ACT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 4, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4) to reauthorize and improve the program of \n     block grants to the States for temporary assistance for needy \n     families, improve access to quality child care, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Boxer/Kennedy amendment No. 2945, to amend the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 to provide for an increase in the \n     Federal minimum wage.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from North \nDakota for his cooperation and I look forward to the conference.\n  I see my good friend from Massachusetts is here. I know he offered an \namendment on minimum wage. I know\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\nhe would be disappointed if I didn't respond to his proposal. While he \nis here, I want to make a couple of comments about the amendment which \nI believe is pending before the Senate. It may have been set aside, but \nI believe it is pending, Senator Kennedy's amendment, which increased \nthe minimum wage from $5.15 to $7 an hour. Is that the pending \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts. If the State of Massachusetts wants to increase the \nminimum wage to $7, or $8, let them do it. What may work in Boston \nprobably does not work in my hometown of Ponca City, OK, or maybe in \nSallisaw, OK.\n  I used to work for minimum wage. I made minimum wage when it was \n$1.60 an hour in 1968. My wife and I made that.\n  That was our first job when we married. And by having a job, we could \nstart climbing the ladder.\n  I am afraid Senator Kennedy's amendment which says let us increase \nthe minimum wage from $5.15 to $7 an hour is going to hurt some of the \npeople he professes to help. I heard his comment yesterday that this is \ngoing to lift a lot of people out of poverty, or help them. If that is \nthe case, let us not stop at $7. Let's make it $10 or $20. If you can \nlift people out of poverty by mandating a higher wage, why in the world \nwould we stop at $7 an hour? I frankly want people to make more than $7 \nan hour. Why in the world would we set this level? If you are actually \ngoing to be eliminating poverty or lifting people out of poverty, let \nus increase it dramatically more. Let us make it $20 an hour.\n  I do not know if a second-degree amendment is in order. Maybe we \nshould have an amendment to make it $10 an hour. I would like for \neverybody in America to make at least $10 an hour. My daughter who \nworks close to minimum wage and is a college student would love to have \n$10 an hour. But I am not sure she would have a job.\n  Maybe in Boston they could pay a student $10 an hour working part \ntime in a clothing store on weekends. Maybe they could pay that much, \nand maybe they can't. But I know one thing: In some rural areas they \ncannot. That student who may be working not in Boston, maybe not going \nto an Ivy League school, but maybe going to a vo-tech school in rural \nSouth Dakota where they can't pay $7 an hour, would be out of luck. \nMaybe it is a minority student in New York City, or maybe in southern \nCalifornia who can't get a job at $7 an hour. Maybe that job is \nflipping hamburgers. People always make fun of working at one of those \nfast-food places, how terrible that is. It is a job. Maybe McDonalds \ncan afford to pay for it, but a lot of places can't. Maybe it is \npumping gas or sacking groceries.\n  They may have a job now, let us say, making $5.15, or maybe $5.50, or \n$6. But if we pass this amendment, we are saying if you don't make $7, \nwe would rather you be unemployed. It is against the Federal law. Even \nthough it is to your mutual benefit and the benefit of whoever is \nhiring you to make $6.50 an hour, we are going to say no because of \nSenator Kennedy's amendment. If you do not make $7 an hour, you are \nunemployed.\n  I find that to be a bad economic argument. I am afraid it would hurt \na lot of people. I am afraid a lot of lower income people might not \nstart climbing the ladder.\n  My wife and I worked for minimum wage. We worked for a janitor \nservice in Stillwater, OK for minimum wage. We did that for a couple of \nmonths. I asked for a raise. We got a very small raise. As a matter of \nfact, we quit and started our own janitor service. We learned enough to \nstart our own janitor service.\n  My point being not to lift this economic ladder so high that some \npeople can't get on. By saying if you make less than $7 an hour, if the \njob can't pay $7 an hour, we don't want you to have that job, maybe as \na result of that we don't have people pumping gas. Almost everything is \nself- serve. We don't have too many people sacking groceries today. \nThere are a lot of jobs maybe that have been priced out of the \nmarketplace. I don't know if that is good.\n  I would rather have somebody get a job even if it doesn't pay very \nmuch because they start climbing the economic ladder. I would hate to \npull that ladder up so high that maybe it would deny them the \nopportunity to start climbing, to start improving, to learn work \nhabits.\n  One of the good things about a job--and many people like myself and \nothers started when they were very young--is if they did not learn \nanything else they learned to be on time. You have to report to work. \nYou have work habits. You have certain things to do that are expected. \nOne of the things you learn many times is it is not enough money. They \nlearned they can't get by. My daughter has already learned that working \npart time in a clothing store won't cut it. It is not enough. She \ndemands more. So she knows she has to improve her skills and have a \nhigher education so she can demand more in the workplace. But having \nthat job is good.\n\n  If we start telling everybody all across America no, if the job \ndoesn't pay at least 36 percent more than the present minimum wage, at \nleast $7 an hour, sorry, I am afraid there will be a lot of jobs lost, \nI don't know how many hundreds of thousands of jobs this amendment \nwould cost, but it will cost many.\n  I don't think we should try to legislate economics. As a matter of \nfact, I know a lot of businesses--I suspect there are a bunch in \nMontana and other places--particularly rural areas, that are struggling \nto survive. They might be small mom-and-pop stores, and Wal-Mart came \nin down the street. Maybe they are not making any money today. They \nmight be struggling. Maybe it is a little hardware store in a town with \na population of 12,000 and they have been there for 30 years. They have \npart-time help. They may pay somebody $5.15 or $6 an hour to work \nthere. All of a sudden, a big Wal-Mart comes in. They are losing money \nand business. They are just trying to hang on.\n  Then Congress passes a bill which says the minimum wage is going to \ngo up by 36 percent. Now you will have to increase that from $5.15 to \n$7 an hour.\n  We are not making any money now. We are losing money and can't \ncompete. We are just hanging on. They realize they can't lose money \nforever. I am afraid they will have to close the doors.\n  How many rural communities have you seen where in downtowns they are \nreally struggling? I wonder what this amendment will do to those towns. \nSome of those towns are trying to hang on. Some of those towns are \ntrying to revive.\n  Again, maybe some Members in this body think it is a living wage, or \nit is getting people out of poverty. That is good. But it may be \nputting some people in poverty. It may be denying the opportunity for a \nyoung student who might be working part time to help pay for vo-tech, \nor maybe work part time so they can get through college, or to become a \nsecretary, or you name it.\n  We are just arbitrarily going to say no. If you can't make $7 an \nhour, we have decided it is against the law for you to have a job. That \nis what this amendment would do.\n  If you ask the question in a poll if you support an increase in the \nminimum, a lot of people used to say yes. If you ask the question \nwhether it should be against the law for anybody to work for less than \n$7 an hour, even though they might all agree it is not to their \nadvantage to work for less than that, they would say no, it should not \nbe against the law. That is what this says. But this amendment says it \nis against the Federal law.\n  Again, if the State of Massachusetts wants to do it, and its economy \nis good, and maybe wage patterns and living costs are so high, that \nmight be appropriate. But many States have minimum wage laws. There is \na lot of difference between them. There is a lot of variance, as well \nthere should be.\n  But to come in and say we want to increase the federal minimum wage \nto $7--that may take away the chance for some people to start climbing \nthat economic ladder.\n  It is far more important to give people opportunity to work than \nalmost anything we do. The work habits and skills they obtain from \ntheir first job are very important. The first job for some people is a \nminimum wage job. I would hate to price people out of the marketplace \nin so many cases. Clearly,\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\nI think this would do it. Clearly, it would do it in some parts of the \ncountry.\n  One other comment: It was alluded to. We haven't raised this in \nseveral years. So now is the time. Why won't these Republicans let us \ndo this?\n  The Democrats ran the Senate from June 2001 throughout 2002. They \ncould have offered minimum wage. I heard it hasn't been increased since \n1997. It has been 7 years and we want to increase it now. They ran the \nSenate most of 2001 and all of 2002, 4 and 5 years after the last \nincrease. How many votes did we have in 2001 and 2002 when Tom Daschle \nwas the majority leader? Senator Kennedy was chairman of the Labor \nCommittee. How many votes did we have?\n  We did not have any votes. They controlled the floor. They could have \noffered an amendment. They could have had a bill reported out of \ncommittee and sent it to the Senate floor, and we could have debated \nit. I would have debated it. But we did not have it. We did not have \none during that timeframe.\n  So, I will mention, this is kind of interesting: they had plenty of \nchances to debate this when they were in the majority. They had the \nmajority leader. They had control of the Senate. They could have \noffered the bill at any time during that period of time.\n  So I mention those issues. I do not want us to make a mistake. I do \nnot want us to pass a bill that will probably cost hundreds of \nthousands of people jobs, and particularly hundreds of thousands of \npeople who are at the low end of the economic scale. Let's give them a \nchance to climb that economic ladder. We do not do that by passing laws \nthat say it is against the law for them to work for less than $7 an \nhour.\n  I would urge our colleagues, if and when we vote on the Kennedy \namendment, to vote no on the Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the great British Prime Minister William \nGladstone called the U.S. Senate ``the most remarkable of all the \ninventions of modern politics.'' If you stop and think about that a \nlittle bit, in the political process there is probably no greater \ntruth.\n  The Senate is a remarkable institution. It is unique. There is no \nother body, no other political body, no other democratic legislature in \nthe world quite like the U.S. Senate. We have our unique rules and our \nunique procedures, which I think make it special, and which have stood \nthe test of time and made this body the institution it is. I think it \nhas added significantly to our country's well-being and has helped make \nthe United States the best country in the world.\n  What are some of those distinctions? What are some of those \nqualities? One, clearly, is the right to debate. Once the Chair \nrecognizes a Senator, that Senator can stand and talk as long as he or \nshe wants, as long as he or she is physically able. That is a rule of \nthe Senate. It means that if a Senator has something to say, that \nSenator cannot be denied the right to say whatever he or she wants to \nsay, unless or until that Senator, for physical reasons, has to stop \ntalking.\n  I think the record for standing and addressing the Senate is held by \nthe late Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. My recollection \nis it was 25 hours and some minutes. He had something to say, and, my \ngosh, he said it. That is a distinct right in the U.S. Senate.\n  I do not know of any other body in the world where legislators are \naccorded that right, certainly not in the other body. As you know, in \nthe other body, the standard rule is 5 minutes; that is, when any \namendment or bill is up, even assuming under their rules a House Member \nhas the opportunity to seek recognition, the basic rule is 5 minutes. \nIn the Senate it is as long as you can possibly speak.\n  What is another unique right of the U.S. Senate? One other right is \nthe right to offer any amendment on any bill at any time without \nnotice.\n  Now, when you stop and think about that, on one level that sounds a \nlittle strange. That tends to make things a little disorderly, doesn't \nit? Yes, it does make things sometimes a little disorderly, but, \nnevertheless, that unique right to offer an amendment protects the \nminority interest; it protects an interest of a Senator who is \nrepresenting some part of the country to be able to present his or her \npoint of view, and to bring it up and have Senators act on it, to \ndebate it, vote on it, and take action. It is very unique. It is very \nimportant. Those are two extremely important qualities that distinguish \nthe U.S. Senate from any other legislative body in the world.\n  In a sense, it is that unique quality that is at the heart of this \ndebate; that is, whether the Senate should vote on an amendment offered \nby the Senators from California and Massachusetts to raise the minimum \nwage. Senators have that right. They have the right to offer \namendments. They have the right to stand up and be recognized and speak \non their amendments. Senators who are opposed to the amendment have a \nright to stand up and oppose the amendment.\n  I believe that one of the best attributes--and I hope I am not \n``misattributing,'' if that is a correct word, the source of this to \nJohn Locke--is the ``marketplace of ideas''--that is, the more people \ndebate and, in good faith, talk about a subject, the more the sunshine \nis on that subject, the more likely it is the best result will be \nachieved; the more likely it is we will find the truth; we will find \nthe right result.\n  It is pretty hard to find the right result to a controversial issue. \nCertainly raising the minimum wage has some controversy with it, \nwithout debating it. If we cannot debate it, it is fairly difficult--it \nis kind of hard--to know what the right result should be.\n\n  My guess is--and, frankly, I believe strongly--if we have a full and \nopen debate on the underlying bill, the TANF bill, as well as on \namendments that Senators want to legitimately offer, even if some of \nthem may not be strictly germane, we are going to end up with a much \nbetter result, and we are going to be serving our country much better \nthan we would if we just do not have debate on amendments or if the \namendments are precluded from being brought up.\n  I strongly urge Senators, therefore, to think about what we are \ndoing. It is not only the narrow subject of whether there should be a \nvote on the minimum wage or whether we are going to allow Senator \nKennedy to have a vote on his amendment. It is a broader question: What \nare we all about as an institution? What are we about as the U.S. \nSenate? Why do we seek these offices in the first place? Why are we \nhere?\n  I think I can speak for every Senator, saying that he or she ran for \nthe Senate because we want to help make this a better place; that is, \nwe want to help our States and help America. We profoundly believe in \nthe democratic process. We sought election to the U.S. Senate because \nwe knew, either directly or intuitively, it is a special place where \none does have the ability to have a voice in reaching a result, and, \nclearly, a result that we think is better than the status quo. So I \nremind all my colleagues that the nature of this Senate is somewhat at \nstake. It is in question.\n  My next point is a bit difficult, perhaps, but there are some \nSenators who have not been here very many years, and who only know the \nSenate as they have seen it and have experienced it. I have been here a \nfew years. I am in my fifth term. I have seen the Senate operate in \nlots of different ways.\n  I saw the Senate operate, a few years ago, where we had votes. We \nvoted on subjects. We voted on amendments. I might say, the last time, \nin a real legitimate sense, we took up this underlying legislation, the \nTANF bill, I think we were on it for 12 or 13 days, and there were 43 \nvotes.\n  Senators offered amendments, Senators debated amendments, and \nSenators voted on amendments according to what each thought was \ncorrect.\n  And guess what happened. Most people hailed the 1996 bill as being a \ngreat step forward in welfare reform. Everyone talks about the great \nstrides and advances this country took as a consequence of that bill \nthat passed, in 1996, the Welfare Reform Act. We have had a 50-percent \nreduction in caseloads all across the country; and in some States more \nthan that, up to a 70 percent reduction in welfare caseloads.\n  We did get rid of welfare as we knew it. Both President Clinton and \nPresident Bush said we needed to get rid of\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\nthe former welfare system as we knew it. I forget exactly what the \nquotes were, but it happened. And I suggest it happened in part because \nwe so solidly and so comprehensively debated welfare and welfare \nreform. We had 43 separate rollcall votes on that bill when we first \npassed it.\n  Contrast that with where we are today. We have had one vote. A \ncloture motion was filed yesterday. The point of that cloture motion \nclearly is to prevent a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts--to prevent a vote. I do not see why we should \nprevent votes.\n  The amendment raises the minimum wage. Clearly that is related. I \ncan't think of anything that is more related to the underlying bill. We \nare talking about getting people off welfare into work. Clearly, it is \nmuch easier to work if the wage that a person is paid is a wage that \ncan allow a person to stay off of welfare.\n  I have met people personally who have told me they want to get off of \nwelfare, but they can't because the minimum wage--this was several \nyears ago--was so low. One single mother told me she couldn't because \nshe realized childcare was taking up almost all of her income. It \nwouldn't work. So she had to go back on welfare, and it bothered her so \nmuch.\n  Clearly, this amendment is related. Clearly, Senators have the \nintelligence to debate the amendment. Clearly, Senators have the \nintelligence to know if they favor or do not favor it. Clearly, it is \ndirectly related. Even more clearly, if we respect the nature of the \nSenate, Senators should have a right to vote on it.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote no on the cloture motion when we \nvote on cloture tomorrow because a ``yes'' vote would deprive Senators \nof the right to vote on a very significant amendment to this bill and \ndeprive Senators the opportunity of debating and trying to find the \nbest solution to a complex question; that is, what are the best changes \nwe think should pass in welfare reform.\n  If that is not bad enough--that is, a cloture motion which is \nsuccessful prevents us from voting on the Kennedy amendment--there was \na proposal by the majority yesterday. Yesterday, on behalf of the \nmajority, the Senator from Pennsylvania propounded a unanimous consent \nrequest on this bill. I will take a moment to explain the consequences \nof that proposal and how that proposed unanimous consent request would \nfurther undermine the fundamental rights of Senators to debate and to \namend.\n  The proposed request had four parts: First, at a time determined by \nthe majority leader, the Senate conduct back-to-back votes on the \nRepublican minimum wage amendment and the Boxer amendment; that the \nbill then be limited to germane amendments; that at 9:30 a.m. on \nThursday, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; and that \nthe Senate request a conference with the House and the Chair and be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  I welcome the prospect of having side-by-side votes on the Republican \nminimum wage amendment and the Boxer-Kennedy minimum wage amendment. We \nhave done that in the Senate. That is a fair way to proceed. We want to \nget to amendments and we want to have votes.\n  But the other three parts of the proposed unanimous consent request \nraise real problems. First, limiting amendments to only germane \namendments is a very tight constraint. Senators often seek to offer \namendments to a bill that are very relevant to the bill at hand but do \nnot meet the strict standard of germaneness. Under previous majority \nleaders, the Senate often chose to limit amendments to relevant \namendments but did not go further in limiting amendments to germane \namendments. Limiting amendments to the more narrow standard of \ngermaneness is unduly restrictive.\n  The proposed request sought to set a definite time to vote on passage \nof the bill. Setting a time for certain passage of a bill makes cloture \npale by comparison. At least under cloture you get a right to vote on \nthe amendments that are germane. But under this proposed agreement, a \nSenator could delay, could stand up and talk. He could use all the \nkinds of dilatory, delaying tactics one could use. That would prevent \nvotes on amendments and more strict than cloture where you are entitled \nto a vote.\n\n  It is even more strict than reconciliation. In reconciliation, \nSenators can always offer amendments. Often there is not time to debate \nthem, but they can still offer them. We then have a vote-a-thon. It is \nnot the most illuminating practice, I grant you, but nevertheless, \nSenators have the right to vote.\n  Under this proposed consent request, Senators would not even get a \nright to vote on amendments that may have been brought up or to even \nbring up amendments.\n  Finally, the proposed consent agreement would seek to have the Senate \ngo to conference on the bill. This raises probably the most problematic \nconcern of all. If we went to conference and if the consent agreement \nwere adopted, which would require the appointment of conferees and \nseeking a conference with the House, we would have to ask ourselves, \nwhat is in the House-passed bill.\n  Let me point out some of the provisions in the House-passed welfare \nreform bill. First, the House bill would impose unrealistically high \nwork requirements on TANF recipients, much higher than under either the \nSenate bill or current law. Next, the House bill would provide minimum \nresources for childcare funding. We all know that the Senate passed an \namendment which would increase childcare funding by an appropriate \namount. The House has levels that are so low, according to CBO, \nchildcare is underfunded by about $4.5 to $5 billion. We would have to \nwork out that one, which would not be easy, particularly where the \nWhite House has issued a so-called statement of administrative practice \nwhich says not one thin dime for childcare. That would make it even \nmore difficult for Senate conferees to work out a reasonable childcare \namount, if we were to go to conference.\n  The House would not allow TANF recipients to continue education; that \nis, education they need to get and keep a good job beyond 1 year. That \nrestrictive provision is in the House bill. Moreover, the House would \nprovide what is called a superwaiver which would give the States \nextremely unprecedented broad authority to combine food stamps, \nMedicaid, childcare, and other programs, and use that money however \nthey see fit, undermining the minimal safety net and low-income \nstandards that low-income families have to rely on in their time of \nneed.\n  It would also mandate full family sanctions, not just partial family. \nThat means cutting families off of assistance if they do not comply \nwith the rules, risking real harm to children in the absence of any \nfault of their own.\n  Finally, the House bill does not provide for legal immigrants.\n  The House-passed TANF bill raises serious concerns. Going to \nconference on such a measure would not be a simple thing. It is the \nposition of the Democratic leader that we would have to have a number \nof assurances before Democrats would agree to going to conference on a \nmatter that raised such serious concerns. That is extremely important. \nThat is because a conference report is not subject to amendment. Let's \nnot forget, we are in a unique situation where the same political party \ncontrols not only the White House but both bodies of Congress. Where \nthe majority runs the conference process without substantial input from \nthe minority, the conference process can substantially limit the rights \nof Senators in the minority.\n\n  Thus, the unanimous consent agreement proposed by the majority \nyesterday undercuts the basic rights of Senators. It would severely \nlimit Senators' rights to offer even relevant amendments. It would \nseriously limit Senators' rights to debate; that is, cutting off debate \nabruptly at a certain time no matter how many amendments we had by then \nconsidered.\n  We on this side of the aisle do not wish to delay this bill. There is \nno way we want to delay it. We want votes. We will agree to time \nlimits. Let's get this bill up and amendments up and let the Senate \nwork its will. We are willing to do that. We are willing to work to get \na finite list of amendments. We are willing to enter into time \nagreements on amendments. We are not asking for anything out of the \nordinary.\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\n  During the 13-day period over which the Senate considered the 1995 \nwelfare reform bill, September 7 to September 19, 1995, the Senate \nconducted 43 rollcall votes on amendments. So far this year we have \nconducted just one. So we are not asking for anything new. We ask \nmerely that Senators be able to debate, to amend. We ask merely that \nSenators be able to do that which makes the Senate ``the remarkable \ninvention'' about which Gladstone spoke.\n  I urge my colleagues to uphold the rights of Senators. I urge \nSenators to allow a vote on lifting the minimum wage, and I urge \nSenators to oppose cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we are hopefully at a position today \nwhere there is going to be some decision made by leadership--meaning \nthe Democrat leader and Republican leader--on proceeding on this \nlegislation. In the meantime, we will proceed with amendments and \nhopefully move along as best we can without having a certain finality.\n  I had a chance to listen to my colleagues' statements. I will make \nthis commentary. We have already said to the minority, the Democratic \nleadership, that we are prepared to vote on amendments that are before \nthe Senate. So the issue is not voting on amendments before the Senate. \nThere is some feeling that we are going to get this bill to finality. \nThat doesn't mean not voting on a lot of amendments. That can be worked \nin as well. All we want is some certainty that we are going to get to \nfinality. Finality means getting to conference.\n  We have a couple pieces of legislation that have been sitting around \nthis body, after the body has finished work on them, not being able to \ngo to conference. One is the CARE Act, an acronym for legislation that \nencourages charitable giving. Another one is the Workforce Investment \nAct. These are two pieces of legislation that have been before the \nSenate, and the minority, the Democrats, will not let us go to \nconference on these pieces of legislation.\n  So, in a sense, the Senate has worked its will, but the legislative \nprocess has been shut down. It seems to me if this legislation includes \nso much of what the Democrats want to accomplish in the way of reform \nof welfare--particularly the vote we had yesterday, very dramatically \nincreasing by $6 billion the amount to be spent on childcare--that they \nwould want this legislation to become law. So we need some assurance \nfrom the other side that if we agree to voting on some amendments that \nthey want to vote on--that is no longer an issue--we want to move ahead \nwith germane amendments.\n  There is not an argument about the number at this point. We can get \nto a vote on this, but most important is not have it stalled in the \nSenate as those other two pieces of legislation. It seems to me the \nissue isn't a whole lot different now than it was 2 years ago. The only \ndifference is the Republicans were in the minority, then and the \nDemocrats were in the majority. At that particular time, we saw an \nEnergy bill taken away from the Energy Committee and brought to the \nfloor. That bill never became law. We saw a prescription drug bill \ntaken over by the leadership on the floor of the Senate, with the \ncommittee effectively cut out. There were 2 weeks of debate on an \nEnergy bill but nothing happened. There was not a budget adopted that \nyear.\n  We Republicans referred to the leadership at that time as having a \ngraveyard in the Senate because they wanted issues for that election as \nopposed to products. We Republicans said to the electorate at that time \nthat we want products, not issues. So when we took over in the majority \nin 2003, the committee system was allowed to work, developing \nbipartisanship. Nothing gets done in the Senate without bipartisanship. \nWe could bring the issues to the floor and work the will of the Senate \nand get things through the Senate. That is what we are elected to do--\nget things through the Senate and let the process work.\n  So there is nothing that my colleague from Montana said that I \ndisagree with, except we ought to see light at the end of the tunnel. \nIs there anything wrong with saying: Are you guys--meaning the \nDemocrats--going to do what you did on the Workforce Investment Act and \nthe CARE Act and let the Senate become a graveyard again just because \nsomething is happening that you don't like?\n\n  It seems to me there would be a lesson learned from the last \nelection. When the Senate became a graveyard, the people of this \ncountry sent a message that they don't want the Senate to be a \ngraveyard. They gave the majority to the Republicans. We show that we \ncan produce. Yet look what we are running into--the CARE Act, after a \nyear of not going to conference. I don't know how long the Workforce \nInvestment Act has been waiting to go to conference. We were stalled \nlast week on a bill the Democrats agreed ought to become law, the FSC/\nETI bill. That stalled.\n  I would not say the Welfare Act is stalled. But what do we know is \ndown the road? What is wrong with a little bit of transparency. The \ntransparency is that they present an amendment on minimum wage and they \nwant a vote. So we present a plan to get to a vote on that very \nimportant issue, but we cannot get some assurance that we may not be in \nthe same boat as with the CARE Act and the Workforce Investment Act.\n  When it comes to the minimum wage being important for welfare, I \nsuggest to the other leaders that, as chairman of the committee, in a \nletter I received from them last year, which is not dated--I received \nthis letter, and it was signed by 41 Democrats--telling us the things \nthey wanted in this legislation that the Finance Committee was going to \nbe working on at that particular time. They were setting out priorities \nthey believed we had not adequately dealt with. In this letter, there \nwas never any mention of minimum wage being an important part of \nwelfare reform legislation.\n  I did take what they said in this letter very seriously, and they \ndealt with issues such as universal engagement, ending the caseload \nreduction credit, strengthening child support, extending TMA, providing \nadditional State flexibility, issues dealing with postsecondary \neducation, no superwaiver, no increase in work without State \nflexibility. Of all of those provisions they raised concern about, none \ndealt with minimum wage. I and the majority tried to accommodate the \nminority members who signed this letter and put these things in this \nlegislation. These provisions are all in this bill.\n  Other priorities, as stated by the Democrats, included some \nadditional funding for childcare, and we passed that overwhelmingly \nyesterday. It wasn't something I could get done in committee. I, \nobviously, agreed with that approach because I voted for it yesterday.\n  We also had a request from the Democrats in this letter to increase \nvocational education eligibility for legal immigrants. We have not \ndealt with that, but that is going to be an amendment before the \nSenate.\n  What we have tried to do in this whole process of Republicans gaining \ncontrol of the Senate and letting the committee system work, as opposed \nto 2002 when very major legislation, such as prescription drugs and the \nEnergy bill, was taken away from the committees and brought to the \nfloor--we do not develop bipartisanship on the floor, and they never \nbecame law--we have tried to make the committee system work. When \nspecific requests are made, such as 41 Democrats sending us a letter \nraising concerns about their issues, we try to put them in the \nlegislation and accommodate them so that we have a product instead of \nan issue.\n  The other side ought to tell us if we are going down the same road we \nwent down in 2002 to have the Senate become a graveyard for important \nlegislation because they need issues instead of product. Did they learn \na lesson from the last election? Do they want to lose more seats in the \nSenate? I don't think they do. But I think they have to get a better \ngame plan than shutting down the Senate because we are in the majority \nto make this place work.\n  I know there are a lot of Democrats who are intent upon making this \nplace work, and I know Senator Baucus, my ranking Democrat, is \ncommitted to making this place work. There should not be any reason we \nhave to have a cloture vote, particularly when we made overtures to the \nother side to vote on a lot of important issues on\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\nwhich they want to vote. All we want to know is that we are going to \nget an opportunity to develop a product. This Senate is not the only \nbody that passes legislation that goes to the President; it also takes \nthe House of Representatives. We do not get to finality until there is \na conference committee if there is a difference between the House and \nthe Senate, and in most major pieces of legislation, we have to have a \nconference committee.\n  I do not understand why we can't get to conference on the CARE Act, a \nbill to encourage charitable giving by people who fill out the short \nform of the income tax by giving above-the-line deduction, or having \nthe tax-free rollover IRAs for people who want to give some of their \nlifetime savings to charitable giving. There are a lot of other good \nprovisions in that legislation as well.\n  Do you know what is wrong with that, Madam President? What is \nprobably wrong with that legislation is it is one of the No. 1 goals of \nthe President of the United States, and maybe the other side can't let \nhim have a victory. Yet in the scheme of what the President of the \nUnited States has to do, it may be a No. 1 goal of his, but it is a \nvery small part of the total agenda that this President has of leading \nthis Nation and being the Chief Executive Officer for our Government.\n  What is wrong with the Workforce Investment Act? One would think that \nwith the other side crying all the time about outsourcing--forgetting \nabout insourcing; we have a $58 billion favorable balance of trade on \ninsourcing versus outsourcing--but we all ought to be concerned about \noutsourcing. What does Senator Kerry, as a Democratic candidate for \nPresident, say we need to do about outsourcing? Educate our workforce. \nAnd we have opportunities to move legislation that does that, and we \ncannot get to conference. What is the game?\n  We have offered to the other side votes on important legislation they \nwant. Can they let us see light at the end of the tunnel so we know \nthere are not games being played? I would hope there are people on the \nother side of the body who want this place to work, and there are. I \nwould hope people who want product instead of issues will rise to the \ntop, as cream does, and as cream of the crop remind their leadership of \nwhat happened in the last election, and do they want to be a less \nsignificant minority than we presently are because I think what is good \nabout the Senate is that it keeps the extremes from governing in \nAmerica--the extreme on the left and the extreme on the right.\n  The Senate, when it cooperates and gets things done, governs from the \ncenter. Whether that is 60 votes or 70 votes or 80 votes, we govern \nfrom the center.\n  This is a body that is going to make sure that Nazis do not take over \nAmerica or Communists take over America, and there are none of them in \nthe Congress. But when you do not have the center rule, as Germany \nlearned or as Korinsky learned and tried to show the people of Russia \nin 1917, when the extremes take over, democratic values are lost.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as the cosponsor of this amendment with \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, I do want to clarify for the \nrecord where we are and the view those who are sponsoring the amendment \nhave with regard to proceeding on the TANF reauthorization legislation, \nwhich is before us.\n  Because we have had characterizations made about our amendment, I \nwish to clarify for the benefit of the Senate and, more importantly, \nfor the American people exactly what the current situation is before \nthe Senate.\n  Before the Senate, we have what we call the TANF legislation, to move \npeople off welfare into employment. As has been mentioned on a number \nof occasions--I have a copy of the report--the point is made by the \nRepublican floor manager that this amendment to increase the minimum \nwage is not pertinent to this legislation and, therefore, because of \nthe fact we are offering it, we are delaying the whole process even \nthough we indicated to the floor manager we were eager to enter into a \nvery short time agreement, a 20-minute time agreement, time to be \nevenly divided, a time certain, and then move on to another amendment.\n  We want to make very clear, speaking for the supporters of the \namendment, we are interested in coming to a resolution. The answer on \nthe other side is, well, since this is not relevant to the subject at \nhand, we are not going to let a vote occur. That is a rather unusual \nprocess and procedure. As to amendments on legislation, unlike \nappropriations, the Senate rules permit a vote on legislation, but the \nmajority does not choose to do so. Therefore, they refuse to let us get \na vote on this and then criticize us for delaying the process even \nthough we are prepared to vote this afternoon. It is 12:30 now; we can \nvote at 1, or whatever time the floor manager would permit us to do so.\n  I mention once again how ridiculous I think the argument is from the \nother side that this is not a relevant amendment. If one looks at the \nlegislation itself dealing with TANF and looks through the report, as I \nhave said previously, they can look under ``strengthens work,'' that is \nwhat this legislation is supposedly all about. If we take the statement \nof the Secretary of HHS, Tommy Thompson--listen to this--regarding the \nTANF reauthorization requirements:\n\n       This administration recognizes that the only way to escape \n     poverty is through work, and that is why we have made work \n     and jobs that will pay at least the minimum wage the \n     centerpiece of the reauthorization proposal for the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.\n\n  Here it is, the administration spokesman talking about the \ncenterpiece of the TANF will pay a minimum wage. That is exactly what \nwe are trying to do. How is it possible that the floor manager can say \nthis is not relevant when the Secretary of HHS specifically refers to a \nminimum wage? How can they possibly take that position? How can they \nsay we are trying to delay it when we are prepared to go ahead with a \nshort time limit?\n  The American people must be greatly confused. Here it is, the \nSecretary of HHS, the President's representative on this issue, saying \nthis administration recognizes the only way to escape poverty is \nthrough work and that is why we have made work and jobs that will pay \nat least the minimum wage the centerpiece of the reauthorization \nproposal for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. That \nis the statement he had at that time on March 6, 2002.\n  As the report goes on, the other references I have talked about, \n``reasons for change,'' to move welfare recipients into good jobs, good \njobs obviously suggest they are going to be halfway decent.\n  The committee refers to the reasons for the change, that the \ncommittee wants to build by increasing work and reducing the welfare \nand talking about good jobs. That is the reference all the way through. \nThat is what the Secretary has said. We have indicated we are prepared \nto move ahead and move ahead immediately, but we are denied the \nopportunity to do so. And that is with regard to procedure.\n  I listened earlier to my friend and colleague from Oklahoma saying we \nreally do not need a minimum wage; we ought to let the market decide \nand make these judgments and decisions. Well, we have heard that. I \nhave heard that since I arrived in the Senate, not only every time we \nhave the chance to debate the minimum wage. Then he talks about the \nchallenges we are facing in rural areas are not the same challenges as \nthey face in urban areas, which we have understood. That is why we have \nan exclusion for agricultural workers. We have a different kind of a \nfinancial situation for mom-and-pop stores rather than the large stores \nin many urban areas. That is why we have a cap and say if you have \napproximately $600,000 or less gross earnings, you do not have to \nobserve the minimum wage provisions. We responded to these rifleshot \nideas that have been constantly brought up during the debates on the \nminimum wage.\n\n  I would like to go back to the general kinds of themes that were \nbrought out. As we understand, this is a minimum wage, not a maximum \nwage. We are talking about a minimum wage to meet minimum kinds of \nstandards in this country. Hopefully we have gone beyond the debate \nabout whether we were going to have the robber barons or the \nmonopolists in this society have individuals who are in the workforce \nso thoroughly and completely exploited.\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\n  Many in the Senate have been up to visit the old mill towns of \nMassachusetts, and one can still travel up to Lowell and visit many of \nthose old textiles and they will see the letters from children who are \n7 and 8 years old who were writing and who were working in the mills 10 \nor 12 hours a day, in many instances 7 days a week. Some of the most \nmoving of those letters are by these children who write looking outside \nthe windows and seeing other children playing outside and dreaming of \nthe time that they might be able to do so.\n  In the old days when we did not have any kind of protections for any \nworkers, we had extraordinary exploitation of children in the \nworkforce. Well, that goes back to the time where the Government was \nnot involved. In 1938, after a great deal of struggle, sweat, and \nbloodshed, all that changed with the very important child labor laws. \nSome had been passed before. Basically, we established the minimum \nwage, the time and a half for overtime, and the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, even though the overtime issue in question is now threatened by \nthis administration that wants to abolish overtime for some 8 million \nworkers, mostly firefighters, policemen, and nurses who in many \ninstances are our first responders. All one has to do is go to any \nhospital and talk to some of those nurses and find out how in many \ninstances they are required to work overtime, and find out their views \nabout quality of care.\n  Now imagine if overtime is eliminated and there is that kind of \nrequirement. We have a shortage of nurses today. One can imagine what \nis going to happen tomorrow if that particular recommendation by the \nadministration is put into effect. So basically we are talking about a \nminimum wage.\n  We can hear on the other side, as we heard earlier from the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, well, it is important to get on the bottom rung of the \nladder because if one gets on the bottom rung of the ladder, they \ndevelop certain kinds of skills and attitudes and will be able to move \nahead and have a successful life.\n  Well, there are certain truths to getting on a bottom rung of the \nladder if the bottom rung of the ladder is not so low it actually \nsubmerges a person and they cannot survive on the bottom rung of the \nladder because they are so overwhelmed by the challenges of life, of \nbeing able to survive. That is what we are talking about, having the \nbottom rung of the ladder so that at least one can make a living wage, \nthey are going to at least be treated with some sense of dignity in \nthis country of ours, which is the richest country in the world.\n  There are people who are struggling. It does appear, by those who are \nopposed to the increase in the minimum wage, there is some \ndismissiveness about the individuals who are receiving it. I do not buy \nthat. The minimum wage workers in the workforce I have met are among \nsome of the most courageous and dignified men and women one will ever \nwant to meet.\n  I am going to mention who we are really talking about. Who are these \npeople who are earning the minimum wage? We have heard speeches on the \nfloor. Let's put some human faces on these individuals. Shreveport, LA: \nIt was early April, and 46-year-old Mrs. Williams was dressed in the \ndark blue uniform she wears at her first job caring for the aged and \ninfirm at a nursing home. On top there was a gray apron she dons for \nher second job cleaning offices at night. The place where she works as \na nursing assistant, Harmony House, was paying her $5.50 an hour, \nbarely above the minimum wage, even though she had been there for 10 \nyears as a union member and completed college courses to become \ncertified. The cleaning job which she took up because she could not \nmake ends meet pays right at the Federally mandated $5.15 an hour.\n\n       ``You think you are moving forwards,'' adds Ms. Williams, \n     ``but you're just moving backwards.''\n\n  Mr. Valles earns his living serving hamburgers at a McDonald's \nrestaurant in downtown Los Angeles. He's a family man. He and his wife, \nLily, have two children.\n\n       ``I make $5.75 an hour. That's about $240 a week. One \n     hundred ninety dollars after taxes. You can't really live on \n     that. Lily works in a fast-food place, too. She makes the \n     same as me. Two weeks of my pay and two weeks of her pay \n     every month goes for rent. Then you have to pay the fare to \n     go back and forth to work. You gotta pay for your food. You \n     have bills. We're still paying on the sofa. . . .''\n       I asked if they ever went on vacation. He looked at me as \n     if I asked if his children could fly. ``No,'' said Mr. Valles \n     quietly. ``There is no money for vacation.''\n\n  The list goes on. We have this situation:\n\n       As she weighs bunches of purple grapes or rings up fat \n     chicken legs at the supermarket where she works, Fannie Payne \n     cannot keep from daydreaming.\n       ``It's difficult to work at a grocery store all day, \n     looking at all the food I can't buy,'' Mrs. Payne said. ``So \n     I imagine filling up my cart with one of those big orders and \n     bringing home enough for all my kids.''\n       Instead, she said that she and her husband, Michael, a \n     factory worker, routinely go without dinner to make sure \n     their four children have enough to eat. They visit a private \n     hunger center monthly for three days' worth of free \n     groceries, to help stretch the $60 a week they spend on food.\n       ``We're behind on all our bills,'' Mrs. Payne said. ``We \n     don't pay electricity until they threaten a cut-off. To be \n     honest, I'm behind two months on the mortgage--that's $600 a \n     month. We owe $800 on the water bill and $500 for heat.''\n       The Euclid Hunger Center helped her seek aid from her \n     parish, Saint William's Catholic Church, but it hurt that \n     three cars broke down in six months.\n       ``They all died and we had to get Mike to work, so we \n     bought a good used car we can't afford.''\n       The first thing to go was money for food herself and \n     husband. ``Some nights Mike and I eat our kids' leftovers, \n     and if we don't have enough money for milk, I feed the kids \n     soup for breakfast,'' she said.\n       Living with housing hardship. Hector Cuatepotzo, a waiter \n     in the upscale Miramar Hotel in Santa Monica, lives in a \n     tiny, one-bedroom apartment with his wife, Maria, 6-year-old \n     daughter, Ashley, and infant son, Bryan. All four sleep in \n     the same small room, with Bryan's crib nestled in one corner, \n     Ashley's bed in another.\n       Cuatepotzo earns about $20,000 a year in salary and tips, \n     equal to about $10 an hour, almost twice the minimum wage. \n     But with $625 a month in rent and another $80 monthly gas and \n     electricity, the family spends more than 40 percent of their \n     income for housing. Cuatepotzo works from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. \n     and travels 40 miles round-trip to work each day because \n     rents in buildings closer to his job are even higher.\n       Since Maria took time off from her job in the restaurant to \n     have the baby, they received several eviction notices for \n     late payment.\n       Cuatepotzo is thinking about getting a second job, but that \n     would mean rarely seeing his children. Cuatepotzo, who has \n     worked at the Miramar since arriving from Mexico 10 years \n     ago, would like to own his own home someday. ``It's my \n     dream,'' he says. But he can't imagine how he'll ever get \n     there when his family lives paycheck to paycheck.\n\n  This is what is happening all across this country. These are not \npeople who are slackers; they are hard workers.\n  Here is Deborah, 23, from Pennsylvania, a single mother and survivor \nof domestic violence. She has two daughters. She was evicted from her \nhome in New Jersey. She now resides in Clairton, PA, where she works as \na salesperson in a grocery store earning $5.35 for 30 to 35 hours a \nweek. Deborah has no health coverage for herself or her girls. Her \nearnings are spread thin to cover childcare expenses, transportation, \nfood, and $50 a month for her bedroom at her aunt's. An increase in the \nminimum wage would help Deborah catch up on lagging bills, come closer \nto making ends meet, get needed doctor appointments for her children at \na pay-for-service clinic, and purchase clothing for her children, who \nlost everything in the eviction and the escape from domestic violence.\n  Pat Rodriguez lives in Washington, has worked at a laundry and \ndrycleaners in Washington for 8 years. She earns $6.15 an hour, the \nminimum wage for the District of Columbia. Currently she and her \ncolleagues are on strike over low wages and other issues. The money she \nearns working full time is not enough to pay the rent, pay for the \nbasic necessities for her family. She has a 2-year-old child and is \nexpecting a second child. She has no pension, no access to affordable \nhealth care, and relies on Medicaid. She works full time and still does \nnot make enough to be able to save for the children's education. Pat \nsays, ``I support raising the minimum wage, but I also want workers to \nbe treated with respect, and for their work be valued accordingly.''\n  Elaine Murphy and her three children, 16, 11 and 6, recently moved to \nNewburgh, NY, from Oregon. Mrs. Murphy is a teacher's aide and special\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\nneeds bus aide in the local elementary school. Every morning she is in \nthe bus yard at 6:30, waiting to escort handicapped children on the \nbus. Then she works in the school offices and in classrooms until \naround 3, when she gets back on the bus and escorts the handicapped \nchildren to their homes. In Oregon, she made $10 an hour doing similar \nwork, but in the new job, she is paid the minimum wage.\n  The job suits her needs as a mother of three. She can be home in the \nafternoon to look after her 6-year-old, who is autistic and needs the \nkind of close supervision the school's afterschool program is not able \nto provide. There are daycare centers that could care for their son, \nbut the cost is prohibitive. Her 16-year-old son is athletic, and after \nschool she is able to drive him to practices and games.\n  Despite the fact that Elaine works full time, she is paid so little \nthat she qualifies for food stamps and her children receive health care \nthrough Medicaid. This bothers Elaine. She doesn't want Government \nassistance. She wants to work hard and provide for her family. In the \nschool district where she works, janitors and others are paid enough to \nsupport their families while Elaine has little choice but to turn to \nthe Government for assistance. She perceives the problem as this: The \nassumption is that women who work as teachers' aides or do similar work \nare not supporting their families but, rather, working to supplement \nthe household income. In her case, this is not true. Elaine is the sole \nprovider for her three children.\n  For Elaine and her family, a higher minimum wage would mean a greater \ndegree of self-sufficiency. Getting a second job is out of the question \ngiven her responsibilities at home. At the present rate of pay, making \nends meet is impossible without Government subsidies. Elaine argues \nthat working 40 hours a week for something as important as special \nneeds education, she should not need Government handouts; that through \nhard work, she should be able to provide for her children.\n  This is it. These are the real faces of people who are out there, \ntrying to make ends meet. Our proposal was to increase the minimum wage \njust to $7. I will show the chart here, what more has happened with \nregard to the minimum wage over recent years.\n  On the far side of the chart, this is purchasing power in the year \n2000, dollar purchasing capability; in 1968 the equivalent of $8.50 for \nminimum wage. The red line indicates how the minimum wage has gradually \ndropped, how we were able to get it raised in 1990, and how we were \nable to get it raised in 1997 and 1998. Now we see it dropping without \nthis increase to about its alltime low.\n  This is a minimum wage, not a maximum wage. We hear those saying, if \nyou are going to go for $7, why not go $10 or $15? That is missing the \npoint. What we are trying to do is get this increased to $7. That will \nstill put it below where it was for a period of 12 or 14 years, but at \nleast it gets it much closer to a living wage.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. We should understand it. \nThis amendment affects real people. I gave some examples of real \npeople. I have given examples of why the Secretary of HHS believes a \nminimum wage job is relevant to this bill. We have indicated we are \nprepared to vote on it. We daresay it is those on the other side, who \ndo not want to vote on it, who are actually filibustering.\n  I want to come to this issue and talk a little bit about the impact \non families, and particularly the impact on children in terms of \nhunger, the problems of hunger.\n  In 1938, we had the child labor law. We had minimum wage, and we put \ntime and a half for overtime pay in there so workers would be \nconsidered. What we have looked at in more recent times, as hunger has \nbeen a defining aspect for people as well, we have tried to take a look \nat what the impact is on hunger, what the impact would be.\n  First of all, this chart: Hunger is increasing for minimum wage \nfamilies. The Agriculture Department reported more than 300,000 more \nfamilies are hungry today than when President Bush first took office. \nMore than 12 million American households are worried that they would \nnot have enough to eat, and nearly 4 million households had someone go \nhungry. African-American households, Latino households, and households \nheaded by single mothers were much more likely than the national \naverage to experience food insecurity, and also more likely to \nexperience hunger.\n  I have the household food security for the United States. This study, \nput out by the Department of Agriculture, shows very clearly what is \nhappening to families, and particularly families with minimum wage. \nWhat you find out is that in 1998, there were 14 million children who \nwere living in families where there was a real problem in terms of food \nsecurity, and then that went down in 1999 to 12 million.\n  In the year 2000, it is 12 million. Then we see in 2001 that it began \nto turn around. In 2002, it is 14 million going right back up again. We \nwere seeing the decline in terms of the impact of hunger on children in \nthis country. Now we see as a result of the economic policies and \nfailure to increase the minimum wage the fact that hunger is again \ntaking off in these minimum wage households.\n  This is an excellent report done by the State of Massachusetts. It is \ncalled ``Walk For Hunger, Project Bread.'' I will include in the Record \nthe appropriate parts of the study.\n\n       According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 425,000 \n     people in Massachusetts lack access to adequate food. In low-\n     income communities in Massachusetts, 20 percent of households \n     cannot afford to buy enough food to meet the basic \n     nutritional needs of household members. The prevalence of \n     hunger is highest among families with children. Today, in \n     low-income communities, one child in three lives in a \n     household struggling to put food on the table.\n\n  Our State is one of the most prosperous, fortunately, in the country. \nThis is what is happening in households in my State. If it is happening \nin Massachusetts, it is happening in States across this country.\n  We have the broad figures. As we go along, I will have the \nopportunity to continue to give speeches and to point this out.\n  Listen to this one more time.\n\n       According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 425,000 \n     people in Massachusetts lack access to adequate food. In low-\n     income communities in Massachusetts, 20 percent of the \n     households cannot afford to buy enough food to meet the basic \n     nutritional needs of household members. The prevalence of \n     hunger is highest among families with children. Today, in \n     low-income communities, one child in three lives in a \n     household struggling to put food on the table.\n\n  And we have opposition to an increase in the minimum wage.\n  How much evidence do you need over there? How much child hunger do \nyou need to increase the minimum wage? What more in the world do you \nneed?\n  That is happening not only in my State but in States all over this \ncountry. Children are facing real hunger because the parents are \nfalling further and further and further behind.\n  I have a book full of those examples, some of which I read. I have a \nbook full of examples from all over the country. This is what is \nhappening. The problem is getting worse.\n  The Department of Agriculture indicates there are 35 million \nAmericans hungry or living on the edge of hunger for economic reasons--\n35 million of our fellow citizens. There are 290 million people in this \ncountry, and 35 million of them are facing serious challenges with \nhunger in the United States today.\n  We will have a chance in half an hour, if you want to take a very \nmodest step to increase the minimum wage. It is not going to solve the \nproblem, but it will sure do more about it than the current legislation \nwhich is before us. That we know.\n  There are 300,000 more families hungry today than when this \nadministration first took office. Twenty-three million Americans sought \nemergency food assistance from the hunger relief organization Second \nHarvest.\n\n  Isn't that a fine description of what our country is coming to.\n  As I indicated, these are men and women of dignity and respect, \npeople who are working hard. We find in a number of the hunger \nprograms, the Food Stamp Program and others, they are vastly \nunderutilized because men and women have a sense of pride. They don't \nwant to take handouts from the Federal Government. Even some of the \nschool lunch programs are underutilized in some areas because parents \ndon't want to have their children appear to come from a poor community.\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\nThey are used to a higher degree than food stamps, but, nonetheless, \nthat happens.\n  These are men and women of pride. It is a real problem. These \nfamilies, as I mentioned--23 million, Second Harvest--cannot afford \nbalanced adequate diets. Parents are skipping meals so their children \ncan eat. Nationwide, soup kitchens and food pantries and homeless \nshelters are increasingly serving the working poor--not just the \nunemployed.\n  Both the U.S. Conference of Mayors and Catholic Charities report \nwitnessing sharp increases in the use of emergency services offered by \nthe cities and the Catholic Charity agencies.\n  In 2003, the survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors that looks at \nhunger found 39 percent of adults requesting food assistance were \nemployed.\n  Effectively, 40 percent of people who are trying to get some \nadditional food assistance are employed and work hard.\n  This is the conclusion of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as well as \nCatholic Charities--a leading cause of hunger is low-paying jobs.\n  How much more evidence do you need? Do we think the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors is a tool of just the Democratic side of the Senate when \nRepublican and Democrat mayors alike across this country are talking \nabout the increasing problems they are facing and the challenges that \nfamilies and their communities are facing when they say one of the \nprincipal reasons there is explosion in the hunger needs of children in \nthis country is because of low-paying jobs?\n  That is what this amendment is about--to do something about low-\npaying jobs.\n  We have a chance to do something about it. We have done it in the \npast. We are denied the chance to do something right now about it.\n  If cloture is successful, we ought to say it as it is. It will defeat \nthis amendment. Evidently, the Republican leadership fears voting on \nthis amendment, for reasons I can't possibly fathom, so much they are \ndelaying the Senate a whole day. Here we are on Wednesday at 1 o'clock, \nand we are not going to be permitted to vote. We could vote on this in \nhalf an hour. No, you can't vote on it. We are going to make sure the \nSenate doesn't do any work this afternoon because we feel so intensely \nabout increasing the minimum wage. We are against it going to $7 an \nhour over a 2-year period. We are going to insist on cloture--the \nunusual step of cloture in the Senate--in order to bring that amendment \ndown so we will not even have to vote on it even though the Secretary \nof HHS has indicated minimum wage is essential to the success of this \nprogram.\n  Is there anything more ludicrous? Is there anything that makes less \nsense?\n  It is absolutely out of our imagination that Republicans feel so \nintensely in opposition they will refuse to let this institution vote \non this measure which can make a difference in terms of children in \npoverty, families in poverty, proud men and women who are trying to \nprovide for their children, a step that we have taken 11 different \ntimes since the minimum wage was passed with Republicans and Democrats \nalike. But what it is about is this Republican leadership that says: \nNo, we are not even going to let you vote on it.\n\n  We had difficulties other times trying to get a vote on it. I will \ncertainly admit that. And the record will show that. But eventually we \nwere able to do that, and eventually we were able to get it passed. But \nthe ferocity of opposition this time is mind-boggling to this Senator.\n  Listen to this, again from the U.S. Conference of Mayors: Emergency \nfood assistance increased by 14 percent. This is just in 1 year. These \nare the 2003 figures. Fifty-nine percent of those requesting emergency \nfood assistance were members of families, children.\n  And then: City officials recommend raising the Federal minimum wage \nas a way the Federal Government can help alleviate hunger.\n  Here it is, the Conference of Mayors--Democrat, Republican, mayors \nfrom all over this country; North, South, East, West; Republican and \nDemocrat--talking about hunger, talking about the particular hunger \nneeds of children, talking about the problems of the growth of hunger \nfor working families, and they make one single recommendation: increase \nthe minimum wage. And we cannot even get a vote on it in the Senate.\n  Can you imagine people watching the Senate and hearing: Well, no, we \ncan't vote on that. We can't vote on that. We are just not going to \nvote. And they say: Why? It looks as if those who are proposing it are \nready to vote on it.\n  We are. When are you ready to vote on it? In 20 minutes, half an \nhour? We are prepared. We have offered time limitations.\n  They say: You are?\n  What is wrong with the other side? They say it is not relevant to the \nunderlying bill. They say it is not relevant.\n  Let's see. Is that the way the Senate works?\n  Let me help you figure out why it is relevant because I have a \nstatement from the President's representative on this bill. This is \nwhat the President says. The President says:\n\n       This administration recognizes that the only way to escape \n     poverty--\n\n  He is talking now about the underlying bill--\n\n     is through work, and that is why we have made work and jobs \n     that will pay at least the minimum wage the centerpiece of \n     the reauthorization proposal for the Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families (TANF) program.\n\n  Well, then they say: Wait a minute, I thought the Republicans said \nyour amendment is not relevant. And now you are saying the Secretary of \nHHS says you should have a good job that pays an adequate minimum wage? \nYes.\n  And they say: It would seem to me it would be relevant.\n  It does to me, too. That should be understandable to any third grader \nor fourth grader, but it is not to the Republican leadership because \nthey do not want to pass it because they have powerful interest groups \nthat do not want to pass it. That is the reason: special interest \ngroups that refuse to let this pass. That is it. That is what this is \nabout. You cannot get around it.\n  So we have taken a few examples of who the people are who are \naffected, what kind of lives they are living, and what has been \nhappening in one State that is a pretty prosperous State, my own State \nof Massachusetts, that has done a very detailed study. I will include \nthat, as I mentioned, as a fierce indictment in terms of the failure \nof both our State and the Federal Government to be able to provide the \nhelp and assistance.\n\n  We have the one recommendation by Republicans and Democrats alike, \nthe mayors all over this country, who are close to the people on it and \nsay: We have one single recommendation. They did not recommend the \nextension of TANF. They recommended one thing: increasing the minimum \nwage. That was their single recommendation.\n  We heard statements just yesterday. I, very briefly, will respond to \nthe arguments that if we raise the minimum wage we are going to \ncontribute to the problems of unemployment in our society. I am glad to \ngo through this issue. We have extended charts. We have debated this \nfrequently the other times we had the increase, with the Kruger studies \nfrom New Jersey, which are probably the most extensive studies. I have \nthe whole working paper.\n  It goes into great detail as to the impact, historically, on the job \nmarket.\n  As I mentioned before, the yellow line on this chart is the rate of \nunemployment in the year we increased the minimum wage, showing the \nrate of unemployment in October, when we had the second increase in the \nminimum wage, and then several months later.\n  So you have the cumulative two increases in the minimum wage. And \nwhat was its impact on the rate of unemployment? As you see, going back \nto the 1996 increase, 1997, and then several months later, the \nunemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent.\n  If you break it out with regard to African Americans, Hispanics, and \nteens, it is very much the same. You had 10 percent unemployment for \nAfrican Americans, and 9.5 percent. If you take both the increase in \nthat year and this year, and then take the result for those two, look \nat the next year; it was at 9.3 percent. If you look among Hispanic \nAmericans, it is the same pattern. And if you look among the teens, it \nis the same pattern.\n  Strong opposition said it is going to increase unemployment, it is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\nincrease teen unemployment, and minority unemployment. It does not do \nso.\n  Another factor is the issue about whether this is going to be an \ninflater. As I mentioned, if you look it over--for those who want to \ntake the time, it is not very difficult to do--but if you take the \nincrease, the total number of people who are going to be affected by \nthe increase in the minimum wage, and take the total payroll, you will \nfind out the impact.\n  We know increasing the minimum wage by $1.85, as I have pointed out, \nis vital to workers but a drop in the bucket to the national payroll. \nAll Americans combined earn $5.7 trillion. And a $1.85 minimum wage \nincrease would be less than one-fifth of 1 percent of the total \nnational payroll. So spare us--spare us--the arguments about the \nadverse impact of an increase in the minimum wage on unemployment and \non minorities and on teenagers, and spare us the argument that this is \ngoing to add to the issues of inflation because it does not do that.\n  What it will do is, it will help some extremely hard-working \nfamilies. It will help many workers who work hard clearing out the \nbuildings at nighttime, being assistants to our teachers in our high \nschools and elementary schools in our country, working in nursing homes \nas assistants. These are minimum wage workers, and they are men and \nwomen of dignity. They are not looking for Government handouts. They \nwant to be able to work hard and raise their children and live with the \nrespect of their children and spend time with their children.\n  That is why this is a women's issue because the great majority of \nthose who receive the minimum wage are women. It is a children's issue \nbecause so many of those women have children. It is a family issue \nbecause the relationship between, primarily, single mothers--not always \nbut primarily single mothers--and their children is dictated by whether \nthe mother has one or two or even sometimes three minimum wage jobs. \nThe time, or lack of time, they are able to spend with their children, \nobviously, is enormously important.\n  This minimum wage is also a civil rights issue because so many of the \nmen and women who receive the minimum wage are men and women of color.\n  It is a civil rights issue, a children's issue, a family issue, a \nwomen's issue. Basically, it is a fairness issue because these men and \nwomen in this country believe if you work hard--you work hard--40 hours \na week, 52 weeks of the year, you should not have to live in poverty.\n  If you look, after all is said and done, at where the poverty level \nis for a family of three, it will be something under $15,000. And even \nwith our increase in the minimum wage, they are going to be well below \nthat.\n  We are prepared to vote early this afternoon. We don't need more \ntime. We can take more time, but we are prepared to vote at any \nparticular time. This side has made its case. People in this body know \nwhat the issue is all about. It is not enormously complicated. They \nunderstand it. We are prepared to vote. It is a very simple vote. If it \nis finally enacted in the House--and I think with a strong vote here it \nwill be--and if it is signed by the President--and if we have a strong \nvote in the House and the Senate, the President is going to sign it--it \nis going to make a big difference because 60 days after enactment, the \nfirst phase of it will begin to give some new hope to some of the \nhardest working men and women in the country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are involved in debate on a \nnongermane amendment the Democrats have offered on which we Republicans \nhave said we are willing to vote, assuming we can have finality on this \nlegislation and make sure we get to conference.\n  In the meantime, while those procedural issues are being worked out, \nI wish to express some views on the subject of minimum wage.\n  The proponents of this legislation claim they want to make sure that \nworkers are able to earn a livable wage. Who doesn't know that is \nnecessary for people to get along in this world? It is not very clear \nto me what the term ``livable wage'' means. But those who use the term \nseem to believe a person working at a minimum wage ought to earn more \nthan the poverty level.\n  So let us consider that goal for a moment. Although there is more \nthan one way to define poverty, the Department of Health and Human \nServices publishes the poverty guidelines each year. These guidelines \nare used to determine eligibility for low-income programs like food \nstamps. For a single individual, the poverty guideline then would be \n$9,310 a year. Under current law, any job subject to the Federal \nminimum wage must pay at least $5.15 an hour. Assuming a person worked \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, at a minimum wage, they would earn \nover $10,000 a year. Even after deducting Federal income taxes owed on \nthis amount, a minimum wage worker is left with more money than the \npoverty guidelines.\n  I would like to repeat that a full-time minimum wage worker already \nearns more than the poverty level.\n  Now, is that a livable wage? The answer is that it depends. Even in \nmy State of Iowa not very many people would say that is very ideal; in \nfact, just the opposite. Most people would look for much higher than \nthat. According to the Census Bureau, more than 2 million workers have \nhourly wages at or below the minimum wage. More than one-fourth of \nthese workers are between the ages of 16 and 19.\n  So is $5.15 an hour a livable wage? If one is a teenager living at \nhome with their parents, they probably feel like they are making a lot \nof money. But what about other minimum wage workers? According to the \nCensus Bureau, 85 percent of the people earning the minimum wage live \nwith their parents, have a working spouse or live alone. Only 15 \npercent of the minimum wage workers are trying to support a family.\n  For those few who are trying to support a family, $5.15 an hour is \nobviously not enough income. Fortunately, these families do not have to \nget by on $5.15 an hour because under current law these families are \neligible for Federal assistance through the earned income tax credit \nand through the food stamp program, two programs that are meant to \nencourage people into the workforce in a way that there is good return \non it.\n  A single mom with two children working full-time at minimum wage \nwould qualify for more than $4,000 in refundable tax credits and more \nthan $2,000 in food stamps. On an hourly basis, that works out to more \nthan $8 an hour. Even after Federal taxes are withheld, a single mom \nwith two children is left with more than $15,670, which is the poverty \nguideline for a family of three. Thus, the debate cannot really be \nabout getting people out of poverty.\n  Some people might say that these workers should not have to rely on \nGovernment programs to escape poverty, and those people working would \nlook for a day in the future when they were making enough money that \nthey would not qualify for the earned income tax credit or qualify for \nfood stamps. But other people might say that employers should not be so \ncheap, that they ought to pay their employees more than the poverty \nlevel wages.\n  As I have just explained, the poverty level varies by the size of the \nfamilies. Employers cannot pay their workers based on the size of their \nfamilies. I do not know that they ever have. When one stops at a local \ndonut shop, they do not charge $5 on Tuesday when the cashier is a \nteenager living at home with his parents and then charge $7 on Thursday \nwhen the cashier is a single mom raising two children. That is not the \nway the real world of economics or the business place works. Any \nbusiness that tried to do things that way would no longer be in \nbusiness.\n  The wages earned by workers are determined by the value that \nconsumers place on the goods and services produced by the workers. \nEmployers cannot pay their employees more than customers are willing to \npay. In fact, in most cases, customers do have\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\nchoices of where to buy their goods and services. They do not have to \nstop at the local donut shop. If they want to, they can eat at home, or \nsome may just decide to do without.\n\n  Those who support raising the minimum wage claim that they are \nhelping workers earn a livable wage, but if Congress could wave a magic \nwand and if Congress would raise wages by legislative decree, why would \nthey stop at $7 an hour? Why not $70? Why not $700? Then everybody \ncould be a millionaire.\n  The reason supporters of a minimum wage stop at $7 is because they \nknow if the minimum wage is raised higher it means yet higher prices \nand fewer jobs. To deny these facts is to deny economic reality.\n  Proof? There is plenty of proof. It is very evident by the fact that \nno one has proposed raising the minimum wage to $70 or $700 an hour. \nRaising the minimum wage by $7 or $70 or $700 all have ensuing ill \neffects. The only difference is the smaller the increase the smaller \nthe effect. Those who support a smaller increase are hoping that by \nonly raising the minimum wage to $7, the price increases and the job \nlosses will be small enough that no one will complain too loudly.\n  Minimizing the damage will not stop the damage. Raising the minimum \nwage to $7 an hour is going to cost employers $6 billion a year. That \nis a $6 billion tax increase on a small segment of our economy, \nparticularly the small business sector of the economy. Ironically, out \nof those costs of $6 billion, roughly $5 billion will go to workers who \nare not supporting a family while $1 billion is going to go to workers \nwho are supporting a family.\n  In other words, raising the minimum wage for everyone means only $1 \nout of every $6 goes to those who are most in need and particularly \nthose we are trying to help with this bill to move people from welfare \nto work. That is a very expensive way to help low-income families.\n  One might try to justify this costly and inefficient policy if it \nwere the only way to help those in need, but as I have already \ndiscussed raising the minimum wage is not about getting people out of \npoverty. A single mom working full-time at the minimum wage, with one \nor two children, is already out of poverty, thanks to the earned income \ntax credit and thanks to food stamps. If we want to help low income \nworkers, we should support policies like the earned income tax credit \nand food stamps that provide help to those who need it the most.\n  Congress does not have a magic wand. It cannot repeal the law of \nsupply and demand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to my friend from Iowa, and he \nis my friend. It is amazing to hear the response to an increase in the \nminimum wage. They say we are going to let other Government programs \nlook out after these proud, hard workers who are trying to provide for \nthemselves and for their families. Effectively, if we follow the way \nthat the Senator from Iowa suggests, we are going to have to tax more \npeople a lot more so that those programs are going to be there because \nwe refuse to have employers do what they should do, and that is to pay \na fair wage.\n  Sure, everybody could be put on welfare and not have any minimum \nwage. What is the possible logic? Those Senators on the other side have \nbeen trying to cut those programs back for years. The programs dealing \nwith nutrition, home heating and programs for food, they have been \ntrying to cut those back for years. This administration has been trying \nto make EITC much more difficult to get.\n  In order to oppose the increase in minimum wage, they say, well, the \nEITC program is out there. We are talking about proud men and women who \nwant to work hard and look after their children and have a sense of \ndignity and not depend on welfare programs. The answer for those who \nare opposed to us is, give them more welfare programs.\n  That is an insult to these working men and women. We reject that as \nan argument. We reject it.\n  We are standing for the dignity of those working men and women who \nought, in the richest country in the world, in the strongest economy, \nto be able to work hard and bring up their children with respect and \ndignity and not a handout.\n  The Senator makes the point why we need the increase in the minimum \nwage. Because those workers are not receiving it today on their own. \nThey should be able to get it. We are committed to trying to get an \nincrease on the minimum wage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: We are under a \ncloture motion that has been filed on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A cloture motion has been filed on this \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Since I have been recognized and I have the floor, is \nthere a time limit on how long this Senator can speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit at this point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent I be added as a \ncosponsor on this amendment to raise the minimum wage. I strongly \nsupport the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, and Senator Kennedy.\n  Let's be clear at the outset. The current level of $5.15 an hour as a \nminimum wage is a poverty wage--actually less than a poverty wage, \nwhich I will show in a minute. It is a wage that does not respect the \ndignity of work, including the most humble work in this country. That \nis wrong. I say the President of the United States ought to be ashamed \nof himself, this Senate ought to be ashamed of itself, the House of \nRepresentatives ought to be ashamed of itself, that we would let the \nminimum wage get as low as it has gotten, forcing more and more \nfamilies into poverty and on food stamps.\n  I just heard my colleague from Iowa saying, rather than raising the \nminimum wage, we ought to be putting more into food stamps. What kind \nof a solution is that? I thought we were going to give people the \ndignity of work. We ought to get them off welfare and get them into \njobs. Now I hear some people say the best thing is giving them more \nfood stamps. I am all for food stamps. It has been a real blessing to \nour society. But that is sort of a welfare answer. It sounds as if we \nturned the clock back and we go back on welfare again.\n  The economic policies of this administration are simply not working \nas advertised. It is still sputtering. The recovery remains fragile. \nThe President has assured us again and again that tax cuts \noverwhelmingly for the wealthy will stimulate the economy and create \nmore jobs and get this country moving. Over the last 3 years we have \nhad nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts, but we have lost more than 2 \nmillion jobs. The President's economic policies, including tax cuts, \noutsourcing of jobs, not increasing the minimum wage, refusing to \nextend unemployment benefits, are not working. Trickle-down economics \nsimply, again, is not working.\n  You don't have to be from Iowa or Nebraska to know you don't \nfertilize a tree from the top down. You fertilize the roots, and that \nis how we need to stimulate the American economy, by applying stimulus \nto the roots, not to the treetops.\n  There are obvious ways to do this. No. 1, instead of the tax cuts for \nthe wealthy, you focus tax cuts on working people who need the money \nand who will actually spend the extra money here in America.\n  No. 2, you increase the minimum wage. You put more money in the \npockets of people who will spend the money because they have to, out of \nnecessity.\n  No. 3, you extend benefits for the long-term unemployed. Today, March \n31, a record 1.1 million Americans will lose their unemployment \nbenefits--this quarter. This is unfair. It is indecent. It is foolish, \nbecause it will create more drag on the economy. Again, we ought to be \nashamed of ourselves for not extending the unemployment benefits to all \nthese people who have now lost them.\n\n  I strongly support the Boxer amendment as one step we need to take in \naddressing the fact we have too many people out of work, and that \npeople on the bottom of the economic ladder are falling further and \nfurther behind.\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\n  No one in America who works for a living should live in poverty. Yet \nfor the millions of hard-working Americans with minimum wage jobs, that \nis exactly what is happening. In fact, if you look at what has happened \nover the last few years, you can see if this is the poverty line right \nhere for a family of three, going back here to 1971, 1974, 1977, the \nminimum wage was pretty darned close to the poverty line. Then during \nthe Reagan years it started coming down. During the Clinton years it \nwent up a little bit. Now we are back down again. Look at this gap \ncompared to where we were before, or even before 1970 when the minimum \nwage was actually above the poverty line. When you look at that, it is \nno wonder our society has problems. No wonder we are being torn apart \nin this country. We have more people working, yet falling further below \nthe poverty line because we don't increase the minimum wage.\n  The other side filed a cloture motion, I understand. I asked the \nPresiding Officer. He said a cloture motion has been filed on this \namendment. This bill we have before us is TANF, the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families. The other side has filed a cloture \nmotion, saying an increase in the minimum wage is not germane, it is \nnot pertinent to the TANF bill, to Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies. They are saying it is not pertinent because if the cloture \nmotion is successful tomorrow, this amendment will fall. So they say it \nis not pertinent.\n  Why don't they tell that to Secretary Thompson? Here is what he said \nregarding TANF reauthorization:\n\n       This administration recognizes that the only way to escape \n     poverty is through work and that is why we have made work and \n     jobs that will pay at least the minimum wage the centerpiece \n     of the reauthorization proposal for the Temporary Assistance \n     for Needy Families Program.\n\n  It is the centerpiece. And they say it is not pertinent. Somebody \nbetter get hold of Mr. Thompson. You better start getting your story \nstraight. He says it is the centerpiece.\n  If minimum wage is the centerpiece for TANF reauthorization, then we \nought to be about discussing how much of a minimum wage--not whether it \nis pertinent but how much.\n  Bear in mind again, I heard some talk about teenagers. I keep hearing \nabout teenagers making minimum wage. They are living at home, they have \nthis and that. Teenagers, teenagers, teenagers, I hear that all the \ntime. But you have to look at the facts. Facts are stubborn. Sometimes \nfacts get in the way of stories. The fact is, 7 million workers would \ndirectly benefit from a minimum wage increase; 35 percent are the sole \nearners in their families--35 percent. Maybe some of them are \nteenagers. Maybe they are married and out of school, maybe they are 18, \n19 years old. Mr. President, 61 percent of those affected are women and \none-third of them are raising children; 15 percent are African American \nand 19 percent are Hispanic Americans.\n  What is this all about teenagers? This is not about teenagers. This \nis about Americans who go to work every day. As I said, they do some of \nthe most humble work in America.\n  I think I heard my colleague from Iowa saying something about if you \nraise the minimum wage, it is bad for business because people will shop \nelsewhere because they will raise the price of goods and people still \nhave choices. We are not putting the minimum wage on one company and \nnot another, one employer and not another. This is across the board. So \nif all of them go up, then there is still competition out there. Maybe \nthrough the competitive urges of the free marketplace they will find \nother places to cut costs, be more productive. But don't take it out of \nthe hides of those who work for a minimum wage.\n  That is what we are basically saying. That is what Congress is \nsaying. That is what this President is saying, when we don't increase \nthe minimum wage. They are saying to businesses all over America: If \nyou want to cut costs, if you want to increase your profit margins, we \nwill help you by keeping your minimum wage as low as possible.\n  If we raise the minimum wage, maybe businesses will find some other \nways of cutting costs and being more productive.\n  I also heard that if you increase the minimum wage to $7 an hour, it \nis a drain on business. It doesn't help the family that much. There \nwould be more help with food stamps, for example. An increase to $7 an \nhour for full-time, year-round workers would add about $3,800 to their \nincome.\n  Maybe for Senators and Congressmen who make $150,000 a year--I assume \nmost of us have stocks and different investments--when you look at the \nnet worth of the Members of the House and the Senate, what is it? Is it \n500 times more than the average American? Maybe $3,800 doesn't seem \nlike a lot to people here, but to a family on minimum wage, for a low-\nincome family, $3,800 would be more than a year of groceries. It would \npay 9 months of rent, a year and a half of heat or electricity, or full \ntuition at a community college for one of the kids. That is nothing to \nscoff at.\n  People say, Well, it will impact business. Again, facts are stubborn \nthings. History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has never \nhad an impact on jobs, employment, or inflation. In the 4 years after \nthe last minimum wage increase passed, the economy experienced the \nstrongest growth in over three decades. Nearly 11 million new jobs were \nadded at a pace of 218,000 per month. There were 6 million new service \nindustry jobs, including more than 112 million retail jobs of which \nnearly 600,000 were restaurant jobs.\n  This was after we raised the minimum wage last time. It sure made a \nbad impact on this country, didn't it?\n  It is long overdue. We should be ashamed of ourselves for letting it \nfall so low.\n  Now we are being told we can't have a vote on the TANF bill because \nit is not germane. That is exactly what Secretary Thompson said.\n\n       Work and jobs that will pay at least a minimum wage is the \n     centerpiece to the reauthorization proposal of TANF.\n\n  Those are Secretary Thompson's words.\n  We also have to keep in mind that a great majority--61 percent, as I \nhave pointed out--who would be affected are single parents, mostly \nwomen with children. Unfortunately, the kind of jobs that women who \nleave welfare find are minimum wage jobs, which makes it difficult, if \nnot impossible, to sustain families and meet the demands of raising \nchildren. For these people, survival is a daily goal. They work hard \nenough. Their hours are long enough to make ends meet, but only barely.\n  What this means is they don't have time for their families. They \ncannot participate in activities with their children, especially \nschool-related activities that most of us take for granted.\n  I would like to do a survey in the Senate of everyone here. I wonder \nhow many Senators know someone or a family living on the minimum wage. \nI wonder how many Senators would actually have some friends who are \nfamilies on the minimum wage. I bet you would not find very many who \nwould actually know anyone. They read about them, but I mean actually \nknow them or maybe have them as neighbors or friends and meet with them \nand talk with them about how they are living on a minimum wage. That \nwould be an interesting survey to take.\n  For these people, as I said, survival is their daily goal.\n\n  Bear in mind the real value of the minimum wage has fallen \ndramatically over the past 30 years. Here is the real value of the \nminimum wage shown earlier by Senators Kennedy and Boxer. We have to \nkeep showing them because these facts are stubborn things. People are \nworking the same.\n  Back in 1968, in real 2003 dollars, the minimum wage was $8.50.\n  In other words, if we had indexed to inflation the minimum wage in \n1968, it would be $8.50 an hour. That is just indexed for inflation. \nBut if you look at where people were back in 1968, look where we are \nnow. The people who were working back in 1968 at minimum wage jobs are \nthe same people, the same kind of people, the same class of people who \nare working today. They are doing the same kind of jobs. Why was that \njob worth $8.50 in 1968, but that same job today is only worth $4.98 an \nhour?\n  You might say the minimum wage is $5.15. But if we don't increase it \nby the end of this year, the real value of that will be $4.98 an hour.\n  Why? It is the same job, the same work. Why was it worth $8.50 an \nhour then, and it is only worth $4.98 an hour now? It is because we \nhaven't done our job about keeping up the minimum wage. We keep pushing \npeople down.\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\n  That is why there is unrest in America. That is why low-wage people \nare saying there is nothing in the system for them because it is so \nskewed against them. They work hard and never can get ahead because the \nminimum wage is stuck.\n  The minimum wage employee working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, \nearns $10,700 a year. That is $5,000 a year below the poverty line for \na family of three.\n  Again, here is the poverty line. The red line is for a family of \nthree. Here is where we were in the past. Before 1970, the minimum wage \nwas above the poverty line. Now look at the gap. Look how far down it \nis.\n  Poll after poll after poll taken of low-income Americans show that \nthey don't believe the system is fair. You can read the polls. Look at \nwhat happened to them. You add on to that they don't have health \ninsurance. You add on to that they do not have any retirement benefits. \nYou add on to that their pay goes for high heating bills this last \nwinter. You add on to that many of these people earning the minimum \nwage are paying one-third to one-half of their paychecks just for rent.\n  How many of us pay one-half of our paycheck for rent?\n  As I said earlier, the minimum wage--I stand corrected. It is not a \npoverty wage; it is less than a subsistence wage. And we can't ignore \nit any longer.\n  Three million more Americans are in poverty today than when President \nBush first took office.\n  I am not saying that to blame it all on the President. I am not going \nto say that. Of course not. I am just saying it is a fact.\n  Today, more than 34 million people live in poverty including 12 \nmillion children.\n  I am not blaming it on the President, or anybody else. I am just \nstating a fact.\n  Among full-time, year-round workers, poverty has doubled since the \nlate 1970s--from about 1.3 million to 2.6 million in 2002. Poverty has \ndoubled since the late 1970s.\n  There is a lot of blame to go around. Rather than blaming anybody, \nlet's fix it. The best way to fix it is to raise the minimum wage. That \nis at the heart of this problem.\n  An increase to $7 an hour would affect nearly 7 million workers.\n  I just saw the figures as to what it would mean in Iowa. I have the \nfigures here as to an increase in the minimum wage in Iowa. If we were \nto increase this minimum wage, there would be 104,000 workers in my \nState of Iowa who would be making more money--104,000 workers. Do you \nknow what? They will spend that money. They will spend that money \nbecause they have to spend it, because their rent is high, their \nheating bills are high; if they have any health insurance at all, that \nis skyrocketing. They are paying for food, paying for the kids. That \nmoney gets spun around in the economy. It would be a shock of stimulus \nfor the economy.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the amendment. To say it again, at the heart \nof this problem is the fact we are just not paying people for the work \nthey do. Why is it people who do the dirtiest kind of work, the \nhumblest kind of work--the kind of people you walk by, and you never \nnotice them; you go into a restaurant, you go in to eat, and then walk \nout, and you do not notice them; a lot of times you go into stores, \nthey are there, but you kind of walk by them--well, it is time we \nnoticed them. They deserve to be noticed. They are Americans, and they \nare working hard. They are trying to raise their families and do the \nright thing, and what do we say to them? Forget it.\n  I almost hear echoes from some of the comments I have heard on this \nfloor. I have heard echoes there should not even be a minimum wage. \nNow, I did not hear anybody say that. I said I sort of heard echoes of \nthat: Well, if we set the minimum wage at $7, why can't we set it at \n$70 an hour or $700 an hour or $7,000 an hour or something like that? \nWell, that is sort of scoffing at these poor people who are working \nbecause it is almost like saying maybe we should not have a minimum \nwage at all.\n  There are a lot of countries that do not have the minimum wage. I \nsuppose we could be like them. I always tell people: When it comes to \nthings like having a minimum wage, just keep in mind, there is always \nsomeone poorer than you, more desperate than you, lower down on the \nladder than you, who will work for less than you are going to work for \nbecause they need it. There is always someone poorer, more needy, more \ndesperate.\n  Is that what our society says: The law of the jungle? Turn the clock \nbackward and just have a welfare system? As Senator Kennedy said, \nrather than taxing the American people to provide food stamps and \nwelfare benefits and things like that, it is better to raise the \nminimum wage and give them a decent living wage rather than putting \nthem on welfare. That is bad for the people on welfare.\n  I supported welfare to work. I believe in it. But in order to move \npeople from welfare to work, they need some health care benefits; they \nneed some childcare. Fortunately, we passed the Snowe amendment. We \nneed an increase in the minimum wage, and they need housing. But \nkeeping them at this less-than-subsistence wage will not do it.\n  I have almost heard some echoes, also, that this is some kind of a \npartisan issue. I went back to look at this issue. Senator Kennedy \npointed this out, and I have a chart to point it out again. I think it \nis very instructive. Since Franklin Roosevelt, when we got our first \nminimum wage in 1938, almost every President has raised the minimum \nwage, including Eisenhower, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. \nBush. Interestingly, Reagan and this President Bush are both missing. \nBut it has been bipartisan in the past. We have had Republican \nPresidents who have raised the minimum wage, as well as Democratic \nPresidents. So I do not think it is a partisan issue at all. It is an \neconomic issue. And it is how you view the value of work.\n\n  Now if you believe people ought to go out there and work for whatever \nan employer wants to pay you, and if you don't like it, you can go \nsomewhere else and try to get something better. We have tried that \nbefore in our country. We see that happening in other Third World \ncountries because there is always some poor sucker worse off than you \nwho will work for less than you will.\n  I really do not think that is the kind of country we want to become. \nWork should have honor and dignity, and the minimum wage today is not \ngiving dignity to the work these people do.\n  I will close. I see the Senator from Idaho wants to speak. I will \nwrap up in a second.\n  We are talking about Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. The bill \non the floor is food assistance.\n  Listen to this. A 2003 survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors--these \nare not Democrats--looked at the hunger issue, and here is what they \nfound: 39 percent of the adults requesting food assistance were \nemployed. Thirty-nine percent seeking food assistance were employed. \nThis is from the Conference of Mayors.\n  They found a leading cause of hunger was low-paying jobs. The \nConference of Mayors found emergency food assistance increased by an \naverage of 14 percent. Fifty-nine percent of those requesting emergency \nfood assistance were members of families--children and their parents. \nFifty-nine percent of those who sought emergency food assistance--which \nmeans they were at wits end; they had no money, and they had no other \nplace to go, so they requested emergency food assistance--59 percent \nwere members of families--children and their parents.\n  What did the mayors recommend? What did the Conference of Mayors \nrecommend? They recommended raising the Federal minimum wage as a way \nthe Federal Government could help alleviate hunger. We are being told \nwe cannot do that; we cannot add it to this bill; we cannot even vote \non it.\n  We saw the same thing on overtime: No, we can't vote on that. Put it \nsomeplace else. No, we can't vote on minimum wage either.\n  What is the Senate coming to? Why don't we do as the House of \nRepresentatives did, where we used to serve--have a rule where you \ncan't do anything, just pass it. That is why the Senate is different \nthan the House. That is why we are supposed to have open and free-form \ndebate and be able to vote on these issues. But these parliamentary \ntactics keeping us from\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\nvoting on things such as overtime, extending unemployment benefits, and \nnow the minimum wage are unworthy of the Senate, unworthy of this \ncountry, unworthy of our jobs.\n  I close by saying again, this is an issue that cuts very deeply. I \nremember I was in my home State in the last year, and I found an \ninteresting thing, that more people were relying upon the food banks in \nIowa. I thought to myself: Why is that happening? Our unemployment is \nnot that high. It went up a little bit, but why were more people going \nto food banks in increasing numbers than the unemployment rate was \nrising?\n  I found out these are low-income workers. They are minimum-wage \nworkers. They get food stamps. But because we have cut back on food \nstamps, their food stamps run out about the 20th of the month, and they \nhave to go to the food banks for the rest of the month. I have to \nbelieve if it is happening in Iowa, it is happening all over the \ncountry.\n  It is time to give dignity to the people who do the humblest work in \nour country. Let's get them back up to what they had in the past. If \ntheir job in the past was worth what today would be $8.50 an hour, it \nis at least worth $7 an hour now.\n  What if we took corporate CEO salaries from 1968 and said they have \nto now have the same percentage reduction this year as those on minimum \nwage? Boy, the hue and cry that would go up on that one.\n  I have made my point. I hope we defeat the cloture petition. I hope \nwe have a vote on increasing the minimum wage, and I hope it passes \noverwhelmingly. I hope the President will be on board and support it so \nwe can give dignity to our workers.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho for his patience and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have listened most seriously to the \nSenator from Iowa on the issue of the minimum wage. My guess is, before \nthe legislative year is out, we are going to vote on this issue. I \nbelieve it is important the Congress express its will. Certainly the \nminimum wage is a part of the total economic makeup of our country, and \nwe need to be concerned about it. When we are talking about welfare \nreform, we know good-paying jobs are a part of getting people off \nwelfare.\n  We also know creating an economic climate in which jobs can grow is \nanother way of making sure we have good-paying jobs, be they minimum \nwage or slightly or substantially above. It is the whole of the economy \nthat makes our country what it is. It provides for the middle class and \nthe upper class and all of those others who have been the tremendous \nenergy and engine of this economy for so long.\n  The day before yesterday and yesterday, I came to the Chamber to \nspeak about the ever increasing price of energy. Today if the Senator \nfrom Iowa or the Senator from Idaho gassed their car up in this city or \nin Idaho or in Des Moines, we would have paid the highest price for gas \never paid in our history. Does that have impact on poor people or \npoorer people? You bet it does. They spend more of the total percentage \nof their income for energy than does someone who makes more money, who \nis in the upper class of society.\n  When we talk about the minimum wage and welfare reform and the \neconomy, should we not be concerned about the price of energy as it \nrelates to that minimum wage employee who drives to work and drives \nhome and spends a higher percentage of the amount of money they get \nfrom the minimum wage on energy than any other segment of the economy? \nWe ought to.\n\n  This Senate has denied us the right to speak to that. Now the other \nside is suggesting that again we have to go through multiples of \namendments if we bring up an energy bill, even though we debated it a \nyear ago and even though we debated it the year before that, and even \nthough we passed it out of the Senate twice and we have had ample time. \nAnd tens of plus amendments later, we have to go through that again, \nwhen this country is hurting more on energy and energy costs than it \never has.\n  I think the American people expect more of us than just an endless \ndebating society that never produces anything. What have I heard in the \nChamber, as I have been speaking about energy the last several days? It \nis big oil's fault or it is the President's fault. It is somebody other \nthan the Congress.\n  Let me suggest to my fellow Senators: No, it is not the President's \nfault and, no, it is not big oil's fault. It is the Senate's fault for \ndenying the American people a modernized, contemporary energy policy.\n  The House passed a policy. The House passed the conference. But not \nthe Senate. No, the Senate couldn't get there because too many of us \nhad too many different ideas. We are here now sitting as Senators while \nthe American consumer is spending more today for gas at the pump or gas \nthat goes to the home for heating than ever in our history.\n  Shame on us. Shame on us for denying a contemporary, modern energy \npolicy. We have not touched energy policy in our country for the last \n14 years. As a result of that, our policy is obsolete. It doesn't fit \nmodern America.\n  As I said yesterday and the day before: Consumption overall as a part \nof per capita has gone down, whether it be with the individual consumer \nor whether it be with corporate America or business and industry. But \ngrowth in our country has gone up. Yet we have largely denied our \ncountry a progressive supply-related energy policy. In other words, we \nhave simply ignored the reality of the marketplace of supply and \ndemand.\n  We have had all these cute ideas over the last several years about \nhow we can conserve our way out of this one or we can deny the consumer \nthe right to have more energy in one form or another and that will \nsolve the problem. It didn't solve the problem.\n  During the decade of the 1990s, with unprecedented economic growth in \nour country, we used up all of the surpluses that had been built into \nthe system. Whether it be gas supply for space heating, gas supply at \nthe pump, whether it was commercial, we used it all up. At the end of \nthe decade, we were beginning to experience blackouts in California. We \nwere beginning to experience shortages. But most importantly, that \nsupply/demand equation had begun to work and prices were edging up very \nrapidly.\n  Here we are, with a 14-year-old policy, and we haven't recognized the \nrest of the world has also grown. One of the great growth giants today \nin the world is China. China's crude oil imports grew 30 percent last \nyear, from the same supplier that is supplying 60 percent of our crude \noil, the crude oil markets of the world.\n  What is happening out there is this very rapid acceleration. We all \nwant the economy to come back. We want our economy to come back. We \nwant the world economy to come back so it can buy our goods and \nservices. And as that economy comes back along with ours, they will \ndemand more energy.\n\n  We know the facts for high gas prices. The price of crude oil \nyesterday was $36.25 a barrel. That is why we have high gas prices. \nInventory stocks are down. Fragmented gas markets are different today, \nand the introduction of new fuels is phenomenal. We know those are the \nrealities of what we are doing and what we are dealing with. I don't \nknow that you can deny it in any other way, unless you want to play raw \npolitics.\n  We also know what the situation is in our country today. We import 62 \npercent of our crude. So the same people supplying that phenomenal \ngrowth in China are also supplying us with our crude. Our refineries \nare now operating at record high rates. Gas production is running at \nrecord levels all over the country. Throughout the year, demand \ncontinues to be strong, as we try to get the economy going again. It is \ngoing, and it is growing. That is part of the reason for these record \nprices.\n  Let's talk a little bit about big oil. Let's talk about the collusion \nsome suggest might be out there. The attorney general of the State of \nCalifornia did exactly what you would expect. We better go out and \ninvestigate big oil again because gas prices are over $2.30 in \nCalifornia. Investigate, if you will, but I offer the following for the \nrecord; that is, the reality of all of the investigations we have had. \nWe have had 29 State and Federal investigations over the last several \ndecades. Most recently, the U.S. Department of Energy looked at it and \nsaid: Demand exceeds supply.\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\nWhat happens when demand exceeds supply? The price goes up.\n  California Energy Commission--I guess the attorney general out in \nCalifornia ought to listen to the energy commission. What drove \nincreases were unusually high costs for crude in a world market. Is \nthat collusion, or is that supply and demand?\n  California, listen up. There is your problem. It is called not enough \nsupply to meet demand of the drivers of California today.\n  Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection--while numerous factors \ncontributed to sharp increases in gasoline prices this summer, \nwholesalers and retailers were not hiking prices to pad their profits.\n  Again, a marvelous thing is happening out there. The marketplace, \nsupply and demand.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list, starting in \nMay of 1973 and going through this past year of 2003, of literally \nalmost 30 different investigations, State and Federal, as it relates to \nbig oil. Every one of them found there was no collusion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS OF OIL INDUSTRY PRICING\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               Investigating\n    Date of investigation           body          Description of probe\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMay 1973....................

They have got to be making huge amounts \nof money today at $2.35 a gallon in California, or $1.80 in my State.\n  Look at last year on this chart. This is from BusinessWeek magazine. \nLet's talk about the most profitable businesses in the economic sector \nof the United States. It is not profitable to own an oil company. You \nought to own a bank. You ought to own diversified finances, real \nestate, semiconductor equipment, pharmaceuticals, and biotech. That is \nwhere the returns are, 19 percent, 17, 16, 14, and 12 percent. Let's go \nfind big oil. Where is big oil? Well, let's see. Big oil is all the way \ndown at the bottom in the utility area. I believe it is something like \na return on investment of 1.4 percent. Oh, my goodness. Is that \nprofiteering? I don't think it is profiteering. I think it is called \nreturn on investment versus competition versus price of input product. \nAnd the price of crude oil is $36. That is the reality of what we are \ndealing with.\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\n  Here is a problem out in California. Let's go to the next chart \nbecause California worries me. I am glad I don't live there at the \nmoment. I am glad I am not paying $2.35 or $2.40 a gallon. I am sorry \nthat Californians are. This is a very interesting chart. It deals with \nwhat we call U.S. gasoline requirements under the Clean Air Act. We \nknow we have air problems in heavily congested areas where air is \nstagnant, and it doesn't move as rapidly as in some other areas. That \nis certainly true in the State of California.\n  Every one of these different colors on this map represents a \nrequirement for the refining industry to produce a unique kind of \nproduct. We see in the State of California one, two, three--possibly \nfour types of what we call boutique fuels, or certain blends of fuel. \nEvery refinery has to shut down and readjust before they can produce \nthat kind of fuel, and that kind of fuel costs more money than a \nstandardized kind of fuel. As a result, it does drive prices up, and we \nknow that to be a reality.\n  That is part of the problem we face when we look at our clean air \nstandards in the Clean Air Act. I am not arguing we should not have the \nClean Air Act, but there are times when reasonable flexibility ought to \nbe offered when consumers are paying unprecedented prices, or maybe we \nought to be concerned about refinery capability and capacity. We have \nlost numerous oil refineries in the continental United States over the \nlast good number of years. Many of our companies today are saying it is \nbetter that we--here is that bad old word--outsource if we want to keep \nprices low in this country because Federal regulations and certain \nState standards are costing us a great deal of money.\n  In the area of gasoline, to understand the reason it is $1.80 in \nIdaho and $2.35 in California, look at the map. There is part of the \nreason. It is not all of the reason, but a substantial part of the \nreason that we are dealing with energy in a way that is very \nfrustrating. Here is the most frustrating thing to do, along with not \nbeing able to pass an Energy bill. When we talk about the economy and \njobs and job creation--this is the investor thinking at this moment--\nthe average investor who puts money in the business that creates jobs--\nhere is investor attitude this month. In fact, it comes from a headline \nin a Gallup poll survey. It says: ``Overall investors' optimism \ndeclines for the second month in a row in March.'' The No. 1 reason \nfor the decline in investor attitude was the price of energy because an \ninvestor looking at a company knows that company is going to have to \npay for energy as a part of the output of that company, and it is going \nup dramatically. Sixty-four percent said high energy costs are hurting \nthe economy a lot.\n\n  If you listen to the rhetoric on the floor of the Senate for the last \nseveral days, you would not have gained one inkling of that. Nobody has \ntalked about passing an Energy bill and developing a national energy \npolicy that gets us back into production. Yes, there is a Senator over \nthere from Nebraska who agrees with me. We are talking about things \nthat make for good political ads but darn bad economy, at this moment. \nI don't blame the American consumer, and now the American investor who \ndrives the economy of our country, for saying high energy costs are \ngoing to hurt us and are hurting a lot.\n  I mentioned on the floor of the Senate yesterday that I talked with a \nbanker in Idaho who does a lot of operating lines for farmers--not big \nfarmers but medium-size and small farmers. He called all of his branch \nbank managers and said: See if that farmer can afford a 20- to 30-\npercent cost in doing business this year because that is where the \nenergy costs are going to take them on the fertilizer and hydrous \nammonia, a direct result of gas gone up almost 100 percent--how can we \nkeep an abundant, safe, high-quality food supply if we are going to \ncause farmers to produce less because they cannot afford to produce \nmore?\n  Now, all of our chemical companies are headed offshore to cheaper \ngasoline because we are too busy locking up the public lands of the \nWest and denying exploration, all in the name of the environment. We \nare now talking about raising the minimum wage, and we cannot even \ncreate jobs in other wage categories because we will not allow the \ninvestment. One of the great competitive characteristics of our country \nis the tremendous ingenuity and initiative of the American workforce \nand low energy costs. Historically, our great wealth was driven by low \nenergy costs. Now, we are no longer in that category. We are competing \nin a much tighter world market because somehow in the decades of the \n1980s and 1990s, we forgot you had to produce it before you could use \nit. As a result, now we are 60-percent dependent upon foreign oil--60-\npercent dependent upon someone other than an American for determining \nthe price of gasoline at the pump. Well, shame on us. It is a very real \nworld we live in, and that is the consequence we are dealing with.\n  So why are we not debating an Energy bill on the floor of the Senate? \nOur President, when he came to office, while he was still President-\nelect, said the No. 1 priority in this country was to develop a \nnational energy policy. He acted quickly, put a team together under the \nVice President. They recommended a variety of ideas to us in their \npolicy. That was 3 years ago, or more, and we are still sitting around \ndebating it and saying we cannot get there. Now the American consumer \nis paying at the highest price ever.\n  Doesn't the Senate get it? I don't think so. I think the politics of \nenergy is so sweet that somehow we deny the reality at hand. I think it \nis time to cease denying that reality. Here are the facts. The \ninvestment community is saying: Wait a minute, energy prices are high \nand getting higher, and they are hurting the economy. It is time that \nwe do something about it.\n  Here is the only thing I can do about it, and I am willing to help my \nfellow Senators. Go to my Web site, if you would, craig.senate.gov. \nThere are all the facts and statistics on energy. Anybody listening can \ngo there, too, and they can see who voted for it and against it and \ntheir phone numbers. I don't think Senators ought to call Senators. \nThey ought to talk to them on the floor and say that is the thing to \ndo. There are Senators in this body who deserve a phone call and \ndeserve to be asked why they voted against the conference report on \nenergy, why they are denying the American consumer--the minimum wage \nperson, along with the millionaire--a reasonable energy policy for this \ncountry, which sustains our economy and creates jobs, and that allows \nus that competitive force we have always had in the world market. We \nwere not allowing it. The Senate is not allowing it.\n  There is a sole reason today why this country does not have a modern \nenergy policy that involves production, that involves conservation, \nthat involves new technologies, that involves new resources. The reason \nis the Senate is denying that. They have denied it now for 2 years, and \nit is time we ante up, we get honest with ourselves and have a vote.\n  Go to my Web site if you want, I say to my fellow Senators. There it \nis: Craig.senate.gov. All the facts and figures are there. The voting \nrecords are there. It is time we get honest with ourselves. It is time \nwe drop the price at the pump instead of breaking the piggy bank from \nwhich we all live.\n  That is my priority, and I think as American consumers pay the bill, \nit will become their priority. I wish it was the Senate's priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I agree with much of what my \ncolleague from Idaho said with respect to passing the Energy bill. I \nthink it is important we find ways to become far more energy \nindependent, rather than dependent, on foreign sources of oil. In \naddition to looking for ways to become self-sustaining in our energy \nneeds, we need to look to the Western Hemisphere for a Western \nHemisphere energy policy to bring together the countries in this \nhemisphere to work jointly for our energy needs. I will have more on \nthis in the future. I commend my colleague for his comments about the \nimportance of getting an Energy bill. We need to look at renewable \nsources of energy.\n  I know my colleague from Iowa will agree that soy diesel and ethanol \nwould be just a few of the kinds of things we could do as an \nalternative energy policy, and they are all included in the Energy bill \nthe Senate has passed on a\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\ncouple of occasions and hopefully the White House will work with the \nHouse of Representatives to fashion their version of a bill that will \nmesh with ours so we can ultimately pass in the very near future an \nEnergy bill for the United States so 60 percent reliance on foreign \nsources can be reduced as dramatically as we possibly can do it, as \nquickly as possible as well, so we can become self-sustaining with our \nenergy needs.\n  I wish to also talk today about the effort that has been undertaken \nsince at least 1996 by Congress and the previous administration, and \nthat is the fundamental reform of the welfare system. This system, \nwhile seeking to prevent hardship among those hurt by economic \ndeprivation by providing a safety net, had unfortunately become a \nspider web. Too many families were caught in the cycle of poverty, and \nthe system that was supposed to help them became instead complicit in \nmaintaining the cycle.\n\n  Chief among those reforms was providing more flexibility to States. \nAs a Governor at the time, I saw firsthand the results of giving those \nclosest to the unique challenges of the system, the States, the ability \nto implement changes to the welfare system.\n  In Nebraska, we instituted a program called Employment First. This \nwas a fundamental change to the way welfare worked. No longer would a \nperson automatically be entitled to benefits if able-bodied. He or she \nhad to sign a contract which laid out a plan for becoming self-\nsufficient. The maximum period of being eligible for benefits was 2 \nyears barring extraordinary circumstances. Yet Employment First also \nrecognized some persons, especially single women with children, needed \nadditional help with family matters such as childcare and \ntransportation.\n  We provided transitional aid for these challenges, even after they \nfound employment; if you will, a bridge from welfare to work, a bridge \nthat was put in place to help people become self-sufficient in the \nprocess of finding employment and leaving welfare.\n  Public officials were encouraged to consider a new view of the \nmeasurement of assistance. Instead of focusing on how many were added \nto the rolls, they looked at how many entered employment. That change \nin vision produced dramatic results. The total Nebraska caseload \ndropped 11 percent by 1998, the lowest number in 18 years. Average \nmonthly caseloads fell 30 percent from 1993 levels. A family's time on \nassistance had been cut almost two-thirds to 11 months from the time \nunder the old system, and Nebraska taxpayers saved $14 million moving \nfamilies from dependence to independence, from welfare to work.\n  This is important to note. Nebraska saved $14 million under the new \nsystem. It is important because States, including Nebraska, are now \nfacing serious budget shortages. In fact, today's Lincoln Journal Star \nreports Nebraska leaders had to borrow from the State's cash reserve \nfund to make payroll and pay its bills this week. In fact, $58.2 \nmillion, which is the exact amount Nebraska received in additional \nFederal funds this year, was borrowed from the reserve to fund schools \nand other programs throughout the State.\n  The Federal funds stored in the State's reserve have helped States \nduring this recession period. Those funds came from a State fiscal \nrelief measure sponsored by my colleagues Senator Susan Collins of \nMaine, Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, Senator Gordon Smith \nof Oregon, and myself. This is exactly what that State fiscal relief \neffort intended: to provide fiscal assistance to help States, such as \nNebraska, that are facing chronic budget shortfalls and help them meet \ntheir obligations.\n  It is important to remember this welfare reform bill will also help \nStates continue to meet those obligations. For example, the State of \nNebraska sharply cut back eligibility for childcare assistance from 185 \npercent of poverty to 120 percent of poverty. As a result, about 1,600 \nNebraska children lost childcare assistance from the State.\n  Yesterday the Senate adopted an amendment to add $6 billion for \nchildcare services to this bill. Under that amendment, Nebraska would \nreceive $40.8 million of that money to help the State provide for \nNebraska's children. I am proud to say I was one of those in the \nmajority who voted for that amendment.\n\n  With flexibility, the States can tailor their programs to meet their \nspecific needs and save money in the process. A large part of our \nsuccess in Nebraska in the 1990s was due to the new flexibility allowed \nunder the 1996 law. We now want to expand that flexibility so more \nStates can craft their own unique methods to succeed.\n  Yet Employment First also recognized some persons, especially single \nwomen with children, needed additional help with family matters, such \nas childcare and transportation, and with the Federal funds that were \nprovided were able to do that.\n  Today I wish to talk briefly about the Alexander-Nelson-Carper-\nVoinovich amendment or, if I am talking to Nebraskans, the Nelson-\nAlexander-Carper-Voinovich amendment that would provide that \nflexibility to the States.\n  Our amendment would create the accountability for a results \ndemonstration project to provide greater flexibility to up to 10 years. \nBut we wouldn't just provide flexibility, we would demand results and \naccountability. States participating in the project would be required \nto ensure all adult TANF recipients have a self-sufficiency plan, much \nlike Nebraska.\n  As I said, we have put this to work in Nebraska. It has made a \ntremendous difference in how recipients look at their own lives. It \nhelps them map out their own paths to success and assures they will \nhave the institutional assistance they need to follow it.\n  Our amendment would also include targets for increasing the State's \nperformance, not just increasing employment and job retention, but in \ntracking entry earnings and earnings gains and, most importantly, child \nwell-being. This is vital because reducing the welfare rolls will mean \nlittle if it comes at the expense of children. The amendment would \ninstitute penalties for States that fail to meet their agreed-upon \ntargets because it means little if it is not accompanied by results.\n  This proposal will expand upon existing reform measures and will help \nstrengthen States' abilities to assist those most in need while giving \nthem the tools they need to succeed. It is worth pointing out this \namendment is sponsored by four former Governors.\n  We understand the role of the States in making welfare reform a \nsuccess because we have all been there. States can do more. They want \nto do more. This amendment will help them meet the unique needs of \ntheir citizens by tailoring their programs to address the needs of \nrecipients in their States.\n  I recall the times when it was necessary to come to Washington to get \nthe approval of Health and Human Services to take a unique approach. \nThis was time consuming, expensive, and delayed the process. What we \nwant to do is give the Governors the opportunity, through their \nlegislatures, to address the needs of recipients in their own \nrespective States, under the theory of the States as the laboratories \nof democracy as envisioned by Thomas Jefferson. We want to give them \nthe opportunity to make those changes and meet the needs of their \nrespective citizens.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Alexander, who has arrived on the \nfloor, Senator Carper, and Senator Voinovich for their hard work on \nbehalf of welfare recipients and their efforts on this amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment and help the States help \ntheir residents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I simply wanted to congratulate the \nSenator from Nebraska on his comments. He and I served as Governors, as \nhe said. We may not have gotten over that entirely as we look at \nlegislation. We strongly support the revolutionary change in American \nlife the welfare reform bill has brought since 1996. Half of those on \nthe welfare rolls are off. The hardest cases remain.\n  What we are attempting to do with this amendment is to suggest that \nwe want to try, with up to 10 States, to give the Secretary some \nflexibility in finding the best way to help people get from dependence \nto independence. If State plans using a combination of work and removal \nof barriers to work\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nand a variety of other factors can do that according to measurable \nresults, then that will give us some successes now and information we \ncan use when we consider this bill in the future.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Nebraska on his leadership and look \nforward to working with him on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to very briefly speak about some \nof the issues my colleague from Idaho raised related to the high price \nof gasoline at the pump. I am afraid the impression was created by my \ncolleague that if the Senate were just to go ahead and pass the energy \nbill that is now on the Senate calendar, that would solve the problem \nof high gas prices for the American consumer. I think we need to dispel \nthat notion if that was the impression that some people had.\n  The truth is, there are three big issues I heard referred to. One is \nclearly production of oil is not what it needs to be relative to demand \ntoday to bring prices down, and the world market is indicating that. We \nreceived the very unfortunate news this morning that OPEC had decided \nto go ahead with the cut in production they had earlier talked about. \nThat is unfortunate. Some of the media has speculated that would result \nin $40 per barrel of oil in the reasonably near future. If that is the \ncase, then we will see very high prices for gasoline in this summer \ndriving season.\n  In a letter I sent to the President last week on March 24, I had \nurged the administration to do all it could to dissuade the OPEC \nnations from going ahead with that proposed cut in production. I do not \nknow what actions the administration took. Clearly, if they did take \nactions they were not effective, and accordingly the amount of oil \nbeing produced by OPEC nations will decrease and that will add to the \nproblem of high prices of gasoline at the pump.\n  A second item mentioned by my colleague from Idaho was that there is \ninadequate refining capacity. That is clearly true. I recognize that. \nIt is one of the items we deal with in this letter I sent to the \nPresident last week. In that letter, I have urged that the President \ntake the necessary steps to bring the parties together and to identify \nwhat the barriers are to the construction of additional refining \ncapacity in this country.\n  That is not something we are proposing to legislate in an energy \nbill. There is nothing in the energy bill that deals with expanding \nrefining capacity. I do not want anyone who has been watching this \ndebate to think by passing an energy bill the problem of refining \ncapacity will be solved.\n  The Presiding Officer asked the Energy Information Administration to \ndo a report as to the effect of the pending energy legislation on \nprices, production, and availability of fuel in the future, and \nessentially the conclusion was the effect of that legislation would be \nnegligible. Let's not give people the impression the problem of high \nprices at the pump is going to be solved by the Senate going ahead and \npassing a particular energy bill at this stage.\n  I would also point out what we all know, which is that we have passed \nan energy bill in this Senate in this Congress. We passed an energy \nbill in this Senate in the last Congress. So it is not that the Senate \nhas been unwilling to act on responsible energy legislation.\n  The third item I wanted to talk about is this whole issue of boutique \nfuels. My colleague from Idaho correctly pointed out that one of the \nproblems we have and one of the reasons why prices stay higher than \nthey should is there is not enough what is called product flexibility, \nthat we do not allow refiners to produce product which can be shipped \nto enough parts of the country. We have too many different types of \nboutique fuels and too many formulations for these boutique fuels \naround the country. There are estimated now to be 110 formulations of \nthese boutique fuels.\n\n  What I recommended to the President is what the Cheney energy task \nforce recommended nearly 3 years ago, and that is the Administrator of \nthe EPA be directed by the President to work, with technical assistance \nfrom the Secretary of Energy, to require revisions of State \nimplementation plans to reduce the overall number of fuel \nspecifications by at least a factor of 5, and preferably closer to a \nfactor of 10. This is not something that requires legislation. This did \nnot require legislation when the Cheney task force recommended it; it \ndoes not require legislation now.\n  In fact, when people go back and look at the Cheney task force \nrecommendations, there were 105 recommendations listed. They are all \ndetailed in the appendix to that report. By the administration's own \ncalculation, 76 of the 105 do not require legislative action; they are \nrecommendations for administrative action.\n  This recommendation to the Director of the EPA to deal with this \nboutique fuels problem is one of those actions that can be taken by the \nadministration without any action by this Congress. Again, it is one of \nthe items I included in the letter we sent to the President last week \nurging that they move ahead with this. As far as I am informed, there \nhas been no action taken on this since May of 2001, when the Cheney \ntask force report was released.\n  These are things that could be done. None of them, in and of itself, \nis going to dramatically affect the price of gasoline at the pump, but \ntogether they would help moderate the prices of gasoline as we move \ninto the summer driving season. For that reason, I think there are \nactions that should be taken. These are 3 of the 13 different \nrecommendations contained in the letter. None of those recommendations \nrequires legislation to be passed.\n  Clearly, there are provisions of law that I favor enacting and I \nthink we should try to enact before the end of this Congress, and I \nhope we are able to do so. To leave the impression that inaction in \ndealing with the price of gasoline is purely a failure of the Congress \nis just misleading.\n  For that reason, I urge everyone to review that letter I sent last \nweek. I hope we will have more debate in the coming days about those \nsteps that can be taken in the near term to deal with the very high \nprice of gasoline and to deal with the very high price of natural gas, \nwhich, of course, we are seeing in the utility and heating bills we all \nhave to pay.\n  I know my colleagues are waiting to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know we are here today to talk about \nTANF, the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program. That program \nis a safety net for the American public. I want to talk about another \nsafety net program--the safety net for American workers--that will \nprovide its last benefit today, March 31. Today is the last day any \nAmerican worker will receive benefits from the Temporary Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation program, which has been providing the last of \nthe Federal unemployment benefits to those who came onto the program \nbefore it expired on December 21. As of today, there are 1.1 million \npeople who have exhausted their State benefit without any Federal \nprogram to pick them up.\n  This is more than a dozen times that I have been to the floor to talk \nabout this program and the need to reinstate the Federal unemployment \nbenefits program. I think my colleagues clearly understand why I am \nhere. In fact, we have had a majority of my colleagues in the Senate \nand a majority of my colleagues in the House support a reinstatement of \nthis Federal program for unemployment benefits. The reason they have \nsupported this program is that our economy has not recovered from the \nrecession and has not created enough jobs to get America back to work. \nThat means Americans who have been unemployed through no fault of their \nown, who are going out, hitting the pavement, trying to find jobs, \ncan't find work.\n  The Federal program for unemployment benefits was created to take \ncare of Americans during times like this. That is why we have, in the \npast 2 years, supported a Federal program that provides 13 weeks of \nFederal unemployment benefits to all states and 13 additional weeks for \nother States that have unemployment rates significantly higher than the \nnational average.\n  I have come to the floor today because today we are leaving that last\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\nperson in America, who today is receiving his or her last bit of \nfederal help, out in the cold. And we are going to continue to see \nthousands more Americans left out in the cold every week.\n  I met with many of my constituents who have had to cash in their \npensions, or who have had to withdraw from long-term savings meant for \ncollege tuition, or who have had to take all sorts of extraordinary \nmeasures to make sure they can continue to pay their bills. They have \nhad to take these measures because we have not owned up to our \nobligation, which is to help individuals and the economy in a time of \nrecession.\n  Let's recap this issue and how we got to this point. Many people look \nat this debate and see what amounts to fairly minor job growth and \nconclude that the economy is going to get better. I am all for the \neconomy getting better. I actually believe in the potential of many \nsectors in the American economy to lead us back to a stronger place. I \nbelieve in aviation and biotech and nanotechnology and software. \nSomeday jobs are going to grow in America.\n  Right now, however, we are still feeling the aftershocks of a \nrecession. Back in 2002, the Bush administration projected that the \neconomy would lose about 100,000. What happened in 2002, however, was \nthat we actually lost 1.5 million jobs in America. The Administration \ndid not have a handle on what was going on with the economy, which \nresulted in job projection that were way off.\n  In 2003, the Bush administration tried again. They projected that the \neconomy was actually going to pick up. A lot of us, while we might not \nhave agreed with the President's economic policies, wanted to hope for \nthe best and wanted to see economic growth. We wanted those Americans \nwho were without jobs to actually find employment. But, the economy in \n2003 certainly didn't perform the way we thought it was going to \nperform. Even though the White House projected 1.7 million new jobs, \nthe economy actually lost 406,000 jobs.\n\n  That leads us to 2004. The President and his economic advisers have \nprojected that the economy will grow by 2.6 million jobs this year. And \nby God, this Member of the Senate would sit down and not say another \nword about unemployment benefits if this administration would say that \nthey actually believe in their projection. I would sit down and not say \nanother word on unemployment benefits, even though they were wrong in \n2002 and 2003. But, in fact, three Cabinet Secretaries of the \nadministration came to my State, and when asked about the projection of \n2.6 million number jobs--their own projection--they basically said: \nWell, we don't really believe those numbers. It is kind of a rounding \nerror.\n  I can tell you that the constituents of my State and across America \nare not a rounding error. They are people who are counting on a Federal \nprogram to help them. Their employers paid into this program for this \nvery circumstance, when the economy is suffering from the aftershocks \nof a recession and there are no jobs to be had. That is why we want to \nhelp these individuals with a bill to reinstate the unemployment \nbenefits program.\n  Let's look at the rest of the country because some of my colleagues \nseem to think that apart from a few states with high unemployment, \nthings aren't so bad. I know Washington State has been hit hard. In \nfact, the Northwest as a region has topped the unemployment rate \nspectrum for some time. So, there are those who say this is a \nWashington state problem, or a Northwest problem. Yes, we were deeply \naffected by 9/11. Washington is heavily dependent on aviation. Yes, \nthere was a huge downturn in the aviation industry. There is no \nsurprise that people don't want to fly when you have an international \nrecession going on. No wonder people don't want to travel. That has \nstarted to recover now, after almost 2 years. But this is not only a \nproblem for the Northwest.\n  Look at these numbers throughout the country: In Ohio, 168,000 \nmanufacturing jobs lost since 2001; in Texas, 175,000; my State, 66,000 \njobs; California, 350,000; Pennsylvania, 154,000.\n  Practically all across America, save Nevada--maybe the Senators from \nNevada could tell me why--and Alaska, every state has lost \nmanufacturing jobs since Bush took office. This is only manufacturing \njobs. In the Northwest we have lost jobs in software and in a variety \nof other industries. But this chart proves it is a nationwide problem. \nEverywhere in America, everywhere, we have lost manufacturing jobs. \nThat has been a challenge to the American workers.\n  Let's talk about this as an economic issue because, having been in \nbusiness, I want my colleagues to understand that this is a complex \nproblem. We ought to celebrate the high productivity growth. This high \ngrowth means the economic pie is getting bigger but all that extra \nmoney in Gross Domestic Product has actually gone to corporate profits.\n  Now, it is not a bad thing for companies to be profitable. They need \nto be. They want to give a return to investors. There is nothing wrong \nwith that, in and of itself. But what is wrong is when we fail to \nrecognize that investors are winning, but laid-off workers are not. Our \neconomy is not behaving the same way it did in the past. We are seeing \na growth in productivity growth, but that has not actually helped us \nproduce jobs.\n  In the 1990s we had some job loss, but we also had tremendous job \ngrowth. People don't think about that. They think in the 1990s it was \nprobably just go-go-go and everything was very nice for America.\n  We actually had a lot of job loss in the 1990s.\n  The point is we had more job growth than we had job loss. So, unlike \ntoday, the people who lost their jobs in the 1990s were actually able \nto go somewhere else and get a new job. Today, people don't have that \nsame opportunity once they have lost a job to find other employment.\n  A Business Week article came out just a few weeks ago entitled \n``Where Are The Jobs?'' I recommend it to all my colleagues. It goes \nthrough each of these issues and greatly amplifies the problems we are \nfacing and why it is imperative for us to do something about jobs and \nunemployment benefits. We see executive salaries have gone up and \ncorporate profits have gone up, but then number of jobs has actually \ngone down.\n  Again, I am not saying it is horrible that we have had productivity \nincreases--not at all. I'm just saying that if we only look at Gross \nDomestic Product, we miss a key part of the story. Everything isn't \nfine if you are not creating jobs.\n  Let's take a look at a cartoon from one of my favorite cartoonists \nfrom the Seattle paper. I thought this cartoon depicted the problem \nbest. While the CEO compensation is going up, middle-class wages and \nthe number of workers with health insurance is going down. These \nworkers are the people who are barely holding on in this difficult \neconomy.\n  That is what we have to recognize--millions of Americans are barely \nholding on. I am not saying our colleagues are totally heartless about \nthis. But when you know that there are 1.1 million people without a \npaycheck or an unemployment check, and you know that you have the power \nto do something about that and you don't, I start to wonder whether \neither there is some heartlessness, or whether it is just a fundamental \nmisunderstanding about what is going on with the economy. You can't \njust simplistically say everything is great because gross domestic \nproduct and productivity are up. It doesn't work that way. We have to \nget serious about this.\n  As the Business Week article pointed out, because of technology, cost \npressures, the price of health care and political and economic problems \nthe link between strong growth and job creation appears to be broken. \nWe don't know what is wrong.\n  That is a quote from Business Week. That is a business publication \nthat talks to businesses, reports on businesses, reports on \nprofitability. So when Business Week asked where the jobs are, they \nanswered that the link between strong growth and job creation appears \nto be broken.\n  This article chronicles these pressures, which are quite obvious if \nyou think about it, how technology is increasing productivity, how we \nhave increased global competition, how we have skyrocketing health care \ncosts, and numerous other things. So, employers aren't hiring, but then \nwhy hasn't the unemployment rate increased?\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\n  Some of my colleagues have pointed out that the unemployment rate is \nholding at 5.6 percent. They say that we don't have to do anything \nabout the unemployment insurance at the Federal level. Well, we cannot \nhang our hat on the 5.6 number because that number hides what is really \ngoing on with jobs in America; chiefly, that people are dropping out of \nthe labor force.\n  If we count the 392,000 people who gave up looking for jobs, we find \nthe unemployment rate would be more like 7.4 percent.\n  But, my colleagues want to say all is fine at 5.6 percent. That is a \ngreat number. We should be happy with it. Don't worry. Let us all go \nhome. We have jobs. We can pay our mortgage payments, but not everybody \nin America can. We have 1.8 percent of the labor force totally out of \nthe picture. If we look at the unemployment rate, it would be more like \n7.4 percent.\n  The question is whether we are going to keep hiding behind these \neconomic indicators and claim the economy is rosy for American workers. \nIt may be rosy for corporate America and for shareholders, but it is \nnot so rosy for the American worker. We have to come to terms with \nwhether we are going to do our job are reinstate the Federal program or \nnot.\n\n  Is that such a bad idea? I don't think it is such a bad idea. I think \nit is pretty simple.\n  I am kind of amazed it isn't more clear to my colleagues how \nunemployment insurance fits in with a constructive economic plan. My \nsupport for this program is not because it as a social program. As a \nformer businessperson I view it as economic stimulus. With these \nbenefits, laid-off workers continue to put money into the local economy \nand pay the mortgage and everything else. That is helpful.\n  When Alan Greenspan testified before a committee this month, he said, \n``Extending unemployment insurance is not a bad idea.'' In fact, he \nsaid, ``At times like this, I support extension of unemployment \ninsurance.''\n  I wasn't surprised when later I heard that Treasury Secretary Snow \nlast week at a hearing said, ``If Congress acts, the President will \nsign the legislation.''\n  Well, there is one hat in the hat trick gone of those who oppose this \nlegislation. At least we know now the President is saying he is going \nto support it. I wish he would call on a few Members on the other side \nof the aisle. We could certainly use his help.\n  I am also bolstered by the fact that even the White House Press \nSecretary Scott McClellan, at a press conference after Snow's comments \nsaid, ``We have always said we would work with Congress on the issue of \nunemployment benefits.''\n  If that isn't an invitation to pass this legislation today, I don't \nknow what is.\n  American workers who have been left out in the cold and who, with \ntheir employers, have paid into the unemployment trust fund ought to \nget the support they deserve.\n  I remind my colleagues that a majority of Members in both the House \nand the Senate--58 Members over here and 227 Members in the House of \nRepresentatives--have voted in support of reinstating this program.\n  The fundamental question for an unemployed person sitting at home--\nwhether you are in Detroit or Pittsburgh or in Washington State--is if \nboth the House and Senate have a majority of Members voting for this, \nif we have the Secretary of Treasury supporting it, if we have the \nPresident's spokespeople saying they will work with the Congress on it, \nwhy can't we get unemployment benefits for the American worker?\n  I am not going to continue to belabor this point on the floor.\n  I go back to my business experience. I trust the fact that people who \nunderstand business and how to stimulate the economy know something \nneeds to happen.\n  This Business Week article didn't give a knee-jerk reaction to our \nproblem. There are probably 40 pages in this publication about this \nissue--why we have the unemployment rate, what our economy's illnesses \nare, and what we can do to recover. It is a very thoughtful piece. They \nconclude that Government action will act as a bridge and will help the \neconomy cross over the extended valley of almost nonexistent hiring.\n  I think they have said it best. It is time for us to act. It is time \nfor us to do something on this issue.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to calendar No. \n470, S. 2250, a bill to extend the Temporary Extended Unemployment \nCompensation Act of 2002 for displaced workers, that the bill be read \nthree times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from New \nHampshire, I object.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield before she yields \nthe floor?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague from Washington. She has talked \nabout this on numerous occasions. Again, she has very eloquently laid \nout a very thoughtful argument about exactly the problems which exist \nacross the country when it comes to job creation. As someone who has \nspent an earlier part of her life in the private sector--very \nsuccessfully, I might add--she brings a very special knowledge and \nawareness to these issues and this debate and discussion.\n\n  I wonder if my colleague has seen the most recent statistics. In \nfact, they were released today from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I \ndo not believe my colleague referenced them, but they illustrate the \npoint she is making.\n  According to them:\n\n       As of February 2004, 35 states have failed to get back to \n     their pre-recession employment levels. Furthermore, 49 states \n     have not created enough jobs to keep up with the natural \n     growth in the number of potential workers, as job growth has \n     lagged in working-age population since March 2001. As for the \n     unemployed, 43 states have higher unemployment rates than \n     when the recession began.\n\n  And, lastly, they go in and point out a projected job creation of \n306,000 jobs per month. Obviously, we are way off those numbers.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which does not have a \npolitical ax to grind at all--national job creation has fallen over two \nmillion jobs short of that pace. . . .job growth projected for the Bush \nAdministration's economic plan has fallen short in 49 of the 50 states \nas of February 2004. Thirteen states have actually lost jobs since the \nAdministration's tax cut was supposed to start creating job growth.\n  I was not sure if my colleague was aware of those numbers. Don't they \nmake the case even further? These are numbers released today, not going \nback 6 months. But they point out, once again, the sluggishness, to put \nit mildly, of job creation.\n  I wonder if my colleague has any statement on that?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator for his question.\n  I had not seen those specific numbers, but for the year 2004, the \nestimate was for 2.6 million jobs. And if you take that by a monthly \nbasis, our pace should be more at 250,000 jobs. We have now seen the \nJanuary and February numbers, and they are nowhere close to that. In \nfact, December and January were actually revised down from their \noriginal projections.\n  Now, we will either see, this Friday or the following Friday, what \nthe numbers are for March. I do not expect them to be anywhere near \nclose to the 250,000 range that would keep us on pace for the original \n2.6 million projection.\n  But the Senator is correct in saying the job growth is not happening, \nwhich is the point I was trying to make. I see the other side of the \naisle has objected to my unanimous consent request. I have made my \npoint on this issue.\n  Does the Senator have another question?\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield for one additional question. I \nheard the objection expressed by the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee. Does my colleague from Washington have any \nindication when we might get a chance to actually vote on this matter? \nI think there have been 90,000 people a week, if I am not mistaken, who \nexhausted their unemployment benefits--90,000 of our fellow citizens. \nYet we cannot even get a vote on whether or not we can extend these \nbenefits.\n  Is there any indication my colleague has received or heard from the \nRepublican leadership that we might get a chance to vote on whether we \ncould extend these benefits?\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Again, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nConnecticut, and his question, because I think this must be about the \n15th time or 16th time we have been to the floor to ask for unanimous \nconsent to bring this issue up. It is a priority, we believe, for \nAmerica, and it should be brought up.\n  As to your question, I have heard rumblings from House Members in \npositions of leadership from the other side that they, too, want a vote \non it. They are interested in having us send them something. So I think \nthe hat trick needs to stop. We need to tell America who is holding up \nthis bill. We need to go forward in giving the American people the kind \nof security and support they need in this economic downturn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If she is yielding the floor, then I want the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has been recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague from Iowa yield--maybe we can work out a \nsequence. I know the Senator from Texas has some comments. I presume \nothers do, too----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would it be OK if I take 5 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely. Even more.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Or even 6 or 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Even 10.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is what I would like to do.\n  First of all, the Senator from Connecticut asks a legitimate question \nof the Senator from Washington about when this might come up. There is \nan orderly way of doing things around here. And usually in the Senate, \nthe leader--and that is not me; that is Senator Frist from Tennessee--\nsets the agenda for the Senate.\n  It is my understanding that right now we are working on it. I do not \nknow whether the Senator from Washington or the Senator from \nConnecticut has been in contact with the leadership of the Senate so we \ncan do things in an orderly way or whether they want to make political \npoints. But I hope they want to do it in an orderly way because that is \nthe way things get done around here. So it is not with pleasure that I \nobject right now, and look like a bad person to the Senator from \nWashington--because she has always treated me very fairly in her \nservice in the Senate--and to object particularly when we are probably, \nin a matter of hours or a few days, going to pass this legislation. I \nam sure it is going to be passed in a way so that the unemployment \ncompensation is seamless for those who are otherwise entitled to it.\n  That is all I can do to answer the question of the Senator from \nConnecticut. It is my firm conviction it is going to happen.\n  Now, maybe I think things are going to happen, but they might not \nbecause of something beyond what I know now. But I think they are going \nto happen. I know there have already been suggestions made between the \ntwo leaders of the Senate's political parties--our respective \ncaucuses--to move some of these important issues along.\n  But do the members of the Democratic Party in the Senate think only \nDemocrats have important issues they want to bring up? Don't they think \nthere might be a few Republicans who have something they want to bring \nup? So you work these accommodations out. That is what I think we ought \nto do.\n  But what I would like to do, for just a few minutes, is speak to--not \nto challenge anything the Senator from Washington said about \nunemployment because, factually, I do not think you can do that--but \nthere are other thoughts that need to be put on the table at the same \ntime.\n  I made a presentation here 2 weeks ago to try to bring into this \ndebate points of view that are made by the intellectual wing of the \nDemocratic Party to offset what we have just heard from the political \nwing of the Democratic Party. And I quoted a former Democratic \nSecretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, Robert Reich. I want \nto quote him again because he writes very eloquently about job changes \ngoing on in America and about job loss in America.\n  I will quote this long paragraph:\n\n       It's true that U.S. manufacturing employment has been \n     dropping for many years, but that's not primarily due to \n     foreigners taking these jobs. Factory jobs are vanishing all \n     over the world. Economists at Alliance Capital Management \n     took a look at employment trends in 20 large economies and \n     found that between 1995 and 2002, 22 million factory jobs had \n     disappeared.\n\n  Now get this:\n\n       The U.S. wasn't even the biggest loser. We lost about 11 \n     percent of our manufacturing jobs in that period, but the \n     Japanese lost 16 percent of theirs. Even developing nations \n     lost factory jobs: Brazil suffered a 20 percent decline, \n     China a 15 percent drop. What happened to factory jobs? In \n     two words, higher productivity.\n\n  He says:\n\n       I recently toured a U.S. factory containing two employees \n     and 400 computerized robots. The two live people sat in front \n     of computer screens and instructed the robots. In a few years \n     this factory won't have a single employee on site, except for \n     an occasional visiting technician who repairs and upgrades \n     the robots, like the gas man changing your meter.\n\n  The points about productivity she made very well, I believe. But here \nis the other side of that. You can create jobs and not have \nproductivity--be inefficient, be uncompetitive, and not have a business \nafter a while. Or you can be productive because enhancing productivity \nin America is what it takes to raise wages. If you want to increase the \nstandard of living in America, you have to raise wages. To raise wages, \nyou have to enhance productivity.\n  So are they suggesting we ought to turn the clock back and forget \nabout productivity, forget about raising the standard of living in \nAmerica? Do they want us to become some Third World economy over the \nperiod of the next 50 years, if you went down that road, or do you want \nto do what America can do best, the other things Secretary Reich is \nreferring to? We have a knowledge base in America. Take advantage of \nthat knowledge base. Create jobs that are more productive and, in the \nprocess, raise wages and raise the standard of living. Those are the \nchoices we have.\n\n  America is a dynamic economy. Every month 7 million jobs go out of \nexistence, and 7 million jobs come into existence. It would be ideal if \nit were more than 7 million jobs coming on board. That hasn't happened, \nand that is why we have the 2.3 million jobs that are referred to all \nthe time.\n  Do you think it is always going to be this way in America? Absolutely \nnot, because of the dynamic economy we have. It is because we are \nalways enhancing productivity that we are going to do better.\n  You don't have to be a defeatist when it comes to the economy. We \nhave gone through tougher times. We have gone through tougher times \nwhen unemployment was 25 percent, not 5.6 percent. We got through it. \nAmerica is stronger today. Don't lose faith in America.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will yield for a question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator. This Senator has the utmost \nrespect for him and his positions and his understanding of this issue. \nHe is right. Productivity is something we want to embrace. It is good \nfor America. You will not that I did not talk about the outsourcing \nissue. I talked about the fact that these things are good and there are \nlots of sectors of the economy that are going to be very robust for us \nin the future, issues the Senator is well advised on--nanotechnology, \nbiotechnology, aerospace, and software. They are all going to be \npositive sectors.\n  The question is, what do we do in this particular recession when \nthings haven't been so positive? I certainly respect the challenge the \nSenator has managing this particular legislation and moving it through \nthe process. I have found him one of the most cooperative Members with \nwhom to work.\n  But I feel compelled to ask: Is it possible, then, if we cannot pass \nthis bill by Unanimous Consent, can we bring up amendment No. 2940 for \nan up-or-down vote which is a vote on the unemployment benefits and do \nthat as part of the TANF legislation?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator asks a very legitimate question. For my \npart, eventually we have to face this. I don't care how we face it, as \na separate bill or as an amendment. I think she has to ask somebody \njust one step above my\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\npay grade to get an answer to that. I am not prepared to answer that. I \ndo not have an answer from the people that give it because, as I said, \nthe leader sets the schedule. I respect the leader, and I don't want to \nput him in a position. I might be able to say, but I don't have \ncertainty of it. So I don't want to put him in a bad position.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield the floor?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are three or four of us here. Maybe we \nshould make a unanimous consent request. I plan on taking about 15 \nminutes. I would ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed for \n15 minutes. My colleague from Texas was next on the floor. I don't know \nhow much time he would request, and then I know our colleagues from \nWisconsin and from Delaware are here as well. Maybe we could set up a \nprocess so we will have predictability to proceed. May I ask my \ncolleague how much time he would like?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. And the Senator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. And my colleague from Delaware?\n  Mr. CARPER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Texas be recognized for 15 \nminutes, the Senator from Wisconsin be recognized for 20 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Delaware for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, I don't think I need to \nobject, but I think there ought to be some consideration that if other \nRepublicans come to the Chamber, we don't have Democrats ganging up on \nus to give one point of view. There ought to be some accommodation to \nRepublicans if they would come over here. I don't expect anybody beyond \nthe Senator from Texas to come over and speak, but if they do, I would \nhope you will be a gentleman and try to work them in so we let America \nknow there are two sides to every story.\n  Mr. DODD. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. With that consideration, I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from Iowa leaves the \nfloor, I want to express my gratitude to the Senator from Iowa, as I \ndid yesterday, for his support of the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Snowe, and me on the childcare provisions. It was a \nsignificant vote: 78 to 20 was the final vote.\n  Certainly, the chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from \nIowa, was tremendously helpful in that regard. I wouldn't want him to \nleave without once again expressing my sincere appreciation for his \nsupport. I have always been treated well by him. We have served \ntogether now for almost three decades in the Congress, and we have \nalways had a strong and good relationship with each other.\n  I was disappointed by the position of the administration. To quote \nthem from their bulletin:\n\n       In considering this legislation, the administration would \n     strongly oppose any amendment that increases funding for the \n     Child Development Block Grant fund.\n\n  ``Strongly oppose'' is an indication of how they fail to understand \nwhat I think the Senator from Iowa pointed out--certainly the Senator \nfrom Maine did--the critical transition that is necessary from welfare \nto work, particularly considering the jobs these people are able to \nget. Most of them are very low-wage jobs. Having a strong childcare \ncomponent is the lifeboat that will get them from one side of the shore \nof this raging river to the other, the side of the shore from welfare \ndependency to work.\n  If you cannot get across that gulf because you have young children, \nas many of these people do who are presently on welfare--trying to get \nto work, or those who work today barely holding on--then the likelihood \nthey are going to succeed is very small.\n  There was a strong vote in this Chamber yesterday to support the \neffort to provide the assistance for literally thousands of young \nchildren who are on waiting lists in 24 States that we know about, some \n600,000 who will need that kind of assistance.\n  I am terribly disappointed the administration strongly opposes \nchildcare assistance. My hope is the position of this body will prevail \nin the conference, if we get there.\n  I also want to comment briefly on the issue of the minimum wage. I \nthank our colleagues from California and Massachusetts who have raised \nit. The better description of this might be called a livable wage. We \ntalk about the minimum wage, but what we are really looking for is a \nlivable wage. It is a standard we have embraced for years. \nAdministrations, regardless of party, have always embraced the idea of \nsetting a floor of what ought to be a livable wage. It is hardly \nlivable when you consider the poverty level for a family of three is \n$15,700 and we are talking about people making $10,700 a year working \nfull time making minimum wage. That is $5,000 below the poverty level. \nI can't even imagine anywhere in the United States one could live today \nas a family of three with a gross income of $10,700. And that is what \nwe are talking about.\n  There are 34 million people who are living in poverty in the United \nStates. In a nation of 280 million people, 12 million are children \nliving in poverty. Obviously, we are not going to solve that problem \nsimply by raising the minimum wage level, but we certainly want to give \npeople a chance to be hired for a little more than $5 an hour in the \n21st century. As we begin trying to move people from welfare to work so \nthey at least have a chance, once they get that job, to hold on and \nthen move into more independent living, they must be able to earn a \nlivable wage.\n  So I am terribly disappointed again that we have not been able to \nhave a vote on this matter. I don't think it is terribly complicated. A \nlivable wage in the United States, certainly in light of what happened \nsince the last time we raised it, is in order--considering that every \nadministration, from the most progressive to the most conservative, has \nfound time and space in which to increase the minimum wage. This is one \nof the longest periods of time we have ever gone without increasing \nthat. It has been 7 years since we have actually raised the minimum \nwage.\n  During that same time, by the way, this body found room to increase \nour salaries six different times; six times we have raised our \nsalaries. Yet, in 7 years, we have not increased the minimum wage. I \nhave not objected to salary increases for Congress. I understand that. \nThe point is, when we find time to debate and vote on matters that \nallow us on six different occasions to raise our salaries and not on \none occasion have we been able to raise the minimum wage or the livable \nwage for people living in the levels of poverty they do, this is \nsomething I find rather distressing, to put it mildly.\n  The great majority of welfare payments go to single mothers. \nUnfortunately, the kinds of jobs women leaving welfare find are often \nminimum wage jobs, making it very difficult, if not impossible, to \nsustain a family and meet the demands of raising children. Life is \nprecarious for low-income people, particularly for single mothers \nraising children. In the U.S., regardless of whether they have been on \nwelfare or not, for them, survival is a daily goal. If they work hard \nenough and their hours are long enough, maybe they can make ends meet, \nbut only barely. They don't have time for their families because they \nare working tremendous hours, sometimes a couple of jobs to make ends \nmeet. They are not buying homes, going on vacation, going to the \ntheater, or symphonies, or buying extra clothes. They are trying to \nhold their families together. The idea of buying gifts for children, \ntaking them on special trips, that is not part of the family's agenda \nif you are part of the 34 million people in this country living in \npoverty. We are trying to get that minimum wage after 7 years to a \npoint that makes it possible to at least make it a little easier to \nmeet the daily goal of survival. We must stop asking families to do it \nalone. They are working too many hours for too little pay.\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\n  Often these children who are being raised in this environment are not \nentering our school system--particularly well prepared to learn. Talk \nto any teacher in any rural area where there is poverty, or to a \nteacher who works in our inner cities where poverty exists. Without \nexception, regardless of their politics, teachers will tell you \nchildren who are not getting the attention and time and care needed are \nstarting their lives way behind.\n  Ultimately, we pay a price in this country for that. I will not \nsuggest to you the minimum wage solves all of those problems. But \nshould we not in this great country, after 7 long years, provide an \nextra couple of dollars an hour so people might have a little bit more \nincome to provide for their children. We need to help raise wages for \nthese families so they can make ends meet and improve the quality of \ntheir lives. One of the best first steps is to ensure the work pays a \nfair, livable wage. The real value of the livable wage has fallen \ndramatically over the past 30 years. The livable wage workers are being \nleft further behind every year. Working families have waited long \nenough. Minimum wage employees work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, \nand earn $10,700. That is if you work every week. Forget that 2 weeks \nvacation or even 1 week of vacation--you earn $10,700.\n  This is the 21st century. In America, what community can you live in \nwith a family of 3 on $10,700? I don't think you are going to find \none. The poverty level is approximately $15,000 for a family of 3. We \nmust raise the minimum wage to $7 an hour, and I think we can do it.\n\n  Under the proposed bill, we go from $5.15 to $5.85 to, one year \nlater, $6.45, and the year after that, to $7. That is what we are \nproposing. I suspect some negotiation might happen in order to get \nsomething done. But, we cannot even vote on the issue.\n  Today, more than 34 million people live in poverty, including 12 \nmillion children. Among full-time, year-round workers poverty has \ndoubled since the late 1970s, from 1.3 million then to 2.6 million in \n2002. An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem we \nare trying to solve. Every day the minimum wage is not increased, it \ncontinues to lose value and workers fall farther behind.\n  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996-\n1997 increase, 7 long years ago. Today, the real value of the minimum \nwage is more than $3 below what it was in 1968. To have the purchasing \npower it had in 1968, the minimum wage would actually have to be closer \nto $8.50 an hour than to $5.15, which is where we are today.\n  In the past 7 years, salaries of lawmakers have gone up by $23,400, \ngiving ourselves 6 raises, while minimum wage workers continue to earn \n$10,700 a year. Nearly 7 million workers would directly benefit from \nthe proposed minimum wage increase 35 percent are their family's sole \nearners and 61 percent are women. Almost one-third of those women are \nraising children. An increase to $7 an hour for a full-time, year-round \nworker would add $3,800 to their income.\n  What does that buy? If you are living in affluence, not much. But \n$3,800 for a minimum wage worker and their families means buying more \nthan a year of groceries; 9 months of rent; a year and a half of heat \nand electricity in their homes; or full tuition for a community college \ndegree. I know there are those who object to this increase and believe \nit is going to slow economic growth in the country. That is not true.\n  Ever since there has been a minimum wage increase, there has been no \nill effect on economic growth in the country. I suggest by doing this, \nthere is a greater likelihood we are going to keep people in the \nworkforce--even if they are minimum wage jobs--and allow them to \nprovide the bare survival needs of their families, so they don't fall \nback into a dependency situation of one kind or another.\n  I think we all become winners if we give these people a chance to \nhave a higher standard of living than that which they are presently \ngetting with the $5.15 an hour wage.\n  I know it is not the job of the chairman of the Finance Committee to \nset the agenda. But somebody has to set the agenda around here. We have \nbeen debating other issues of almost total irrelevancy. I guess at some \npoint we are going to debate gay marriage. Well, that is a compelling \nissue for the vast majority of people who are trying to make ends meet. \nOr we will debate medical malpractice where you cannot even negotiate \nwhat comes out of it. We can debate whether the gun manufacturers ought \nto be excused from any liability. Heaven forbid we take an hour or two \nand debate whether we increase the minimum wage a few dollars more than \n$5.15 an hour.\n  I will emphasize to you again $10,700. That is what the minimum wage \nprovides today. I don't think anyone believes that is a condition or a \ncircumstance, economically, in which you can expect a family of 3 to \nsurvive. You cannot make it, no matter how determined you are. I \nbelieve we ought to be able to take care of this issue and do it \npromptly. It would be a great piece of economic news for millions of \nAmericans and not just for those living in poverty. I think for \nmillions more who don't live in poverty and see people doing it every \nday there would be a sense of gratification that we are doing something \nfor people. We are doing something for people who make the effort every \nday not to fall back into dependency, but to provide an opportunity for \ntheir families, to stay independent, become self-sufficient, and raise \na family. I have often said that the best social program ever \nenvisioned was a decent paying job. The second thing you and I ask a \nperson we meet for the first time after their name is: What do you do?\n  Everybody I have ever met wants to take pride in what they do. By \ngiving people a livable wage, we allow them to be able to say to their \nchildren and families and neighbors: I do something. I have value. I \nhave worth.\n  Providing an additional $3,800 over 2 or 3 years is not asking too \nmuch. I would hope we could adopt the Boxer-Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments about what I \nbelieve to be a better way than we have heard today, which has so far \nbeen a proposal for greater Government regulation and intervention, \nmore of a straitjacket on those who create jobs and create those \nlivable wages about which the Senator from Connecticut has spoken.\n  I also want to say a few words in response to the breathless negative \ncomments we have heard in recent weeks about our economy and about job \ncreation in this country, and in the process the attacks that are made \nrepeatedly on this floor and elsewhere against President Bush.\n  Of course, in every election year, we all understand there will be a \nrise in political sniping, but no one should ever cross the line and \nmislead the American people about the fundamental strength of our \neconomy or champion this negative view just because they view it to be \nin their own political self-interest to undermine public confidence in \nthe economy.\n  Sadly, it seems there are some interested in playing on fear and \nanxiety. Some who talk about job loss and unemployment provoke, rather \nthan actually working, as we have the opportunity to do on this floor, \nto actually fix some of the problems and some of the conditions that \nwould give rise to job creation and more job security in this country.\n  The truth is we ought to be able to agree on the facts. The public \npolicies we argue based on those facts are something else. We are going \nto have policy differences. We are going to have differences of \nposition, and that is to be expected, and that is fine. But we should \nagree on the facts.\n  Fact No. 1: Home ownership is at an all-time high in the United \nStates of America, and that is an enormously good and positive thing. \nMore people in this country are achieving part of the American dream.\n  Interest rates we know are at a historic low. Productivity is booming \nwhich, in turn, increases the ability of employers to invest in their \nbusiness and to create even more jobs. And indeed, the gross domestic \nproduct in this country is growing by leaps and bounds.\n  One fact we should and I think we can agree on is the unemployment \nrate is standing at about 5.6 percent. The interesting thing about that \nis the\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nstory we heard in 1996 from the distinguished minority leader from \nSouth Dakota, back at a time when we had a 5.6 percent unemployment \nrate. Senator Daschle said:\n\n       The economy is doing extraordinarily well. . . . We have \n     the lowest rate of inflation and unemployment we've had in 27 \n     years.\n\n  What was the unemployment rate then, and what is the unemployment \nrate now? It is identical.\n  Today I read the comments of the junior Senator from New York who \nsaid with a 5.6 percent unemployment rate, it is obvious the economy is \nnot creating any jobs. But indeed it was another Clinton back in 1996 \nwho said:\n\n       I was gratified to hear our partners praise the strength of \n     our economy . . . Lower interest rates have helped us slash \n     unemployment--\n\n  To what? That is right, to 5.6 percent.\n  It seems for many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, a \n5.6 percent unemployment rate under a President named Bush is a \ntravesty, but a 5.6 percent employment rate under a President named \nClinton is just fine and dandy.\n  We have more than 138 million Americans working today, a figure we \nshould be very proud of, the highest in our Nation's history. But you \nwould not know that from listening to those who try to talk down the \neconomy.\n  Something we can all agree on, I am sure, is any person out of work \nwho wants to work is one person too many. Indeed, I would hope the one \nthing we would all be able to agree on is we ought to pursue policies \nwhich encourage full employment and we ought to provide everybody in \nthis country who wants a job the ability to provide for themselves and \ntheir families.\n\n  Sometimes you get the idea our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle really want to have it both ways. They want to have low \nunemployment, which is what we all want, but they also want to oppose \npolicies which are designed to reduce unemployment and to encourage \nfull employment. For example, I read this morning the reaction of some \nin this body to the comments made by Treasury Secretary John Snow who \npointed out that outsourcing, a subject of frequent commentary in this \nbody, is an important aspect and, indeed, an inevitable aspect of free \ntrade that ultimately produces jobs in this economy.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, who happens to be a candidate for \nPresident of the United States, said he wants to crack down on \n``Benedict Arnold CEOs and corporations'' who engage in outsourcing as \na way to maintain their competitiveness in this global economy. As the \njunior Senator from New York said, when it comes to outsourcing:\n\n       I really don't know what reality the Bush administration is \n     living in . . . [outsourcing] isn't good for America.\n\n  I suggest those who say outsourcing is something that we actually \nhave the capacity to stop or they think is bad to job creation in \nglobal competitiveness sit down and have a conversation with Robert \nReich, President Clinton's former Secretary of Labor, who claimed in a \nWashington Post op-ed on November 2, 2003, that ``High-Tech Jobs Are \nGoing Abroad, But That's Okay.''\n  Getting a meeting with Professor Reich should be convenient, as Mr. \nReich is candidate Kerry's top labor adviser and a member of his \nsteering committee.\n  I think Mr. Snow, the Treasury Secretary, knows an awful lot about \neconomics, but I also agree that so does Mr. Reich. They both agree \noutsourcing is an inevitable result of free trade that ultimately \nbenefits America and America's competitiveness in the world economy.\n  As Mr. Reich wrote:\n\n       It makes no sense for us to try to block efforts by \n     American companies to outsource.\n\n  Just this month, Mr. Reich was interviewed in the Pittsburgh Post-\nGazette and asked: What do you think about the move in Congress to bar \nFederal contracts from being outsourced to other lower cost countries? \nMr. Reich's response:\n\n       A silly political ploy.\n\n  Yet even as outsourcing continues to be a subject of discussion and \neven as some of my colleagues in this body throw it out as something \nthat is bad and hurtful to America and America's competitiveness, we \nall seem to have forgotten it also goes the other way. Indeed, my State \nof Texas is one of the leading beneficiaries of what I will call \ninsourcing; that is, foreign investments in America.\n  According to the Texas Department of Economic Development, Texas has \nmore than $110 billion in foreign investment, direct investment in our \nState, and that is approximately $5,000 in foreign investment for every \nTexan--$5,000 for each of 22 million Texans in direct foreign \ninvestment because of free trade.\n  There are 430,000 jobs in Texas thanks to outsourcing by these \nforeign corporations. People who would otherwise be out of work if we \ndid as some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggested. \nMembers who are appealing to the anxieties and fears of the American \npeople rather than giving them the information they need to understand \nand that we all need to embrace in terms of maintaining our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  I ask my colleagues to tell me why creating jobs for the hard-working \ncitizens of my State by encouraging this foreign investment in our \ncountry is a bad idea. If we are to cave in to fear mongering by those \nwho want to erect a protectionist wall around our country, do my \ncolleagues think other countries might choose to retaliate against the \nUnited States? You bet.\n  This is a two-way street, and there is a natural flux. New jobs are \ncreated and old jobs fade away. That is what being part of a market \neconomy is all about. In the end, the net increase is a good one.\n  This week in my State, a study found we will lose 3,000 technology \njobs over the next 5 years due to outsourcing. That is the bad news. \nThe good news is we are going to gain 24,000 jobs over the same period.\n  I reassure my colleague from New York, according to this report, her \nState will have a net gain of more than 18,000 jobs over the same \nperiod thanks to outsourcing, which she has said is a bad idea and out \nof touch with reality.\n  When companies that provide employment save money and maintain their \ncompetitiveness in a global economy because of outsourcing, they can \nafford to hire more U.S. employees. As a matter of fact, if we were \nsomehow trying to find a way to prohibit this phenomenon, the only \nchoice some of these employers would have would be to pack up their \nAmerican company and simply move it overseas. What good would that do? \nThat would obviously cause more harm than good.\n  We are dealing with a simple economic truth, and one that far too \nmany ignore or choose to distort for partisan political purposes in \nthis election year. We have to recognize that in the 21st century, we \nare competing in a true global economy, and our job in Government ought \nto be to try to find ways to enhance America's competitiveness in the \neconomy, not the other way around. That is why I believe education, job \ntraining, and the President's community college initiative he talked \nabout during his State of the Union address are so important, steps \nalso endorsed by Chairman Alan Greenspan. These programs, which I have \nseen in operation in communities across my State, from Amarillo to \nHouston to Austin, have created opportunities for young men and women \nto train and retrain, to hold better paying jobs in an ever-changing \neconomy. I have seen the positive results of these partnerships between \nbusinesses and community colleges when it comes to training and \nretraining the workforce for these good, high-paying jobs.\n  High taxes, overregulation, and rising health care costs, in an \nenvironment that encourages people to sue first and ask questions \nlater, are damaging our global competitiveness. Those on the other side \nwho seem to persistently favor higher taxes and more regulation are at \nthe same time complaining about America's inability to compete and to \nkeep these jobs in America. Those who still honestly believe we can \nsue, tax, and regulate our way to economic growth and prosperity are \njust flat wrong.\n  In this body, we have had many opportunities to address some of these \ncompetitiveness issues. We had the opportunity earlier this year to \npass class action reform and medical liability reform which would lower \nhealth care costs so more employers could provide health care coverage \nat a more reasonable cost to more employees. We have\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\nhad a chance to reform our broken asbestos liability system. Yet, there \nare those who consistently vote against these reforms that would make \nAmerica more competitive in this global economy and would increase the \nopportunity to create jobs. Members who now are prescribing the wrong \nmedicine for what ails the American economy. This is even at a time \nwhen our economy is roaring back, thanks to the leadership of our \nPresident and the actions of this Congress in reducing the tax burden \non hard-working Americans.\n\n  I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when they talk \nabout their desire to increase competitiveness of American job creators \nin this global economy, will join us in reconsidering the position they \nhave taken so far in opposing the JOBS bill, medical liability reform, \na rational national energy policy, class action reform, asbestos \nlitigation reform, and many other measures that would enhance America's \ncompetitiveness in this global economy. They need to allow us to vote.\n  I believe a bipartisan majority stands ready to pass many of these \nreforms which would create more jobs and improve the economy. Time and \ntime again, when we have had the chance to fix these problems, when we \nhave had a chance to address these issues, there are those on the other \nside whose only answer is, no, no vote, no closing off of debate, no \nimproving of the competitiveness of America in the global economy.\n  In closing, I want to reinforce what I have tried to say throughout. \nThere is a lot of good news I do not think is breaking through the \nclutter on the 24-hour cable news cycle in this highly politicized \nelection year. There are those who want to bad-mouth the economy, \nincrease the anxiety of people who are working, and compound the misery \nof those who are out of work by saying there is no hope; America cannot \ncompete; the only way we can protect American workers is to build a \nwall around our country and to stop free markets.\n  I think that is absolutely the wrong medicine for what ails this \ncountry. What we need is to be true to our principles. Americans have \nalways and will always be able to compete given a level playing field. \nThis is not a time for us to lose confidence in America's ability to \ncompete and to create jobs in a way that has made us the envy of the \nworld. This is not the time to tell the American people that America \ncannot compete and our only hope is to retreat into our shell and to \nbuild the walls of protectionism around our country.\n  Indeed, we have been preaching to the entire free world, including \nthe new democracies that have just joined NATO and will soon join the \nEuropean Union, that free markets and free trade are the answer. \nAmerica must stick by that answer because it is the last best hope for \nimproved quality of life and freedom for people all across this planet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                          The 9/11 Commission\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday the 9/11 Commission heard the \npublic testimony of current and former Cabinet and National Security \nCouncil officials. It is critically important to make certain the \nhistorical record is accurate and complete and to establish all of the \nfacts surrounding what the various elements of the U.S. Government knew \nabout the terrorist threat before September 11, 2001.\n  The most important task before us, our first priority, should be to \nstop future attacks, to crush the terrorist organizations that are \ntrying to kill us and trying to kill our children.\n  Over 2\\1/2\\ years have passed since that horrible day. We are \ndutybound to get our post-September 11 response right, and I think \ngetting it right means keeping this fight focused on the terrorist \nnetworks that attacked this Nation. Putting it more simply, it means \nkeeping our eye on the ball. We need to take this fight to the \nterrorists. That is why every Member of this body voted to go after \nthose responsible for attacking this country on September 11, 2001. But \nthe further we get from September 11, I am concerned that we are not \ndoing enough to root out the terrorists in Afghanistan.\n  Recently, we have all heard a lot about the spring offensive in the \nborder region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. I support the offensive \nand I remain deeply grateful for the service of our men and women in \nuniform. But why is this offensive happening this spring? We are \ntalking about forces that attacked this country in 2001. This offensive \nshould have taken place last spring. In fact, by the end of last \nspring, Rand Beers, who had served as counterterrorism adviser to this \nadministration in the National Security Council, had resigned his job \nand was voicing his concerns about the insufficient effort in \nAfghanistan. ``Terrorists move around the country with ease. We don't \neven know what is going on,'' he told a reporter.\n  The director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York \nUniversity just found that ``the low level of funding for the \nreconstruction of Afghanistan remains astonishing, given the importance \nwith which major nations claim to regard it and the consequences of the \nprevious neglect of that country.''\n  When it comes to terrorists in Afghanistan, we need to finish the job \nand finish them off. Then we need to make sure that we support the \nAfghan people and help them create a climate in their country that will \nmake it impossible for terrorist forces to survive there in the future.\n  Make no mistake: The al-Qaida network is not confined only to \nAfghanistan. It would be misleading and dangerous to suggest that \neliminating a handful of al-Qaida leaders eliminates the threat from \nthe network. None of these al-Qaida forces should ever know a moment's \npeace. We must wage a relentless campaign against al-Qaida around the \nworld, and we will not be done until they have nowhere left to hide.\n  I joined my colleagues in authorizing the use of force against those \nresponsible for the September 11 attacks. When I cast that vote, I \nexpected a serious campaign targeting the terrorists who attacked this \ncountry. I am pretty confident most Americans expected the same thing. \nWhat we did not expect was that elements of that effort would be left \nto tread water so that we could focus resources on the war in Iraq \ninstead.\n  Instead of keeping our eye on the ball, instead of focusing on \nwinning the fight we are in, this administration launched into a \ntremendously costly initiative in Iraq. Of course, they have used a \nwhole lot of different arguments to justify this war, and a lot of \narguments trying to link the war to the fight against terrorism, even \nthough on January 8 of this year, Secretary of State Colin Powell \nstated he had not seen any ``smoking gun or concrete evidence'' of ties \nbetween former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. Even though \nthe report The Network of Terrorism, published by the State Department \nin the wake of 9/11, which begins with the words of the President of \nthe United States, listed 45 countries where al-Qaida or affiliated \ngroups were known to have operated--and guess what, Iraq was not one of \nthe 45. Iraq was not on the list in the report. Even though Richard \nClarke, the man whom the Bush administration chose to head up \ncounterterrorism policy within the National Security Council, told the \nPresident and members of his Cabinet that Iraq had nothing to do with \n9/11.\n  By the summer of 2002, national security debates weren't about the \nfight against terrorism anymore; they were all about the invasion of \nIraq. We got sidetracked. We are facing one of the most serious threats \nto our national security in the history of this country, and I dare \nanyone to say that is an exaggeration, but what did we do? We took our \neye off the ball.\n  As I said before, even as our brave troops were taking Baghdad, 10 \nmen allegedly involved in the bombing of the USS Cole--a terrorist \nattack that killed 17 American sailors--escaped from a prison in Yemen. \nThat news was disturbing, and I wanted answers, answers about what we \nknew about their escape, the circumstances of their detention and the \nsecurity of the facility, about the implications of this lapse. The \nanswers were of a deeply troubling ``no one is minding the store'' \nvariety. I can assure you I tried again and again to get some \ninformation about this.\n\n  This month, reports indicate these escapees have finally been \nrecaptured.\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\nOf course this is good news. But we must take steps to avoid this kind \nof scenario in the future. We must give these issues the focus they \ndeserve and devote resources and support to monitoring these situations \nclosely and acting to protect our interests.\n  As you know, by October 2003, even Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld \nindicated in a memo that, despite over 2 years having passed since \nSeptember 11, ``relatively little effort'' had gone into developing ``a \nlong range plan'' to win the fight against terrorism. In the memo of \nthe Secretary of Defense, he pointed out that there is no consensus \nwithin the national security community in the U.S. about how to even \nmeasure success in this fight. No thoughtful and useful way to tell \nwhere we stand? So not only have we lost our focus in this fight, we \ndon't even have a way to measure our lack of focus. This is our most \nimportant national security priority. Something is not right with this \npicture.\n  Iraq is a mammoth undertaking. We only have so many national security \nresources, and all the resources we used to fight the war with Iraq--\nthe military resources, the intelligence resources, the money, effort, \nand the long hours--all of them came from what is surely a finite \nsupply. The fight against the terrorists who attacked this country had \nto be addressed with what was left, wedged into the margins.\n  Jeffrey Record, visiting professor at the Army War College, published \na paper that very clearly acknowledged this problem. His analysis \nindicated that the U.S. fight against terrorism has been \n``strategically unfocused.'' He writes as follows:\n\n       In the wake of the September 11, 2001, al-Qaida terrorist \n     attacks on the United States, the U.S. Government declared a \n     global war on terrorism. The nature and parameters of that \n     war, however, remain frustratingly unclear. The \n     administration has postulated a multiplicity of enemies, \n     including rogue states; weapons of mass destruction \n     proliferators; terrorist organizations of global, regional, \n     and national scope; and terrorism itself. It also seems to \n     have conflated them into a monolithic threat, and in so doing \n     has subordinated strategic clarity to the moral clarity it \n     strives for in foreign policy and may have set the United \n     States on a course of open-ended and gratuitous conflict with \n     states and nonstate entities that posed no serious threat to \n     the United States. Of particular concern has been the \n     conflation of al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein's Iraq as a single, \n     undifferentiated terrorist threat.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       This was a strategic error of the first order because it \n     ignored critical differences between the two in character, \n     threat level, and susceptibility to U.S. deterrence and \n     military action. The result has been an unnecessary \n     preventive war of choice against a deterred Iraq that has \n     created a new front in the Middle East for Islamic terrorism \n     and diverted attention and resources away from securing the \n     American homeland against further assault by an undeterrable \n     al-Qaida. The war against Iraq was not integral to the \n     [Global War on Terrorism], but rather a detour from it.\n\n  Some have argued that Iraq itself is the central front in the fight \nagainst terrorism, despite the absence of significant evidence linking \nthe Saddam Hussein regime to terrorists who attacked this country. They \npoint to the indisputable fact that in post-Saddam Iraq, terrorists are \noperating in Iraq and they are targeting our brave American soldiers as \nwell as innocent American and Iraqi and other civilians. This is a true \nstatement. It is also a painful reality. But it is not a strategy for \ndefeating al-Qaida. Just because there are attacks in Iraq does not \nmean there will not be attacks elsewhere. The terrorists working for \nand with the al-Qaida network will not all be attracted to Iraq. We \ncan't bring them all in there and defeat them there.\n\n  Right now, terror cells are plotting and planning and operating in \nmany other places around the world--in the Middle East, in east Africa, \nin southeast Asia, in northern Africa, in central Asia. Pretending that \na ``roach motel'' strategy against terrorist networks is a viable way \nto protect our national security would be almost laughable if the \nconsequences were not so deadly serious.\n  There are heartbreaking human costs to the families of killed and \ninjured troops, and there are astronomical economic costs--costs that \nAmerica is writing bad checks to cover--as well. And there is the cost \nwe can never know or measure, the cost of missed opportunities to make \nprogress in the fight against al-Qaida and associated terrorist \nnetworks.\n  I am glad the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein is gone. I am glad the \nIraqi people have a chance at a better life. I recognize it is not in \nour national interest to let Iraq dissolve into chaotic disorder, but \nmy first priority is my concern for the American people, and I doubt \nour effort in Iraq has helped to eliminate the terrorist threat we face \nfrom the forces that actually attacked us on September 11.\n  I also fear that the way the administration has approached Iraq--the \nblurring of facts, the conflating of villains, the shifting \njustifications for war--may undermine our capacity to lead the global \nfight against terrorism. As David Kay, the former chief U.S. weapons \ninspector in Iraq said on March 22, ``We are in grave danger of having \ndestroyed our credibility internationally and domestically with regard \nto warning about future events.''\n  International credibility matters. It is part and parcel of our \ncountry's power--our power to inspire, to motivate, to persuade. Our \nenemies have a global network. We must have a global response. That \nmeans close cooperation with countries around the world. It means \nsharing intelligence, and coordinating with other countries to clamp \ndown on terrorist financing, squeezing terrorist networks out of the \nshadows in which they operate, leaving them vulnerable and exposed. But \nsince September 11, we have seen a loss of this critical American \npower. In fact, today, a majority of people living in Jordan, Morocco, \nPakistan and Turkey say they believe the U.S. is conducting its \ncampaign against terror to dominate others and control the world's oil. \nSomehow the fight against terrorism, which was and should still be a \nrallying point for global unity and resolve, has become divisive.\n  We know that the military plays a critical role in fighting \nterrorism. But some have twisted the importance of the military's role \ninto an argument that suggests that fighting terrorism is about nothing \nbut military force. I believe at best this is delusional and wildly \ndangerous at worst. Military force absolutely must be part of our \nresponse, and all of us in the Senate voted to give the President the \nauthority to use it. And the vast resources available to DOD, which \nunfortunately do not always trickle down to the level of our men and \nwomen in the field, makes it tempting to turn to our Armed Forces for \nsolutions again and again. But we all know this is true: The answers do \nnot lie with the military alone--and it is not fair to our brave men \nand women in uniform to make them bear the brunt of conducting the \nfight against terrorism all by themselves. We must also take a hard \nlook at all the other forms of power that America has at its disposal, \nstrengthen those tools, and apply them wisely.\n  Consider what a quick glance at the international section of daily \nnewspapers tells us--uranium seizures at insecure borders, money \nlaundering through the diamond trade that has been linked to \nterrorist financing, and pirates boarding chemical tankers, steering \nthem for a while, and then disappearing.\n\n  As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I know \nthat we do not have the intelligence resources that we should around \nthe world. I know that we do not really have any policy at all to deal \nwith Somalia, a failed state in which terrorists have operated and \nfound sanctuary. I know that there is a great deal of work to be done \nto help countries in which we know terrorists have operated. We need to \nimprove the basic capacities of border patrols who could stop wanted \nindividuals, and customs agents who could help stop weapons \nproliferation and auditors who could freeze terrorist assets. And we \ncan do more to root out the corruption that undermines these safeguards \nat every turn.\n  In the wake of the terrible bombings in Madrid, my heart goes out to \nthe people of Spain, and my judgment tells me that too many people are \nmisinterpreting the subsequent Spanish election. I don't believe that \nthe Spanish people will let their political choices be dictated to them \nby terrorists. The real lesson, the most important lesson that we can \ndraw from recent events in Spain is this: A democracy cannot be unified \nand mobilized to fight terrorism when citizens believe that their\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\ngovernment is willing to mislead them about the threats they face, and \nwhen they believe that their government does not have its eye on the \nball.\n  Americans know that the battle against terrorism is not a matter of \nchoice, and they know that the battle is worth fighting fiercely. We \nwill not run scared, and we will not be frightened into abandoning our \nmost cherished national values or liberties. So let us move forward to \nharness the strength of this great country, to learn from our mistakes, \nto use all of the tools at our disposal, and to stay focused on the \nmost important national security priority before us--fighting and \ndefeating the forces that have attacked our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to my friend from \nWisconsin for his statement. When the senior Senator from Wisconsin \ncomes to the floor, he is prepared. I am always so impressed with the \nsubstance of his statements. The Senator and I have traveled to parts \nof the world. He has a great concern about what is going on in the \nworld. He is able to express himself very well. I acknowledge his \nstatement today and extend for the second time this afternoon my \nappreciation for his statement.\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk on the Senate floor \ntoday, but I am very disappointed it has only been talk. We are not \nlegislating. For this very important bill on the floor, we have had one \nvote. There are many people in the Senate who have more experience than \nI as a national legislator, but I have been here 22 years. I know how \nthe Senate operates. I know how it used to operate.\n  The way it operates today is not pleasant, I am sorry to say. There \nis no reason we cannot be real legislators, take these amendments and \nwork through them. I am convinced this is not the right way to \nlegislate.\n  I have the greatest respect for the majority leader. He is a fine \nman. He is a humanitarian, as shown by his chosen profession. He is a \nreal medical expert. He is an organ transplant specialist. And he has, \nin his capacity as a Senator, gone to countries where there is a \nshortage of doctors, and he does work that he is overqualified for but \nthat is badly needed, doing hernias and other types of surgery.\n  So I do not say this in any way to take away from the dignity of his \njob. I do not want, in any way, to demean him personally. But I am just \nsaying, the Senate is not being handled right. I do not know if it is \nbecause of the advice he is getting from his other Senators or what the \nreason is. Maybe he is getting advice from the White House. I do not \nknow. But we should be moving through these pieces of legislation.\n  For example, the FSC bill, this very important tax bill, Senator \nHarkin offered an amendment on overtime. Why did he offer this \namendment on overtime? Because we believe--and we have substantive \nfacts to back us up--that 8 million people, because of actions taken by \nthis administration, will no longer be entitled to overtime pay.\n  Who are these people? They are firemen; they are police officers; \nthey are nurses. If someone disagrees with us, let them come and oppose \nthe Harkin amendment in the light of day and say I don't like the \nHarkin amendment for this reason or this reason or this reason. And \nthen let's vote on it.\n  Senator Harkin has said, on many occasions, he will take a very short \ntime agreement on the amendment. What does that mean? It means he would \ntake 15 minutes. The majority could have 15 minutes. Let's have a vote \non the amendment.\n  This amendment passed before. It passed the Senate last October. The \nHouse instructed its conferees to do exactly what the Senate did. But \nthat bill was not allowed to move forward because there was an effort \nmade--and successfully--not to vote on that overtime amendment.\n  So now we move to the reauthorization of the welfare bill, TANF. \nSenators Boxer and Kennedy offered an amendment dealing with minimum \nwage. Certainly, on a welfare bill that is an amendment that seems to \nhave some bearing. We want to do what we can. I have supported the \nwelfare-to-work programs we have had going. But one of the things we \nhave to do is make sure these people moving off welfare and on to work \ncan earn a living.\n  As we have established on the Senate floor, quite clearly, minimum \nwage jobs are not jobs that are set aside for kids from high school to \nflip hamburgers or for old Americans who are in a state of \nsemiretirement and need a little extra work. No. Sixty percent of the \nminimum wage jobs are held by women. And for the majority of those \nwomen, that is the only money they get for them and their families.\n\n  We want to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour. If someone \nopposes, let's have a debate on whether we should raise the minimum \nwage. But, no, we are not allowed to vote on that issue. There have \nbeen some complaints that, well, there are other amendments. We will \ngive you a vote on that maybe, but we have to have an agreement on the \nother amendments.\n  Why can't we legislate the way we used to? Just work our way through \nthese amendments and produce a tax bill and produce a welfare bill? It \nmight require we work a night or two. It might require we have votes on \nFriday and even Monday, but I do not understand why we are in this \nsituation. I do not think it is good for the institution. I know it is \nnot good for the American public.\n  We are not in control of the Senate. Because of the untimely death of \nPaul Wellstone, our margin dropped from 50 to 49. It would have been \n50-50 had he not been untimely killed in that plane crash. Now we are \nin the minority, 51-49. We understand that. We understand there will be \na day in the future when we will be in control, and we will want as \nmuch cooperation as we can get from the minority. I hope when we are in \nthe majority we will be treated to the sense that the Senate is the \nSenate, as it has been for more than 200 years, and we will work \nthrough these amendments.\n  We have been concerned--and I am happy to see the fact that in a bill \nearlier today the leader of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Conrad, agreed there would be a real \nconference where Democrats and Republicans sit down and try to work out \ndifferences between the bill. That is the way we need to do it.\n  There has been a pattern where Democrats are not even allowed into \nthe room at a conference. My limited amount of math shows me we are in \nthe minority. And when you have a conference, we are going to lose most \nof those votes anyway, but we are entitled to have a discussion in \nthose conference committees about ideas we have. Maybe if our ideas are \ngood enough, we can get somebody from the majority to agree with us and \nwe can win on some issues in those conferences.\n  I can't imagine why we are not doing a better job on moving these \npieces of legislation. I see my distinguished friend, the majority \nwhip, my counterpart. Maybe he is here with some good news that we are \ngoing to start moving some of this legislation. I hope that is the \ncase.\n  I want to be as constructive as I can to help work through this \nlegislation. But for the life of me, I cannot see why we can't vote on \novertime and on the minimum wage. It is good for the institution. It is \ngood for the country. We are willing to take our chances. If there are \nmore votes to defeat overtime and the minimum wage, that is OK. That is \nthe way things happen. But we think we can win both measures and move \npast this on to something else that is related.\n  I have heard discussions of the ranking member, Senator Baucus, who \nhas indicated some of the things we need to get done in the TANF bill. \nI have said on the Senate floor on a number of occasions, I don't know \nof two Senators, in leadership positions with committee assignments, \nwho get along better than the senior Senator from Iowa and the senior \nSenator from Montana. They work out their differences.\n  I am convinced there is ground to be made up here. We can still do \nthese two bills. We want both of them passed. Forty-nine Democrats want \nthe welfare bill to pass. We also want the tax bill we were on last \nweek to pass. We want these bills to pass, but we believe there are \nsome institutional issues that are important, and the American people \nare entitled to votes. I am not going to be drawing any overtime, but \nthere are\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\n8 million people who are entitled to a vote on overtime, whether the \nadministration should be able to take that away from them. There are \ntens of millions of people who are entitled to a minimum wage increase. \nWe need to do that.\n  Some States have gone ahead and said Congress is acting too slowly, \nand they have a minimum wage above ours right now. There is going to be \na ballot initiative in the State of Nevada this year--they have to get \nsome signatures, but I am sure they will get enough--to raise the \nminimum wage in Nevada to $6.15 an hour, a dollar more than what we do. \nThe people of the State of Nevada will vote on that in November. I \ndon't think they should have to vote on it. We should be doing our job. \nBut we are not able to do our job because we are being stopped from \ndoing this because we are in the minority.\n  We are going to continue exercising the rights we have. The Senate \nallows us to offer amendments. People can say: Why do you offer \namendments that have no bearing on what we are doing? I think everyone \nwould acknowledge that this overtime pay issue does have a bearing on \nwhat we do. It would be without any foundation in logic to say we don't \nhave a right on a welfare bill to offer a minimum wage amendment. We \nshould be able to do so.\n  I repeat--I want the record spread--we are not trying to stall. We \nbelieve passage of these two measures is extremely important. We want \nthem to pass. We have confidence in the two managers of the bill. But \nthe leadership of the majority has to allow us to move past where we \nare now because we are in a deadlock, and that is too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened carefully to my good friend \nfrom Nevada who is my counterpart on the Democratic side. I recall he \nsaid, just a few moments ago--I think this is a direct quote: ``Why \ncan't we legislate the way we used to?''\n  I say to my good friend from Nevada, I couldn't agree more. Why can't \nwe legislate the way we used to? I have been here a while. But you \nwouldn't have had to be here all that long to remember how we used to \nlegislate. Just as recently as a Congress ago, we didn't filibuster \njudges on the floor of the Senate. In fact, we hadn't done that for a \ncouple hundred years.\n  Just as recently as the previous Congress, we didn't prevent the \nlegislative process from going forward by prohibiting the appointment \nof conferees, but adhered to the normal legislative process, so that \ndifferences between legislation in the House and Senate can be \nreconciled and we can move forward.\n  I think we can stipulate the minority has always had a lot of power \nin the Senate, but never before has the minority insisted on writing \nlegislation for the majority--not just in the Senate but in the House \nas well. That is the practical effect of preventing a conference. It is \nthe minority of Senators saying: We won't allow the legislative process \nto go forward unless it is just the way we want it. Even though we are \na minority in one of the two bodies, we are going to dictate to the \nother body the content.\n  When my friend from Nevada criticizes the majority leader for the way \nhe is ``handling the Senate,'' he is pointing the finger in the wrong \ndirection. I say to my friends on the other side: You have met the \nenemy, and it is you.\n  I think I can safely speak for the majority when I say that we are \nperfectly happy to have votes on the Democratic Party outbasket items. \nBut, of course, one of the privileges each Member of the Senate has is \nto prevent a time certain for a vote. And that is used around here \nfrequently in order to make sure something else happens.\n  The something else the majority would like to have happen--and \ncertainly the majority leader would like to have happen--is the chance \nof finishing a piece of legislation, getting it to conference, \nresolving the differences, and sending it on down to the President for \nsignature. That is the way we used to legislate, I say to the Senator \nfrom Nevada, who was suggesting longingly that we ought to go back to \nthe way we used to legislate, as he put it. That is the way we used to \nlegislate.\n  Our position has been, as we have discussed this back and forth off \nthe floor, let's see a limitation on amendments that allows the \nminority the opportunity to have their vote, allows the majority an \nopportunity to have a similar vote on a similar subject, to work our \nway through the legislative process, and then a guarantee at the end \nthat there will be a conference allowed so the legislation we have \nspent time on has some chance of becoming law.\n  I can say to my friends on the other side, there is no chance--zero \nchance--that the majority in the House of Representatives is going to \nlet the minority in the Senate dictate to them the final content of \nlegislation that leaves the Senate. That is simply not going to happen.\n  I agree with my good friend from Nevada: Let's get back to \nlegislating the way we used to. Legislating the way we used to means a \nlimitation on amendments, amendments that are relevant certainly to the \nunderlying bill but not just those, even those that are not relevant, \nwith opportunities for the other side to offer their substitute ideas, \nand then a chance to get to the end of the process, to finally pass the \nbill, to get to conference, and to move along.\n  That is what the majority leader is looking for. We are going to \ncontinue our discussions, both on and off the floor, in the hopes that \nwe can reach agreements to move forward on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  The Welfare Reform Act of 1996 was a conspicuous success story, a \nbipartisan success story passed by a Republican Congress, signed by a \nDemocratic President, something all of us are proud of. It should be \nreauthorized. And the JOBS bill that had to be shelved last week \nbecause of an excessive number of amendments is something we know is \nextremely important to accomplish.\n  Levies have been put in place, a European tax on American \nmanufacturers, at 5 percent beginning March 1. Tomorrow, it goes up to \n6 percent, and then another percent each month until it is up to 17 \npercent--European taxes on American manufacturers, killing jobs here at \nhome when we are told that jobs is an important issue.\n  So we need to do business. We need to do welfare reform. We need to \nget back, as my good friend from Nevada said, to legislating the way we \nused to. I hope we can reach that point very shortly.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Steven J. Law\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a good friend, \nSteven J. Law, who is the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nLabor.\n  Deputy Secretary Law was nominated by the President and was confirmed \nby the Senate on December 9, 2003. Prior to holding his current \nposition, he served the President and Secretary Elaine L. Chao as Chief \nof Staff at the Department. In that position, Steven has played a \nfundamental role in crafting major administration initiatives, such as \nthe post 9/11 economic recovery plan, retirement security, and \nregulatory reform. Steven is valued as an asset to the Department, \ngreatly admired by his peers, and respected throughout the Washington \ncommunity.\n  Steven began his career in this city after graduating from the \nUniversity of California at Davis. From there, he went on to receive \nhis juris doctorate from Columbia University School of Law, where he \nwas named the Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar and graduated cum laude.\n  It was after those academic pursuits that our lives happily crossed \nwhen he began in my office as a legislative assistant. Displaying the \nhard work and talent he is well known for, Steven quickly advanced to \nChief of Staff shortly after successfully managing my 1990 reelection \ncampaign.\n  Steven didn't just make a big impression on me. He was recognized by \nRoll Call as one of the 50 most influential staffers on the Hill. \nEventually, he left my office to become executive director of the \nNational Republican Senatorial Committee during my chairmanship and \nhelped secure the Republican majority through both cycles. Over 4 \nyears, and through 2 tough election cycles, he has very skillful and \nprofessionally managed that operation in an extraordinarily able \nfashion.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Steven for the past 15 \nyears. I\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\nhave had the honor of calling him my friend and confidant during that \ntime as well.\n  Mr. President, it is easy to see why President Bush chose to nominate \nSteven to this high post. It is easy to see why my Elaine Chao, the \nSecretary of Labor, also exercised good judgment in giving this \ntalented man this opportunity. I applaud his confirmation and wish both \nSteven and his marvelous wife, Elizabeth, and their two beautiful \nchildren, Charlotte and John James, continued success in their future \nendeavors. Elaine and I have been blessed to be a part of their lives \nfor the last 15 years. This is truly a remarkable individual and a \nmagnificent public servant. I wish him well not only in his new job as \nDeputy Secretary of Labor, but in all of the endeavors he may undertake \nin the coming years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have an opportunity to, based on the \nstatement of the Senator from Kentucky, move some of this legislation. \nBut I cannot understand why, when we finish running one race, we have \nto immediately go to the other race. We need a little time to rest.\n  What I am saying about that is that we have on many occasions passed \nbills in the Senate and accomplished the desire of the people working \non that legislation by working things out with the House. We have done \nthat without using conference. We have done this simply in negotiating \nthe differences between the House and Senate. We have done it in the \n108th Congress; we did it 21 times then. In the 107th Congress, we did \nit 51 times.\n  I think before the end of this year, if we can get a few things done \non the floor, instead of 21 bills, we can get it up to maybe 40. We \nhave done it on very important things, such as AIDS assistance, TANF \nextension, military family tax relief, national flood insurance, Syria \naccountability, veterans benefits, the Defense Production Act, which \nare very important pieces of legislation. There have been some things \nwe have done with a conference. As some will recall, last year we had a \ndifficult situation with the fair credit reporting. But Senator Shelby \nand Senator Sarbanes decided that the best thing they could do would be \nto set a standard and the two leaders said, yes, we are willing to go \nto conference, we think we can do a good job. They did that. It became \nlaw.\n  We are one step ahead of where we should be. We want legislation \npassed in the Senate. When that is done, there are many ways to resolve \ndifferences with the House. We can do it in conference and there are \noccasions when we need to do that. Some may ask why we have balked at \nconferences. Very simply, for example, the overtime measure which \npassed here went to conference, and Democrats weren't even invited into \nthe room where the conference was held. A bill came back here and, of \ncourse, overtime was stripped from it, and we had a bill that did not \ngo through the conference process. They did not follow the Shelby-\nSarbanes model.\n  We are willing to work to get legislation passed. We have said we \nwant to do that, we want to work our way through these amendments. But \nto come here and say we will do it if you only have 4 amendments, the \nbest way to get these bills passed is to work on them. These bills \ndon't come magically. We have 49 of us here and 51 on the other side. \nWe all have ideas as to how the legislation could be improved. \nSometimes our ideas are good and sometimes they are bad. But individual \nSenators--there are two Senators from every State with the ability to \nget elected. We have wide interests we represent in our States. We have \nan obligation to allow them to offer amendments and move through this \nlegislation.\n  I am not an expert in parliamentary procedure in the Senate. I don't \nthink many people can claim that. I do understand a lot of the \nprocedures in the Senate, and I understand that the best way to do \nlegislation is to work through it. If you have an amendment you don't \nagree with, speak against it and vote against it. But don't stop others \nfrom having the opportunity to vote.\n  So, again, we are being told today, yes, we will let you have some \namendments, or we will let you have more than some, but if we do that, \nyou have to agree to go to conference. We are not going to do that. We \nare going to do everything we can to get a bill passed.\n  As I have indicated, Mr. President, in the 108th Congress, 21 times \nwe have been able to get legislation passed and sent to the President \nwithout a conference. We have negotiated our differences in the \nlanguage between the House and Senate. We can continue to do that. We \ndid it 51 times in 107th Congress. So as I said before, and I repeat, \nthere is no reason we should not legislate the way we always have in \ndays past: You introduce legislation, it goes to committee, comes to \nthe floor, we debate it, offer amendments, and vote on it. When that is \ndone, you figure out how you are going to work your way through the \ndifferences with the House.\n  We want to pass the tax bill that was in effect on the Senate floor \nlast week. I repeat, we want to pass this welfare bill. The only way we \ncan show that is by agreeing to work through these amendments. There is \nnot a single Senator who wants to filibuster this bill. We are not \ngoing to be stopped from offering these amendments, and we will hold \ntogether as a body and not allow cloture to be invoked tomorrow. It is \nnot fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized first.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          High Gasoline Prices\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today as consumers in America--\nbusinesses and farmers and families--are facing gasoline prices at a \nrecord high. Prices for natural gas, which is used to heat our homes \nand workplaces, have gone through the roof.\n  In fact, I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee, and we \nhad a hearing this week on the crisis we are facing, and that is our \nfarmers are having to pay twice as much as they did 6 months ago \nbecause of the skyrocketing costs of natural gas. And all of this is \ndue to the fact we have a lot of the far-left environmental groups \ntrying to keep us from being able to produce more oil and gas, and it \nis a crisis. It is a crisis, as we pointed out in this committee \nhearing. Unfortunately, due to obstructionist tactics led by the \nradical environmental groups, bipartisan energy policy legislation \ncontinues to just be out of grasp of passage in the Congress.\n  Yesterday, those who are against domestic energy production and in \nfavor of higher costing energy prices plaguing us today were given a \nboost by the presumptive Democrat for President who said in a speech in \nSan Diego, CA:\n\n       We need a new direction on energy policy.\n\n  And went on to lay blame for the high cost of gas on the Bush \nadministration, while attempting to put forth an energy plan of his \nown. Rather than advance a policy actually related to our Nation's \nenergy needs and supplies, the Senator consistently suggested policies \nthat would increase cost to consumers, that would consistently increase \ncost to businesses, that would consistently undermine our economy and \nforce high-paying manufacturing jobs overseas. We have seen this taking \nplace. It is taking place today. I heard our very eloquent junior \nSenator from Ohio talk about the number of jobs they have lost in the \nState of Ohio just for this reason.\n  His statements about the Bush administration are incorrect. One of \nthe first proposals the Bush administration made was a comprehensive \nenergy plan in 2001 that would increase domestic energy supplies and \nmake America less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\n  Congress took up legislation and incorporated many aspects of the \nPresident's plan, and I note that the Senator who finds it easier to \ncriticize than do was nowhere to be found when the bipartisan Energy \nbill, H.R. 6, was debated and passed by the Senate by a vote of 84 to \n14 on July 13, 2003.\n  It intrigues me that this issue is important enough for the Member to \ntake time to discuss it out of his busy campaign schedule, but not \nimportant enough for him to be present and vote on the bipartisan \nlegislation that was brought before this body. In fact, to my\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\nrecollection, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, prior to \nyesterday, never once proposed comprehensive energy legislation during \nhis 19 years in the Senate.\n  What we heard from San Diego yesterday was really less of an energy \npolicy for the Nation and more of a checklist of how to increase energy \ncosts to consumers. I am not surprised at that fact since it is clear \nfrom his voting record over the last many Congresses that affordable \ndomestically produced energy was far from a priority of the Senator. \nHis claim yesterday to aggressively develop domestic oil and gas \nsupplies does not seem genuine to me as he has no specific plan to do \nso and has spent a lot of his time stopping us and this country from \nbeing able to explore such areas as ANWR and offshore that would allow \nus to be energy independent.\n  Let me be perfectly fair. This goes back a number of years. I can \nremember even back during the Reagan administration making talks about \nthe fact at that time we were 35 percent dependent on foreign countries \nfor our ability to fight a war. And yet now it is closer to 60 percent. \nSo there we are only 2,000 acres of ANWR's Coastal Plain, about the \nsize of Dulles Airport, for oil exploration and development; 2,000 \nacres that could provide the United States with enough oil to replace \nimports from Saudi Arabia for the next 30 years.\n\n  But actually, as the junior Senator from Massachusetts proposes to \nsolve the energy crisis, for one he is going against his own advice and \nnow calling for President Bush to open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \na move that would threaten our national security without any benefit.\n  We know from recent history that releasing oil from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve would have no impact on gasoline prices. On September \n22, 2000, former President Clinton released 30 million barrels of oil \nfrom our strategic stockpiles. The effect, according to Energy \nInformation Administration, was 1 penny savings per gallon of gasoline. \nSo that does not work. It makes good conversation, it sounds good, but \nwe know it does not work, and he knows it, too.\n  During that time, the junior Senator from Massachusetts stated \nhimself that a release is not relevant. It would take months for the \noil to get to the market, he said. Now he has flip-flopped and it is \nthe cornerstone of an energy plan more about politics than meeting the \nreal needs for American families and businesses.\n  Even experts such as the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, \nformer Carter Energy Secretary James Schlesinger, and other top energy \nofficials have warned for years that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nshould not be used as a market management scheme. It is there for \nnational security. I think we all understand that.\n  Further, it is important to note while we have a Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, we do not release our strategically held resources to fit \npolitical whims but should only do it to address a major supply \ndisruption, such as political instability from a source nation, which \nis highly likely, and I think we understand that situation. The \nrelative instability of supply nations is well known. Our Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve is our Nation's buffer, a safety net. The junior \nSenator from Massachusetts would have us squander our Nation's \nstrategic reserves for his political gain, forcing our country into a \nfar weaker position.\n  The presumptive Democrat nominee's call to release oil from our \nstrategic reserves is also surprising to me because what he is really \ncalling for is to increase our domestic supplies. Experts agree that \none of the principal reasons that our Nation was able to weather the \noil embargo of the 1970s was largely because new supplies were coming \nonline from Prudhoe Bay, AK. Yet, as I said before, the Senator \nstaunchly opposes developing oil from the Alaska National Wildlife \nReserve. The policy of the junior Senator from Massachusetts seems to \nbe: Let us use our strategic reserves but not have any more oil to \nreplenish them.\n  The Senator is also quick to praise himself for his foreign policy \nexperience. Yet that experience must not have translated to the energy \nsector. Oil is a global commodity; therefore, the world market must be \nconsidered. What has happened in the global market? China's increased \ndemand for oil has constrained world oil supplies which have only been \nexacerbated by OPEC's recent reduction restrictions.\n\n  We should also note that another key component of the Senator's plan \nto address our Nation's high gasoline prices is for the administration \nto get tough with or jawbone OPEC, the implication being that President \nBush is not advocating America's interest, that he is too soft.\n  The foreign policy of the junior Senator from Massachusetts is \ninteresting on this point. On one hand he criticized the President for \nnot kowtowing to the United Nations and countries such as France in the \nwar on terrorism and on the other hand suggests that the administration \nis too soft on oil-producing nations. You cannot have it both ways.\n  In addition, the Senator has been a supporter of drastic climate \nchange legislation that would cripple our economy and legislation that \nwould literally shut down powerplants in the United States, the outcome \nof which would send hundreds of thousands of American jobs overseas and \nseriously stress our supply of energy.\n  It was the Wharton Econometrics Survey that came out with the \nconclusion that if we signed on to the Kyoto Treaty, it would cost 1.4 \nmillion jobs--that is what we are talking about today: jobs--it would \ndouble the price of energy, it would cost an increase of 65 cents a \ngallon on gasoline, and it would cost the average family of four $2,700 \na year. That is not Jim Inhofe talking; that is what came from the \nWharton School of Economics.\n  In addition, the Senator has been a supporter of drastic climate \nchange legislation that we have talked about that would be disastrous \nfor this country. Again, since the Senator has not developed an energy \npolicy before and failed to show up for the Energy bill vote, I must \nlook to his words and not his actions to determine what is the intent \nof his energy policy.\n  The Senator's recommended energy and environmental policy seems to be \ntainted with an overriding intent to impose his utopian view of the \nfuture without any consideration on present reality at any cost. The \njunior Senator from Massachusetts makes nonhydropower renewable energy \na cornerstone of his energy policy. Again, however, we must look to the \nSenator's words on the matter and not his deeds.\n  Last year's energy bill renewed a tax credit for wind and solar \nenergy, a credit that expired on December 31. The Senator failed to \nshow up for the crucial vote and the tax credit died. Prior to that \nvote, Randall Swisher of the American Wind Energy Association said: If \nthe energy bill dies, extension of the wind production tax credit will \nalso die for any time in the foreseeable future.\n  Swisher and many in the industry contend the credit is essential to \nmaintaining their businesses. He said:\n\n       If we weren't in the bill, the credit that is the \n     foundation of our industry was going to expire and with it \n     our industry would expire.\n\n  So, yes, it was important for them to see the energy bill move \nforward. President Bush recognizes the valuable contribution renewables \ncan play in our Nation's energy mix. The President dedicated $1.7 \nbillion over 5 years to develop hydrogen fuel cells and related \ntechnologies. In 2005, in his budget, it includes $228 million for a \nhydrogen fuel initiative, an increase of $69 million, or 43 percent, \nover the 2004 funding to develop the technologies to produce, store, \nand distribute hydrogen for the use of fuel cell vehicles, electricity \ngeneration, and other applications.\n  The 2005 budget proposes tax incentives totaling $4.1 billion through \n2009 to spur the use of clean, renewable energy and energy-efficient \ntechnologies.\n  President Bush's plan invests in the future. He wisely recognizes \nnonhydropower renewable energy represents only about 1 percent of our \nNation's energy mix.\n  The Senator, on the other hand, would mandate 20 percent of our \nNation's electricity be generated with those very same renewable \nsources by 2020.\n  In 2003, DOE's Energy Information Administration concluded a 10-\npercent mandate could cost Americans more than $100 billion. However, \nthe effect would likely be far more severe in certain regions of the \ncountry where ``not\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nin my backyard'' and the risks seem to drive policy without regard to \nfixed and low-income residents.\n  The fact is wind energy, the most cost-effective renewable, is only \neffective when the wind blows. We already know where the rich elite \nstand on developing wind turbines off the coast of Cape Code in the \nSenator's home State of Massachusetts.\n  The presumptive Democrat nominee also supports legislation that would \ncap carbon dioxide under pollution-reducing bills as well as under the \nauspices of global climate change. Again, the Senator seeks to impose \nhis utopian world view on people without bothering to consider our \nNation's energy makeup, or more likely he is but does not seem to care.\n  Drastic carbon dioxide reduction strategies the Senator supports \nwould effectively force coal out of use. I think we all understand \nthat. Coal right now, whether the junior Senator from Massachusetts and \nhis special interest radical supporters like it or not, makes up one-\nquarter of our country's energy mix.\n\n  Recently, it has been reported the junior Senator from Massachusetts \nsupported a 50-cent per gallon tax on gasoline. The effects of such a \ntax on our country are obvious. However, I think it is important to \nnote such a tax is another example of the Senator's overriding \nopposition to fossil fuels and his blind and unwavering support for \nnonhydropower renewables without regard to the state of our Nation's \nactual energy mix.\n  Nonhydropower renewable energy is a wonderful concept and with the \nadministration's investments in developing technology, I am confident \nits use will increase considerably. However, today it is too costly, \nwhich leads me back to the Senator's overriding intent behind his \nsuggested energy policies.\n  The presumptive Democrat nominee and his radical environmental group \nsupporters also recognize renewables are not cost competitive compared \nwith traditional energy sources today. Their answer: Embark on a \nstrategy to make fossil fuel use so expensive and burdened with \nregulations that nonhydropower renewables suddenly become more cost \neffective by comparison.\n  Let's recap a few of the highlights of the recommendations of the \njunior Senator from Massachusetts. No. 1, empty the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. No. 2, do not produce domestic oil. No. 3, impose a tax on \ngasoline, some 50 cents a gallon. No. 4, impose a mandate increasing \nnonhydropower renewable energies from 1 percent to 20 percent in 15 \nyears. No. 5, restrict carbon dioxide emissions, which translates to \nreducing U.S. economic production.\n  The Senator's energy policy is certainly bold, if nothing else. It is \njust that the Senator's utopian view of the future ignores our very \nreal present.\n  Like his radical special interest supporters, the Senator's energy \npolicies would increase costs on American consumers, disproportionately \naffect the low and fixed-income taxpayers, and drastically undermine \nthe ability to compete in the global market.\n  If this were not a Presidential election year and we were asked to \njudge a man not on his words but on his actions, we would in large \nmeasure know what the Senator's energy policy would be: Do nothing but \nmake speeches.\n  Some may scoff at what I am saying. We all know the Senator was too \nbusy campaigning to do the job his constituents elected him to do and \nthe job American taxpayers have paid him to do. Instead of actually \ndoing some work and crafting an energy policy, the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts chooses to make outrageous allegations from the comfort \nof multimillion-dollar mansions in Beverly Hills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I had not expected to hear the kind of \nstatement with regard to the criticism of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, my colleague and friend John Kerry, on the energy \npolicy. I will include in my comments a response to Senator Inhofe.\n  I am wondering whether the Senator could possibly tell us what was \nthe position of the President of the United States when OPEC continued \nto cut back on production today. We have a statement by a colleague \ntalking about a candidate for the President of the United States when \ntoday OPEC primarily--\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I was asked a question, and I would like \nto answer the question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, I do not yield.\n  We have today more than 150,000 servicemen who are over there \nprotecting the oil countries in the Middle East, and American service \nmen and women are dying every single day. If we have a President of the \nUnited States who is lacking in sufficient influence to try and \nindicate to our allies that it is of vital importance to the security \nof the families and industry in the United States that they increase \ntheir production, what kind of influence do we have? Where is our \nPresident of the United States on this issue? Why are we hearing \nMembers who are so eager to talk about John Kerry's policy on energy \ntalking about what we ought to be doing over there today as OPEC is \ncutting back on its production?\n  We hear silence. We have silence about that. Where is the \nadministration?\n  I remember last week we had my good friend Spencer Abraham, who is \nthe Secretary of Energy, and I asked him the question whether this \nPresident was going to try and persuade the oil-producing countries in \nthe Middle East to produce more energy, particularly at a time when we \nare faced with difficult economic significance. His answer was: This \nadministration is not going to beg for oil.\n  Beg for oil? When we have 140,000 men and women over there protecting \ntheir interests and protecting their oil and they are cutting back \nproduction?\n  I would not think there would be many Members of the Senate who would \nbe criticizing my colleague, who has done so, who recognize that their \nPresident should provide Presidential leadership. This election is \nabout Presidential leadership. My colleague has been demanding that \nthis President do something about the cutbacks in production.\n  We hear criticism--well, he didn't show up for a vote. Sure, he is \nrunning for the Presidency of the United States.\n  I will certainly respond to my colleague, but I am absolutely baffled \nthat one of the major energy decisions being made in the world is being \nmade within the last 24 hours by the OPEC countries, the primary \nproducers, Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, other middle eastern \ncountries whose security American servicemen have been fighting for and \ndying for, and this President and this administration has not \nsufficient influence to be able to stop them from cutting back in \nproduction or getting them to increase production. You talk about a \nbankrupt energy policy--there it is.\n  Every consumer ought to know when they pay those extra funds for the \ngasoline, they are paying it directly to countries over there in the \nMiddle East whose security we are protecting and for which American \nlives are being lost. It is beyond belief to me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2945\n\n  Madam President, we have, over the course of the day, had a number of \nour colleagues speak about the amendment that is before us, and that is \nthe increase in the minimum wage over a 2-year period, up to $7 an \nhour. I want to wrap up this evening and summarize a couple of \nimportant points because during the course of the afternoon, I followed \nthe debate when I wasn't here for a few hours, meeting with the head of \nthe VA about some of the challenges we are facing up in Massachusetts \nabout veterans health.\n  We heard statements, speeches from some of our colleagues on the \nother side, that the increase in the minimum wage was delaying action \non the TANF reauthorization. Of course nothing could be further from \nthe truth. As Senator Boxer, my friend and colleague who introduced the \nlegislation, and I have stated, we would have been willing to have a \n20-minute time agreement, 10 minutes a side, and had a vote and final \ndisposition and then moved ahead with other amendments.\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\n  But the opposition is so strong in opposition to this amendment that \nthe Republican leadership has insisted we have, effectively, a cloture \nvote, delaying progress on the underlying bill for some 2\\1/2\\ days, so \nif they are successful in getting cloture, cutting off the debate, they \nwill eliminate the possibility of even voting on an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  Maybe there are those who are opposed to the increase in the minimum \nwage. We have heard some of them speak today in opposition. But the \nidea that this is not related and relevant to the underlying bill \ndefies any logic and any fair understanding of what the underlying \nbill, the TANF bill, is all about.\n  I bring to their attention the statement that was made by Secretary \nThompson regarding the TANF reauthorization when he testified on March \n6, 2002. He said:\n\n       This administration recognizes the only way to escape \n     poverty is through work, and that is why we have made work \n     and jobs that will pay at least the minimum wage the \n     centerpiece of the reauthorization proposal for the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Family Program.\n\n  That will pay at least the minimum wage. There it is in the words of \nthe President's own representative. That is exactly the issue we are \nattempting to address and we are being denied getting final action on \nit.\n  I am going to take a moment to review for the benefit of the Senate \nabout where the minimum wage is now. The purchasing power of the \nminimum wage has dramatically decreased.\n  We reviewed with the Senate what the impact of the increase in the \nminimum wage has been on unemployment and have shown many times when we \nhave had increase in the minium wage it had virtually no adverse impact \non the question of unemployment. We reviewed the fact if we have the \nincrease in the minimum wage it virtually has no impact on the issue of \ninflation. We responded to the question of different conditions and \ndifferent parts of the country. There are small mom-and-pop stores that \nwould not be able to afford the increase in the minimum wage. We \nresponded and pointed out those stores by and large are excluded under \nthe provisions of the existing minimum wage.\n  We heard: We don't want to do this because we want to encourage young \npeople to work in agriculture. We responded: It doesn't relate to \nagricultural workers.\n  We have addressed all of these kinds of conditions.\n  These minimum wage workers are men and women of dignity. They work \nhard and long. The men and women who clean out the buildings in this \ncountry at nighttime, teachers' aides, and assistants working in homes \nlooking after the elderly are men and women of dignity. They do not \nwant any assistance. They want to have a wage so they can provide for \nthemselves and their children and their families.\n  I want to reiterate and give some examples. I gave some examples \nearlier. These are the real faces of people who are going to be \naffected by what we do here tomorrow on the floor of the Senate, \nwhether we are going to be able to get a vote on the increase in the \nminimum wage or whether we are going to be denied that opportunity to \ndo so.\n  The minimum wage affects a person such as Cynthia Porter.\n\n       Cynthia Porter is not on welfare. She works as a certified \n     nursing assistant at a nursing home in Marian, Alabama. When \n     Cynthia comes on duty at 11:00 p.m., she makes rounds. She \n     checks the residents for skin tears and helps them go to the \n     toilet or use a bedpan. She has to make sure she turns the \n     residents every two hours or they will get bedsores, and if \n     bedsores are left unattended, they can get so bad that you \n     can put your fist in them.\n       But there aren't enough people on her shift. Often there \n     are only two nursing assistants for forty-five residents. In \n     addition to responding to the needs of the residents, Cynthia \n     must also wash the wheelchairs, clean up the dining rooms, \n     mop the floors and scrub out the refrigerator, drawers, and \n     closets during her shift. Before she leaves, she helps the \n     residents get dressed for breakfast.\n       For all of this, Cynthia makes $350 every two weeks. She is \n     separated from her husband, who gives her no child support. \n     The first two weeks each month she pays her $150 rent. The \n     next two weeks, she pays her water and her electric bills. It \n     is difficult to afford Clorox or shampoo. Ensuring that her \n     children are fed properly is a stretch, and she is still \n     paying off the bicycles she bought for her children last \n     Christmas.\n       She can't afford a car, so she ends up paying someone to \n     drive her the twenty-five miles to work. And there have been \n     a few days when she couldn't find a ride. ``I walked at \n     twelve o'clock at night,'' she said. ``I'd rather walk and be \n     a little late than call in. I'd rather make the effort. I \n     couldn't just sit here. I don't want to miss a day, \n     otherwise, I might be fired.'' There is no public \n     transportation that would take her to work.\n       I first met Cynthia at a union meeting. She had a quiet, \n     dignified presence with her dark suit and her hair pulled \n     back in a bun. She and twenty-five others from the nursing \n     home--all eighty of her coworkers are African American women \n     like her--gathered in the little brick Masonic building \n     outside of Marian to talk about having a union. Like Cynthia, \n     none has ever gotten a raise of more than 13 cents. Some who \n     had been there ten years were still making $6.00 an hour.\n\n  She is effectively a minimum wage worker.\n  These are the people this legislation is trying to help.\n  Linda Stevens:\n\n       The only job she could find with a high school degree and \n     some college courses was a part-time cashier's position at a \n     small market called George and Stanley's, working the night \n     shift from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Not surprisingly, the \n     $5.00 an hour she made at her retail job was not enough to \n     support her and her daughter, so she worked a second job from \n     2:00 to 5:00 p.m. as a receptionist at H Block, which paid \n     $5.50 an hour. She liked the work and would have preferred to \n     go full-time, but H Block only offered work from January \n     through April. The money from these two part-time jobs still \n     did not cover her bills, so she worked as a lunch supervisor \n     for the Flint public schools from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. She \n     had to put planners up on the wall to keep track of her \n     schedule. And even then, she had no benefits.\n       After a year, Linda left her job at George and Stanley's \n     after they refused to give her a 25 cent raise and went to \n     work at Kessell's on the day shift for $5.25 an hour. But \n     Kessell (which has since been purchased by Kroger) would only \n     give her a part-time position and without full-time status, \n     she still did not get benefits. Working three jobs became so \n     exhausting that she left her lunch supervisor position, but \n     had to continue to work her second job at H Block.\n       Linda's typical day started at 6:00 a.m. when she got her \n     daughter ready for school. Her job at Kessell started at 7:00 \n     a.m. and ended at 3:00 p.m. She came home, changed, and went \n     to her job at H Block at 5:00 p.m. and got off at 10:00 \n     p.m. Her schedule left little time to spend with her \n     daughter.\n\n  She needs a minimum wage to help that family.\n  Flor Segunda of Newark, NJ:\n\n       Flor lives in a primarily African-American neighborhood of \n     Newark, New Jersey, with her husband and three children: \n     Jose, who is nine years old; Luis, who is two and a half; and \n     Paul, who is one and a half. To reach Flor's place, you must \n     walk down a flight of concrete stairs, through a narrow hall, \n     and past the washer and dryer. Like most basement apartments, \n     it is damp and dark. One small window allows the only \n     daylight to enter. They pay $700 per month for this two-\n     bedroom apartment without utilities. There are no parks near \n     her apartment and she doesn't have a car. So most days, the \n     children stay inside.\n       At night when most workers are at home, Flor begins her \n     day. She cleans, dusts, vacuums, dumps trash, and straightens \n     the offices of law firms in a large suburban office building \n     in West Orange, New Jersey. Flor is a janitor. She works for \n     a private contractor who contracts with the owners of \n     commercial buildings to provide cleaning services.\n\n  She would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Finally, Judy Smithfield:\n\n       Judy Smithfield works in a superstore as a pharmacy \n     technical assistant, a ``pharmacy tech.'' Her 12:00-9:00 p.m. \n     shift begins with a call from a nurse in a doctor's office \n     dictating a prescription over the phone or a customer at the \n     counter giving her a prescription. Once she has the \n     information, she gives it to the pharmacist to process in the \n     computer. Then it is Judy's responsibility to check that \n     information and get the proper medication from the shelf. She \n     counts the pills that are prescribed, puts them into the \n     bottle, affixes the proper label to the medication, gives the \n     filled prescription to the pharmacist for her review, and \n     puts it in the proper bin for the customer to pick up.\n       Once the customer arrives, Judy must ensure that she has \n     the right prescription and that the proper forms are filled \n     out. She must ask the customer whether they understand the \n     prescription, whether they want counseling or have any \n     further questions. Their response must be put in writing.\n       There are two pharmacy techs and three pharmacists on \n     Judy's shift that fill over 400 prescriptions per day. If the \n     pharmacy gets behind in the prescriptions, Judy stays late, \n     sometimes until midnight. Many times she works six days a \n     week because they don't have enough help. Her feet and back \n     ache from standing all day.\n  This will help Judy.\n  I want to conclude again by talking about the impact of the minimum \nwage\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\nand the failure of increasing the minimum wage on families, \nparticularly on children.\n  I pointed out earlier we have 35 million Americans, according to the \nDepartment of Agriculture, who are hungry or living on the edge of \nhunger for economic reasons--35 million in a country of 290 million.\n  Today 300,000 more families are hungry than there were 3 years ago. \nThe 2003 survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors that looked at hunger \nfound effectively 39 percent of the adults requesting food assistance \nwere employed. A leading cause of hunger is low-paying jobs.\n  Emergency food assistance increased by 14 percent. Of those \nrequesting emergency food assistance, 59 percent were members of \nfamilies with children and elderly parents.\n  City officials recommend raising of the Federal minimum wage as the \nway the Federal Government could alleviate hunger.\n  This is their No. 1 recommendation. This is the survey of the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, Republican and Democrat alike, for raising the \nminimum wage.\n  Finally, I have the excellent report of the National Urban League, \nOctober 2002. I will read just parts of it. In the foreword, it says:\n\n       Too often, changes in the minimum wage are viewed as poorly \n     targeted to the needs of America's working families. Minimum \n     wage workers are too often presented as teenagers, or wives \n     in middle class families. Yet, the clear implications of this \n     study are that the proposed increase in the minimum wage from \n     $5.15 to $6.65 an hour would move 1.4 million American \n     households to the level of being food secure, having enough \n     money to buy nutritious and safe food for their families. \n     And, a disproportionate share of the households that would \n     benefit would be African American or Hispanic. Single parent \n     households would also benefit disproportionately from an \n     increase in the minimum wage.\n\n  Again raising the minimum wage is a clear policy solution for helping \nmeet the needs of America's poor children.\n  Then it goes on in the executive summary:\n\n       Second, we show that increases in the minimum wage raised \n     the food security of households in which the householder, \n     principal person in the household, has no more than a high \n     school diploma or is a single parent or both. The increases \n     in the minimum wage lessened hunger in all households, but \n     particularly in low-income households and in those households \n     in which the householder was less educated, African-American, \n     Hispanic or was a single parent.\n\n  Finally, I will include in the Record the findings. These are briefly \nthe findings.\n\n       We find that:\n       (1) Increases in the Federal minimum wage to $4.25 in \n     October of 1996 and $5.15 per hour in September 1997--\n\n  That was 7 years ago--\n\n       reduced hunger among all households and in particular, in \n     low-income households where individuals had completed no more \n     than a high school degree. . . . Hunger is defined as a \n     psychological condition where household members experience an \n     uneasy or painful sensation caused by the involuntary lack of \n     food.\n       (2) Relative to the general population, food security rates \n     are lower among households in which the householder has no \n     more than a high school degree. . . .\n       (3) A direct relationship between food security and \n     increases in the minimum wage was observed following two \n     modest increases in the minimum wage in 1996 and 1997--when \n     food security rates increased slightly; and following \n     administration of the Food Security Supplement . . . of 1995. \n     Food security rates also increased modestly following 1995. . \n     . .\n       (4) Inner city households have the highest levels of food \n     insecurity, followed by suburban and rural households. Other \n     studies have demonstrated that groups most-at-risk for food \n     insecurity are those who are most economically vulnerable, \n     and whose households are most directly impacted by increases \n     in the minimum wage.\n\n  The failure of our increase in the minimum wage is wrong because \nAmericans believe people who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, \nshould not have to live in poverty in the United States of America. And \nit is wrong because we now have millions of children who are going \nhungry every night, and millions of families who are going hungry as \nwell.\n  We can make some difference by increasing the minimum wage. It is now \nat a dramatically decreased level of purchasing power. Certainly, we \ncan do better. We should do better. How can we possibly tolerate the \nconditions of our fellow Americans and not say that we need an increase \nin the minimum wage? I hope we will be able to do so tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to rise in \nsupport of the amendment offered by Senators Kennedy and Boxer to raise \nthe minimum wage over the next 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  My staff provided me with some information about the history of the \nminimum wage. One important date cited is 1968, which was my senior \nyear at Ohio State University. I had a couple of jobs then. I was the \npots-and-pans man at the Delta Gamma sorority house. I also had a part-\ntime job at the university bookstore. I was paid the minimum wage for \nboth jobs, which at the time was $1.60 per hour. If you adjust $1.60 \nfor inflation, then the minimum wage would presently be $8.50 per hour.\n  Senators Boxer and Kennedy propose that we gradually raise the \nminimum wage over the next 2\\1/2\\ years. They recommend raising it from \nthe current level of $5.15 per hour to $5.85 in the next 60 days, from \n$5.85 to $6.45 a year later, and finally from $6.45 to $7 the following \nyear.\n  Some have said that such an increase goes too far, too fast, and have \nsuggested that we take a different approach. However, we should do some \nmath on the decline of the real value of the minimum wage. The current \nminimum wage has been $5.15 per hour since 1997. If you adjust $5.15 \nfor inflation, then we would have a minimum wage of $5.95 per hour. \nBut, if you adjust the minimum wage for inflation from its 1968 level \nof $1.60, then the minimum wage would presently be $8.50.\n  Senators Kennedy and Boxer are right in the middle between the two, \nand I would suggest to my colleagues that they are not far off the \nmark. In fact, their amendment is a pretty good compromise.\n  I know that some people do not want to raise the minimum wage, and \nthat they are concerned by the potential for job losses if we were to \ndo so. And some of our employers--both large and small--have expressed \nconcerns with an increase in the minimum wage and urge us to be mindful \nof those concerns.\n  Having said that, we also need to be mindful of minimum wage workers. \nSenator Kennedy shared with us some real-life examples. Let me share \nwith you some of my own experience from when I was a college student \nearning the minimum wage. A lot of people who received the minimum wage \nin 1968 were not supporting a family. I was not supporting a family in \n1968. Many of them were students or just out of school.\n  But a lot of the people who earn the minimum wage these days are \npeople with a family, with one child, or maybe two. They may be in a \ntwo-parent family. But in a lot of cases, a minimum wage earner is a \nsingle parent.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep this statistic in mind as we consider \nwhether to support an increase in the minimum wage. If you or I were \nworking full time, 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year, with no time \noff, then we would be making about $206 a week if we were paid the \nminimum wage. That is less than $11,000 per year.\n  Madam President, less than $11,000 per year does not crack the \npoverty line for one person, much less two or three.\n  As a Governor who worked on welfare reform in my state and with the \nNational Governors Association I understand what it takes in order for \npeople to move off of welfare. For people to move successfully from \nwelfare to work, four things have to happen: One, they have to have a \njob to go to; they have to have a way to get to the job; they have to \nget some help with their health care; and they need some help with \ntheir childcare. Those four things: a job, the ability to get to a job, \nhealth care, and childcare are critical.\n  The other thing people have to have when they get off of welfare for \nwork is the belief that they will be better off working than on \nwelfare.\n  In my own State of Delaware, we adopted comprehensive welfare reform \nin the mid-1990s and phased in an increase in the minimum wage. Today, \nthe minimum wage in Delaware is $6.15 per hour. We increased the \nminimum\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\nwage to help people move off of welfare. We wanted to make sure that \nthey were better off working than on welfare.\n  I ask people to understand, whether you happen to be from Delaware or \nMaine--where the Presiding Officer is from--or from any other State, to \ntry to make it these days on $11,000 per year, while trying to hold a \nfamily together. It is incredibly difficult to do so.\n  The other thing I want to say is on a more macro-issue with respect \nto welfare reform legislation currently on the Senate floor. We should \nbe able to pass welfare reform legislation. Both sides agree on about \n90 percent of the issues. For those issues that we do not agree on, we \nshould be able to reconcile our differences.\n  I believe that legislation I introduced with Senator Collins, the \nPresiding Officer, and with Senator Ben Nelson is a consensus bill on \nwelfare reform--we think it is a pretty good compromise from what has \nbeen reported out of the committee and has some of the changes that \nDemocrats would like to see. That bill is a good compromise.\n  On our side, we want to have an opportunity to offer relevant \namendments to legislation before the Senate. One amendment is an \nincrease in the minimum wage, which I think is relevant to this \nparticular bill. A second amendment is an extension in unemployment \ncompensation benefits. We should extend unemployment compensation \nbenefits until our economy is stronger and we have more jobs for people \nlooking to work.\n  Senator Harkin has an interest in offering an amendment on overtime \nregulations, which has already passed the House and the Senate. He is \ndetermined to make sure he has a chance to offer that again.\n  We are smart enough around here to be able to work with our \nRepublican colleagues to come up with an agreement that allows those \nthree amendments to be offered.\n  Once those amendments are offered, we should be able to offer other \nrelevant amendments to this welfare bill. I have a few amendments to \noffer, and I know others do as well. We should be able to agree on a \nreasonable number of amendments--it could be 10, 20. We could also \nagree to an amount of time on such amendments, for example, 10 minutes \nfor proponents of the amendment and 10 minutes for opponents of the \namendment. When the debate on an amendment is completed the Senate \nshould vote.\n  I would be very disappointed if we went along and, at the end of next \nweek, were not able to close our differences on welfare reform \nlegislation and the FSC bill.\n  The last thing I will mention has to do with conference committees. \nWhen the House passes one bill, and the Senate passes a different bill, \nwe end up, a lot of times, in a conference negotiation to resolve \ndifferences between the bills. And we, in the Democratic Party, have \nbeen stung because we have not been allowed to participate in these \nconferences.\n  We saw that happen with respect to the Energy bill, where Democrats \nwere not invited to participate. We saw it happen to a large extent in \nthe conference on the Medicare prescription drug bill, where, for the \nmost part, Democrats were not allowed to participate in conference \nnegotiations. We cannot allow that to continue. Democrats are not going \nto allow that to continue. Someday Democrats will be in the majority. \nSomeday our friends on the other side will be in the minority. I ask \nthem to keep that in mind because what is good for the goose is good \nfor the gander.\n  To the extent that we get closed out of conference committees without \nany active participation, the same thing could happen to them. I would \nnot want to do it to them, and I do not like having it done to us.\n  Part of this universal agreement in moving welfare reform and getting \nthe FSC bill onto the Senate floor is not just encouraging words about \nthe conference, but a good, hard, fast agreement that Democrats will be \nfull participants in a welfare reform conference with the House.\n  It is too bad that the presiding officer, Senator Collins, and I \ncannot work out these differences by ourselves. We would pass a bill \nthat we negotiated with Senator Nelson of Nebraska. It would be pretty \neasy.\n  I do not mean to minimize nor make light of the toughness of the \nsituation we face, but we can get this done. We need to get this done. \nWe are going to take a recess week sometime around Good Friday. I sure \nhope we can go home having passed welfare reform legislation through \nthe Senate, and to have made good progress on FSC legislation as well.\n  With respect to a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, we should \nbe able to get that done. It is the right and fair thing to do. We need \nto have an extension of unemployment compensation benefits. While we \nhave an official unemployment rate of about 5.6 percent, the rate is \nactually closer to 7.5 percent once you count all the people who have \nrun out of benefits or stopped looking for employment.\n  If we agree to those things, we ought to be able to get those bills \ndone and move on to the next step in welfare reform. Welfare reform is \na great experiment, made successful by our Nation's Governors. Members \nof the Senate know how to make it even more successful going forward.\n  It has been a pleasure to do business with the Presiding Officer and \nSenator Nelson on our side. I hope we can take some of the provisions \nin our bill and have an opportunity to offer them as an amendment to \nthe bill in the next day or two.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, the hour is getting late. I am going to \ntake a few minutes of the Senate's time to talk a little bit about \nwelfare reform. It is a subject that has been close to my heart for a \nlong time. I was a freshman in the House when I introduced, along with \nthen-Congressman Tim Hutchinson who subsequently served in this body, \nwhat we called the real welfare reform act.\n  The idea behind that bill was to stop talking about welfare reform in \nterms of whether we could save money or whether we could stop fraud in \nthe welfare system and start talking about what was really at stake, \nwhich was replacing a system that had punished work, that had \ndiscouraged marriage, that had torn down neighborhoods, and had mired \npeople in despair and replaced it with a system that encouraged work \nfor able-bodied people, required it in some cases, that supported \ncommunity-based solutions, and built up neighborhoods.\n  We talked about that bill for several years. Welfare reform gained \nsteam. There were some who opposed it the whole time, who fought a last \nditch effort on behalf of the status quo; a pretty lousy status quo it \nwas, too. But eventually we passed the bill by very large majorities in \nboth Houses. President Clinton signed it. There were predictions of \ndoom. It has turned out to be--I guess now by consensus--the most \nsuccessful legislation of the 1990s, and the most significant social \nreform passed in the last generation in this Congress. Now the \nextension of that bill, the new welfare reform bill, the attempt to \nextend the benefits of work and marriage to more and more people around \nthis country, is being filibustered.\n  That is not a new thing in this Senate. I made a quick list. We can't \napprove nominations for judges; that is being filibustered. The Energy \nbill was filibustered. The liability relief bill was filibustered. The \ntax break for manufacturers to try and keep manufacturing jobs in the \nUnited States was filibustered. Now welfare reform is being \nfilibustered in the name of passing a minimum wage increase.\n  Of course, there are varying opinions in the Senate and around the \ncountry about the minimum wage. I have supported it in the past, when \nit was linked to tax benefits or other kinds of support for small \nbusiness because whatever you think of it, it is a mandate on small \nbusiness. We ought to support small businesspeople, the ones who are \ncreating the jobs in the country, if we are asking them to increase \ntheir payments.\n  Whether you do or you do not support the minimum wage, though, it is \na terrible mistake to filibuster the welfare reform bill in the name of \npassing the minimum wage bill. As a matter of fact, my understanding is \nthe leadership has offered to take votes on that and several other \nmeasures that Senators on the other side want to offer, if\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\nwe can have some assurance the bill will pass, some assurance that \ngoing through these amendments that are not germane to the bill will \nallow us to pass the bill and then get to conference and finally pass \nthe bill and send it to the President. That does not seem to me to be \nan unreasonable request.\n  Why is it so important that we pass welfare reform? What has happened \nsince 1996? Mr. President, 3.6 million fewer Americans live in poverty \nnow; 2.9 million fewer children live in poverty. Child poverty is at \nits lowest rate. Kids are not as poor as they were. In June 2002, there \nwere 5 million welfare recipients, which was a 65-percent decrease from \nthe 1994 level. The poverty rate of single moms is the lowest rate in \nU.S. history. Even the out-of-wedlock birth rate has stabilized and \ngone down slightly since 1996.\n\n  I was at a press conference earlier today when a lady talked about \nthe effect of this on her life. Because of welfare reform, she is now \nworking and supporting her family. She talked about what it meant to \nher kids. The first day she came home from work with a paycheck, they \nwaited for her, and they wanted to go to the store and pay cash at the \ngrocery store instead of having to use food stamps. They were proud of \ntheir mother. There are stories such as this all over the country.\n  Now in the name of helping the poor, some Members are holding up the \nwelfare reform bill. There is an irony in that.\n  Let me talk a little bit about history. Poverty in the United States \nin the immediate postwar era was about 30 percent. It declined steadily \nfor 20 years until 1965; reached about 15 percent in 1965. And that is \nwhen the Federal Government declared war on poverty, which was a good \nthing. One of the frustrations about this whole experience is there is \na consensus. If we look beyond the politics of the 24-hour news cycle \nand look where the two great parties in this country have come from, \nwhat their mainstream beliefs are, there should be a consensus about \nwelfare reform. There is on final votes.\n  Liberals, in 1965, got the Federal Government aggressively in the \nbusiness of trying to do something about poverty. That was a good \nimpulse. What went wrong with it was that they did it in such a way \nthat showed a disrespect for the basic values that have always gotten \npeople out of poverty. The two best antipoverty programs, historically, \nin the United States, the way people get out of poverty have been work \nand marriage, family. They work and they marry somebody who works. They \nget out of poverty.\n  Poverty is not that unusual an experience for Americans. Most \nAmericans either grew up in poverty or they have a parent who grew up \nin poverty or at least a grandparent who grew up in poverty. That is \nhow they got out of poverty.\n  For 30 years, from 1965 to 1995, in the name of fighting poverty, the \nFederal Government conditioned assistance to poor people on them not \ndoing the two things that get people out of poverty. They offered a \npackage of benefits that, to somebody coming from a low-income \nbackground, looked like a lot of money--cash benefits, Medicaid, \nhousing subsidies, food stamps--but only on the condition they not get \na job, they not get married, and they have children anyway. That is how \nwe ran the welfare system for 30 years.\n  The poverty rate, which was 15 percent in 1965, 30 years later was 15 \npercent. But it was intractable poverty because if you are 18 or 19 \nyears old, you have a child without being married, you don't have your \neducation yet, a couple years later you realize it is hard now to climb \nthe ladder. It is hard now to realize the American dream.\n  Well, we fixed that in 1996. We introduced a system where if you are \nable bodied, we are going to help you work. There is a constellation of \nbenefits and supports in the bill to enable you to work. The other day, \nwe passed an amendment increasing daycare in this bill. I supported \nthat to enable people to work.\n  The bill extends the benefits of work to more people and makes sure \nthat the States around this country have to keep trying to help people \nget off welfare and into self-sufficiency. We should define success not \nby how many people we get on the welfare rolls, but by how many we get \noff. We can open opportunities for millions of people who currently \ndon't have it.\n  The bill contains a provision I strongly support. It was in a measure \nI had introduced, establishing a promarriage program. In 1996, we \ntalked a lot about reducing the out-of-wedlock birth rate. That was a \ngood thing to do. We wanted kids to have dads. I am glad we introduced \nthat subject. In a sense, we were fighting the darkness by talking \nabout what we were against. The bill we are debating today lights a \ncandle. You cannot just fight the darkness; you have to let in the \nlight.\n  There is a $300 million grant program here, encouraging the States to \ngo to people when they apply for welfare and talk to them about the \nbenefits of healthy marriage. The surveys show that a majority of folks \napplying for welfare--or many of them--are living with the partner with \nwhom they are having a child. Many of them, if not most, are thinking \nabout marriage. There may be many reasons in their minds why they don't \nwant to do it. Maybe their parents had bad experiences. Maybe they are \nnot certain about the partner. Maybe they have fights and they don't \nknow how to resolve that. What an opportunity we have at that point--\nand often through community-based organizations that have grown up in \nthe last 10 years--to approach them and say, here are the benefits to \nyour children of being married, if you can do it in a healthy way. Here \nis how you can do it that way. We can help you learn how to resolve \ndisputes, help you learn how to build healthy relationships. That is in \nthis bill.\n  There are a lot of things in this bill we know will make a difference \nfor people because they have made a difference for the last 7 or 8 \nyears. It is being filibustered in the name of helping the poor.\n  Well, I don't really know what to say. It seems to me we ought to be \nable to come to some kind of an agreement here. I have been in meetings \nof Senators on this side of the aisle, when the Republican leaders have \nsaid, we are willing to give votes on some of these message amendments, \nbut we want some assurance that we are going to have an opportunity to \nvote on the bill in final passage after a reasonable period of debate, \nand then go to conference.\n  I know the Senate is different than other legislative bodies. I am \nnew here and it is an honor to be here. I have had the privilege of \nmeeting and working with people on both sides of the aisle that I read \nabout and saw on television for years, and they are an extremely able \ngroup of people. But most legislative bodies are about actually doing \nsomething. We have measures before us that I know, if we can get to \nfinal passage, would have substantial majorities--bipartisan \nmajorities. This is one of them. How come we cannot get there?\n  It is hard not to reach the conclusion that politics is being \nplayed--not politics in the broadest sense because actually that is \npart of what democracy is about, not laying forward an agenda, \npresenting it to people, and driving distinctions between you and the \npeople who disagree with you and getting support from the public so you \ncan move an agenda that makes a difference, but the politics of \ncontrolling or shifting the discussion from an issue focus groups say \ndoesn't help you on an issue, but the focus group says does help. I \ndon't think that politics works. Here we are holding up legislation on \nbehalf of--I am afraid to say it, but I think of politics that is not \neven very good politics and certainly will end up hurting a lot of \npeople.\n  I have worked on this subject for a long time. I have an underlying \nfaith that we are going to get our act together at some point and get \nthis done. I know too many people of good will in this body. I \nemphasize again how important this is to real people. I have been all \nover this country, all over my State of Missouri, and I have talked to \nso many people, recipients, people who work with welfare recipients, \nwho are excited about what has happened in the last 7 or 8 years as a \nresult of the passage of the 1996 bill. We did something good.\n  Work and marriage can make a difference for people. We can have a \nFederal Government that is aggressive in helping people in a way that \nis consistent with the great values upon\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nwhich we built this country. That is at stake with this bill.\n  I hope we can reach some kind of conclusion. I am certainly willing \nto vote on these other issues. I might have a few extraneous amendments \nI would not mind offering myself. But at the end of the day, we need to \nget this bill done, send it to the House, conference on it, and get it \nto the President. We can all be certain that when we do that, the bill \nwe produce is not going to be perfect in anybody's eyes, but it will be \na step down the road we took in 1996, which made a difference in the \ncountry to those who are the most powerless.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a couple of statements I wish \nto make. I appreciate the recognition from the Presiding Officer for \nthis purpose.\n  Earlier today, there were statements made on the floor, echoed by the \njunior Senator from Colorado, in which he claimed several times \nPresident Bush inherited a bad economy. I know my friends on the other \nside of the aisle genuinely want to believe that, but it is simply not \ntrue. That is not the fact.\n  The official arbiter of when recessions begin and end is the National \nBureau of Economic Research, NBER. Despite intense and inappropriate \npolitical pressure from the White House, the NBER continues to insist \nthe recession began in March of 2001, nearly 3 months after President \nBush took office. Facts are stubborn.\n  On a related note, the junior Senator from Texas was on the floor \nsome time ago with a poster that read: Most jobs ever. Perhaps he was \nreferring to India. He certainly could not be referring to the United \nStates.\n  Yesterday, we had another administration official--in this instance \nTreasury Secretary Snow--talking about how wonderful outsourcing is for \nour economy. Don't ask the people who are out of work, I can tell you \nthat, and don't ask their families.\n  This notion the U.S. economy is currently generating record numbers \nof jobs is thoroughly specious. It would be laughable if it were not so \npathetic. The claim is based on data selectively culled from something \ncalled the household survey. Economists from Alan Greenspan on down \ninsist the accurate measure of jobs gained and lost is the payroll \nsurvey. Even the President's own Council of Economic Advisers relies on \nthat which we call the payroll survey.\n  This is something I know something about. Before I came to the \nSenate, I was the chairman and CEO of a company called ADP, Automatic \nData Processing. It was a company I started with two other neighborhood \nfriends in the city of Paterson, NJ. The company was named in its \nearliest days Automatic Payroll. Later on, as we expanded our reach of \nservices, it was changed to Automatic Data Processing, ADP. For the \ninformation we are discussing here, it specialized, among other \nservices, in payroll processing--in other words, writing paychecks for \nclient companies that relied on us to compute their payrolls. Now, I \nknow a paycheck when I see one. ADP, the company I helped found and run \nfor many years, pays over 30 million people each and every pay period. \nApproximately 10 million of them are outside our boundaries in other \ncountries, but more than 20 million work in America and are paid right \nhere. So I know something about payroll structure.\n\n  Interestingly, one of our most distinguished board members was a \nfellow named Alan Greenspan, the Alan Greenspan who is now the Chairman \nof the Fed. He was on the ADP board. He was on the ADP board as a very \nvaluable director. He developed a service that was called the \n``econometrics'' plan. ADP, my company, the computer service company, \nwould deliver this service--they called it an online service--and we \nwould process the work we did for Alan Greenspan's company as well as \nfor clients, over 500,000 of them today, through cities and towns \nacross America.\n  When Alan Greenspan, the talented and credible Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, says use the payroll survey to get reliable data on \nhow many people have jobs and are getting paid that way, I think it has \nto be treated with great respect.\n  According again to the payroll survey--not the household survey. The \nhousehold survey is done in a different manner. They are both done by \nBLS, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but the payroll survey is the one \nthat tells the true story--they say the economy has lost more than 2 \nmillion jobs since George Bush took office, making him the first \nPresident since Herbert Hoover--and I said this before and I mean no \ndisrespect--and the Great Depression to preside over a net job loss \nduring his term in office. Again, I mean no personal disrespect, but \nthe facts ought to be presented accurately.\n  These are the facts: For every minute George Bush has been President, \nnearly two Americans have lost their private sector jobs. I know it is \ndifficult for our friends on the other side. The Republicans have an \nimpossible task of trying to convince Americans the economy is better \nnow than it was before George Bush became President. It is a difficult \ntask. They should try to refrain from saying things everyone knows are \njust plain untrue.\n  On Monday, I attended a symposium in New York City on the life and \ncareer of our dear friend and former colleague Pat Moynihan. As \nconservative columnist George Will noted, Pat was fond of saying: \nEverybody is entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts. I \nwonder if Members on the other side of the aisle agree with me.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement \nAlan Greenspan and others have attested to. That statement refers to \nthe household survey versus the payroll survey and it quotes several \npeople. One is Alan Greenspan, who said at the House Budget Committee \nhearing on February 11, 2004: Everything we have looked at suggests \nthat the payroll data is what has to be followed. Additionally, the \nestablishment survey, the payroll survey, better reflects the state of \nlabor markets. That is from CBO, the Congressional Budget Office. That \nwas done in a report called the Budget and the Economic Outlook, an \nupdate, August 2003.\n  Another statement that the payroll survey is the best indicator of \ncurrent job trends was made by Kathleen Utgoff, the Commissioner of the \nBureau of Labor Statistics--which is the organization that conducts the \nsurveys--at a hearing before the Joint Economic Committee, March of \n2004. One final thing is the fact that the 2004 economic report of the \nPresident uses the payroll survey to assess the state of the labor \nmarket. I do not think there can be any doubt about which one is the \nmore reliable one to use.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ``Everything we've looked at suggests that it's the payroll \n     data . . . which you have to follow.''--Alan Greenspan, \n     testifying before a House Budget Committee Hearing, February \n     11th, 2004.\n       ``The establishment [payroll] survey better reflects the \n     state of labor markets.''--Congressional Budget Office, The \n     Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update, August 2003, page 34.\n       ``The payroll survey is the best indicator of current job \n     trends.''--Kathleen Utgoff, Commissioner of the Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics, which conducts the surveys, at a hearing \n     before the Joint Economic Committee, March 2004.\n       The 2004 Economic Report of the President uses the payroll \n     survey to assess the state of the labor market.\n\n                        Emergency Contraception\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to discuss another subject, if I might, \nand that is something that came about this week that was discussed in \nmy State's largest newspapers about the administration's interference \nin the FDA's proposed approval of emergency contraception for over-the-\ncounter sales. I believe the administration's activity is another \nexample of their desire to establish a ``maleogarchy'' in this country. \n``Maleogarchy'' is a phrase I coined. It talks about men making all the \ndecisions that affect not only themselves but the female population of \nthe country.\n  We saw that most notably on November 6, 2003, in the Washington Post\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\nwhen a group of men was standing with the President of the United \nStates gleefully talking when the President signed a bill that \nrestricted a woman's choice, even though it was made ostensibly with \nher doctor and in the best interest of her health. Yet again President \nBush and other male politicians want to take away a woman's right to \nmake decisions about her health and her body.\n  These are the facts: On December 16, 2003, two separate FDA advisory \ncommittees overwhelmingly recommended the emergency contraception known \nas plan B be made available to women over the counter. The FDA almost \nalways follows the advice of its scientific advisory committees. But \nthen a funny thing got in the way of the science. I will call it \nrightwing politics. Extremists, anti-choice groups, and their allies in \nCongress objected to the FDA advisory committee decision. They made \ntheir opposition loud and clear. Once again I say, these decisions are \nmade by the FDA after their scientific advisory committees come up with \ntheir recommendations. Science first and then the decision.\n\n  The effect of this opposition? FDA suddenly announced, after they \nwere ready to clear it, that it was delaying any decision on the \napproval of the drug. This is no coincidence. The Bush administration \nis caving to political pressure from ultraconservatives and risking the \ncredibility of FDA's scientific panels.\n  For an understanding of what has taken place, it is hard to come up \nwith a conclusion that this emergency contraception ought not to be \navailable. These actions they took beg the question about who is \nrunning the FDA, scientists or politicians? I think the answer is \nclear. Science has taken a backseat to politics in this administration. \nIt is disgraceful. Using the FDA to promote a political agenda not only \nthreatens women's health but everyone's health. It threatens the health \nof our society.\n  Do we want to resemble what we see in places such as Iraq, where \nwomen are subjected to second-class treatment? I was once in Saudi \nArabia, in the first Gulf war. I was in the airport. There was a fellow \nthere wearing a turban and a long dress-type suit. At his feet was what \nI thought was a bag of rags, black rags, because it just looked tumbled \ntogether and there it was. The man was standing there smoking a \ncigarette. But when he moved to another location, the bag of rags \nturned out to be a lady, small in stature, wearing black over her face \nand her body, and she followed this man, and as soon as he stopped \nwalking, she sat down again, curled herself up like a bag, covered \nherself over with the black cloth. I will never forget that. This \ndisdain for a female, for the rights of women is so outrageous that \nevery woman has to cover her face--whether she wants to or not, by the \nway. That's not an option. It's ``you must.''\n  In countries such as Saudi Arabia they have morals police who chase \nthese women, embarrass them, and who will hit them. We in this country \nbelieve that, regardless of gender, people are appropriately treated as \nequals.\n  We see a dangerous trend by this administration. We see the \ncorruption of science. In some ways they are adopting the scientific \nstandards we saw in Afghanistan, allowing religious fundamentalists to \ntrump legitimate science. The Bush administration's intrusions into \nscientific decisionmaking threaten the future credibility of American \nscience.\n  Should high school science teachers tell students that the \ndiscoveries in their textbooks become null and void if rightwing \npoliticians decide they don't like the results? No, that cannot happen. \nWe are in the 21st century, but in many ways we are still fighting the \nScopes trial. In fact, we have seen far right politicians in many \nStates, and even here in Congress, continue to challenge the teaching \nof evolution in schools. What is next? Will the flat Earth theory make \na comeback?\n  Aside from serious scientific concerns, there are grave consequences \nfor women who are denied this drug. Each year, approximately 25,000 \nwomen in the United States become pregnant as a result of rape. An \nestimated 22,000 of these pregnancies could be prevented if these \nvictims have access to emergency contraception. Increased use of \nemergency contraception could reduce the number of unintended \npregnancies and abortions by half. Reducing abortions is something we \nwould all like to see, but it is not our choice. It is the choice, it \nshould be the choice, of the woman, her conscience, with her doctor and \nperhaps her entire family. But the choice is not ours to make. It is \nnot for the ``maleogarchy'' to make those decisions.\n  The FDA advisory committee agreed that emergency contraception meets \nall of the standards for an over-the-counter drug: It is safe; it is \neffective; it is simple to use; it is not associated with any serious \nor harmful side effects; and it is not dangerous to women with \nparticular medical conditions. Leading medical organizations including \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Society for \nAdolescent Medicine, and the American Academy of Pediatrics all support \nover-the-counter access to emergency contraception. It is time for the \nadministration to stop playing games with women's health and the \nintegrity of American science. The FDA should be allowed to act, free \nof political interference.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article on the \nadministration's action on emergency contraception from our States \nlargest paper, the Newark Star-Ledger, be printed in the Record, and I \nyield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Newark Star-Ledger, Mar. 29, 2004]\n\n         FDA's Indecision on `Morning After' Pill Stirs Concern\n\n                           (By Robert Cohen)\n\n       Washington.--A scientific advisory panel's overwhelming \n     vote three months ago endorsing over-the-counter sales of the \n     ``morning after'' pill left family planning groups confident \n     of the Food and Drug Administration's approval.\n       But that was before the FDA unexpectedly delayed its \n     decision after 49 conservative members of Congress wrote \n     President Bush objecting to the panel's conclusion and urging \n     that sales of the emergency contraceptive be restricted to \n     prescription holders.\n       The FDA's action last month has raised fears among the \n     pill's proponents that the panel's scientific and public \n     health findings will be trumped by election-year politics.\n       ``For some members of the Bush administration and the \n     president's political base, this product being available \n     without a prescription to young people files in the face of \n     their message, which is abstinence or else. At this point, \n     we're very concerned that politics was involved,'' said \n     Kristen Moore of the Reproductive Health Technologies \n     Project, a group that promotes contraception.\n       But FDA officials said the delay has nothing to do with \n     politics, and that a final decision will be made by May. \n     Susan Cruzan, an FDA spokeswoman, said the agency first wants \n     to review data on use of the contraceptive by teenagers.\n       ``The FDA bases its decisions on science,'' she said.\n       This is not the first time the Bush administration has been \n     accused of politicizing science. Last month, 60 leading \n     scientists, including 12 Nobel laureates, accused the \n     administration of undermining the government's scientific \n     advisory system by distorting and suppressing data to meet \n     its policy goals.\n       Critics of the emergency contraceptive--mostly religious \n     conservatives and anti-abortion groups--counter the claims of \n     politics by accusing liberal, pro-abortion organizations of \n     ignoring health concerns to foster their own agenda.\n       ``When the supporters argue politics, they are simply \n     trying to divert attention from the real risks of making this \n     product readily available,'' said Wendy Wright, a policy \n     director for Concerned Women for America, a conservative \n     advocacy group dedicated to promoting biblical values.\n       ``We don't know how this affects adolescents, who are the \n     target market,'' she said.\n       Wright's group, along with the Catholic Medical \n     Association, the American Life League and others, argue that \n     making emergency contraceptives as easy to purchase as \n     aspiring will increase sexual promiscuity among adolescents \n     and cause the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\n       Morning-after pills have been sold by prescription in the \n     United States since 1998, and contain higher doses of the \n     hormones used in regular birth control pills. The emergency \n     contraceptives are considered effective in preventing \n     pregnancy up to 72 hours after sex, but work best if taken in \n     the first 24 hours.\n       Barr Laboratories of Woodcliff Lake recently purchased the \n     rights to the contraceptive, known as Plan B, from the \n     privately held Woman's Capital Corp. Barr holds the pending \n     FDA application to sell its product without a prescription.\n       An FDA advisory panel voted 23-4 in December to recommend \n     the over-the-counter sale of Plan B, finding it to be a safe \n     and effective way to prevent unwanted pregnancies and reduce \n     the number of abortions. The FDA normally follows the advice \n     of its advisory committees.\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\n       But in January, 49 members of the House, led by Rep. David \n     Weldon (F-Fla), sent their letter to President Bush.\n       ``We are very concerned that no data is available to \n     suggest what impact this decision will have on the sexual \n     behavior of adolescents and the subsequent impact on \n     adolescent sexual health,'' the letter said. ``We are \n     concerned that adolescent exposure to sexually transmitted \n     infection will increase. This availability may ultimately \n     result in significant increases in cancer, infertility, and \n     HIV/AIDS.''\n       The lawmakers are among the supporters of Bush's policy \n     stressing abstinence rather than birth control and sex \n     education. The president has proposed doubling the funding \n     next year to $270 million for ``abstinence only'' programs \n     for teens.\n       ``Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to \n     avoid sexually transmitted diseases,'' Bush said in his State \n     of the Union address in January.\n       Carol Cox, a spokeswoman for Barr Labs, said the company \n     has submitted the information sought by the FDA and will \n     ``continue to work with the agency.'' Cox said the company \n     ``does not view the delay as a positive development,'' but \n     remains hopeful.\n       ``We believe this product meets criteria of over-the-\n     counter status,'' she said.\n       James Trussell, director of Princeton University's Office \n     of Population Research and a member of the FDA advisory \n     panel, said the studies sought by the FDA were thoroughly \n     reviewed by the committee.\n       ``The studies find that easy availability of emergency \n     contraception does not promote risk taking, does not \n     discourage condom use or use of regular contraception. This \n     product should go over-the-counter because it will reduce \n     unintended pregnancies,'' Trussell said.\n       ``If the FDA does not approve Plan B to go over-the-\n     counter, the decision will not have been based on the science \n     because the science says the drug is safe and effective to be \n     sold without a prescription,'' he said.\n       Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent \n     Teen Pregnancy, said pregnancy rates among adolescents in the \n     United States have been dropping but are still the highest in \n     the industrialized world. She said multiple strategies \n     involving ``less sex and more contraception'' are needed.\n       ``The government should approve the over-the-counter \n     availability of the emergency contraceptives,'' Brown said. \n     ``It probably will make some contribution to reduce teen \n     pregnancies. Will it eliminate it or dramatically change \n     adolescent sexual behavior? I doubt it.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                       Escalating Gasoline Prices\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for \nhis leadership in the presentation he just made to the Senate. I would \nlike at this time to address an issue that is extremely topical in \nIllinois and across the Nation, more so in some States than others, but \nit is the escalating gasoline prices people are facing.\n  Global crude oil prices are as high as they have been in a year. \nDomestically, retail gasoline prices are as high as they ever were, \nwith the average price of gasoline $1.738, higher than a year ago. In \nIllinois, the current sale price of gas is $1.756 cents, which is \nhigher than the current national average, higher than a month ago, and \n4 cents higher than the average a year ago.\n  Gasoline prices affect Americans in the pocketbook. On the average, \nthe cost of gasoline is about half of a family's transportation \nexpenses. We love our cars, we love our trucks, we are in them a lot, \nand when gasoline prices go up, we pay more. The low-income families \nare hit the hardest by high transportation costs. The poorest 20 \npercent of American households, those earning less than $13,908 after \ntaxes per year, spend 40 percent of their take-home pay on \ntransportation.\n  There are many factors that have led to these high prices, some of \nthem on the supply side and some on the demand side. U.S. crude oil \ninventories hit a 28-year low in January of this year. OPEC has been \nvery prudent in putting oil on the market. I will get to the most \ncurrent announcement on OPEC policy in a few minutes. In addition, \nrefinery capacity in the United States has been down for years.\n  In the United States, cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, and minivans account \nfor 40 percent of oil consumption, and the transportation sector itself \naccounts for 60 percent overall. Almost nothing has been done to curb \nthis demand. The best way to address rising gasoline prices is to curb \nour Nation's insatiable thirst for guzzling gas.\n  I am leading the fight in the Senate to try to lessen overall demand \nfor gas by improving the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks. Last \nyear, I offered an amendment to the energy bill which would have \nincreased the Corporate Average Fuel Economy--or CAFE--law's standard \nfor cars and SUVs to 40 miles a gallon by the year 2015, and the \nstandard for trucks to 27.5 gallons in the same year.\n  I also introduced legislation that would discourage the building of \nmore SUVs that achieve less than 15 miles per gallon, and to address \nthe tax credit currently given to these SUVs, these gas guzzlers, and \ninstead create a tax credit for consumers who purchase more fuel-\nefficient cars.\n  The Bush administration finalized regulations for SUVs and pickup \ntrucks that would save at the most 20 billion gallons by 2015. This is \none-sixth of the savings that would have occurred under the proposal I \nam offering--one-sixth. What I offered would have saved 123 billion \ngallons of gasoline by the year 2015--123 billion by reducing demand.\n  I urged my colleagues at the time to read the writing on the wall and \nrealize if we didn't reduce the demand for gasoline for cars and \ntrucks, we would not only have skyrocketing gasoline prices but even \nmore pollution.\n  The New York Times editorial, Monday, March 22, 2004:\n\n       A much better way to strengthen America's leverage . . . is \n     for the United States to limit its own consumption of energy \n     . . . [T]he most straightforward [way] is to raise fuel \n     economy standards by significant amounts. This is exactly \n     what the country did after the oil shocks of the 1970's, \n     resulting in huge savings in imported oil.\n\n  Thanks to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, oil consumption \nis about 2.8 million barrels per day lower than it otherwise would be.\n  Studies have shown consumers can save as much as $2,000 over the \nlifetime of a car from higher fuel efficiency, even accounting for the \ncost of new vehicle technology.\n  Raising fuel economy standards to 40 miles per gallon would save \nconsumers a cumulative $45.8 billion within about 10 years.\n  Unfortunately, since peaking at 22.1 miles per gallon in 1987 and \n1998, average fuel economy declined nearly 8 percent to 20.4 in 2001, \nlower than it has been at any time since 1980.\n  Consider that for a moment. Instead of having more fuel efficiency \nand more fuel economy and less demand for foreign oil, our cars and \ntrucks are less efficient burning gasoline, cause more pollution, and \nincrease our dependence on foreign oil.\n  The Energy bill brought to us by the Bush administration didn't \ninclude any provision whatsoever to improve efficiency.\n  I will add, in all honesty and candor, that the automobile \nmanufacturers in the United States and their unions also oppose \nincreasing the fuel efficiency in cars. I think their reasoning is \nwrong. I think their excuses are lame. I think they are so shortsighted \nto believe that we can continue to build the most fuel-inefficient cars \nand trucks in the world and not run into the same problem we face today \nof increasing costs for fuel. As our demand increases, we can't produce \nenough fuel on our own. We import more and become more dependent on \nforeign fuel and, frankly, enslaved to OPEC. In a minute I will tell \nyou what that enslaved position resulted in.\n  I say to my colleagues and many who have come to the floor to talk \nabout gasoline prices, go back and check the Congressional Record. How \ndid you vote when it came to making cars and trucks more fuel \nefficient? Sadly, very few of my colleagues joined me. It did not win a \nmajority vote. I think those who complain today ought to take an \ninventory of their own voting record on this issue.\n  There are many things we should do. If we don't start fuel \nconservation and fuel efficiency and fuel economy, frankly, we will \ncontinue to be captives of the oil cartel. We will continue to watch \nthese prices rise at the pump with very little we can do in response.\n  The next time we debate energy policy, I will be offering this \namendment again. I hope we will do the right thing.\n  In the meantime, what do we do about the current prices? It is \ninteresting what some have said when it comes to the current prices.\n  During the Republican primary debate in Manchester, NH, in the year \n2000, in January, then-Governor Bush of Texas said:\n\n       What I think the President ought to do is he ought to get \n     on the phone with the OPEC cartel and say we expect you to \n     open your\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\n     spigots. One reason why the price is so high is because \n     the price of crude oil has been driven up. OPEC has gotten \n     its supply act together and it is driving the price like \n     it did in the past, and the President of the United States \n     must jawbone OPEC members to lower the price.\n\n  Faced with these skyrocketing gasoline prices, the obvious question \nis, Did President Bush do what candidate Bush suggested? The answer is \nno.\n  Listen to what the Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, had to say \non March 24, just a few days ago, when he was asked about whether the \nadministration should put pressure on OPEC not to cut the supply of oil \nand raise prices in America.\n  I quote the Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, from the Washington \nTimes.\n\n       Abraham said the administration would not temporarily stop \n     filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help lower oil \n     prices and it would not publicly call on OPEC to roll back \n     production cuts scheduled for April 1st.\n\n  Here are the words of Secretary Abraham:\n\n       We've . . . made clear we are not going to beg them for \n     oil.\n\n  What it means is when candidate Bush went to Manchester, NH, and said \nwe need a forceful President who will stand up to OPEC to defend \nbusinesses and families and individuals across America who are paying \nthe price of higher gasoline prices, candidate Bush when he became \nPresident Bush suffered severe political amnesia. He forgot what he \nsaid. Look where we are today.\n  The unfortunate reality is that we have a press release today from \nVienna, Austria, from Reuters, which said:\n\n       '`OPEC agreed Wednesday to endorse tighter curbs on oil \n     production, ignoring concerns in some countries about crude \n     oil prices near their highest level in 13 years,'' ministers \n     said.\n       ``The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided \n     to implement a deal cutting 1 million barrels a day from \n     April 1,'' Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said. Libyian \n     Oil Minister Fethi bin Chetwane also said that the cartel \n     formally agreed Wednesday to implement the cuts, which were \n     first proposed in Algiers in February.\n\n  Benchmark U.S. crude traded up 25 cents to $36.50 a barrel with the \nNew York Mercantile Exchange's gasoline contracts sitting at an all-\ntime high of $1.177 a gallon.\n  What is happening? Because this administration refuses to confront \nOPEC, because as Secretary of Energy Abraham said, we are not going to \nbeg for oil, because President Bush forgot what he promised when he ran \nfor President 4 years ago, American families and businesses will face \noil prices at record high and historic levels.\n  What has been the response of the Bush administration to this \nreality? The response was to prepare a campaign ad attacking John \nKerry. The campaign ad just started to run. It is an ad which \ncriticizes Senator John Kerry, the purported Democratic nominee for \nPresident of United States, for supporting a 50-cent-a-gallon gas tax, \nsaying that the tax increase will cause the average consumer to pay \n$657 more a year, and that he supported high gasoline taxes 11 times.\n  This morning, the Washington Post decided to look at the charges, the \nnegative ad, that is being run against John Kerry. Here is what they \nhad to say:\n\n       Unlike three previous negative ads, this spot softens its \n     charges with a mocking tone and funny footage against the \n     ``wacky'' Kerry.\n\n  This is from the Washington Post.\n\n       But it unfairly presents a gas-tax hike as if it were the \n     Senator's current position, when most of the examples are a \n     decade old. Kerry voted in 1993 for the Clinton economic \n     package, which included a 4.3 cent increase in the gas tax, \n     and is widely credited with boosting the economy. He also \n     opposed several Republican efforts to repeal the tax.\n\n  The article goes on to say, analyzing the Bush negative ad:\n\n       Kerry spoke in favor of a 50-cent hike in 1994 and as a \n     possible way of cutting the deficit, but no such proposal \n     came to a vote and he later changed his mind. His only recent \n     vote was in 2000, when Kerry opposed the GOP effort to \n     suspend 18 cents in gas taxes for five months.\n\n  The article goes on to say, analyzing the Bush attack ad:\n\n       The ad fails to mention that the President, who promised in \n     2000 to trim gas taxes, has never proposed such a cut. Bush \n     campaign manager Ken Mehlman said Kerry last year opposed \n     Bush's energy bill, designed to boost oil in part by allowing \n     drilling in Alaska. Kerry's spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter \n     called the measure ``a giveaway'' to the oil companies and a \n     Republican-controlled Congress killed it. The Kerry camp \n     dug out a quote in which Bush's top economic adviser [the \n     ever-present and almost infamous] N. Gregory Mankiw, \n     backed a 50-cent gas tax in 1999.\n\n  You may remember Mr. Mankiw. Mr. Mankiw was the man, the President's \neconomic adviser, who sent the economic report to Congress. In it Mr. \nMankiw, with his own insight as the top economist of the Bush \nadministration, said that the outsourcing of jobs to India and China \nwas a good thing. Now we were trading in new things like call centers. \nIt was a good thing--Mankiw's own words.\n  So Mr. Mankiw, top economic adviser to George Bush, it turns out, was \nsupporting a 50-cent increase in the gasoline tax in 1999. Interesting. \nAnd President Bush and his campaign continue to run ads attacking John \nKerry and saying that the real reason for the gasoline price increases \nthat we are seeing across America is John Kerry voting for a 4.3-cent \ngasoline tax increase 11 years ago.\n  Is that as good as they can get? Is that the best they can come up \nwith? What they are ignoring is the obvious. They are ignoring the fact \nthat this President has the power, as President of the United States, \nto put the pressure on OPEC, and refuses to do it. Why? Why is this \nPresident backing away? Is it this oil connection with the President \nand Vice President Cheney? Is it the fact that some of the OPEC cartel \ncountries have been some of the favorites of this administration for \npolitical and other reasons?\n  What is it all about? Why wouldn't this President, facing a gasoline \ncrisis in America today, do what he said he would do when he ran for \noffice in the year 2000? It is an answer I cannot come up with. But I \nwill tell you, the American people will come up with it. They \nunderstand what this is all about.\n  The President can promise tiny little tax cuts for working families \nand massive tax cuts for the wealthy, and then turn around and fail to \nshow leadership on gasoline prices, and watch whatever benefit those \nsmall tax cuts meant to lower-income families disappear.\n  The Bush administration's failed policies have created record high \nprices for gasoline. Americans are paying 12 percent more for gasoline \nsince former oil industry executives President Bush and Vice President \nCheney took office on the pledge that their ties to the oil industry \nwould lead to lower gas prices.\n  Well, it did not work, just as the President's economic policy did \nnot work. Here we have a President who, in a matter of 3 years and a \nfew months, has lost more jobs in America than any President in the \nlast 70 years, and that includes Republicans and Democrats alike. Tax \ncuts to the wealthy did not create jobs. And the President's cozy \nrelationship with the oil companies and the oil sector certainly has \nnot kept gasoline prices under control. The President refuses to \nconfront OPEC and tell them they have to stop taking advantage of \nAmerican families and businesses.\n  Secretary Abraham: ``We won't beg for oil.''\n  Well, I do not think you have to beg. Many of these countries in the \nMiddle East, as part of the OPEC cartel, depend on the United States \nfor an important and valuable market. They depend on the United States \nfor many security items. They depend on the United States and its \nfriendship and alliance when things get tough, such as the instance in \nKuwait and the Persian Gulf crisis.\n\n  Why wouldn't this President go to the leaders in OPEC and tell them \nwhat they were doing to America and the American economy, gripped with \nthis so-called jobless recovery. Frankly, a jobless recovery is no \nrecovery at all. We all know that. Facing a jobless recovery, this \nPresident will not confront OPEC and tell them: Keep gasoline prices \nlow; increase your exports of crude oil so we do not run up the cost of \nbusiness for small and large businesses alike, and run up the cost of \nliving for average working families.\n  Economist David Rosenberg told CNN's Lou Dobbs:\n\n       [P]ain at the pump has wiped out more than $20 billion of \n     the coming $40 billion in tax refund checks.\n\n  How did he come to that conclusion? On January 5, American consumers\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\npaid $1.51 for an average gallon of gas. As of today, less than 3 \nmonths later, they are paying $1.75 a gallon--a 24-cent increase since \nJanuary.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       [E]very penny increase in a gallon of gas costs consumers \n     $1 billion a year.\n\n  So if prices remain high, that means a $24 billion gas tax hike has \nbeen placed on the American people, for the failure of the Bush \nadministration to confront the OPEC cartel, as he promised to do.\n  But that is not all.\n  Nationwide gas prices have risen 12 percent since the year 2000 and \nare expected to skyrocket upwards to $1.83 a gallon this summer when \ngasoline prices usually peak--a 17-percent increase in gasoline prices \nsince President Bush took office.\n  So what is wrong with this picture? When it comes to employment, \nthere is nothing but bad news in statistics. The unemployment rates \ncontinue to go up. When it comes to gasoline prices and its cost to \nfamilies and businesses, more bad news from the Bush administration: a \n17-percent anticipated increase by this summer.\n  Guy Caruso, the administrator of the Energy Information \nAdministration, told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nthat an average family will spend about $1,700 for gasoline in 2004. At \ntoday's gas prices, this means the average family will spend over $300 \nmore for gas than they would have if prices were at the level they were \nthe week President George W. Bush took office.\n  As I said, candidate Bush knew what to do. President Bush refused to \ndo it. Candidate Bush said: Confront the OPEC cartel. President Bush \nsaid: We are not going to dirty our hands by ``begging for oil.''\n  Because the Bush administration did not follow its own advice from \n2000, OPEC has decided to pursue additional cuts, leaving American \nconsumers more susceptible to higher gas prices.\n  Let me say, gas prices have been an issue for the Vice President, \ntoo. On October 9, 1986--since President Bush's campaign is dredging up \nhistory when it comes to John Kerry--as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, Dick Cheney, our Vice President, introduced a bill to \nestablish a $24-per-barrel price floor on imported crude oil--a \nmandatory minimum price, indexed to inflation, that today would have \nreached as high as $36.12 a gallon. If Vice President Cheney's bill had \npassed in 1986, consumers would have paid over $1.2 trillion in \nincreased gas prices since that year, with $600 billion going to oil \ncompanies.\n\n  In 2001, as Vice President, former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney led an \nenergy task force that met with energy industry officials in closed \nmeetings to write the energy bill of this administration. The meetings \nled to the administration's energy policy, which has failed on the \nSenate floor. The administration has refused to release detailed \nrecords of the meetings to the General Accounting Office, the \ninvestigative branch of Congress. The secrecy surrounding the meetings \nis so unusual and unprecedented that the Supreme Court on April 27--\njust a few weeks from now--will hear arguments that the records for the \nmeetings should be opened.\n  Republicans have criticized John Kerry for supporting gas taxes in \nhis Senate career, but, as I have said, these charges are grossly \nexaggerated and a distortion. This, frankly, is what I am afraid we can \nexpect more of during this campaign. But I think the American people \nknow, while Republicans make a lot of noise about opposing a gas tax, \nthe record tells a different story.\n  Ronald Reagan said of the gas tax:\n\n       The cost to the average motorist will be small, but the \n     benefit to our transportation system will be immense.\n\n  Republican leaders in the House have pushed for a gas tax hike this \nyear. In fact, House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Don \nYoung of Alaska proposed a 5.4-cent-per-gallon gas increase this \nCongress. And President Bush, who promised to cut the gas tax as a \ncandidate, has never acted to do so once in office.\n  So I think what faces America is clear. We need leadership in the \nWhite House that is not afraid to confront OPEC. We need a President \nwho is not afraid to get on the phone, through his Secretary of State, \nSecretary of Energy, and say to those in the OPEC cartel that they \ncannot unilaterally put us in a position where our economy--struggling \nto come out of recession, struggling to recover, struggling to create \njobs--is going to end up hat in hand, in a situation where we have no \nrecourse for families and for businesses.\n  But the Bush administration failed. They failed to do what the \nPresident should have done in showing leadership on this issue. The \nPresident said one thing in the campaign and has done another thing now \nin the White House.\n  American families are going to have to face that cost. When you look \nat this record, sadly, it is not too much of a surprise. Here we are \nfaced with a struggling economy and an administration which, despite \nlosing more jobs than any President in 7 years, refuses to support a \npayout of unemployment compensation to the workers and families who \nhave lost their jobs, an administration which understands that more \nworkers are working longer hours to make ends meet and comes up with a \nproposal to eliminate overtime pay for 8 million American workers.\n  We created the overtime law in 1938. Since we said that after you \nwork 40 hours, you are going to be paid more under the law, every \nadministration that has addressed this law has increased the \neligibility of American workers until this administration. With the \nBush administration, for the first time in history, a President has \nproposed cutting overtime pay for 8 million workers in America.\n  Think about that. If he is successful in doing that, it means that \nthe workers who are going to work today will have to work longer hours \njust to keep up with the lost pay from this Bush administration policy. \nSo who are these workers? They are policemen, firefighters, nurses, and \npeople, frankly, who we count on every single day. This is an \nadministration which won't provide unemployment compensation despite \nlosing millions of jobs since the President was elected, an \nadministration which cuts overtime pay for some 8 million workers, and \nan administration which has decided as a matter of policy it will not \nsupport an increase in the minimum wage for workers in America.\n  We are in the midst of debating the welfare bill. I voted for welfare \nreform. I hope I can vote for this bill. There are many positive \naspects to it. But if we want to keep people off welfare, if we want to \nreward work and reward the right decisions, then we certainly should \ngive fair and adequate compensation to those who struggle. Can you \nthink of what life would be like if you faced $5.15 an hour, a little \nover $10,000 a year, as your total income, and then add on to that a \nsecond job, if you could get it, that has you working 16 hours a day \nand doubles your income to $20,000 or $22,000 a year?\n  These proud and hard-working people get up and go to work every \nsingle day. They are the visible Americans who make the beds in our \nhotel rooms, bus our tables in the restaurants, wash the dishes in back \nof the kitchen, deal with tending our children in daycare facilities. \nWe have said, because of the refusal of this administration and \nCongress to increase the minimum wage, that we have so little respect \nfor their work ethic we will not allow the minimum wage to be increased \nin America.\n  The insensitivity of this administration to working families and to \nthe sad state of the economy has been documented again, not just with \nunemployment compensation, not just with overtime pay, not just with \nits resistance to increasing the minimum wage, but with the refusal of \nthis President to keep his campaign promise from the year 2000 and to \nput pressure on OPEC not to cut the production of oil, forcing an \nincrease in gasoline prices across America.\n  We need more compassion from this administration. We need more of a \nconnection between this administration and working families across \nAmerica. We need a change.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment I wish to \noffer to the bill currently under consideration to reauthorize the \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This program is one of \nthe largest Federal programs ever designed to help families reach self \nsufficiency. I believe this amendment is a strong addition to the \ncurrent bill, and one that\n\n[[Page S3447]]\n\nthis body should pass. I thank my friend and colleague from Iowa, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for his hard work in preparing this \nbill for floor consideration and for making important improvements to \nthe 1996 welfare reauthorization. The 1996 reauthorization is one of \nthe greatest success stories of the recent past. Even now, it continues \nto produce positive results far beyond what many thought was possible. \nNow it only makes sense for us to pass this legislation to continue the \nreforms we began 8 years ago.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, the key principle of this welfare \nreauthorization is self-sufficiency. As this body considered welfare \nreform in 1996 we found that families could end their dependence on \nFederal assistance if we provided the incentives to help them find jobs \nand start providing for themselves. It was the most important change we \ncould have ever made. In response, families went out and found good \njobs that provided them with the resources they needed to make ends \nmeet today and prepare for their future needs.\n  Even today, the results of that effort continue to speak for \nthemselves. As my colleague from Pennsylvania has pointed out, child \npoverty has declined significantly since 1996. Families receiving \nwelfare assistance have found a renewed sense of confidence and self \nworth by meeting life on their own terms. Their newfound jobs have \ngiven them a sense of security many have never had before.\n  We congratulate all those who have been able to work themselves off \nthe welfare rolls and we encourage those who are trying to do the same \nnot to be discouraged. That is why this legislation is so important. It \nenables us to continue that piece of the reform we started, to get \npeople into work and on to self-sufficiency.\n  I don't think there is any more vital aspect of self-sufficiency than \nmaking sure that these families know how to budget and manage their \nmoney wisely so they can maintain their financial independence and work \ntoward financial security. That calls for education in financial \nliteracy.\n  When I served as mayor of Gillette, WY, I saw firsthand the \neffectiveness of helping individuals understand the importance of \nfinancial planning. This is a skill that is essential to self-\nsufficiency, and it should be a part of the welfare assistance program.\n\n  My amendment would permit welfare recipients to participate in a \nlimited amount of financial literacy training that would allow them to \nlearn about personal finance management, credit counseling, budgeting, \nand debt management. This important course work and study would then \ncount toward the work requirement under the Financial bill. As my \ncolleagues are aware, the Finance bill separates the permissible work \nhour activities into two groups: core work and work preparation \nactivities, and allowable activities. Both are required for a recipient \nto meet the work hour requirement. My amendment would add financial \nliteracy training as an allowable activity.\n  Financial literacy and education is an essential tool that must be \nmastered to fully participate in today's society. Only an educated \nindividual consumer will be able to fully unlock the financial markets \navailable to them. A basic understanding of the credit process and \nmanaging personal finances will prepare consumers and their families \nfor making major financial purchases like a home, saving for college \nand planning for retirement. All of these are part of achieving self-\nsufficiency because they require people to create a plan that will \nenable them to meet short term needs and still reach long term goals.\n  It is essential that welfare recipients be given an opportunity to \nreceive this training and that states have an incentive to provide it. \nThe Federal Government operates several financial literacy and \neducation information programs designed to help individuals make smart \ndecisions about their finances. It is my hope that by including \nfinancial literacy training in the welfare reauthorization we will \nimprove and build upon the growing Federal recognition of the \nimportance of this training.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, our support of childcare assistance is \nessential to ensuring the health and safety of children in working \nfamilies. Without greater support for childcare, parents of young \nchildren may be forced to choose cheaper, poor quality care for their \nchildren or fail to provide it entirely. These families need to know \ntheir children are cared for while the parents do their part to attain \nself-sufficiency and to provide for their families.\n  At 73 percent, my State of South Dakota has the highest percentage of \nchildren six years of age and younger with both parents working and the \nhighest number of children under the age of 6 in paid daycare, at 47 \npercent. This is almost double the national average of 24 percent. On \naverage, 1 year of childcare costs families in South Dakota $4,000. \nThis estimate is close to a semester of college at a State institution.\n  A study done by the South Dakota Coalition for Children found that \nparents seek a safe, nurturing environment for their children when they \nare under someone else's care. As more and more families need both \nparents to work in order to make ends meet, safe reliable day care has \nbecome essential to the peace of mind of working families in South \nDakota and across the country. Without the increased funding for \nchildcare that the Snowe-Dodd amendment provides, more parents will be \nforced to seek childcare that meets their budgets rather than their \nhopes for the care of their children. In some cases, families may go \nwithout childcare all together.\n  Without the increase in childcare funding provided by this amendment, \nhundreds of thousands of eligible children will lose childcare \nassistance over the next 5 years. At a time when only one out of seven \neligible children is currently served, I urge my colleagues to \nstrengthen our commitment to children in working families by supporting \nthe Snowe amendment and providing additional resources to increase the \nnumber of children able to receive quality care.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Boxer/\nKennedy amendment to raise the minimum wage for the first time in seven \nyears. This increase is long overdue. The last time Congress increased \nthe minimum wage was in 1997. Yet inflation has already wiped out the \nreal value of that increase. For working people, a full-time job should \nnot mean full-time poverty.\n  I thought in this country, the best social program was a job. Yet \nminimum wage jobs aren't paying enough to keep families out of poverty. \nThere are more than 100,000 Marylanders earning minimum wage. Most of \nthem can't even afford a two-bedroom apartment. At $5.15 per hour, \nminimum wage workers working 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, earn \nan annual salary of only $10,700. That's $5,000 below the national \npoverty line for a family of three.\n  Every day the minimum wage is not increased, workers fall farther and \nfarther behind. Throughout Maryland, I keep hearing about families \nturning to soup kitchens and local charities for help. They are forced \nto do this because the economy is bad, and their jobs simply don't pay \nthem enough to stay afloat.\n  An increase in the minimum wage equals an increase in the standard of \nliving for working Americans. This amendment would raise the minimum \nwage from $5.15 and hour to $7.00 an hour. It would help nearly 7 \nmillion working Americans. It helps low wage workers like the home \nhealth aides who take care of our elderly parents and the child care \nworkers who take care of our children. It helps farm workers, security \nguards and housekeepers.\n  Right now we are debating the reauthorization of Welfare Reform. I \nvoted for Welfare Reform in 1996 because I agree that the best way to \nhelp lift someone out of poverty is to help him or her get a job. But \nit doesn't help anyone to get a job that doesn't pay enough to stay off \nof public assistance. While we're working to move our most vulnerable \ncitizens from welfare to work, we need to make sure those jobs pay a \nlivable wage.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Boxer-Kennedy \namendment to raise the minimum wage. A fair increase is long overdue \nand the Congress must act to set a\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\nminimum wage that accurately reflects current economic conditions.\n  The majority has decried this amendment as non-germane and accused \nthe minority of holding up the underlying legislation. While the \namendment may not be germane in a procedural sense, it is certainly \nrelevant, it is certainly appropriate, and it deserves an up or down \nvote.\n  Indeed, as my able colleague Senator Kennedy mentioned earlier on the \nfloor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as recently as March \nof 2002, has acknowledged that moving people to jobs that pay at least \nthe minimum wage is the centerpiece of TANF. Minimum wage jobs are the \ncenterpiece of TANF.\n  But in order for people to move off these rolls and still support \ntheir families, such jobs must provide a livable wage. Mr. President, \nif the true goal of this legislation--as has been stated--is to reduce \nthe number of individuals enrolled in our Nation's welfare system, this \namendment would directly serve to accomplish that goal.\n  To achieve self-sufficiency, a working family needs more. By working \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, an employee will earn $10,700 at the \ncurrent minimum wage. For a family of three, that represents an income \nthat falls $5,000 below the poverty line.\n  And this is a pervasive trend. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that \nin 2002 the number of working poor in the United States stood at \n8,954,000. This is unacceptable. If Americans are willing and able to \nwork full time jobs, they should be able to provide for their family.\n  At the current minimum wage, this situation is not likely to improve \nany time soon. According to the Congressional Research Service, the \nminimum wage today is at its lowest level in terms of purchasing power \nsince the 1940s. And each day we fail to act, inflation continues to \nerode this purchasing power. As this happens, workers earning the \nminimum wage will only become more and more dependent on the government \nassistance to make ends meet.\n  If enacted, at its full implementation, the Kennedy amendment would \nincrease this wage to $7 an hour. This would provide an increase in the \nincomes of minimum wage earners by $3,800 a year, which represents a \npositive step toward purchasing power that comports with modern day \nneeds and prices.\n  The other side will argue that increasing the minimum wage will hurt \nbusiness and stunt job growth. They argue that we need to give more tax \ncuts to the wealthiest among us, run large and growing Federal \ndeficits, and hope that things improve.\n  Mr. President, this has been our policy for over three years since \nthis Administration took office. In that time, we have seen the largest \njob loss in our Nation's history. We have seen Federal surpluses erased \nin favor of record deficits. And we have been told time and time again \nby the Administration that things will turn around soon.\n\n  However, today's release of state-level job growth data by the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics flies in the face of the Administration's \nassertions in this regard. These statistics indicate that 49 states \nfailed to meet the Bush Administration's projections for job creation \nin the month of February 2004. As of February 2004, 35 states have \nfailed to get back to their pre-recession employment levels. \nFurthermore, 49 states have not created enough jobs to keep up with the \nnatural growth in the number of potential workers, as job growth has \nlagged the growth in working-age population since March 2001. As for \nthe unemployed, 43 states have higher unemployment rates than when the \nrecession began. As a Nation, the cumulative job growth shortfall is \nover two million jobs since July 2003, when the first of this \nAdministration's tax cuts went into effect.\n  Raising the minimum wage will not only benefit low-income wage \nearners, it will provide economic stimulus by putting additional \ndollars in the hands of those who must spend them to make ends meet. \nWhen the Congress last increased the minimum wage, the economy \nexperienced its strongest growth in over three decades. Nearly 11 \nmillion new jobs were added. This is quite a different result from the \neconomic policies we have pursued under the current Administration.\n  Mr. President, increasing the minimum wage is the fair thing to do \nand it is sound economic policy. I urge my colleagues to support the \nBoxer-Kennedy amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3448-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today is the 77th birthday of someone whom I \nadmire greatly, Cesar Chavez. He was born March 31, 1927. I never had \nthe opportunity to meet Cesar Chavez. I came close a couple of times, \nbut I never had the opportunity to meet him.\n  He was a leader, a great father, a man of great moral character, and \na humanitarian. He was a man whose name is synonymous with a broad \nsocial movement that accomplished substantive things. He was guided by \nprinciples of nonviolence and respect for human labor. He dedicated his \nlife to helping those who had no voice. And that is an understatement.\n  Whether he was leading a 340-mile march from Delano to Sacramento or \nstaging one of his prolonged hunger strikes, Cesar Chavez worked \ntirelessly to focus attention to the inhumane conditions endured by \nmigrant farm workers.\n  He gave life, dignity, and strength to the United Farm Worker \nmovement. He knew firsthand the plight of migrant farm workers. He went \nto work in the fields and vineyards when he was only 10 years old, \nwhich was fairly standard at the time. He was forced to leave school in \nthe eighth grade to help support his family. But even though he didn't \nhave a lot of book learning, so to speak, he was a brilliant man. In \n1944, he served his country in the United States Navy.\n  Forty-two years ago, Mr. Chavez joined Dolores Huerta, whom I have \nhad the opportunity to meet. She is still an avid activist and gives \ninspiration to people in the State of Nevada and throughout the \ncountry. Forty-two years ago, Chavez and Huerta founded United Farm \nWorkers Association.\n  Cesar Chavez and the Farm Workers Union opened the eyes of the \nAmerican people. For the first time, many Americans began to learn \nabout the hard lives and inhumane treatment of the workers who helped \nput food on the table.\n  Cesar Chavez was an integral figure in the birth of La Causa, as our \nNation's Latino civil rights movement is sometimes called. Organized \nlabor, religious groups, minority students, and many other people of \ngood will joined Chavez in his fight to secure the rights and improve \nthe lives of migrant farm workers.\n  Cesar Chavez is probably our Nation's most recognized Hispanic \nAmerican historical figure, but he did not help only Latinos but Irish, \nAsian, Indian, German, Mexican. When it came to aiding farm workers, \nCesar Chavez drew no racial lines. He placed his life on the line many \ntimes. He did it by protesting, by denying his body nourishment, in \norder to nurture the cause he so well served.\n\n  In 1968, he staged a fast. For 25 days, he ate no food. In 1972, he \nrepeated this for 24 days. But, in 1988, he fasted for a remarkable 36 \ndays. He embraced the philosophy of Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King \nJr. He sought to bring about deep-rooted change through nonviolent \nmeans.\n  In those many difficult days migrant farm workers lived in makeshift \nhomes with no plumbing, heat, or running water. It was not uncommon for \nthem to be sent into a field or vineyard while the crop-dusting plane \nwas actually dropping pesticides. And, in most cases, little or no \nattempt was made to educate the children of these farm workers.\n  Things have changed as a result of his work. Take, for example, the \nonion fields of northern Nevada, Lyon County. Farm workers now have \nvery nice facilities. They have to meet certain standards. They watch \nhow many hours they work. They have rights they never had but for this \nman, Cesar Chavez.\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\n  We have a lot of work to do on improving the lives of people who \ngather our food, but at least today they have dignity and hope. This is \nbecause Cesar Chavez gave them that dignity and hope. He personally led \na very courageous life and, in my estimation, is a true American hero \nand an inspiration. He believed:\n\n       The end of all education should surely be service to \n     others.\n\n  He held this belief in his heart, and he lived this belief in his \nactions until his untimely death in 1993. I hope those of us in the \nSenate will understand that courage and commitment that guided Cesar \nChavez's life and honor his legacy by looking out for those people with \nno voice.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today would have been the 77th birthday \nof one of our country's greatest leaders, Cesar Chavez. His famous \nmotto in life ``si se puede,'' ``yes we can'' is his legacy to all of \nus, and we are a better nation because of his life-long struggle to \nbring dignity and freedom for the working men and women and their \nfamilies he cared so much about and did so much to help.\n  Cesar Chavez made powerful contributions to our society and has \ninspired countless individuals who continue his battle against \ninjustice. My brother Robert Kennedy came to know Cesar Chavez well, \nand a special friendship grew. Bobby instinctively shared Cesar's \nextraordinary commitment to migrant farm workers, and his dedication to \nnon-violent change, and he too was inspired by Cesar's passionate \nconviction. My brother was the only public official who was there in \nMarch of 1968, at the end of Cesar's 25-day fast for non-violence to \nhelp the grape workers. He was deeply moved by that day and called \nCesar ``one of the most heroic figures of our time.''\n  Cesar is best known today for his leadership in founding the United \nFarmworkers of America, the largest farm workers' union in U.S. \nhistory. Under his 30 year leadership, it became the strongest and most \nconsistent voice for farm workers' rights. His determination and vision \nled the fight for fair wages, decent medical coverage, reasonable \npension benefits and better living conditions for their workers. His \nlegacy guides us today as we continue the battle to enable today's farm \nworkers to live and work with respect and dignity.\n  In fact, the Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits and Security \nAct we hope to enact in this Congress is based on the far-reaching \nagreement between the UFW and the agriculture industry to treat \nimmigrant farm workers fairly. Large numbers of men and women employed \nin agriculture are currently undocumented. Often they risk danger and \neven death to cross our borders only to be exploited by unscrupulous \nemployers who pay inhuman wages under harsh and often dangerous job \nconditions. Our bill gives these deserving farm workers and their \nfamilies the opportunity to earn legal status, and it gives \nagricultural businesses a legal workforce. By passing this bill, we pay \ntribute to Cesar and we win an important battle in ending injustices in \nfarm work across America.\n  The legacy of Cesar Chavez also reminds us of the important role of \neducation in helping children with the greatest need to have a better \nfuture. We know we can do much more to guarantee equality of \nopportunity, and fulfill the promise of a good education for millions \nof children living in poverty, especially for the children of migrant \nand seasonal farm workers.\n  Too often, schools attended by migrant families are substandard, and \ncollege is an impossible dream. Migrant students are among the most \ndisadvantaged youth in the nation. Current estimates place their school \ndropout rate between 50 and 60 percent.\n  Cesar Chavez put it best in his own words:\n\n       It is not enough to teach our young people to be successful \n     . . . so they can realize their ambitions, so they can earn \n     good livings, so they can accumulate the material things that \n     this society bestows. Those are worthwhile goals. But it is \n     not enough to progress as individuals while our friends and \n     neighbors are left behind.\n\n  Those words remind us of our commitment to provide a better future \nfor today's youth; especially those who live in poverty, work long \nhours in the fields, and are in the greatest need. They remind us of \nour commitment stated in law, but far from reality, to leave no child \nbehind. They remind us of our unmet responsibility to achieve equal \neducational opportunity for all, invest in our nation's communities, \nand make a difference in the lives of millions of children.\n  Cesar's famous ``Prayer for the Farm Worker's Struggle'' sums up the \nqualities of strength, wisdom and compassion that are essential as we \ncarry on his mission:\n\n       Show me the suffering of the most miserable, so I will know \n     my people's plight. Free me to pray for others, for you are \n     in every person.\n       Help me to take responsibility for my own life, so that I \n     can be free at last.\n       Give me honesty and patience, so that I can work with other \n     workers.\n       Bring forth song and celebration, so that the Spirit will \n     live among us.\n       Let the Spirit flourish and grow, so that we will never \n     tire of the struggle.\n       Let us remember those who have died for justice, for they \n     have given us life. Help us love those who hate us, so we can \n     change the world.\n\n  Happy birthday, Cesar--may your vision continue to guide us now as we \nseek a better world.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today we celebrate the life of one of \nAmerica's greatest civil rights and labor leaders, Cesar Chavez. The \neffects of his work on behalf of farm workers and to improve civil \nrights are still felt across America today, from Salinas to Selah. \nAlthough Chavez is best remembered for his decades of work to advance \nthese causes, the principles that guided him are universal and \nenduring.\n  Chavez's motto, ``si se puede'', it can be done, embodies the \nentrepreneurial spirit that made America great, and continues to make \nour Nation stronger every day. Although he labored to overcome \ntremendous obstacles, he is remembered not just for his grit and \ndetermination, but his optimism that those barriers could be \nsurmounted.\n  Just as importantly, Chavez set goals to better the conditions not \njust of individuals, but of our society. As he once put it, ``We cannot \nseek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity \nfor our community. . . . Our ambitions must be broad enough to include \nthe aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own.''\n  The values and philosophy Chavez embraced are as important to the \nchallenges we face today--from educating our children, to improving \nhealth care, to creating opportunity for all our workers--as they were \nto the causes he championed decades ago. When we honor these \nprinciples, Cesar Chavez's legacy lives on.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today we honor the life and legacy of \nCesar Chavez, a great champion of civil rights and workers' rights.\n  Cesar Chavez was one of our Nation's strongest advocates for social \njustice. He believed that the men and women who bring us the food we \ndepend on deserve a safe work environment and a fair wage. He fought \nfor America's farmworkers--men and women who worked so hard to provide \na decent life for their families--and challenged all Americans to \nrecognize their plight.\n  On this day, 77 years ago, Chavez was born at the Yuma, AZ farm his \ngrandfather had homesteaded in the 1880's. Like many families during \nthe Great Depression, his family lost their farm and began years of \nmigrating from town to town throughout the southwest in search of \nsteady work.\n  Chavez began working at the age of ten. He attended school when he \ncould--thirty-seven different schools, in all--before abandoning his \neducation after the eighth grade to help his family.\n  In 1945, he joined the Navy, serving in the Pacific just after World \nWar II. Upon returning to the United States, he lived in several \ndifferent Southwestern communities before settling in East San Jose.\n  It was there--as he worked in the apricot orchards--that he decided \nto devote his life to tackling the injustice that so many migrant \nworkers lived under.\n  In 1952, Chavez became a full-time organizer with the Community \nService Organization, a Mexican-American advocacy group. In this \nposition, he organized farmworkers in California and Arizona, worked to \nstamp out racial discrimination, and built the influence of farmworkers \nthrough voter registration drives.\n  His activism led him to establish the National Farm Workers \nAssociation in\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\nDelano, CA in 1962. The new organization eventually became the United \nFarm Workers of America, the first union representing farmworkers in \nthe United States.\n  Under the leadership of Chavez, the United Farm Workers successfully \nimproved the once-dismal working conditions for hundreds of thousands \nof farmworkers throughout the nation. These efforts brought safety \nimprovements, pay increases, benefits and job security to workers who \nhad been among the most exploited.\n  The union's efforts also brought attention to the health problems \nfacing farmworkers, including the exposure to harmful pesticides that \naffect workers and their children.\n  An adherent to the principles of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., Chavez used nonviolent means to bring about these changes \nincluding economic boycotts, marches, civil disobedience, and fasts.\n  Chavez once declared to his followers, `Nonviolence is our strength.' \nThis message still rings true as the official slogan for the United \nFarm Workers Union.\n  A winner of the highest civilian honor our Nation can bestow--the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom--which he received posthumously in 1994, \nChavez was a true American hero. He was a hero because he spoke up for \nso many who could not be heard.\n  Chavez once commented, ``It's ironic that those who till the soil, \ncultivate and harvest the fruits, vegetables, and other foods that fill \nyour tables with abundance have nothing left for themselves.''\n  His life and this day remind us that as a society we have a \nresponsibility to protect the rights of all Americans.\n  As Cesar Chavez often said, ``Si se puede!'' Yes, we can!\n  Mr. DODD. Today, on the 77th anniversary of his birth, people across \nAmerica will pay tribute to a remarkable man, Cesar Estrada Chavez.\n  I had the honor of meeting Cesar Chavez. No one was a more powerful \nor more passionate advocate for the men, women, and children who work \non farms throughout this country.\n  It's easy for Americans to forget that the food they eat doesn't \nmagically appear on a supermarket shelf. Every bunch of grapes, every \nbox of cereal, every can of corn represents the labor for real human \nbeings--so many of whom come to this country in search of a better \nlife, but instead find low wages, poor housing, and substandard working \nconditions.\n  Cesar Chavez didn't just know about this struggle. He and his family \nlived it. He grew up moving from town to town and from school to school \nwhile his father worked in the fields. He himself became a farm worker \nas soon as he finished the eighth grade. Born out of his sweat and toil \nwas a fierce determination to give a voice to people like him and his \nfamily who labored so hard and received so little in return.\n  Chavez became one of America's most well-known, beloved, and \neffective labor leaders. As the founder and leader of United Farm \nWorkers of America, Chavez shed light on the shameful treatment of farm \nworkers in our country. He led boycotts and marches. He helped register \nvoters. He went on hunger strikes. And he united workers across America \nwith a simple, yet powerful, message: ``Si se puede''--``Yes we can.''\n  Ceasr Chavez represented farm workers. But the priorities he fought \nfor are America's priorities: Better pay and benefits for workers. \nBetter education for children. Expanded civil rights for minorities. \nAll working Americans today owe a debt of gratitude to this outstanding \nindividual.\n  Of course, Chavez's work is not done. There is still a great deal we \ncan do to help to create a better life for working Americans, \nespecially those who work on farms. One thing we can do right now is \npass the bipartisan AgJOBS bill, which I'm proud to consponsor. This \nbill, sponsored by my colleagues Senator Craig and Senator Kennedy, \nwould give many hard-working nonimmigrant farm workers a chance to \nobtain legal status. This bill is the right thing to for these workers. \nAnd by increasing the number of legal farm workers, it's the smart \nthing to do for our economy. This legislation has the support of \nagricultural businesses, labor unions, as well as immigrant and civil \nrights groups. It deserves to become law.\n  But there is so much more we can and should do to make America a land \nwhere each and every person receives respect and opportunity. We can \nextend a helping hand to the children of nonimmigrant workers--by \npassing the DREAM Act to help those children get a college education. \nWe can give every child in this country a chance at success--by making \na real commitment to our public schools. We can ensure that a job in \nAmerica is truly a gateway to a better life--by raising the minimum \nwage and making it a fair and living wage. And we can make access to \nhealth care a right--not a privilege--for every man, woman, and child \nin America.\n  By perpetuating his legacy, we will truly be honoring the memory of \nCesar Chavez. Let us continue his commitment to achieving basic rights \nand dignity for all American workers. And let us use his vision as a \nguide as we strive to build a better tomorrow for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3450-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CLARK COUNTY VICTORY IN NEVADA SCIENCE BOWL\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Elmo and Nancy \nMartinelli on their 50th wedding anniversary. These two native Nevadans \nhave demonstrated a remarkable commitment to each other and their \nfamily for these past five decades.\n  Raised in Sparks, NV, Elmo and Nancy were high school sweethearts and \nwere married on April 25, 1954. The son of Italian immigrants, Elmo \nserved in the Army and opened a barber shop, which he owned for more \nthan 30 years until his retirement in 1994. Nancy worked as an office \nsecretary and bookkeeper until motherhood arrived in 1955.\n  Throughout their lives, Elmo and Nancy have dedicated themselves to \nensuring that their children--Greg, Craig, Sheila, and Julie--could \nenjoy the best possible opportunities life has to offer. Their family \nwould grow over time to include five grandchildren and three great-\ngrandchildren.\n  As their children grew and moved on to college, the Martinellis \ncreated a new and no less active life, which included regular weekly \ngolf games, improvement and maintenance of their home, and worldwide \ntravel. In fact, Elmo and Nancy have traveled throughout the United \nStates in their motor home, visited most of Europe and the Far East, \nand have taken cruises on most of the world's major bodies of water.\n  In the mid-1990s, the couple sold their Reno home where they had \nlived for 39 years and embarked on a new adventure: the construction of \ntheir dream\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\nhome. Elmo and Nancy built their new abode on an acre of land nestled \nin the foothills of the beautiful Sierra Nevada Mountains in southwest \nReno. It is a testament to both Elmo and Nancy that their retirement \nhas produced some of the most exciting times of their lives.\n  It gives me great pleasure to offer my sincerest congratulations to \nElmo and Nancy on the occasion of their golden wedding anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3451-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SERBIA AND THE HAGUE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, March 31, is the deadline in our law \nfor the Secretary of State to certify that the Federal Government of \nYugoslavia--now the Government of Serbia and Montenegro--is meeting \nthree conditions enumerated in Section 572 of the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Act of 2004. The first of those conditions is that the \nGovernment of Serbia and Montenegro is ``cooperating with the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia including \naccess for investigators, the provision of documents, and the surrender \nand transfer of indictees or assistance in the apprehension, including \nmaking all practicable efforts to apprehend and transfer Ratko \nMladic.'' I am informed by the State Department that the Secretary \ndeclined to certify that Serbia has met this condition. I applaud his \ndecision.\n  This law, first enacted in 2000, was instrumental in pressuring \nSerbian authorities to apprehend Slobodan Milosovic and transfer him to \nthe ICTY. It has also been the impetus for further arrests of other \nindictees.\n  But over the years, Serbia's cooperation with The Hague has been \ninconsistent, often grudging, and usually only on the eve of a cut-off \nof U.S. assistance. President Kostunica has made no secret of his \ndisdain for the tribunal. This is unfortunate, because unless the \nSerbian Government, and the Serbian people, support efforts by the ICTY \nto bring individuals accused of war crimes to justice, Serbia's \npolitical and economic development will continue to suffer. The fact \nthat Ratko Mladic, who was responsible for some of the worst atrocities \nof the Balkans war, remains at large, is unacceptable.\n  Senator McConnell, the Chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, and I have worked together to maintain U.S. assistance to \nSerbia in the Foreign Operations budget, subject to the conditions. I \njoin him in commending the Secretary for declining to make the \ncertification. I also agree with Senator McConnell that if Mr. Mladic \nis turned over to the ICTY, we should review the certification law. \nWhile it is necessary that the other indictees be apprehended and \nsurrendered, the capture of Mladic would be a very important, positive \nstep.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3451-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed \nS.733, the Coast Guard Authorization bill of 2003, which I cosponsored. \nI am hopeful that the Senate can work quickly with the House and pass a \nfinal bill in both houses in the near future.\n  The Coast Guard has always taken on an impressive array of tasks that \nare important for our security, for the protection of our resources, \nand for the safety of our mariners. After the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, we have asked the Coast Guard to take on even more \nin the area of maritime security, while asking them to continue to \ncarry out their traditional missions as effectively as before.\n  This legislation provides authorizations for Coast Guard's Fiscal \nYear 2004 and Fiscal Year 2005 budgets, and also includes important new \nauthority for the Coast Guard to better carry out its missions. While \nthe President's budget request for these two years provided some \nincreases, it was still far from adequate to ensure that the Coast \nGuard will be able to carry out all that we demand of it.\n  Thus, I am particularly pleased that I had the support of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in adding to the \nFiscal Year 2004 authorization $491 million in authorizations not \nrequested by the President. For Fiscal Year 2004, the bill authorizes \napproximately $7.032 billion. This is a 15-percent increase for the \nCoast Guard's budget over what Congress appropriated last year, and \nabout 5 percent above the President's request for fiscal year 2004. The \nbill includes authorizations of $246 million in Fiscal Year 2004 for \nport security not requested by the President, including $100 million \nfor operating expenses, to cover the increases in operating tempo that \nthe Coast Guard has experienced over the past few years, $70 million \nfor analyzing port security plans, and $36 million for three additional \nMarine Safety and Security Teams. These additional amounts are \nessential to the security of our ports and waterways, and of our \nmaritime transportation industry.\n  For Fiscal Year 2005, the bill authorizes approximately $7.787 \nbillion, a 10-percent increase over Fiscal Year 2004 authorized and \nenacted levels, including for port security operations. This is $327 \nmillion greater than the President proposed, over 4 percent higher than \nthe President's request.\n  I have also been a firm supporter of the need to provide the Coast \nGuard with the tools it needs to get the job done. The Coast Guard \nneeds to upgrade its core assets, in particular, its aging fleet of \ncutters. The Integrated Deepwater Program is the Coast Guard's program \nfor achieving these upgrades, and the President has not requested \nsufficient funding in its budgets to even keep this program on its \noriginal track. I therefore strongly support the inclusion of an \nauthorization of $702 million for this program in Fiscal Year 2004, \nwhich is $202 million above the President's budget request, and $708 \nmillion in Fiscal Year 2005, or $30 million over the President's \nrequest. These increases will allow the program to get back on its \noriginal schedule.\n  At the same time, I have significant concerns with respect to how \nwell the Coast Guard is managing this procurement, and whether the \nunique method for procurement utilized by the Deepwater Program will be \nable to achieve the stated goals of minimizing costs and providing \noperational effectiveness. The Deepwater project is the single largest \nprocurement program that the Coast Guard has managed to date. The \nSenate has voiced concerns about this program on numerous occasions \nover the past few years. A GAO analysis of the Deepwater project \npublished in May 2001 entitled ``Coast Guard: Progress Being Made on \nDeepwater Project, but Risks Remain'' highlighted risks with the \nproject, including concerns with the Coast Guard's ability to control \ncosts by ensuring competition among subcontractors, and the Coast \nGuard's ability to effectively manage and oversee the acquisition phase \nof the project. GAO has identified the Deepwater Program as a ``high \nrisk'' procurement.\n  GAO recently produced a new report on this subject, entitled ``Coast \nGuard's Deepwater Program Needs increased Attention to Management and \nContractor Oversight.'' The report's major conclusions indicate that \nthere is a need for significant improvement of the program and its \noversight by the Coast Guard. First, GAO found that over a year and a \nhalf into the Deepwater program, the Coast Guard has\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\nnot put into place the key components needed to provide adequate \noversight of the prime contractor. For example, the Coast Guard had not \neven agreed on specific criteria to measure the contractor's \nperformance, yet awarded the contractor nearly the total amount \npossible as a bonus for the first year of the contract.\n  Second, GAO found that there is no clear, transparent and predictable \nopportunity for competition of the subcontracts under the Deepwater \nprogram. While the prime contractor uses the ``open business model'' to \ndecide whether to ``make or buy'' Deepwater assets, this guidance is a \nphilosophy--not a formal process with clear criteria and specific \ndecision points--that encourages, but does not require competition. In \nfact, over 40 percent of the funds obligated to the first-tier \nsubcontractors, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, have either \nremained with those companies or been awarded to their subsidiaries.\n  Perhaps most disturbing, according to Deepwater officials within the \nCoast Guard, it is unrealistic to believe that the Coast Guard would \nchange contractors after the first five years of the program. Thus, \nthere is little incentive for the prime contractor to achieve the \nperformance goal of minimizing total ownership costs. This obviously \ncould have serious implications for the American taxpayer.\n  I have also long been concerned that the Deepwater Program meets not \nonly the letter but the spirit of our Buy America laws. A number of the \nsubcontractors that have either received awards under the Deepwater \nProgram, and/or are included in the contractor's proposal, make all or \nmost of their parts overseas. Buy America was intended to ensure that \nthe U.S. Federal government, including the U.S. military, did not \ncontribute to the loss of American manufacturing jobs, yet here we have \na major acquisition program for our 5th branch of the military, the \nU.S. Coast Guard, that appears to be doing just that.\n  As a result of concerns about the program, the Commerce Committee \nincluded in S. 733, as reported, a requirement that the Coast Guard \nprovide a report to Congress which would include an analysis of the \nprime contractor's performance in meeting the two key goals of \nproviding operational effectiveness and minimizing total ownership \ncosts. However, based on this latest GAO report, and the need to ensure \nthat Buy America is fully implemented, additional Congressional \noversight of this major procurement is clearly warranted. Unless there \nare significant changes to the way business is conducted on this \ncontract, there will be enormous problems in the future that may, in \nthe long run, undermine this program.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Coast Guard Authorization Act \nauthorizes nearly $15 billion in funding for the Coast Guard to carry \nout its mission for 2 years. This represents a significant increase in \nfunding over previous years, and will go far to support an agency that \nhas both civilian and homeland security responsibilities. The bill also \nincludes funding for the Deepwater program, funding for port security \nmeasures, provisions aimed at preventing oil spills and helping \nfishermen, and protections for marine resources.\n  Let me begin by discussing the authorization included in the bill. \nThe fiscal year 2005 budget authorization is 4 percent higher than what \nthe President has requested. This difference represents $327 million, \nand the authorization itself is a $700 million increase over what the \nCongress appropriated for the current fiscal year. The funding \nincreases in the bill will help the Coast Guard meet all of its \nmissions. The Coast Guard has stretched its resources dramatically \nsince September 11, and traditional missions such as enforcement of \nfishing and marine resource laws as well as search and rescue missions \nare still below pre-September 11 levels.\n  This legislation includes over $700 million for both fiscal year 2004 \nand fiscal year 2005 for the Coast Guard's Deepwater program, well over \nthe $500 million in fiscal year 2004 and the $678 million in fiscal \nyear 2005 requested by the President. Deepwater is an important program \nthat will allow the Coast Guard to purchase new ships, planes, and \nnavigation equipment and integrate those resources into its existing \ninfrastructure.\n  This legislation also addresses security at our ports. Unfortunately, \nmany of our Nation's ports and waterways remain vulnerable to terrorist \nattacks. Implementation of the Maritime Transportation Security Act is \nexpected to take years. Therefore, it is important that the Coast \nGuard, the main Federal agency charged with port security, have \nadequate resources to meet current homeland security responsibilities. \nThe bill includes $70 million to assess port security plans as well as \n$100 million for expenses that the Coast Guard incurs when the \nGovernment issues homeland security alerts. The bill also authorizes \n$36 million for three new maritime safety and security teams, MSSTs. \nThe MSSTs have already become a vital security force for many of the \nNation's busiest ports. Major port cities such as New York, Boston, and \nLos Angeles have benefitted from the deployment of MSSTs, and I am \npleased that this legislation will allow other ports to receive the \nsame level of protection. The bill also includes $40 million for the \nautomatic identification system, AIS. Mandated by the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act, the AIS will allow the Coast Guard to \ntrack and monitor certain vessels that could pose a threat to port \nsecurity. It is essential that this system operates at full capacity. \nThe fiscal year 2005 authorizations include an overall 10-percent \nincrease for operating expenses and general capital costs to ensure \nthat port security priorities continue to be funded at appropriate \nlevels.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes a number of environmental \nprovisions, aid for fishermen affected by oilspills, and protections \nfor living marine resources. In response to last year's oilspill in \nBuzzards Bay, MA, we included in this bill a provision that requires \nthe Coast Guard to study the feasibility of speeding up the deadline \nfor companies to start using double-hull tankers to transport oil. Also \nin the bill is a mandate for the Coast Guard to issue a report \noutlining the cost and benefits of requiring vessels to have electronic \nnavigational equipment on board. In addition, to ameliorate the effects \nof oilspills on fishermen, we added language to the bill that will \nallow fishermen to receive loans from the oilspill liability trust \nfunding during the period immediately following an oilspill.\n\n  The bill also addresses the issue of ship strikes of one of the most \nendangered whales in the world--the North Atlantic right whale. There \nare only about 300 individuals left in this entire species, and ship \nstrikes are the No. 1 cause of mortality. While lobstermen and other \nfishermen in the Northeast have shouldered significant regulatory \nrequirements to avoid entanglement of these whales in fishing gear, no \nactions have been taken to address the risks from ship strikes. The \nbill would require the Coast Guard to undertake studies to examine \noptions for minimizing vessel strikes of North Atlantic right whales in \naccessing ports where this is an issue. In addition to these studies, \nthe bill would require the Coast Guard to submit a report to Congress \non the effectiveness and costs of such measures.\n  In conclusion, we have crafted a balanced bill that will benefit the \nCoast Guard and enhance our domestic security. The Congress has a \nresponsibility to oversee the Coast guard and provide it with direction \nand resources. With this bill, we have met that responsibility. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge \nthe hard work of Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Snowe in \nhelping to draft this legislation. I respect and appreciate their \ndedication to these issues.

The article was headlined \n``Protectionism Happens To Be Congress's Job.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat the article be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Protectionism Happens To Be Congress's Job\n\n                        (By Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       Free trade is like world peace--you can't get there by \n     whining about it. You must be willing to fight for it. And \n     the entity to fight for free trade is the U.S. Congress.\n       Instead, Congress--whose members are shouting ``fair \n     trade'' and ``level the playing field''--is the very group \n     tilting the playing field when it comes to trade.\n       By piling items onto the cost of doing business here, \n     Congress has helped end the positive trade balance that the \n     United States ran right up until the early 1980s. Over the \n     past 40 years, the minimum wage went up, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency was established, and the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration was set up. Lawmakers added \n     the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \n     and the Employment Retirement Income Security Act. Then came \n     the sharp increase in payroll taxes for Social Security in \n     1983, measures requiring plant closing notice and parental \n     leave, and the Americans With Disabilities Act. Health costs \n     increased, too, making it $500 a car cheaper in health costs \n     alone for General Motors to make Pontiacs in Canada. All this \n     helped give us a trade deficit that hit a record $43.1 \n     billion in January alone.\n       Even if wages were equalized, it would still pay for U.S. \n     companies to move operations to places such as China, which \n     requires none of these aspects of America's high standard of \n     living. Recently, columnist George Will wrote: ``The export \n     of jobs frees U.S. workers for tasks where America has a \n     comparative advantage.'' But in global competition, what \n     matters is not the comparative advantage of our ability so \n     much as the comparative disadvantage of our living standard.\n       To really level the playing field in trade would require \n     lowering our living standard, which is not going to happen. \n     We value our clean air and water, our safe factories and \n     machinery, and our rights and benefits. Both Republicans and \n     Democrats overwhelmingly support this living standard and \n     many are prepared to raise it. The only course possible, \n     then, is to protect the standard.\n       To talk in these terms raises cries of ``protectionism.'' \n     But the business of government is protection. The oath of the \n     public servant is ``to preserve, protect and defend.'' We \n     have the Army to protect us from enemies without and the FBI \n     to protect us from enemies within. We have Medicare and \n     Medicaid to protect us from ill health, and Social Security \n     to protect us from poverty in old age. We have the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission to protect us from stock fraud; \n     banking laws to protect us from usurpers; truth in lending \n     laws to protect us from charlatans.\n       When it comes to trade, however, multinational corporations \n     contend that we do not need to protect, but to educate and to \n     improve skills; productivity is the problem, they say. But \n     the United States is the most productive industrial nation in \n     the world, with skills galore. BMW is producing better-\n     quality cars in South Carolina than in Munich. There are \n     other obstacles that need addressing. For 50 years we have \n     tried to penetrate the Japanese market, but have barely done \n     so. To sell textiles in Korea, U.S. firms must first obtain \n     permission from the private Korean textile industry. If you \n     want to sell in China, it's a lot easier if you produce in \n     China.\n       ``But we will start a trade war,'' is the cry. Wake up! We \n     have been in a trade war for more than 200 years. And it's \n     the United States that started it! Just after the colonies \n     won their freedom, the mother country suggested that the \n     United States trade what we produced best and, in exchange, \n     Britain would trade back with what it produced best--as \n     economist David Ricardo later described in his theory of \n     ``comparative advantage.'' Alexander Hamilton, in his famous \n     ``Report on Manufactures,'' told the Brits, in so many words, \n     to bug off. He said, we are not going to remain your colony \n     shipping you our natural resources--rice, cotton, indigo, \n     timber, iron ore--and importing your manufactured products. \n     We are going to build our own manufacturing capacity.\n       The second bill ever adopted by Congress, on July 4, 1789, \n     was a 50 percent tariff on numerous articles. This policy of \n     protectionism, endorsed by James Madison and Thomas \n     Jefferson, continued under President Lincoln when he launched \n     America's steel industry by refusing to import from England \n     the steel for the Transcontinental Railroad. President \n     Franklin Roosevelt protected agriculture, President \n     Eisenhower protected oil and President Kennedy protected \n     textiles. This economic and industrial giant, the United \n     States, was built on protectionism and, for more than a \n     century, financed it with tariffs. And it worked.\n       The Washington mantra of ``retrain, retrain'' comes up \n     short. For example, Oneita Industries closed its T-shirt \n     plant in Andrews, S.C., back in 1999. The plant had 487 \n     employees averaging 47 years of age. Let's assume they were \n     ``retrained'' and became 487 skilled computer operators. Who \n     is going to hire a 47-year-old operator over a 21-year-old \n     operator? No one is going to take on the retirement and \n     health costs of the 47-year-old. Moreover, that computer job \n     probably just left for Bangalore, India.\n       In global competition there is a clash between standards of \n     living. I supported free trade with Canada because we have \n     relatively the same standard of living. But I opposed free \n     trade with Mexico, and therefore voted against the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), preferring to raise \n     the standards in Mexico, as Europe did with Portugal, Spain \n     and Greece before admitting them to Europe's common market. \n     To be eligible for a free trade agreement you should first \n     have a free market, labor rights, ownership of property, \n     contract rights, rights of appeal and a respected judiciary. \n     Mexico lacked these, and after NAFTA there was an immediate \n     flow of jobs out of the United States because of Mexico's \n     lesser standards. Australia, on the other hand, has labor \n     rights, environmental rights and an open market, so the trade \n     agreement reached with Australia this month should be \n     approved.\n       We must engage in competitive trade. To eliminate a \n     barrier, raise a barrier. Then eliminate them both.\n       Our trouble is that we have treated trade as aid. After \n     World War II, we were the only country with industry, and in \n     order to prosper we needed to spread prosperity. Through the \n     Marshall Plan, we sent money, equipment and expertise to \n     Europe and the Pacific Rim. And it worked. Capitalism \n     defeated communism in the Cold War. Our hope in crying ``free \n     trade'' was that markets would remain open for our exports. \n     But our cries went unheeded, and now our nation's security is \n     in jeopardy.\n       National security is like a three-legged stool. The first \n     leg--values--is solid. Our stand for freedom and democracy is \n     respected around the world. The second leg of military \n     strength is unquestioned. But the third leg, the economic \n     leg, is fractured and needs repair. We are losing jobs faster \n     than we can create them. Some time ago the late Akio Morita, \n     founder of Sony Corp., was lecturing leaders of third-world \n     countries, admonishing them to develop their manufacturing \n     capacity to become nation states. Then, pointing at me in the \n     audience, he stated, ``That world power that loses its \n     manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.''\n       What should we do? First, we need to stop financing the \n     elimination of jobs. Tax benefits for offshore production \n     must end. Royalty deductions allowed for offshore activities \n     must be eliminated, and tax havens for corporations must be \n     closed down.\n       Next, we need an assistant attorney general to enforce our \n     trade laws and agreements. At present, enforcement is largely \n     left to an injured party. It can take years to jump over \n     legal hurdles. Then at the end, based on national security, \n     the president can refuse to implement a court order. Rather \n     than waste time and money, corporate America has moved \n     offshore.\n       We need to organize government to produce and protect jobs, \n     rather than export them. The Commerce Department recently co-\n     sponsored a New York seminar, part of which advised companies \n     on how to move jobs offshore. This aid for exporting jobs \n     must stop. The Department of Commerce should be reconstituted \n     as a Department of Trade and Commerce, with the secretary as \n     czar over the U.S. trade representative. The department's \n     International Trade Administration should determine not only \n     whether goods have been dumped on the U.S. market, but how \n     big the ``injury'' is to U.S. industry. The International \n     Trade Commission should be eliminated.\n       While it is illegal to sell foreign-made goods below cost \n     in the U.S. market (a practice called dumping), we refuse to \n     enforce such violations. The Treasury Department reports $2 \n     billion worth of illegal transshipments of textiles into the \n     United States each year. Customs agents charged with drug \n     enforcement and homeland security are hard-pressed to stop \n     these transshipments. We need at least 1,000 additional \n     Customs agents.\n       It won't be easy. A culture of free trade has developed. \n     The big banks that make most of their money outside the \n     country, as well as the Business Roundtable, the Conference \n     Board, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation (whose \n     members make bigger profits on imported articles) and the \n     editorial writers of newspapers that make most of their \n     profits from retail ads--all these descend on Washington \n     promoting ``free trade'' to members of Congress. Members \n     looking for contributions shout the loudest.\n       Not just jobs, but also the middle class and the strength \n     of our very democracy are in jeopardy. As Lincoln said, ``The \n     dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy \n     present. . . . As our case is new, so we must think anew, and \n     act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall \n     save our country.''\n       Today's dogma is the belief that protectionism will mean \n     trade war and economic stagnation. But we are already in a \n     trade war, one from which the president and the Congress are \n     AWOL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3453-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3453-S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO EARLE C. CLEMENTS JOB CORPS CENTER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to honor the Earle C. Clements Job Corps\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nCenter in Morganfield, KY. One of Job Corps' oldest centers, Earle C. \nClements, and its dedicated staff will be marking their 39th \nanniversary on Wednesday, April 7.\n  The shining record of the Earle C. Clements Job Corps Center is a \nstrong example of the way Job Corps works. When I visited this center \nin August of 2002, I had the pleasure of witnessing firsthand the \ncompetent dedication with which the staff at this Job Corps Center \napproach the problems of men and women looking for a job and a way to \nbetter their lives. The work carried on at the center fills me with \nconfidence that the Federal Government can rely on these men and women \nto train the American workforce for the needs of the economy and of the \nAmerican people.\n  The importance of Job Corps and of the Earle C. Clements Center \ncannot be underestimated. A skilled workforce is the key to a strong \neconomy, to happy and prosperous citizens, to a well-run government, \nand to a strong nation. The men and women who make our economy work are \nthe backbone of America. Without them our great Nation would be forced \nto collapse on itself. Training the workforce of America is not simply \nan isolated act of kindness: every worker also makes an important \ncontribution to the United States that enables it to succeed \neconomically. I believe that a prosperous United States is not only \ngood for the American people but good for the world.\n  I ask that may colleagues join me in honoring the 39 years of \nexcellence and dedication of the Earle C. Clements Job Corps Center in \nMorganfield, KY. Their years of service and dedication have earned the \npraise and gratitude of the Senate. I hope for the very best in their \ncontinued years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3454-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF TYLER BROWN\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

This award is given to an adult and a youth for \noutstanding volunteer work.\n  Tyler Brown has proven himself to be an ideal volunteer. While he is \nonly 16 years old, he has already done more volunteer work than many \npeople will do in their whole life. He has worked with Habit for \nHumanity in Colorado, Florida, and even in Canada. He is also very \nactive in his church, Bethlehem Baptist, where he gives his time to \ntheir Dare to Care program in addition to numerous other projects.\n  The citizens of Louisville are fortunate to have a young man like \nTyler Brown in their community.

A bill to provide for the establishment of campaign medals \nto be awarded to members of the Armed Forces who participate in \nOperation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenators Inhofe, Landrieu, Lugar, and Lott, to introduce a bill to \nhonor our service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan who have served \nand continue to serve their country by working for a free, independent, \nand stable Iraq and a new Afghanistan. These missions have been \ndifficult and the cost has been high; nearly 600 Americans have been \nkilled and almost 3,000 Americans have been injured in Iraq, while more \nthan 500 Americans have been injured and more than 100 U.S. service men \nand women have been lost in Afghanistan.\n  More than a year after the initial invasion, nearly 110,000 troops \nare still stationed in Iraq, working to build a new, stable beacon of \nfreedom in the region. My fellow Senators, the liberation of Iraq is \nturning out to be the most significant military occupation and \nreconstruction effort since the end of World War II. We cannot \nunderstate the importance of the work being done there today.\n  The administration's focus on Iraq leaves the mission in Afghanistan \nincomplete. Despite constant progress there, the fighting is still not \nover. Recent assassinations of government officials, car bombings, and \nthe lingering presence of terrorist forces and former Taliban fighters \nforce thousands of our troops to stay in-country.\n  For there courageous efforts, the Department of Defense has decided \nto award our brave young men and women with the Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal, GWOT, and no other medal. This is despite the fact \nthe GWOT medal is meant for any individual who has served overseas \nduring the war on terror and may have come within a few hundred miles \nof a combat zone. The dangers of serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are \ngreater; therefore, along with my colleagues, Senators Lott, Landrieu, \nInhofe, and Lugar, I propose to correct this mistake by passing \nlegislation authorizing the Iraq and Afghanistan Liberation Medals in \naddition to the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.\n  While some of us in this body have not shared the administration's \nview on this war, we are united when it comes to supporting our troops. \nThese young men and women from Active Duty, National Guard, and \nReserves are all volunteers and exemplify the very essence of what it \nmeans to be a patriot. We believe that what they are doing in Iraq and \nAfghanistan today differs from military expeditionary activities such \nas peacekeeping operations or no-fly-zone enforcement.\n  They continue to serve, even though they do not know when they will \nreturn home to family and friends. They continue to serve despite the \nconstant threat to their lives and the tremendous hardships they face.\n  There is a difference between an expeditionary medal and a campaign \nmedal. We only need to look at an excerpt from U.S. Army Qualifications \nfor the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and Kosovo Campaign Medal. In \norder to receive the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, you don't need \nto go to war. You only need to be ``placed in such a position that in \nthe opinion of the Joint Chief of Staff, hostile action by foreign \narmed forces was imminent even though it does not materialize.''\n  To earn the Kosovo Campaign Medal, the standard is higher. A military \nmember must:\n  Be engaged in actual combat, or duty that is equally hazardous as \ncombat duty, during the Operation with armed opposition regardless of \ntime in the Area of Engagement. Or while participating in the \nOperation, regardless of time, [the service member] is wounded or \ninjured and required medical evacuation from the Area of Engagement.\n  Many within the military agree that there is a difference. According \nto the Army Times, ``Campaign medals help establish an immediate \nrapport with individuals checking into a unit.'' An expeditionary medal \nlike the GWOT does not necessarily denote combat. A campaign medal is \ndesigned to recognize military personnel who have risked their lives in \ncombat.\n\n  Campaign medals matter. ``When a Marine shows up at a new duty \nstation, commanders look first at his decorations and his physical \nfitness score--the first to see where he's been, the second to see if \nhe can hang. They show what you've done and how serious you are,'' said \nGySgt James Cuneo. ``If you're a good Marine, people are going to award \nyou when it comes time. . . .''\n  My fellow colleagues, it is time. We must recognize the sacrifice of \nour young men and women who liberated Iraq, including great Americans \nlike Army SPC Joseph Hudson from Alamogordo, NM, who was held as a \nprisoner of war. The Nation was captivated as we watched Specialist \nHudson being interrogated by the enemy. Asked to divulge his military \noccupation, Specialist Hudson stared defiantly into the camera and \nsaid, ``I follow orders.'' Those of us with sons and daughters were \nunited in worry with Specialist Hudson's family. The entire Nation \nrejoiced when he was liberated.\n  We have also asked much from our Reserve and National Guard Forces.\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\nThe reconstruction of Iraq would not be possible without the commitment \nand sacrifice of the 170,000 guardsmen and reservists currently on \nactive duty.\n  My colleagues, Senators Lott, Landrieu, Inhofe, Lugar, and I are \ncommitted to honoring our over 200,000 heroes who liberated Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We believe that current administration policy does a \ndisservice to our fighting men and women. Therefore we propose, in \naddition to the GWOT medal, new decorations that characterize the real \nmissions in Iraq and Afghanistan, two that are distinctive and honor \ntheir sacrifice, the Iraq and Afghanistan Liberation Medals.\n  What we do today is not without precedent; Congress has been \nresponsible for recognizing the sacrifice and courage of our military \nforces throughout history. Congress has had a significant and \nhistorically central role in authorizing military decoration. Our \nNation's highest military decorations were authorized by Congress, \nincluding: the Medal of Honor, the Air Force Cross, the Navy Cross, the \nArmy's Distinctive Service Cross, the Silver Star, and the \nDistinguished Flying Cross.\n  We have also authorized campaign and liberation medals similar to \nwhat we hope to accomplish with this legislation. A partial list \nincludes the Spanish War Service Medal, the Army Occupation of Germany \nMedal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Berlin Airlift Medal, the \nKorean Service Medal, and the Prisoner of War Medal.\n  The list goes on and on. The great men and women of our military \nforces are doing their jobs every day in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is \ntime to do our job and honor them with an award that truly stands for \ntheir heroic service, the Iraq and Afghanistan Liberation Medals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Army Times and the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Army Times, Mar. 15, 2004]\n\n           Hill Set To Challenge Pentagon on Terror-War Medal\n\n                             (By Rick Maze)\n\n       The Pentagon's determination to award a single campaign \n     medal for the entire global war on terrorism will come under \n     fire Wednesday when the House Armed Services Committee is \n     expected to pass a bill ordering creation of separate \n     campaign medals for combat operations in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. This is a bipartisan bill, first introduced in \n     September, with 84 cosponsors. It is expected to pass the \n     committee Wednesday with little or no discussion, but the \n     next step is unclear, House aides said. The Defense \n     Department has stood firm in the face of complaints about \n     having a single Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal \n     instead of separate campaign medals, and is likely to lean on \n     House Republican leaders to prevent passage of the bill, \n     aides said. ``Passing the committee isn't a problem. Getting \n     the bill scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives \n     could be a lot tougher,'' said one Republican aide. Exactly \n     who would get the campaign medals would be left to the \n     Pentagon to determine. The bill, HR 3104, only orders the \n     medals to be established and leaves eligibility rules to the \n     military. Passage by the full House still wouldn't ensure the \n     separate medals would ever be issued. The Senate debated the \n     issue last year and by a 48-47 vote ended up siding with the \n     Pentagon. Defense officials have argued that a single medal \n     treats all deployments for the war on terrorism equally, \n     whether the operations are in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, \n     Colombia or the Philippines. The chief cosponsors of the \n     House bill are all Vietnam veterans who serve on the armed \n     services committee: Vic Snyder, D-Ark., a former Marine, and \n     Army veterans Rob Simmons, R-Conn., and Silvestre Reyes, D-\n     Texas. Snyder, the chief sponsor, said his combat experience \n     is part of the reason why he is pushing for separate \n     campaign medals. ``I know the incredible pride and sense \n     of accomplishment our military personnel feel about how \n     well they have done in our most recent wars,'' he said. \n     ``In past wars, millions of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \n     Marines have received combat medals that have held intense \n     meaning for them,'' Reyes added. ``Soldiers who fought and \n     are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve a medal of \n     equal significance.'' ``As a Vietnam veteran and \n     reservist, I am proud of the sacrifices made by our \n     military men and women,'' said Simmons, who remained in \n     the Army Reserve after his combat experience and retired \n     from the military in 2000. ``Whatever one thinks about the \n     war on terror, our service men and women did what their \n     country asked of them and did it very well. Congress \n     should recognize these accomplishments.'' In addition to \n     the campaign medal bill, the House Armed Services \n     Committee is scheduled to take up three other measures on \n     Wednesday. One bill would order the reimbursement of \n     travel expenses for service members who used the Central \n     Command's rest and recuperative leave program in its early \n     stages last fall, a measure passed by the Senate last \n     week. Also planned are votes on a bill attempting to \n     expand access for military recruiters to college campuses \n     and a non-binding resolution asking the Defense \n     Department, banks and credit unions and the Federal Trade \n     commission to all work to reduce the financial hardships \n     of mobilized reservists. The planned markup is unusual \n     because the House Armed Services Committee normally would \n     wrap such bills into the larger defense authorization bill \n     it approves each year. Aides who spoke on the condition of \n     not being identified said there are two reasons for \n     breaking with tradition to pass separate bills. One is \n     that lawmakers want to move quickly on some issues, like \n     R travel reimbursement, which have already been \n     completed. The second reason is that House Republican \n     leaders have been pleading with committees to have some \n     bills ready for debate and passage on the House floor. The \n     legislative calendar already is light because of the \n     upcoming elections, aides said. Delays in House floor \n     debate on the 2005 budget resolution, due to problems \n     getting a consensus among Republicans about budget \n     priorities, has left a big hole in the legislative \n     schedule that House leaders would like to fill, aides \n     said.\n\n                                S. 2262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require a report on the conflict in Uganda, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am very pleased to be joined by \nmy colleague, Senator Alexander, in introducing legislation to draw \nattention to the horrifying situation in northern and eastern Uganda.\n  When most of my colleagues think of Uganda, they probably think, \nquite rightly, of Uganda's inspiring example of how a concerted effort \non the part of government and civil society can save lives in the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS. Or perhaps they recall the brutal history of the Amin \nera, and reflect on the extraordinary progress that the Ugandan people \nhave made in closing that chapter of their history and rebuilding their \ncountry. Today, so much of Uganda is vibrant and exciting. A lively \ndebate about the pace and depth of democratization has been underway \nfor years. Ugandan leaders, including civil society leaders, work to \nfight against the insidious influence of corruption, just as leaders \nhere in our country do. Ugandan officials devote time and energy to \nfostering a climate the encourages enterprise and increased trade and \ninvestment so that the next generation of Ugandans might know even more \nprogress. And importantly Uganda is a strong partner in cooperating \nwith the United States and with the rest of the vast global coalition \ncommitted to fighting international terrorist networks.\n  It is in part because there is so much that is positive and promising \nabout Uganda and about our relationship with Uganda that the situation \nin northern and eastern Uganda is so very shocking. For more than 17 \nyears, a conflict has raged between the Lord's Resistance Army and the \nGovernment of Uganda. All conflict comes with costs, but this one has \nbeen particularly atrocious. The LRA's campaign has been characterized \nby the forced abduction of thousands of Ugandan children--possibly over \n25,000 children. These children have been terrorized, tortured, forced \nto participate in extraordinarily brutal acts, pressed into service as \nsoldiers and used as cannon fodder, and forced into sexual servitude. \nThroughout the region, about 1.4 million people are displaced, often\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\nforced into camps by the government. They cannot plant their crops, \nthey cannot support themselves, and insecurity makes it difficult to \nget humanitarian assistance to these populations. Acute malnutrition is \nwidespread, sanitary conditions often do not meet even minimal \nstandards.\n  Worse, often these camps have insufficient protection, and the LRA \nhas targeted these civilian communities of the displaced. Just last \nmonth, a displaced persons camp was attacked by the LRA, and in a 3-\nhour period, some 200 unarmed civilians were hacked, shot, and burned \nto death. Many fear that targeting of civilians will only increase with \nthe government's efforts to arm and train local defense forces, and \nlocal leaders warn of the potential for these forces to take the form \nof ethnic militias, harkening back to some of the worst days of \nUganda's history.\n  Reputable human rights organizations have reported disturbing abuses \ncommitted by Ugandan security forces in the region, and an absence of \nreliable mechanisms for holding those responsible to account. The \nrecent history of Ugandan military adventures in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, particularly in Ituri, does not inspire \nconfidence. Thankfully, Uganda has withdrawn from the DRC. But \nlingering questions about the military's commitment to basic human \nrights standards remain. I believe that the Ugandan military and the \nUgandan government want to answer those questions definitively, and to \nreaffirm their commitment to developing professional and responsible \nforces. But pretending that these questions and concerns do not exist \nis not in the interest of Ugandans, it is not in the interest of \nAmericans, and it is not in the interest of the kind of solid, frank, \ngenuine partnership that I believe we all wish to cultivate with \nUganda.\n  The Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children reports that at \nleast 50,000 people--the majority of them children an adolescents--flee \ntheir homes nightly in search of secure places to stay until dawn. Dusk \nbrings seemingly endless lines of children walking into town centers \nfrom homes that are often miles away, sleeping en masse in makeshift \nshelters if they are very lucky, sleeping on the streets where they are \nextremely vulnerable to exploitation if they are not. This is not \nsomething that happens occasionally. This has become a nightly ritual, \na way of life, for the civilians caught up in this nightmare. Children, \nsome of whom have been abducted and have escaped only to be abducted \nagain, know much about fear. But they know little about school. They \nknow little about safety. They know very little about the promise of a \nbetter future. And the entire structure of their community has been \nshattered.\n  The human tragedy is devastating and the implications are quite \nserious. If Sudan is continuing to support the LRA, I am concerned \nabout what this tells us about the nature of the Sudanese regime. I am \ntroubled by the prospect that some will, for their own purposes, cast \nthe conflict in northern and eastern Uganda in purely ethnic terms, \nlumping civilians who have been victimized in with the LRA forces \nresponsible for their suffering. I worry about the potential for \nregional fractures when one part of the country lives in such a \ndifferent world from the rest, enjoying none of the stability and \ndevelopment that we all so admire. I want Uganda to succeed. I want the \nvolume of positive news to increase. And that means that we must \naddress this serious issue frankly today.\n  This legislation asks the administration to report to Congress on a \nnumber of issues relating to the situation in northern and eastern \nUganda. I ask for these reports because I certainly do not have all of \nthe answers. But I know enough about the problem to know that these \nreports will help the Congress to make informed decisions about how to \nproceed in our relationship with Sudan and about how to most \neffectively help the people of northern and eastern Uganda.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for joining me in \nthis effort. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2265. A bill to require group and individual health plans to \nprovide coverage for colorectal cancer screenings; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing bill, the Eliminate Colorectal Cancer Act, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Eliminate \n     Colorectal Cancer Act of 2004''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     deaths in the United States for men and women combined.\n       (2) It is estimated that in 2004, 146,940 new cases of \n     colorectal cancer will be diagnosed in men and women in the \n     United States.\n       (3) Colorectal cancer is expected to kill 56,730 \n     individuals in the United States in 2004.\n       (4) When colorectal cancer is diagnosed early, at a \n     localized stage, more than 90 percent of patients survive for \n     5 years or more. Once the disease has metastasized, 92 \n     percent of patients die within 5 years. Yet, only 37 percent \n     of colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed while the disease is \n     still in the localized stage.\n       (5) If all men and women age 50 and over practiced regular \n     colorectal cancer screening, without any new scientific \n     discoveries, the United States could see up to a 50 to 90 \n     percent reduction in deaths from this disease.\n       (6) Currently, many private insurance health plans are not \n     providing coverage for the full range of colorectal cancer \n     screening tests. Lack of insurance coverage can act as a \n     barrier to care.\n       (7) Assuring coverage for the full range of colorectal \n     cancer tests is an important step in increasing screening \n     rates for these life saving tests.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing the Eliminate Colorectal Cancer Act of 2004. I \nespecially commend Senator Roberts for his leadership, assistance, and \nsupport on this important legislation. This bipartisan bill is being \nintroduced on the final day of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness \nMonth, as a sign of our intention to do all we can to see that more \neffective action is taken as soon as possible to combat this deadly \ndisease. Our goal in this is to give every American with health \ninsurance the right to access a full range of screening tests for \ncolorectal cancer.\n  The statistics are staggering. Colorectal cancer is the second \nleading cause of cancer deaths among men and women in America. Last \nyear, 148,000 people were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and 56,000 \nmothers, fathers, daughters, and sons died from the disease. Tragically \nthese deaths are taking place despite the fact that this form of cancer \nis curable 90 percent of the time if detected early.\n  We know that screening can discover this cancer early, in fact, so \nearly that growths can be identified and removed before they become \ncancerous. For no other disease are the guidelines for screening better \ndefined and nationally recognized as the best way to prevent deaths \nfrom this cancer.\n  Screening for colorectal cancer will save lives, and it will also \navoid thousands of dollars in later treatment costs for each patient. \nThe Institute of Medicine estimated that such screenings cost less than \n1 percent of later treatment for this cancer. Screening for colorectal \ncancer is obviously the right thing to do, and it is also the cost-\neffective thing to do.\n  The real tragedy is that fewer than half of those who fit the \nguidelines for screening are actually screened within the right \ntimeframes, if at all. As a result, only 37 percent of colorectal \ncancers are diagnosed at the early, most curable stages.\n  Many citizens are aware, at least vaguely, that they should probably \nbe screened, but they can't afford it, because it is not covered by \ntheir health insurance. In our view, no American should be denied \naccess to these lifesaving screening procedures simply because their \nhealth insurance company will not pay for it.\n  Every American with insurance should have access to screening \nprocedures that will prevent cancer. By requiring insurers to cover \ncolorectal cancer screening, we will save thousands of lives each year, \nand save money too.\n  Some argue that it is wrong to require insurers to cover a test for a \nspecific disease. Yet the evidence is clear that screening makes \ncolorectal cancer preventable, treatable, and beatable.\n  National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month has brought new attention \nto the fact we can eliminate a disease that causes immeasurable \nsuffering and sadness in the lives of millions of Americans. With this \nlegislation, we can save hundreds of thousands of lives over the next 5 \nyears.\n  The need is clear and so is the solution. As National Colorectal \nCancer Awareness Month comes to a close, let us do the right thing and \nwork together to approve the Eliminate Colorectal Cancer Act of 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Kerry (for himself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Bingaman, and \n        Mr. Levin)):\n  S. 2266. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to provide adequate \nfunding for Women's Business Centers; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today as ranking member of the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I offer the Women's \nBusiness Center Safeguard Act, legislation to fix a funding gap that \nexists for the most experienced meritorious women's business centers.\n  I would first like to express my sincere disappointment that the \nRepublican majority refused to include the bipartisan women's business \ncenter compromise that was agreed to by Chair Snowe and the bipartisan \nleadership of the House Small Business Committee, and, in the best \ninterest of women business owners across the country, I urge them to \nreconsider.\n  I also want to comment on the Bush administration's proposals to \neliminate experienced, efficient, and effective women's business \ncenters in favor of new, untested, and inexperienced centers. Moving \nforward with the administration's proposal and failing to correct this \nfunding gap immediately would jeopardize women's business centers in 39 \nStates and eliminate assistance for thousands of women in business. \nWhile, as my bill demonstrates, I support opening new centers to help \nwomen entrepreneurs who do not currently have access to this important \nassistance, this should only occur when the existing centers, whether \nin their initial or a later funding period, are fully funded. The \nadministration's policy to sacrifice successful, experienced centers in \nthe interest of opening new centers is unwarranted and unwise. Women \nentrepreneurs and their businesses are critically important to our \neconomy and to U.S. job creation, and women's business centers help \nthem succeed. I intend to continue to advocate on their behalf.\n  This legislation contains a small adjustment to the Women's Business \nCenter program that updates an outdated funding formula, without added \ncost to the Treasury. The adjustment changes the portion of funding \nallowed for women's business centers in the sustainability part of the \nprogram to keep up with the increasing number of centers that will need \nfunding this fiscal year. In short, this change directs the SBA to \nreserve 54 percent of the appropriated funds for the sustainability \ncenters, instead of 30 percent, which will allow for full funding of \nthe most experienced centers, while still allowing for new centers and \nprotecting existing ones.\n  Currently there are 88 women's business centers. Of these, 35 are in \nthe initial grant program and 53 will have graduated to the \nsustainability part of the program in this funding cycle. These \nsustainability centers make up more than half of the total women's \nbusiness centers, but under the current funding formula are only \nallotted 30 percent of the funds. Without the change to 54 percent, all \ngrants to sustainability centers could be cut in half--or worse, 23 \nexperienced centers could lose funding completely. Cutting funding for \nthese, our most efficient and successful centers, would not only be \ndetrimental to the centers themselves, but also to the women they \nserve, to their local communities, to their States, and to the national \neconomy.\n  As the author of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of \n1999, I can tell you that when the bill was signed into law, it was \nCongress's intent to protect the established and successful \ninfrastructure of worthy, performing centers. The law was designed to \nallow all graduating Women's Business Centers that meet certain \nperformance standards to receive continued funding under sustainability \ngrants. This approach allows for new centers to be established--but not \nby penalizing those that have already demonstrated their worth. It was \nour intention to continue helping the most productive and well-equipped \nwomen's business centers, knowing that demand for such services was \nrapidly growing.\n  Today, with women-owned businesses opening at one-and-a-half times \nthe rate of all privately held firms, the demand and need for women's \nbusiness centers is even greater. Until Congress makes permanent the \nWomen's Business Center Sustainability Pilot Program, as intended in \nSenate-passed legislation, an extension of authority and increase in \nsustainability funds is vital--not only to the centers themselves, but \nto the women's business community and to the millions of workers \nemployed by women-owned businesses around the country.\n  This bill is necessary to continue the good work of SBA's Women's \nBusiness Center network, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it \nand its inclusion as part of any extension of SBA programs. I ask that \nthe full text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows.\n\n                                S. 2266\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

fair enforcement of property \n     rights; normalized dialogue with Belgrade; and transformation \n     of the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) in line with its \n     mandate; and\n       Whereas it is in the long-term interest of all people of \n     Kosovo that the UNMIK standards are achieved in order to \n     promote peace, stability, and economic development, and to \n     ensure a better future for all people in Kosovo: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges all people in Kosovo to immediately stop the \n     violence, end the destruction of homes, churches, and other \n     cultural and religious sites, and cooperate with North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization's Kosovo Force (KFOR), the \n     United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), and \n     the Kosovo Police in identifying for prosecution the \n     perpetrators of violence and the destruction of property;\n       (2) expresses its deep condolences to the families of those \n     who have been killed in the recent violence;\n       (3) strongly condemns the destruction of personal and \n     religious property in Kosovo, including more than 500 homes \n     belonging to Kosovo Serbs, Ashkali, and other minorities, and \n     of 30 churches and monasteries belonging to the Serbian \n     Orthodox Church, adding to the more than 100 churches that \n     have been destroyed since June 1999;\n       (4) strongly condemns the destruction of historic mosques \n     in the cities of Belgrade and Nis, and of an Islamic center \n     in Novi Sad;\n       (5) recognizes the commitment made by the Kosovo Assembly \n     to establish a fund for the reconstruction of property, \n     including homes and churches, destroyed during the attacks;\n       (6) recognizes the commitment made by Serbian officials to \n     provide funds for the reconstruction of mosques in Belgrade \n     and Nis, and an Islamic center in Novi Sad;\n       (7) urges political leaders to fulfill their commitment to \n     rebuild what has been destroyed and to take all possible \n     action to allow the more than 4,000 Kosovo Serbs and other \n     minorities displaced during the violence to return quickly \n     and safely to their homes and communities;\n       (8) encourages all political leaders in Kosovo to renounce \n     the use of violence, and to proceed with efforts to establish \n     a secure, peaceful, multiethnic society, which protects the \n     rights of all people in Kosovo, and to take action to proceed \n     with the implementation of the standards or ``benchmark \n     goals'' outlined by UNMIK;\n       (9) strongly recommends that the United Nations review the \n     structure and organization of UNMIK; and\n       (10) urges reinvigoration of dialogue between Belgrade and \n     Pristina in an effort to move toward the establishment of a \n     peaceful and secure environment guaranteeing freedom of \n     movement and human rights for all people in Kosovo.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, I \ncontinue to pay close attention to developments in Southeast Europe. \nDuring my time as a member of the Senate, I have been deeply concerned \nwith the situation in Kosovo--particularly the situation for Kosovo's \nethnic minorities.\n  I have traveled to Kosovo three times since the end of the military \ncampaign in 1999, most recently in May 2002. At that time, I met with \nKosovo Albanian leaders, including President Rugova and Prime Minister \nRexhepi, as well as leaders of the Kosovo Serb community. In my \nconversations with all political leaders, I stressed the importance of \nmoving forward with efforts to promote the rule of law and refugee \nreturn, as well as work to provide for the protection of human rights \nand freedom of movement for all people in Kosovo.\n  At that time, I reiterated a plea that I made during a trip to \nPristina in February 2000, urging Kosovo's leaders to start a new \nparadigm of peace and stability for all people in Kosovo. I continue to \nbelieve it is essential that minorities in Kosovo, including Serbs, \nRoma, Egyptians, Bosniaks, Croats, Turks, Ashkalia, and others, are \nable to move about as they wish and live lives free from fear.\n  I could not agree more with a statement made in the Ninth Assessment \nof the Situation of Ethnic Minorities in Kosovo, a joint report \nreleased in May 2002 by the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, OSCE, and the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, UNHCR. The \nreport concludes, ``Only when Kosovo's minorities feel confident in \ntheir long-term future and when all of Kosovo's displaced persons are \nable to exercise the choice to return to their homes, feeling assured \nof their safety and confident in their ability to access institutions \nand participate in social, economic and political life in Kosovo on a \nnon-discriminatory basis, will it be possible to say that the situation \nof minorities in Kosovo is acceptable.''\n  The latest round of ethnic violence in Kosovo, which erupted on March \n17, 2004, resulted in the deaths of 20 people, including 8 Kosovo \nSerbs, 8 Kosovo Albanians, and 4 unidentified victims. It displaced \nmore than 4,000 people, including Kosovo Serbs, Ashkalia, and others, \nand led to the destruction of more than 500 homes and more than 30 \nchurches or monasteries belonging to the Serbian Orthodox Church--\nadding to the more than 100 churches that had already been destroyed \nduring the last 5 years.\n  This is a tragic and urgent reminder of the work that remains to be \ndone in Kosovo. I believe we must redouble our efforts and do all that \nwe can to prevent continued violence in Kosovo. While the violence \nappears to be calming, the situation on the ground remains tense. There \nis a long road ahead as we look to work with the people of Kosovo not \nonly to rebuild what has been destroyed, but also to secure an \nenvironment where respect for human rights and the rule of law are \nprotected. Continued U.S. leadership is critical in this regard.\n  Today, I submit a resolution condemning the recent ethnic violence in \nKosovo and calling for a renewed effort to promote long-term peace and \nstability there. I am joined by a number of my colleagues, including \nSenator Joe Biden, Senator Dick Lugar, Senator Joe Lieberman, and \nSenator Sam Brownback.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting swift passage of this \nimportant measure, which reminds us of unfinished business in this part \nof the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3462-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3462-S3463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2956.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Ban Asbestos in America \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human \n     carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a \n     substance;\n       (2) there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos;\n       (3)(A) in hearings before Congress in the early 1970s, the \n     example of asbestos was used to justify the need for \n     comprehensive legislation on toxic substances; and\n       (B) in 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);\n       (4) in 1989, the Administrator promulgated final \n     regulations under title II of the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et seq.) to phase out asbestos in \n     consumer products by 1997;\n       (5) in 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th \n     Circuit overturned portions of the regulations, and the \n     Government did not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court;\n       (6) as a result, while new applications for asbestos were \n     banned, asbestos is still being used in some consumer and \n     industrial products in the United States;\n       (7) the United States Geological Survey has determined that \n     in 2000, companies in the United States consumed 15,000 \n     metric tons of chrysotile asbestos, of which approximately 62 \n     percent was consumed in roofing products, 22 percent in \n     gaskets, 12 percent in friction products, and 4 percent in \n     other products;\n       (8) available evidence suggests that--\n       (A) imports of some types of asbestos-containing products \n     may be increasing; and\n       (B) some of those products are imported from foreign \n     countries in which asbestos is poorly regulated;\n       (9) many people in the United States incorrectly believe \n     that--\n       (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and\n       (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the \n     use of new commercial products;\n       (10) the Department of Commerce estimates that in 2000, the \n     United States imported 51,483 metric tons of asbestos-cement \n     products;\n       (11) banning asbestos from being used in or imported into \n     the United States will provide certainty to manufacturers, \n     builders, environmental remediation firms, workers, and \n     consumers that after a specific date, asbestos will not be \n     added to new construction and manufacturing materials used in \n     this country;\n       (12) asbestos has been banned in Argentina, Australia, \n     Austria, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, the Czech Republic, \n     Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, \n     Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Saudi \n     Arabia, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and \n     the United Kingdom;\n       (13) asbestos will be banned throughout the European Union \n     in 2005;\n       (14) in 2000, the World Trade Organization upheld the right \n     of France to ban asbestos, with the United States Trade \n     Representative filing a brief in support of the right of \n     France to ban asbestos;\n       (15) the 1999 brief by the United States Trade \n     Representative stated, ``In the view of the United States, \n     chrysotile asbestos is a toxic material that presents a \n     serious risk to human health.'';\n       (16) people in the United States have been exposed to \n     harmful levels of asbestos as a contaminant of other \n     minerals;\n       (17) in the town of Libby, Montana, workers and residents \n     have been exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos for \n     generations because of mining operations at the W.R. Grace \n     vermiculite mine located in that town;\n       (18) the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \n     found that over a 20-year period, ``mortality in Libby \n     resulting from asbestosis was approximately 40 to 80 times \n     higher than expected. Mesothelioma mortality was also \n     elevated.'';\n       (19)(A) in response to this crisis, in January 2002, the \n     Governor of Montana requested that the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency designate Libby as a \n     Superfund site; and\n       (B) on October 23, 2002, the Administrator placed Libby on \n     the National Priorities List;\n       (20)(A) vermiculite from Libby was shipped for processing \n     to 42 States; and\n       (B) Federal agencies are investigating potential harmful \n     exposures to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite at sites \n     throughout the United States;\n       (21) the Administrator has identified 14 sites that have \n     dangerous levels of asbestos-tainted vermiculite and require \n     cleanup efforts; and\n       (22) although it is impracticable to eliminate exposure to \n     asbestos entirely because asbestos is a naturally occurring \n     mineral in the environment and occurs in several deposits \n     throughout the United States, Congress needs to do more to \n     protect the public from exposure to asbestos and Congress \n     has the power to prohibit the continued, intentional use \n     of asbestos in consumer products.\n\n     SEC. __03.

DIRECT FUNDING AND ADMINISTRATION BY INDIAN TRIBES.\n\n       (a) Tribal TANF Programs.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) The Federal Government bears a unique trust \n     responsibility for Indian tribes.\n       (B) Despite this responsibility, Indians remain remarkably \n     impoverished. According to the Bureau of the Census, 25.9 \n     percent of American Indians live in poverty, more than twice \n     the national poverty rate. The average household income for \n     Indians in 2000 was only 75 percent of that of the rest of \n     Americans.\n       (C) In some States with substantial Indian populations, the \n     percentage of the welfare caseload that is made up of Indians \n     has increased since the enactment of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 because some Indians face substantial barriers in their \n     moving from welfare to work.\n       (D) A General Accounting Office review of data from the \n     Bureau of the Census found that 25 of the 26 counties in the \n     United States with a majority of American Indians had poverty \n     rates ``significantly'' higher than average.\n       (E) Many Indian tribes are located in isolated rural areas \n     that lack sufficient economic opportunities, including jobs \n     and economic development, transportation services, child \n     care, and other services necessary to ensure a successful \n     transition from welfare to work.\n       (F) Tribal temporary assistance to needy families programs \n     have demonstrated remarkable success in moving Indians from \n     welfare to work.\n       (G) Tribal governments, unlike State governments, have not \n     been afforded an opportunity to administer and fully \n     participate in the Federal entitlement program for foster \n     care and adoption assistance, a program Congress recognizes \n     as an important component of welfare services.\n       (H) Welfare reform has not brought enough change to Indian \n     Country. Welfare reform has not, and will not, succeed unless \n     it adequately addresses the unique barriers many Indians face \n     in moving from welfare to work.\n       (2) Funding for tribal tanf programs.--\n       (A) Reauthorization of tribal family assistance grants.--\n     Section 412(a)(1)(A) (42 U.S.C. 612(a)(1)(A)), as amended by \n     section 3(h) of the Welfare Reform Extension Act of 2003, is \n     amended by striking ``1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and \n     2003'' and inserting ``2005 through 2009''.\n       (B) Tribal tanf improvement fund.--Section 412(a) (42 \n     U.S.C. 612(a)) is amended by striking paragraph (2) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(2) Tribal tanf improvement grants.--\n       ``(A) Tribal capacity grants.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Of the amount appropriated under \n     subparagraph (D) for the period of fiscal years 2005 through \n     2008, $35,000,000 shall be used by the Secretary to award \n     grants for tribal human services program infrastructure \n     improvement (as defined in clause (v)) to--\n\n       ``(I) Indian tribes that have applied for approval of a \n     tribal family assistance plan and that meet the requirements \n     of clause (ii)(I);\n       ``(II) Indian tribes with an approved tribal family \n     assistance plan and that meet the requirements of clause \n     (ii)(II);

Mrs. LINCOLN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby her to the bill H.R. 4, to reauthorize and improve the program of \nblock grants to States for temporary assistance for needy families, \nimprove access to quality child care, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 217, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       (g) Sense of the Senate.--\n       (1) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (A) Under current law in the temporary assistance for needy \n     families program established under part A of title IV of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (in this \n     subsection referred to as ``TANF''), a single parent with a \n     child under age 6 must participate in work-related activities \n     for at least 20 hours a week to count toward program \n     participation rates. Other single parents must participate \n     for at least 30 hours a week in order to count toward \n     participation rates.\n       (B) Under current program rules, States have been very \n     successful in increasing employment among families receiving \n     welfare. Between 1994 and 2002, the nation's caseload fell \n     from 5,000,000 to 2,000,000 families and most families that \n     left welfare and are employed work full-time jobs.\n       (C) The Department of Health and Human Services reports \n     that according to Census Bureau data, the employment rate \n     among single mothers with children rose from 57 percent in \n     1994 to 70 percent in 2000. For single mothers with children \n     under age 6, employment increased from 46 percent in 1994 to \n     64.5 percent in 2000. Employment rates among single mothers \n     now exceed the rates of married mothers. While some of these \n     employment gains have been lost during the recent period of \n     labor market weakness, a significantly higher proportion of \n     single mothers are employed today than in the mid-1990s.\n       (D) The design of the TANF block grant is intended to \n     provide States with broad flexibility to decide how to \n     further the employment and other goals of the program. States \n     are free to set required hours of participation above the \n     level that counts toward Federal participation rates, and \n     some States have chosen to do so.\n       (E) The PRIDE Act increases the hours a recipient must \n     participate in work activities to fully count toward the \n     State's work participation rates from 20 hours a week to 24 \n     hours a week for single parents of children under 6, and from \n     30 hours a week to 34 hours a week for other single parent \n     families.\n       (F) There is no evidence that increasing the required hours \n     of participation above those in the PRIDE Act would lead to \n     States running better programs, or would lead to more \n     families becoming employed. However, increasing the required \n     hours of participation would add to program and child care \n     costs. Most families receiving assistance (54 percent) have a \n     child under the age of 6. Increasing child care costs for \n     these families would force States to redirect resources that \n     could be used to help other families get and keep jobs.\n       (G) The decision about whether to further increase the \n     number of hours of participation for families above the \n     levels set in the PRIDE Act is best left to State \n     legislatures and Governors.\n       (2) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any conference report or legislation enacted into law \n     that reauthorizes TANF--\n       (A) should not increase hours of required program \n     participation for families beyond the hours specified in the \n     PRIDE Act; and\n       (B) should provide States with the flexibility they need in \n     determining appropriate hours of program participation for \n     families with young children to ensure that program \n     requirements are consistent with family responsibilities and \n     available resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2975.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE POVERTY LINE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the official United States poverty line is used in \n     determining eligibility for many Federal and State public \n     assistance programs and in determining the allocation of \n     Federal funds to States and localities;\n       (2) the official poverty line is based on the cost of a \n     minimum diet of an average family in 1955 multiplied by three \n     to allow for expenditures on other goods and services and is \n     adjusted each year for estimated price changes;\n       (3) the current measure of the poverty line has remained \n     virtually unchanged over the past 40 years, yet during that \n     time, there have been marked changes in the nation's economy \n     and society and in public policies that have affected \n     families' economic wellbeing;\n       (4) in 1990 Congress commissioned a study by the National \n     Academy of Sciences/National Research Council to provide a \n     basis for a possible revision of the poverty measure;\n       (5) in 1995 the National Research Council released a report \n     that called for the Office of Management and Budget to revise \n     the measure of poverty used by the Federal Government, citing \n     that the current measure no longer provides an accurate \n     picture of the differences in the extent of economic poverty \n     among population groups or geographic areas of the country;\n       (6) the National Research Council proposed that the new \n     poverty measure be based on costs comprised within a basic \n     family budget including food, clothing, shelter, utilities, \n     and a small additional amount to allow for other needs;\n       (7) while the current poverty measure counts only pre-tax \n     income, the National Research Council proposed that the new \n     poverty measure count disposable after-tax income, including \n     in-kind benefits and deducting expenses such as child care \n     and out-of-pocket medical costs;\n       (8) while the current poverty measure is the same for all \n     areas of the country, the National Research Council proposed \n     that the new poverty measure be adjusted for geographic \n     differences in the cost of living;\n       (9) Federal agencies, including the Census Bureau, have \n     carried out substantial research to evaluate and determine \n     the feasibility of implementing the recommendations in the \n     National Research Council's report; and\n       (10) the Census Bureau publishes alternative measures of \n     poverty that incorporate many of the recommendations of the \n     National Research Council.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the improvement of the current measure of income \n     poverty is an important goal;\n       (2) the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation \n     with the National Research Council and other related \n     agencies, should work to implement an improved poverty \n     measure as expeditiously as possible;\n       (3) any action taken by the Office of Management and Budget \n     to implement an improved poverty measure should be cognizant \n     of the recommendations and review provided by the National \n     Research Council; and\n       (4) before taking action to implement a new poverty \n     measure, the Office of Management and Budget should consider \n     the impact of alternative poverty measures on federally \n     funded programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2979.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Research shows that caring adults can make a difference \n     in children's lives. Forty five percent of mentored teens are \n     less likely to use drugs. Fifty nine percent of mentored \n     teens have better academic performance. Seventy three percent \n     of mentored teens achieve higher goals generally.\n       (2) Children that have mentors have better relationships \n     with adults, fewer disciplinary referrals, and more \n     confidence to achieve their goals.\n       (3) In 2001, over 163,000 children in the foster care \n     system were under the age of 5 years.\n       (4) In 2001, over 124,000 children were under the age of 10 \n     when they were removed from their parents or caretakers.\n       (5) The International Day of the Child, sponsored by \n     Children United Nations, has served as a great tool to \n     recruit mentors and partner them with needy foster care \n     children.\n       (6) On November 10, 2002, as many as 3,000 children will be \n     matched with mentors as a result of the International Day of \n     the Child.\n       (7) States should be encouraged to incorporate mentor \n     programs into the delivery of their foster care services. The \n     State of California serves as a great example, matching\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\n     close to half a million mentors with needy children.\n       (8) Mentor programs that serve foster children are unique \n     and require additional considerations including specialized \n     training and support necessary to provide for consistent, \n     long term relationships for children in care.\n       (9) Mentor programs are cost-effective approaches to \n     decreasing the occurrence of so many social ills such as teen \n     pregnancy, substance abuse, incarceration and violence.\n\n     SEC.   .

The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this legislation has been long in coming. \nSenator McCain and I have worked on this for months. I think it is a \ntremendous step forward. It is a perfect example of how we have to \ncooperate with each other. This is not everything that Senator McCain \nwanted, it is not everything I wanted, but it is legislation that now \nis going to pass the Senate. It is something that has been needed for \nsome time. It is the Professional Boxing Safety Act, but it also will \ntake a very\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nclose look at promoters, including those who are the networks, HBO, \nShowtime. It sets up a national boxing commission. It is important.\n  This is a multimillion-dollar industry, and it needs Federal \noversight as a result of deaths that occur with boxers. We had a death \nof a person from Nevada who went to Utah to fight. He had been knocked \nout 21 times. He went to Utah to fight and got knocked out again and \ndied.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I come to my work on boxing with a \nperspective that was formed both inside and outside the ring. Before I \nentered the political arena, I personally was a boxer. I also worked \nringside as a judge in hundreds of fights, in all weight classes, and \nhave judged championship fights. As a lawyer in private practice, I \nalso represented professional fighters.\n  My State of Nevada hosts most of the premier boxing matches in the \nworld. Nevada's state-of-the-art resorts provide fight venues that are \nunmatched in any other part of the world, and Nevadans take great pride \nin the historical role the State has played in boxing. The Nevada State \nAthletic commission is the most respected boxing commission in the \nworld. It has led our country and the world in implementing terms of \nboxing safety and ethical treatment of fighters, promoters, and \nringside personnel. Nevada's commission, under the outstanding \ndirection of Marc Ratner, serves as a model for a national commission \nand has guided my work on this legislation.\n  Is there a need for the establishment of a national commission \npatterned after Nevada's commission to regulate boxing throughout the \nUnited States? The answer is a yes.\n  Last July, a boxer named Brad Rone fought in Utah and died at the age \nof 35. While Brad lived in Las Vegas, he had been banned from fighting \nin Nevada for more than three years. The Nevada Commission felt that he \nwas at risk of getting seriously injured every time he stepped into the \nring. Unfortunately, this ban didn't prevent him from fighting in other \nStates. So despite the fact that he lost 26 consecutive fights, Brad \nwas allowed to step into the ring in Utah to fight Billy Zumbrun. After \nonly one uneventful round of what was to be an eight-round fight, Brad \npassed out and died. He wasn't knocked out. He was hit once and started \nto walk away and collapsed. An autopsy later revealed that Brad \ntechnically died of a heart attack, but many acknowledge that the \ncontinual physical abuse inside the ring contributed to his untimely \ndeath.\n  Unfortunately, the rules governing professional boxing and the \nenforcement of those rules vary widely among States. This legislation \ntoday will help avoid future tragedies like Brad's, and ensure a \nvibrant future for the sport of boxing and the Nation's boxers. If this \nlegislation had been enacted before Brad's death, it would have \nrequired that his fights be approved by a Federal Commission after \neither his 10th defeat or fifth consecutive knockout.\n  This bill creates the United States Boxing Commission, USBC. The USBC \nwill prescribe and enforce uniform regulations for professional boxing \nin order to protect the health and safety of boxers and ensure fairness \nin the sport. While it will not supercede States with higher standards, \nlike Nevada, it will establish minimum standards and conformity for all \nStates. The USBC will also have the ability to defer its authority to \nStates with strong commissions when deemed appropriate.\n  Among other things, the USBC will maintain a national computerized \nregistry for the collection of specific information on professional \nboxers and boxing personnel as well as certify for each boxing match \nthe participating boxers' medical histories. It will require sites to \nhave both an ambulance and emergency medical personnel with \nresuscitation equipment continuously present. There are some places \ntoday that have only one ambulance. Once a boxer is hurt, and the \nambulance takes him away, there is no remaining personnel or equipment \nfor the other fights on the card. This poses unnecessary and sometimes \nfatal risks to boxers and ring personnel. The USBC will also review \nplans submitted by all State athletic commissions for uniformity.\n  This uniformity will discontinue the use of forum shopping that we \nwitnessed in 2002 with the Mike Tyson v. Lennox Lewis fight. That fight \nwas originally scheduled to take place in Las Vegas, but the Nevada \nState Athletic Commission declined to grant Tyson a license to fight \nbecause of his violent behavior, both inside and outside the ring. The \nAssociation of Boxing Commissions, ABC, recommended that other State \ncommissions honor Nevada's decision not to let Tyson fight. However, \nthe ABC acts only as a quasi-federal agency and has no enforcement \nauthority. Obviously, the ABC's recommendation was ignored, as Tyson \nwas permitted to fight Lewis in Tennessee.\n  Another important problem this legislation begins to remedy is \nbroadcasters acting as de facto fight promoters. Broadcasters who \neffectively operate as promoters ought to be held to the same standards \nand scrutiny as traditional promoters. They should be regulated in the \nsame manner. This is only fair. Many broadcasters control when the \nfighters fight, who they fight, where they fight, and how much they are \npaid. This is the role of the promoter, and the media companies are \nacting as the fighters' de facto promoters. However, despite the fact \nthat these companies are acting as promoters, they are not regulated by \nboxing commissions. While traditional promoters are regulated under the \nMuhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, Ali Act, and State athletic commission \nlaws, the media companies have been virtually free from regulation.\n  This legislation will require the broadcaster to make certain \ndisclosures to the USBC similar to what promoters must do. Broadcasters \nwill have to provide to the USBC statements of fees paid and owed to \npromoters, copies of all contracts, and a list of the sources of income \nthey receive from the broadcast of the match.\n  Additionally, the bill requires the USBC to study for one year the \ndefinition of a promoter and report back to Congress their proposed \nrevised definition, speculatively, to include broadcasters as \nappropriate. When Congress enacted the Ali Act, one of the main goals \nwas to protect boxers from being unfairly treated by promoters. The Ali \nAct provided contractual reforms that prevented exploitive business \npractices that at that time allowed for coercive and lengthy contracts \ntying a fighter to a promoter for years. Today, many fighters are \nentering into promotional agreements directly with the broadcaster. \nThus, in order to really give the Ali Act any weight, it is necessary \nthat those who are conducting the business of a promoter comply with \nthe regulations set forth in the Ali Act. The broadcasters should not \nevade the restrictions placed on promoters by the Ali Act simply by \nslipping through some technical loopholes.\n\n  The USBC should focus on two particular issues when making this \nimportant promoters decision. Both, I believe, strongly suggest that \nbroadcasters be included in the promoter definition. First, it should \nexamine the situation that exists when a broadcaster or network hires \nanother individual or entity as the per se ``promoter'' to stage a \nboxing event. While the broadcaster pays this local promoter a fee, the \nbroadcaster contracts to retain the boxer's rights to the fight, for \nexample, the right to sell, distribute, exhibit, or license the match \nor in some cases several matches, and retains the right to choose \ndates, sites, and opponents. In this scenario, the broadcaster is \nreally acting as a de facto promoter and should be subject to the \nregulations and disclosure requirements imposed by the Ali Act. \nHowever, since the local promoter is contractually charged with \ncomplying with federal and state laws, he is the only one required \nunder current law to file financial disclosures with the boxer. The \nbroadcaster who hires this local promoter does not have to disclose to \nthe fighter how much the broadcaster is earning for the fight. Since \nconventional promoters determine when a fighter fights, where he \nfights, who he fights and how much he is paid, the broadcaster is doing \nall the work of a promoter yet circumventing the requirements of the \nAli Act. It is the fighter who is left in the dark.\n  This situation I have described is illustrated by the roles of HBO \nand Showtime in the Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson fight. Lewis was under \ncontract to HBO and Tyson was under\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\ncontract to Showtime. These two media companies signed an agreement to \npromote the Lewis/Tyson fight and a possible rematch. However, neither \nHBO nor Showtime was required to file their agreements with the two \nfighters or with a State athletic commission since they are not \ntechnically ``promoters'' under the Ali Act. Instead, they hired a \nlocal promoter to ``stage'' the fight, and because the local promoter \nwas not a party to the master agreements for the fight, those \nagreements may have never been filed with the commission. Furthermore, \nthe disclosures under the Ali Act which require a promoter to inform \nthe fighters how much revenue is to be earned by it from the event may \nnot necessarily have been provided since the ``promoter'' was only \nbeing paid a fee to stage the fight. Oftentimes, the ``multi-fight'' \nagreements which these broadcasters have with their fighters may \ncontain terms beyond those permitted by law to promoters.\n  The second scenario the commission should examine is where the \nbroadcaster contracts directly with the boxer or with the boxer's \nrepresentative. By ``boxer's representative'' I am talking about any \nentity or company that employs the boxer or to whom the boxer has \ntransferred the rights to his boxing services. Even if a broadcaster \nonly obtains rights to the boxer through this entity, the broadcaster \nshould still be deemed a promoter and be subject to the Ali Act because \nin essence, they are contracting with the boxer. Here is an example. \nWhen Tyson and Lewis fought, HBO contracted with Lion Promotions. Lion \nPromotions is--for all practical purposes--Lewis's company, yet \nlegally, Lewis may or may not own or be employed by Lion Promotions. \nHowever, when HBO contracted with Lyon, they effectively contracted \nwith Lewis directly. Thus, the contractual protections given the boxer \nin the Ali Act should apply in this type of situation.\n  In determining whether a broadcaster is acting as a de facto \npromoter, the USBC must study the contracts between broadcasters and \nsuch entities and any attached ratifications by the boxer him/herself; \nthe contracts with local promoters; the contracts between the local \npromoters and the boxer; and the contracts between any involved \nbroadcasters. The USBC is also directed to look at the sources of \nincome received from the broadcast of a fight and examine the amounts \nreceived from each of these sources. Effectively defining the role of a \npromoter requires looking at who is contracting with a boxer for the \nrights to the boxer's service. These rights include the rights to sell, \ngrant, convey, distribute, exhibit, and license the match or matches.\n  Conventional promoters control the rights to a fighter's boxing \ncareer and the right to exploit the boxer's name and image in \nconnection with his/her boxing matches. By determining who is \ncircumventing the requirements placed on a promoter under the Ali Act \nand thereafter including them within the definition of a promoter, the \nUSBC will protect the fighter from exploitive business practices, \nregardless of the source.\n  It is envisioned that the commission created under this legislation, \nthe USBC, will monitor the boxing world, creating an environment that \nwill enable both the sport and its participants to thrive. I am proud \nof the work that Senator McCain and I have done to help in the reform \nof this great sport.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Doc. 107-7).\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate and the Committee on International Relations and \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (3) Nuclear non-proliferation treaty.--The term ``Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty'' means the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, \n     1970.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the Additional \nProtocol to the Agreement between the United States and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Regarding Safeguards in the \nUnited States.\n  Last February, at the National Defense University, President Bush \ncalled on the Senate to ratify the U.S. Additional Protocol, and today, \nI am pleased to bring this resolution of ratification to the floor on \nbehalf of the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  The United States signed the Additional Protocol in Vienna on June \n12, 1998, and President Bush submitted it to the Senate on May 9, 2002. \nThe State Department submitted the implementing legislation to Congress \non November 19, 2003. At the administration's request, I introduced the \nimplementing legislation in the Senate last December.\n  Since Senate ratification of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, \nthe NPT, in 1969, and our Voluntary Offer to accept IAEA safeguards in \n1980, 188 states have now approved the NPT. The NPT and the IAEA's \nexisting safeguards agreements sufficed to forestall nuclear weapons \nprograms in the world's advanced industrial states, several of which \nwere weighing the nuclear option 40 years ago. Unfortunately, the NPT \nand the IAEA's existing safeguards agreements have been insufficient to \nprevent the diversion of resources in Non-Nuclear Weapon States \ndetermined to cheat. At the same time, we have witnessed an increase in \nthe global availability of nuclear weapons materials, reprocessing and \nenrichment technologies. To ensure that materials and technologies are \ndevoted only to peaceful uses, it is in the interest of the United \nStates that the IAEA have the power to conduct intrusive inspections \nand verify imports and exports of sensitive materials and equipment in \nstates suspected of diverting resources to a weapons program. The \nAdditional Protocol, when universally ratified and implemented by all \nmember states of the IAEA, will not solve all of our proliferation \nproblems, but Senate ratification will further ensure that U.S. efforts \nto persuade all member states to adopt the Additional Protocol will be \nsupported by concrete U.S. action.\n  When the NPT was constructed, in order to gain its acceptance by \nstates without weapons or complete fuel cycles, the world allowed for \npeaceful uses of the atom by states who forswore weapons. This was an \noutgrowth of the U.S. ``Atoms for Peace Program.'' Thus, Article IV of \nthe NPT states:\n\n       Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting \n     the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to \n     develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for \n     peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity \n     with Articles I and II of this Treaty.\n\n  Those last words, ``in conformity with Article I and II of this \nTreaty,'' are key in our consideration of the Additional Protocol. Non-\nNuclear Weapon States under Article II of the NPT are obliged not to \nundertake any steps toward development of a weapon, and in so doing, \nsecure their right to peaceful uses of the atom; peaceful uses verified \nby the IAEA under safeguards. When the Committee on Foreign Relations \nreported the NPT to the Senate in 1968, it did so with some \nreservations concerning this safeguards system. As the committee report \nnoted:\n\n       [T]he implementation of the treaty raises uncertainties. \n     The reliability and thereby the credibility of international \n     safeguards systems is still to be determined. No completely \n     satisfactory answer was given to the Committee on the \n     effectiveness of the safeguards systems envisioned under the \n     treaty. But [the Committee] is equally convinced that when \n     the possible problems in reaching satisfactory safeguards \n     agreements are carefully weighed against the potential for a \n     worldwide mandatory safeguards system, the comparison argues \n     strongly for the present language of the treaty.\n\n  Today, many have come to the realization that the existing framework \nof the NPT, as verified by status quo safeguards, is unable to provide \nadequate verification of Non-Nuclear Weapon States' obligations and \nalert the world community to broken commitments to the IAEA and under \nthe NPT.\n  I believe that acting today to ratify the Additional Protocol will \nput us back on the right track, a track toward complete verification \nand effective enforcement of Article II.\n  In 2003, the international community was confronted with two cases \ninvolving declared Non-Nuclear Weapon\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nStates violating their commitments under the NPT by pursuing \nnuclear weapon programs.\n\n  Iran's clandestine drive toward a nuclear weapons capability was \npartly exposed by an Iranian resistance group and confirmed by the \nIAEA. Then, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom concluded separate \nnegotiations with Tehran in which the regime agreed to abandon its \nuranium enrichment program and to cease all efforts to pursue nuclear \nweapons. Iran signed an Additional Protocol with the IAEA last \nDecember. In January, Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi appeared to \nhedge on Iran's commitment by suggesting that Tehran had agreed ``to \nthe suspension, not stopping, of the uranium enrichment process.'' \nThen, last February, in his latest report on Iran, IAEA Director \nGeneral ElBaradei noted that inspectors had found in Iran technical \ndesigns for so-called ``P-2'' centrifuges similar to those the Agency \ndiscovered in Libya, designs not declared to the IAEA. Iran has also \nfailed to declare a pilot uranium enrichment facility, importation of \nmany nuclear fuel cycle components, and experiments with plutonium \nseparation.\n  Lastly, with regard to Iran, there are extremely disturbing press \naccounts of inspectors finding traces of highly enriched Uranium-235, \nwhich could have but one use, in a nuclear weapon. The United States \nhas made no secret of our view that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.\n  In Libya, we witnessed an important nonproliferation success. \nFollowing intense negotiations with the Bush administration and the \nUnited Kingdom, Libya admitted that it had WMD programs and agreed to \nabandon these efforts and work with international treaty regimes to \nverify Libya's commitment. I applaud President Bush and his team for a \nvictory in the war against the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Through our experience in Libya, we have learned of the \nextent of the nuclear proliferation network run by Pakistan's ``father \nof the bomb,'' A.Q. Khan. Similarly, we have also seen the dangers \nposed by exports of sensitive technologies by many European and Asian \ncountries that contributed to Libya's nuclear weapons program. It is \nimportant to note in this regard how the Additional Protocol \nincorporates and provides for reporting on the Nuclear Suppliers' \nGroup, NSG, Trigger List items in Annex II as well as uranium mining, \nenrichment and reactor activities in Annex I.\n  Events in Iran and Libya are important to our consideration of the \nAdditional Protocol. In 1980, the Senate ratified the U.S. commitment \nto voluntarily accept safeguards to demonstrate a firm commitment to \nthe IAEA and to the NPT. As a Nuclear Weapon State party to the NPT, \nthe United States is not required to accept any safeguards. Our \ndecision sent an important message to the world: the preeminent \nsuperpower, with a large civilian nuclear power industry, could accept \nIAEA safeguards.\n  The Additional Protocol seeks to fill holes in the existing patchwork \nof declarations and inspections. It will require the declaration of \nmany locations and activities to the IAEA not previously required, and \nallow, with less than 24 hours' notice, inspections of such locations.\n  The United States, as a declared Nuclear Weapon State party to the \nNPT, may exclude the application of IAEA safeguards on its activities. \nUnder the Additional Protocol, the United States also has the right to \nexclude activities and sites of direct national security significance \nin accordance with its National Security Exclusion contained in Article \n1.b. This provision is crucial to U.S. acceptance of the Additional \nProtocol and provides the basis for the protection of U.S. nuclear \nweapons-related activities, sites, and materials as a declared nuclear \npower.\n  The Additional Protocol does not contain any new arms control or \ndisarmament obligations for the United States. Although there are \nincreased rights granted to the IAEA for the conduct of inspections in \nthe United States, the administration has assured the Committee on \nForeign Relations that the likelihood of an inspection occurring in the \nUnited States is very low. Nevertheless, should an inspection under the \nAdditional Protocol be determined to be potentially harmful to U.S. \nnational security, the United States has the right, through the \nNational Security Exclusion, to prevent the inspection.\n  For the past 9 months, the majority and minority staffs of the \ncommittee have been working closely with the administration to craft a \nresolution of ratification that will gain broad support in the Senate. \nOn January 29, the committee held a hearing with administration \nwitnesses. On March 4, the resolution of ratification before the Senate \ntoday was approved at a committee business meeting by a vote of 19 to \n0. I thank Senator Biden and his staff for their cooperation in this \neffort. I am pleased to inform all Members that the administration \nfully supports the committee's recommended resolution of ratification, \nwithout changes.\n  In sum, I believe the Additional Protocol is necessary to further \nensure effective verification and enforcement of the Article II \nobligations of Non-Nuclear Weapon States. Continued enjoyment of \nArticle IV rights should come only with an increase in our ability to \nverify compliance with obligations to the IAEA and under the NPT. I do \nnot believe that the Additional Protocol will be a burden for the \nUnited States, given that our ratification and implementation of the \nProtocol does not constitute a statement about U.S. adherence to \nnonproliferation commitments, but rather as a demonstration of our \ncontinued leadership in furtherance of the nonproliferation objectives \ncontained in it. It is a first step toward realization of the \nobjectives set forth by President Bush last February.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the committee's resolution of \nratification and to ratify the Additional Protocol.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to recommend that the \nUnited States Senate give its advice and consent to ratification of the \nAdditional Safeguards Protocol between the United States and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. Ratification of the \nAdditional Protocol will make a real contribution to U.S. nuclear non-\nproliferation efforts, and it will do so without putting at risk any \nsensitive national security information.\n  As my colleagues surely know, the Additional Protocol is an outgrowth \nof the world's discovery in 1991 that Iraq had come perilously close to \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon, without the IAEA realizing it. One reason \nfor Iraq's near-success was that the IAEA was allowed to inspect only \nthose facilities that Iraq declared to it. If a uranium enrichment \nfacility was across the hall from a declared facility--and in some \ncases it was about that bad--the IAEA had no mandate to inspect it. We, \nthe world, and the IAEA itself realized that a revised safeguards \nregime was needed.\n  The Additional Protocol that was developed to address this concern \nrequires a signatory to provide yearly reports covering more nuclear \nfacilities than those included in the declarations required by the so-\ncalled ``comprehensive'' safeguards agreements that have defined the \nIAEA's role in recent decades. It also allows the IAEA to inspect non-\ndeclared facilities, if the organization believes that illegal nuclear \nactivities may be taking place there. This is a significant expansion \nof IAEA inspection rights, and it's something that the United States \nrightly wants to be adopted by all the non-nuclear weapons states under \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (the NPT).\n  The United States, as a recognized nuclear weapons state under the \nNPT, is not required to provide information to the IAEA or to accept \nIAEA inspections. In 1967, however, when the NPT was being negotiated, \nPresident Lyndon Baines Johnson announced that the United States would \nvoluntarily submit to safeguards on nuclear materials. He did this to \nassuage the concerns of non-nuclear weapons states that feared that the \nfive nuclear weapons states would otherwise enjoy an unfair commercial \nadvantage regarding their nuclear power industries. Accordingly, a \nU.S.-IAEA safeguards agreement, also known as the ``Voluntary Offer,'' \nhas been in place since 1980. Truth be told, this Voluntary Offer is \nmore symbolic than real; until 1994, the IAEA only applied safeguards \nto two commercial power reactors and two fuel fabrication facilities in \nthe United States, from a list of 250 eligible facilities. In recent \nyears, it has inspected\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\nonly sites for which the United States requested inspections, like the \nsite where we store the highly enriched uranium we removed from \nKazakhstan.\n  Our willingness to accept IAEA safeguards helped to secure the \nworld's agreement to the NPT. Similarly, our stated willingness to \naccept the Additional Protocol was crucial to gaining the world's \nagreement, in 1995, to the indefinite extension of the NPT. And our \nratification of the Additional Protocol will strengthen our ability to \nconvince more non-nuclear weapons states to sign their own additional \nprotocols.\n  When the Additional Protocol enters into force, the United States \nwill submit additional information on civil nuclear facilities on an \nannual basis and identify additional civilian facilities, a small \nnumber of which might someday be inspected. All implementation \nactivities under the Additional Protocol will be subject to a \n``National Security Exclusion,'' however, that will allow our \nGovernment to exclude the application of the Additional Protocol \nwherever it would result in ``access by the Agency to activities with \ndirect national security significance to the United States or to \nlocations or information associated with such activities.'' Just as \nunder the Voluntary Offer, the United States will retain the trump card \nof not declaring a facility, not submitting certain information, or \ndenying or halting an inspection if our national security interests \ncome into play. If we decide to permit an IAEA inspection, we will also \nhave the right to employ ``managed access'' to protect national \nsecurity information. (All countries will have the right to use managed \naccess to protect confidential business information; because the United \nStates is a recognized nuclear weapons state, we will have the right to \nuse managed access more broadly.)\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has looked carefully at how \nour special rights would be invoked and whether sensitive facilities \nwill be prepared to accept an IAEA inspection if the President or the \ninteragency process decides to permit that inspection. We are satisfied \nthat a Federal agency with a legitimate national security concern will \nhave no difficulty ensuring that sensitive information is protected.\n  The resolution of ratification that the Committee recommends will \nensure that the U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol does not enter into force \nuntil the President certifies that all the necessary regulations will \nbe in place and all the necessary site vulnerability assessments will \nhave been completed within 180 days of entry into force. (No reporting \nto the IAEA is required until 180 days after entry into force, so no \ninspections of newly-declared facilities would occur before then.) The \nresolution of ratification also addresses the protection of classified \nand proprietary information, the addition or deletion of locations from \nU.S. reports to the IAEA, U.S. intent to use its special rights as a \nnuclear weapons state under the NPT, and the adoption of subsidiary \narrangements or amendments under the Additional Protocol. In short, the \nCommittee has covered all the bases to ensure that adoption of the \nAdditional Protocol will support our nuclear non-proliferation policy \nwithout endangering sensitive national security information.\n  The resolution of ratification also calls for annual reports on U.S. \nefforts to get all the non-nuclear weapon states to adopt additional \nprotocols and on U.S. help to the IAEA to conduct effective \ninspections. Those are important efforts that every member of this body \nshould support. For all the difficulties it faces in gaining access to \nsites of concern, the IAEA has shown a real determination to get into \nthose sites. Getting more states to sign and implement additional \nprotocols will help the IAEA to gain that access. And once they get in, \nIAEA inspectors have shown a real ability to uncover information that \nrogue states thought they had concealed. But they are vitally dependent \nupon member states--and especially the United States--for the equipment \nand training that enable them to know what to look for and how to \ndetect it in a manner that is scientifically valid, maximizes detection \ncapabilities, and preserves a chain of custody so as to leave no doubt \nabout the validity of their analysis.\n\n  U.S. ratification of our Additional Protocol is only one step among \nmany that are needed to make nuclear non-proliferation work. Even to \nbring the Additional Protocol into force, we will then need to enact \nimplementing legislation; the Executive branch will then have to \npromulgate appropriate regulations; and preparations for possible IAEA \ninspections will have to be completed.\n  In addition, the United States must marshal all its foreign policy \ntools to move states of concern away from nuclear weapons and to foster \nfurther international cooperation on non-proliferation. Some good work \nhas been done in recent months. Libya signed an agreement with the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom to give up its weapons of mass \ndestruction and long-range ballistic missile programs. The \nProliferation Security Initiative was created and cooperating states \nagreed to coordinate their interdiction efforts while adhering to \ninternational law. The permanent members of the United Nations Security \nCouncil agreed on a draft resolution to bar proliferation to non-state \nentities.\n  At the same time, however, much remains to be done. For example, \nNorth Korea continues to move toward having a large enough nuclear \narsenal that it might contemplate using it, or even selling or giving \naway some of its nuclear weapons or fissile material. Meanwhile, \nalthough we have engaged in six-party talks that included North Korea, \nboth we and the North Koreans have yet to give our negotiators the \nauthority to get down to business and discuss a phased agreement under \nwhich North Korea would gradually dismantle all its nuclear weapons and \nlong-range ballistic missile programs, in return for various security \nassurances and diplomatic or economic benefits. So nothing significant \nhas yet been achieved on the diplomatic front, while the clock keeps \nticking on the nuclear weapons front. And we face the risk that South \nKorea, a crucial player on this issue, will develop a policy that is at \nodds with ours.\n  The situation regarding Iran is also difficult, although much has \nbeen achieved in the last year. Exposure of Iran's two decades of lying \nand deception regarding its nuclear activities has led Iran to sign the \nAdditional Protocol and to permit IAEA inspections that have proven \nquite embarrassing to Iran. Pursuant to an agreement with the foreign \nministers of the United Kingdom, France and Germany, Iran has also \nagreed to suspend all its uranium enrichment and reprocessing \nactivities. Iran has tried to backtrack on its commitments, and I \npersonally have no confidence that Iran has come clean on its nuclear \nweapons efforts. So we must continue to press Iran to realize that its \nnational interest will best be served by rejecting nuclear weapons. We \nmust work to maintain solidarity with our European allies, with the \nRussian Federation, with Japan, and with the IAEA to send the message \nthat Iran's real choice is between international acceptance and world \nrejection. I don't think that Iran wants to become another North Korea. \nWe must make clear that the path of nuclear weapons can lead only to \nsuch a fate, and also that the path of non-proliferation will lead to a \nbetter future for Iran and all of its people.\n  We must also work to make the international nuclear non-proliferation \nregime still more effective. One element of the NPT is a promise to \nnon-nuclear weapons states that, in return for forswearing nuclear \nweapons, they will enjoy the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology. \nThat bargain has become frayed. Iran, Iraq and North Korea have all \nused their ostensibly civilian facilities to mask covert weapons \nprograms.\n  In Iran and North Korea, we were at least able to sound the alarm. \nBoth states had secret efforts to produce weapons-grade plutonium and \nhighly enriched uranium and were caught. In Iraq, however, absent the \nGulf War of 1991, Saddam Hussein might have obtained highly enriched \nuranium without anybody realizing it.\n  A smarter state, using a civilian program as the rationale, could \nbuild uranium enrichment facilities, spent fuel reprocessing cells, and \nthe like--and properly report these efforts to the IAEA. It could \nacquire weapons-grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium, and place \nthe material under IAEA safeguards. In other words, it could become a \npotential nuclear weapons\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\npower without violating safeguards. Then it could withdraw from the \nNPT, and develop and assemble nuclear weapons in a short time.\n  That's the challenge we need to address. How do we counter not just \nstates that do things in a ham-handed manner, but states that \nskillfully exploit the loopholes of the NPT? The Additional Protocol \ncan help make it much harder to hide a covert nuclear program, if we \npersuade the rest of the world to sign such protocols as well. But how \ncan we combat the ``breakout'' scenario?\n  One idea gaining currency is to allow non-nuclear weapons states to \ncontinue to possess civilian nuclear programs, but not a closed nuclear \nfuel cycle. A state could have civilian nuclear reactors to produce \nelectrical power, but must import the nuclear reactor fuel and return \nany spent fuel. This would ensure that a state did not obtain fissile \nmaterial needed for a nuclear weapon.\n  IAEA Director General Mohammed El-Baradei would allow only \nmultinational facilities to produce and process nuclear fuels, and give \nlegitimate end-users assured access to these fuels at reasonable rates. \nGen. Brent Scowcroft and Dr. William Perry recently endorsed this \nproposal, adding that states that refuse this bargain should be subject \nto sanctions. President Bush has not endorsed multinational facilities, \nbut called upon members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to refuse to \nexport enrichment and reprocessing equipment to any state that does not \nalready possess full scale enrichment and reprocessing plants.\n  Any agreement on revising the nuclear non-proliferation regime will \nbe difficult to achieve. Non-nuclear weapons states will ask what they \nwill get for surrendering a well established right. States with nuclear \nfuel industries may worry that they will go out of business if only a \nfew multinational facilities are allowed to operate enrichment and \nreprocessing activities. But the United States and other concerned \nstates should set a goal of reaching a consensus in time for next \nyear's NPT Review Conference. We have a window of opportunity, and we \nshould use it.\n  There is another bargain central to the NPT, one that this \nadministration largely prefers to ignore. In return for forswearing \nnuclear weapons, non-nuclear weapons states received a commitment from \nthe five permanent nuclear powers, reaffirmed as recently as 2000, to \nseek eventual nuclear disarmament.\n  Nobody, including me, expects the United States to give up its \nnuclear deterrent any time in the foreseeable future. But the \nadministration's drive to research and possibly produce new nuclear \nweapons--including low-yield nukes--is a step in the wrong direction. \nIt signals to the rest of the world that even the preeminent global \npower needs new nuclear weapons to assure its own security.\n  The administration threatens to take another backward step on a \nFissile Material Cutoff Treaty. An FMCT has been a U.S. objective for \neight years, and this administration castigated other countries for \npreventing negotiations from starting. Now that there is a chance of \nsuccess, however, the administration says that we may refuse to \nnegotiate. This only undermines solidarity with our allies, which have \nworked for years to help us convince other countries to negotiate.\n  For all the flaws of the NPT, it is an essential treaty. It has been \nvital to encouraging states like Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, South \nAfrica, Brazil and Argentina to end their nuclear weapons programs. The \nUnited States must work to improve the nuclear non-proliferation \nregime, and it must also do all that it can to abide by the bargains \nbetween the nuclear ``haves'' and the nuclear ``have nots'' that \nunderlie world willingness to eschew the most awesome and awful weapons \nmankind has ever invented.\n  In conclusion, I want to congratulate and thank my chairman, Senator \nDick Lugar, for his fine leadership in bringing this resolution of \nratification to fruition. It was not an easy task, and he demonstrated \nexceptional leadership. I am grateful also to our staffs, especially \nKen Myers, III and Thomas Moore on the majority side, and Edward Levine \nand Jofi Joseph on the Democratic side. Finally, I want to commend the \ninteragency committee that worked with us, and especially Ms. Susan \nKoch of the National Security Council staff. She is a real \nprofessional, and we would not have gotten to this day without her.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion about \nhigh gasoline prices lately, and rightly so because gasoline prices are \nas high as they have ever been in the history of our country and, in \nthe process, not only taking a lot of money out of the pockets of \nworking men and women, but harming the overall economy. And the full \nimpact has not been felt yet.\n  In the process of hearing so many remarks and concerns about this \nsituation, as we heard for a half hour a few minutes ago from one of \nour colleagues from the other side of the aisle, I wonder if we are not \nhearing so many speeches from the other side of the\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\naisle on the issue of energy because it was the other side of the aisle \nthat led a filibuster against the national energy policy we had before \nus last November. Maybe there is some guilt on their part about \ndefeating a national energy policy, as it was through a Democratic \nfilibuster.\n  I thought since that vote, when we had 58 votes and only needed 2 \nmore to get cloture, to get to finality on a bill that was passed \noverwhelmingly by this body, that bill would have been the national \nenergy policy. It would have been the first national energy policy that \npassed this body for probably a dozen or more years, and it is now \nneeded more than ever before, but we needed two more votes. It is so \npuzzling to me that 46 out of 49 Democrats can stick together when they \nwant to defeat very well-qualified judges the President sends up here, \nso well qualified they have the highest rating of the American Bar \nAssociation, and yet when we had a national energy policy, we adopted \nthat national energy policy 3 or 4 months after the Northeast blackout \nlast August and just before we knew energy prices were going to go up \nbecause OPEC announced they were going to shut off the spigot, why \ncouldn't we get more than 13 out of 49 Democrats, considering the \nunanimity of holding the caucus together to defeat judges, and the \nDemocratic leader was very much in favor of the Energy bill but he \nvoted to stop debate? Why couldn't more than 13 Democrats help bring \nabout a national energy policy?\n  Now we are hearing so much from the other side that one wonders if \nthey don't have a somewhat guilty conscience about that vote.\n  We only needed two more Democrats. There are at least four Democrats \nfrom corn-producing States who should have been voting for cloture \nbecause this bill was so good for the ethanol industry, as an example, \nproducing ethanol, a renewable fuel to mix with gasoline, to stretch \ngasoline, but we had four Democrats on the other side from corn-\nproducing States who did not vote. We only needed two of them.\n  Also, this was a very comprehensive energy policy, so comprehensive \nit was well balanced with tax incentives for fossil fuels, tax \nincentives for renewables and alternative energy, and tax incentives \nfor conservation. In fact, the speech we just heard was a lot about \nconservation, tax incentives for conservation, and they do not want to \nvote to stop a Democratic filibuster and move the bill along? It is \nvery puzzling. I do not understand it. It makes one wonder: Are we \nhearing all these speeches now since gas is way up, at the highest \nlevel in history, because maybe they have some shame because they \ndidn't want to vote to stop that filibuster last fall?\n  Then I hear some criticism toward the President about high gasoline \nprices. But what about the President of the United States leading the \nway ever since he has been in office to get this Congress to adopt a \nnational energy policy, and Congress came within two votes, but a \nDemocratic filibuster killed it, and the President is getting blamed \nfor a national energy policy he has been pushing that the other side \nkilled?\n  Is there some guilt, some shame on the other side trying to detract \nfrom what the President has been trying to do? Is there some shame on \nthe other side when they were in the majority in 2001 and 2002 and \ncould not produce a national energy policy?\n  We have had an opportunity to move forward with a national energy \npolicy, and those people who are giving the speeches condemning the \nPresident or concerned about high prices, what about helping us to \nreconsider that vote of last November--it can be reconsidered--and \nbring cloture and finality to the bill, and we can have a national \nenergy policy?\n  Is a national energy policy going to make a difference when it comes \nto high energy prices? You bet it is because it is sending a signal to \nOPEC that we have our act put together and we are prepared to respond.\n  It very much broke the stranglehold of OPEC in 1982 when President \nReagan deregulated the cost controls that we had on petroleum. For the \nnext 20 years, OPEC was irrelevant because it told the rest of the \nworld that we are not going to hold our product off the market. When we \nestablish not only our own incentives for producing our own fossil \nfuels to a greater extent than we are today but also that we are going \na whole new route of having a national energy policy on renewables and \nalternative energy and also that we are going to have incentives for \nconservation, it is going to send that same clear signal to OPEC?\n  OPEC is meeting maybe right this very day to say to the rest of the \nworld: We are going to shut our spigots down another million barrels a \nday. And all the time the Senate is languishing because of a Democrat \nfilibuster last November of the Energy bill. They see inactivity on our \npart, and to a great extent it encourages them the same way they were \nencouraged when we had price controls on petroleum from 1979, 1980, and \n1981 until Reagan finally took them off. I hope we will have less \nspeeches from the other side and votes in favor of ethanol and \nbiodiesel, all of those things that are good for the agricultural \ncommunities of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, as well as Iowa and \nMinnesota. They are good for the environment because ethanol and \nbiodiesel are cleaner burning than fossil fuels; good for the \nagricultural economy because when the bill is fully implemented, we \nwould be using 20 percent of our corn crop to produce ethanol and will \neventually be doing the same thing with the soybean crop and biodiesel. \nWe will also be conserving as well.\n  Yet what do we get from the Members of those States when they have an \nopportunity to do something? They vote no, under some excuse that we \nare not going to be able to maybe have some lawsuits that they want to \nhave.\n  Do they want chocolate cake for lawyers or do they want lower \ngasoline prices? Do they want chocolate cake for their lawyers--because \nthe whole new realm of lawsuits after tobacco and after asbestos, that \nis where those lawyers are going to go, suing the energy companies--or \ndo they want a cleaner environment? Do they want chocolate cake for \ntheir lawyers or do they want to help their farmers? Do they want \nchocolate cake for their lawyers or do they want to send a signal to \nOPEC that we have our act together and we are going to play in this \nenergy game and we are not going to be in a stranglehold by those oil \nsheiks? I think the choice is pretty clear. I hope we get some action \nand less words.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/31/senate-section/article/S3516-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECESS UNTIL 9:30 TOMORROW\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
