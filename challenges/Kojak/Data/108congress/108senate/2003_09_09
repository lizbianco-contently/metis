Mr. President, I have been asked by the majority leader \nto make the following statement.\n  For the information of all Senators, this morning the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2660, the Labor, HHS, and Education \nappropriations bill. There are a number of pending amendments that will \nneed to be disposed of and it is therefore my hope that we can reach an \nagreement to vote in relation to those amendments. Many of these \namendments have been fully debated and will require a rollcall vote.\n  I understand that on the other side of the aisle there is a \nreluctance to vote on any of the amendments until an agreement is \nreached with respect to the Harkin amendment. I encourage Members to \nallow us to move forward on the bill until that issue is resolved. \nThere are a number of amendments that were pending prior to the Harkin \namendment. Again, these amendments have been debated previously and are \nat this stage ready--should be ready for the Senate to work its will. \nTherefore, I hope we can begin to schedule those votes to allow further \nprogress on the bill.\n  Rollcall votes are anticipated throughout the day and it is still my \nexpectation to complete the Labor-HHS bill as early as possible this \nweek.\n\n  Also, I would supplement what the leader has said, that there is no \nreason we can't finish this bill if we can get a schedule of votes. It \nconceivably could be done today but certainly no later than tomorrow if \nwe move ahead and break this logjam as to when the votes are going to \noccur.\n  The leader concludes his own statement: As a reminder, today the \nSenate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly party lunches to \nmeet.\n  In addition to the comments I have read on behalf of the leader, as \nthe manager of the bill I would supplement what the leader has said to \nurge us to move forward. There is a certain reluctance, understandable \nreluctance, on the part of the Members on this side of the aisle, to \nbe, in effect, dictated to as to when we are going to vote.\n  I understand the problems faced by the Democrats, where they have a \nnumber of people running for President who are out of town. From my \npersonal point of view, I would like to accommodate them and I would \nlike to move on. But it draws considerable consternation and ire to be \ntold when we are going to vote.\n  I had a colloquy yesterday with the Senator from Iowa, a colleague \nand a very good friend with whom I have worked very closely for more \nthan a decade. There is scarcely a disagreement between Senator Harkin \nand myself. As we change control of the gavel, we use the expression, \n``change seamlessly.'' But I pointed out, we have a majority, and under \nthe rules of the Senate, the majority is supposed to determine the \nschedule. It is not a very big prerogative. We can't impose our will \nbeyond a filibuster. And the Senators on the other side of the aisle \nare competent, able, resourceful as they articulate their views and \ncarry their policies forward. That is something we understand.\n  But when it comes to a matter of the schedule it is my hope that the \nmajority's prerogative to establish the schedule will be respected.\n  When I commented about our being in the majority, my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Harkin said: Well, it's only 51 to 48 and 1.\n  There have been closer elections. There have been elections by 1 \nvote, not by 2\\1/2\\ votes.\n  So it is my hope that we can at least be accorded the prerogative of \nrunning the schedule. If people on this side of the aisle dig in their \nheels, like people on the other side of the aisle, and people on the \nother side of the aisle dig in their heels, we are not going to be able \nto conduct the people's business.\n\n  I see the Senator from Nevada waiting to speak. I will conclude. The \nSenator from Nevada has been in the Chamber more in the past several \nyears than anybody else, managing the business of the Senate. He has \ndone that when he has been in the majority and\n\n[[Page S11192]]\n\nhe has done that in the minority. I know he does his utmost to try to \nwork these matters out.\n  So it is my hope that reason will prevail and we can find a way to \nget out of the entrenched positions, move ahead, do the public's \nbusiness, and finish this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11192-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my friend. He is \nabsolutely right. He and Senator Harkin have set an example after which \nmany of us have modeled our responsibilities on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I would say this. I think we should. I agree with the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Why don't we go ahead and finish this bill? I think we \nhave lost the time--we won't be able to do it today, but maybe we could \ndo it tomorrow.\n  I had suggested and made a unanimous consent request that there be a \nvote at 3:15. When do you want the vote today? It is the pending \namendment. When do you want the vote? I would say that. Let's vote on \nthat. We have a number of amendments on which we can go ahead and vote. \nWe have a couple more people who want to speak on the overtime issue, \nbut they could do that quickly.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, check with the majority leader. \nSee when he wants the vote. He can set the vote on overtime. We won't \nset it. Let him set it. Set the time for that. We can go ahead and \ndispose of other amendments. I think if he came back and said fine, \nvote on it at 2:15, or whenever--give us a suggestion--then we will try \nto finish this bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would direct this question to the \nSenator from Nevada. He says let the majority leader determine when the \nvote should be set. I would agree with that. But suppose the majority \nleader says we ought to take the Harkin amendment vote after we take \nthe votes on the other amendments?\n  Mr. REID. Fine.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And vote, but not necessarily today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to my----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let me add, I personally don't object to \nvoting today, but there are a lot of people on this side of the aisle \nwho do as a matter of protocol and principle.\n  That is why I am going to leave the Chamber in a few minutes and, \nalong with the President pro tempore, who is the chairman of the full \ncommittee, discuss the matter with the majority leader.\n  But as I understand the position of the Senator from Nevada and his \nside of the aisle, it is that they insist on the vote today.\n  Am I incorrect about that?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have never in the past 6 months, during \nthe time four Members are running in the Presidential campaign, said to \nthe majority that we can't vote today because people are running for \nPresident. We have never done that. We have lost by one vote. And we \nhave gone ahead and refiled amendments. We have taken our lumps.\n  On this occasion, we gave adequate notice that we think it is a good \nidea to vote on Tuesday. But we never tried to play games as to why we \nwanted that. We have done this on one occasion. This is an extremely \nimportant vote for the country.\n  What I am saying is that I guess we are in a no-win situation. If the \nmajority leader says we are not going to vote on it today, then I don't \nsee any alternative. But we are not going to be able to finish this \nbill. This is an important bill for the people of the State of Nevada.\n  It is an important bill for the people of this country. But the \novertime issue is also an important issue.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania that we are going to vote on \nthis issue whether it is on this bill or if we are unable to finish \nthis bill when it comes back or on a continuing resolution--however it \ngets here. We have a right to vote on this amendment.\n  I don't understand why we cannot have a vote sometime today. That is \nmy point. Let the leader schedule it, if he wants to, right now. Do it \nnow. If he wants to do it at 6 o'clock tonight--whenever he wants to do \nit--we can set it up and get rid of all of these other amendments and \nbe in pretty good shape to finish this bill tomorrow sometime.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we will try to find the position of the \nleader on this issue as he represents the majority. We will report back \nas promptly as we can.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may say one other thing, this kind of \nreminds me of Roger Miller. He was a songwriter. He wrote songs which I \nidentified with more than my friend from Pennsylvania who probably \nlikes opera and other things. But one of the lines in one of the songs \nwhich Roger Miller wrote was pride is the chief reason for the decline \nin the number of husbands and wives. I think that is really true. That \nis what we have here. We are being prideful saying I got you and you \ngot me. Why don't we, as adults, try to work this out so we can have a \nvote on overtime. We want it at 3:15. Have the leader set it any time \nhe wants today but complete the other amendments that are important. It \nis a tough vote. There is no question about that. Most of them are 60-\nvote waivers.\n  I would like to finish this bill. I know the Presiding Officer has a \nreal interest in this. Once we knock this out, we have eight more \nappropriations bills to go. We might be able to do another one this \nweek. That would leave seven. That puts us in pretty good shape to \nfinish all of this.\n  We want a certain time this afternoon, but we can do it some other \ntime. We will swallow whatever pride we have, and hopefully you folks \nwill, and we can finish this bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada has articulated \nsome wisdom this morning in his comments about pride. I think of the \nstatement ``pride goeth before a fall.'' I think we can retain our \npride and also get this worked out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11192-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week the Labor Department announced we \nhad lost almost 100,000 more jobs in the month of August. Almost 9 \nmillion American people are unemployed. Almost 2 million of these \npeople have been out of work for more than 6 months. As bad as these \nnumbers are, the real story is even worse. These figures don't include \n1.7 million people who want work but have given up looking for it and \nare no longer counted in the unemployed listed by the Labor Department. \nThey don't qualify.\n  The problem is especially frightening among minority groups. \nUnemployment among African Americans is double the rate for whites. It \nis much harder for Hispanic and Asian Americans to find jobs.\n  Some may have heard the economy in Nevada is booming. We are so \nfortunate. It isn't as bad as it is in some places. But ``booming'' is \nnot the proper term for it. People in Nevada, as good as it is, are \nhaving a lot of problems. We have more than 90,000 people out of work. \nThese numbers are grim, and they don't even begin to tell the story.\n  Every time we lose a job, it threatens another family's American \ndream--the dream of owning a home, building a strong community, giving \nchildren a good education.\n  Some have said the economy is recovering. But is it recovering when \nwe are still losing jobs to the tune of 100,000 a month? We know job \nloss is not a normal function of the business cycle. Job loss reflects \nmore serious underlying problems with our economy such as the alarming \nloss of manufacturing jobs. In the last 3 years, we lost 16 percent of \nour manufacturing jobs. This is serious, and we need to take it \nseriously. We need a plan to create more jobs.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's only plan seems to be more of the \nsame. Since January of 2001, we have lost more than 3 million jobs. \nThis is the first administration since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs, and \nour President says more of the same.\n  We have to do something different. Instead of a continual program of \ntax breaks for those who have the most, we have to create jobs for \nthose who want to work. We can create jobs by building new schools, \nroads, bridges, by rebuilding our decaying sewer systems, and by \nreplacing broken water pipes. Any State in the Union qualifies for new \nschools, new roads, new bridges, and, of course, rebuilding our \ndecaying sewer systems and replacing broken water pipes.\n  All over America there are plans no longer on the drawing boards. \nThey are ready to be executed. They just need the money. We can create \njobs. For every billion dollars we spend on a public works project, we \ncreate 47,000 high-paying jobs. We can also create jobs by promoting \nnew technology to produce energy, and we can do this by having a view \nthat we should do more with renewable, nonpolluting sources. This will \nnot only create jobs, it will benefit our environment and help us \nachieve energy independence.\n  We can save existing jobs by helping our financially burdened States \nso they do not have to raise taxes on working families and small \nbusinesses. We can reverse this trend. We can save the jobs we have and \nhelp create new ones. We have to be innovative.\n  I hope the President will consider joining with this Senator and \nothers who want to push what we call the American Marshall Plan; that \nis, have the Federal Government spend money to create jobs. These jobs \nare not Government jobs; they are private sector jobs.\n  I repeat, for every $1 billion we spend, there are 47,000 high-paying \njobs, and the spinoff from those jobs is unbelievably large. That is \nwhat we need to do. America needs it. We need it to create jobs, but we \nalso need it to make America a better place to live with better roads, \nbridges, dams, cleaner water, and able to adequately dispose of our \nsewer problems.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can do some of these activities in the \nimmediate future, and I hope we are joined by the administration.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1580\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last week I offered an amendment to the \npending appropriations bill that would prevent the administration from \nimplementing a new regulation that could result in millions of American \nworkers losing their overtime pay protection.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. It would allow the \nadministration to increase overtime pay protection for working \nAmericans but not take it away from those who currently have that \nprotection.\n  I was quite surprised, as a matter of fact, to come to work yesterday \nand find that on Friday, after we had debated this appropriations \nbill--we adopted a couple of amendments on the appropriations bill last \nFriday, and, we all know, at the end of the day, the leader always has \nunanimous consent requests agreed to that have been worked out on both \nsides. I was quite surprised to see that last Friday, the Senate passed \nunanimously, by consent, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution supporting a \nbalance between work and personal life being in the best interest of \nnational worker productivity and families.\n  S. Res. 210 was adopted last Friday. It is sponsored by Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Alexander, and I assume others. It expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that supporting a balance between work and \npersonal life is in the best interest of national worker productivity \nand that the President should issue a proclamation designating October \nas ``National Work and Family Month.''\n  I will read a few of the clauses that we all voted for last Friday:\n\n       Whereas the quality of workers' jobs and the supportiveness \n     of their workplaces are key predictors of job \n     productivity, job satisfaction, commitment to employers \n     and retention. . . .\n       Whereas employees who feel overworked tend to feel less \n     successful in their relationships with their spouses, \n     children, and friends, and tend to neglect themselves, feel \n     less healthy, and feel more stress;\n       Whereas 85 percent of U.S. wage and salaried workers have \n     immediate, day-to-day family responsibilities off the job;\n       Whereas 46 percent of wage and salaried workers are parents \n     with children under the age of 18 who live with them at least \n     half-time;\n       Whereas job flexibility allows parents to be more involved \n     in their children's lives, and parental involvement is \n     associated with children's higher achievement in language and \n     mathematics, improved behavior, greater academic persistence, \n     and lower dropout rates. . . .\n       Whereas nearly all working adults are concerned about \n     spending more time with their immediate family. . . .\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) reducing the conflict between work and family life \n     should be a national priority; and\n       (B) the month of October should be designated as ``National \n     Work and Family Month'';\n       (2) the Senate requests that the President issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe ``National Work and Family Month'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n  We adopted this resolution last Friday, unanimously. Maybe some did \nnot know about it. I did not know about it either, but I support it. It \nsounds very\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\ngood: It is the sense of the Senate that reducing the conflict between \nwork and family life should be a national priority.\n  We have this resolution, and now we have the proposal by the \nadministration, rolled out this spring under cover of darkness--there \nwas not one public hearing anywhere in the Nation--which changes rules \nand regulations that will affect overtime protection for over 8 million \nAmerican workers and their families.\n  It is interesting that the administration did not ask us to change \nthe law. No, they just want to do it by rules and regulations.\n  We cannot have it both ways. We cannot have a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution saying--we all say--we have to reduce the conflict between \nwork and family life, and it ought to be a national priority; that \npeople need to spend more time with their families, and then let the \nadministration implement these changes in rules and regulations which \nmean that people will have to work longer hours with less pay. That is \nexactly what it means: longer hours with less pay.\n  I found it so interesting that we have been debating my amendment--it \ncame up last week. I guess we talked about it a couple of times during \nthe week. We talked about it at length on Thursday. We spoke about it \non Friday, and yet on the very same day we adopt a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution unanimously saying we want to reduce stress on families. We \nwant to recognize that workers need more time with their families. \nWell, OK, here is a chance to not just have a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution but to take concrete action to make sure that happens by \ntelling the administration that we are not going to permit these \nchanges in rules and regulations that would take away overtime \nprotection for up to 8 million people.\n\n  Again, a quick summary of the Bush administration's proposal is \nsimply this: Eliminate the 40-hour workweek by allowing employers to \ndeny millions of workers overtime pay, workers who are currently \nguaranteed overtime pay protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act \npassed in 1938. This proposal is antiworker. It is antifamily. It is \nthe antithesis, the total opposite, of what we passed on Friday as a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is an attack on America's middle and \nlower income workers. It will not create one job. In fact, just the \nopposite; it will kill a lot of jobs.\n  Why do I say that? Because employers right now know that if workers \nwork more than 40 hours a week, they have to pay time and a half \novertime. So in many cases, they might find it better to go ahead and \nhire someone new, hire another person, rather than paying that kind of \novertime pay.\n  Let's say one changes the rules of the game. No longer is one \nprotected by time and a half. That means their employer can say they \nneed them to work 43 hours this week, 44 hours, 45, but guess what. \nThey do not get any more money. They get the same salary they had \nbefore. They just do not get any more money.\n  Now, what is an employer going to do? Why, here is a new pool of \nlabor that is not going to cost him a cent. So why would they go hire \nsomeone new to work when they can take an existing person and say work \nlonger at no extra pay?\n  Employers will have a financial disincentive to hire new workers if \nthey can force current workers to work these longer hours without pay.\n  Who are we talking about? We are talking about nurses--again, we have \na nursing shortage right now and we are trying to get more nurses--\npolice officers, firefighters, retail managers, insurance claim \nadjustors, journalists, medical technicians, paralegals, surveyors, \nsecretaries, and so on. For most of those men and women, the overtime \npay they earn is not spare change. It is not for frivolous spending. \nSometimes it is essential to help pay the mortgage, feed the children, \npay for college, and save for retirement.\n  In fact, I have a recent letter from the National Association of \nPolice Organizations which represents thousands of law enforcement \nofficers from across the country. They oppose the administration's \nproposal because, as they said:\n\n       Under such regulations, America's State and local law \n     enforcement officers, already strained by countless overtime \n     hours ensuring community safety from terrorist threats, could \n     lose their basic benefit accorded to them for their efforts.\n\n  A few days ago President Bush was asked a question about my \namendment. He said that basically I was wrong. He said that the \nproposal would increase overtime coverage for low-income workers.\n  Interestingly enough, part of the proposal does raise the income \nthreshold, and I will get into that in a minute. So he says it is going \nto cover more people. The other part of the proposal, though, in \nchanging the rules, would result in up to 8 million people losing \novertime pay protection.\n  By raising this income threshold, most of the people who are already \ngetting overtime pay are already over that threshold so they are going \nto be covered anyway. They are covered now. They are going to be \ncovered then. So it is really not going to increase the number of \npeople paid overtime pay because they are already getting it. But do \nnot take my word for it. This is what industry and their consultants \nhad to say about it from Hewitt Associates. On their Web they say their \nclients include half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. This is \nwhat Hewitt Associates said:\n\n       These proposed changes likely will open the door for \n     employers to reclassify a large number of previously \n     nonexempt employees as exempt--\n\n  Meaning exempt from overtime pay.\n\n       The resulting effect on compensation and morale could be \n     detrimental, as employees previously accustomed to earning, \n     in some cases, significant amounts of overtime would suddenly \n     lose that opportunity.\n\n  The administration argues the proposal they are putting out is simply \nto update and clarify current regulations under the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. Again, the Society for Human Resource Management, which \ntouts itself on its Web site as the world's largest association devoted \nto human resource management, said the following:\n\n       This is going to affect every workplace, every employee and \n     every professional.\n\n  I will explain a little bit about how some of these rules work right \nnow. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, hourly workers are \ngenerally guaranteed overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours a \nweek. Many salaried workers are also eligible for overtime pay under \nthis law. The administration's proposal will make it much easier for \nemployers to deny salaried workers overtime pay protection. The result: \nMillions of salaried workers earning more than $22,100 a year would be \ndenied overtime under the proposed changes. This proposal would keep \nworkers from spending time with their families without compensation.\n  Now, we said last week we want workers to spend more time with their \nfamilies. One of the ways to do that is if they have guaranteed \novertime.\n  Maybe the employer says, well, I do not need an employee to work \novertime because I have to pay time and a half. Well, now if I do not \nhave to pay them time and a half, they can work 44, 48 hours a week and \nI do not have to pay anything extra.\n  I have always thought at least--and I think it has sort of been \ngenerally accepted as a kind of a social contract in this country--that \nwe wanted people to spend more time with their families, but if an \nemployer needed someone to work overtime, that they would be \ncompensated for that at more than just their regular pay because we \nwere taking away the time they could spend with their family that would \nbe beyond their normal workweek, and therefore we paid time and a half, \nor on Sundays sometimes double time, for that kind of overtime.\n  Right now, American workers already work longer hours than any \nindustrialized country and nearly all Third World countries. This is a \nchart that shows that. U.S. work hours increase, over the years, while \nthose in other industrialized nations decrease. Here is the change in \nannual average hours worked from 1979 to 2000. We see in the United \nStates it went up 32 hours. In Japan, it has fallen 386 hours; Germany, \nfallen 489 hours; France, fallen 244 hours; Italy, 88; United Kingdom, \n107 hours; Canada, minus 31 hours; Australia, minus 44 hours. This is \nfrom the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2001.\n  Already, our workers are working more than their counterparts in all \nof\n\n[[Page S11195]]\n\nthese countries, from Japan to Australia to the United Kingdom, France, \nand Germany. They have made a decision in those countries that one can \nstill have high productivity and still give workers time off to be with \ntheir families, and they have a better social system and stronger \nfamilies because of it, and because workers are not working so much \nthey are more productive in the time they do work. In America we just \nkeep on working people more and more, longer hours all the time. So \nalready American workers are working longer hours.\n\n  Under this proposal put out by the Bush administration to take away \novertime protection, in a few years this number is going to be \nskyrocketing. As I said before, it is not enough that we export all of \nour manufacturing jobs out of this country to Third World countries; \nnow we are importing Third World labor standards into this country: No \nlabor protections and no overtime protection, just work however long \nyour employer wants you to work without overtime pay protection.\n  Major women's organizations, including the National Partnership for \nWomen and Families and the American Association of University Women, \noppose the administration's proposal because they fear an increase in \nmandatory overtime would take time away from families and disrupt the \nschedules of working parents as well as impose additional childcare and \nother expenses.\n  I said last week that the first wave of people who will be hit, if \nthis proposed change goes through, will be women. This charts show what \nI mean and why it will be women who will be hit first and hardest. I am \nnot saying men won't be hit; they will be. But I am saying the first \nwave of people hit the hardest by taking away overtime pay protection \nwill be women.\n  If we look at the labor force participation rate for men and women \nfrom 1948 until today, we see participation of women has climbed \ndramatically. Women's participation in the labor force climbed from \nslightly over 30 percent to over 60 percent, and participation rates \nfor men consequently have declined from about 88 percent to about 74 or \n75 percent. So it is women who have come into the workforce in the last \n30 or 40 years.\n  We see some other statistics here. We find that 61.3 percent of \nmarried couples with children were dual earners in 2002.\n  In 1975, 47.3 percent of women with children were in the labor force. \nIn 2002, it was 71.8 percent.\n  Women with children under 3--in 1975, only 34 percent of women with \nchildren under age 3 were in the workforce. Now it is over 60 percent \nof women with children under 3 who are in the workforce. And 66 percent \nof women with children worked 40 hours or more in 2002.\n  Who are these women? Bookkeepers, paralegals, clerks, nurses, \nphysical therapists, social workers, et cetera, those who are really \ndoing the nitty-gritty hard work to keep our society together. These \nare the facts right here. Now we are going to tell these women: Sorry, \nwe know you have children in daycare, we know you have to pay a lot for \nchildcare, but we need you to work longer hours per week.\n  Maybe in the past, if these women had worked longer hours, they got \ntime and a half for overtime, but now they will not; they will get the \nsame salary rate. Now they will have to continue to pay for more \nchildcare. Yet they will not get 1 cent more for their labors.\n  This chart also shows what is happening with middle-income families. \nRemember last week we passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying it \nis the sense of the Senate that reducing the conflict between work and \nfamily life should be a national priority? We recognized:\n\n       Whereas nearly all working adults are concerned \n     about spending more time with their immediate family;\n       Whereas 85 percent of U.S. wage and salaried workers have \n     immediate day-to-day family responsibilities off the job;\n       Whereas employees who feel overworked tend to feel less \n     successful in their relationships with their spouses, \n     children, and friends. . . .\n\n  That is what we said last week on the Senate floor.\n  Here is what is happening with our middle-income families. Average \nweeks worked per year by middle-income families with children: In 1969, \nthe number of average weeks worked per year by middle-income families \nwith children was 78.2. Look at it now, 97.9 weeks per year, average, \nfor a middle-income family in America with children. That is why I \nshowed this first chart, where you see the United States is going up in \nhours worked and all the other countries are going down. And you wonder \nwhy American workers and their families are stressed out, why we are \nhaving family strife in this country, why families are breaking up, why \nthe divorce rate gets higher, why our kids don't have parents around \nafter school to help nurture them. We wonder why we are having such \ntrouble in our society. Because we are not letting our working parents \nspend more time with their families.\n  Columnist Bob Herbert recently wrote in the New York Times:\n\n       You would think that an administration that has presided \n     over the loss of millions of jobs might want to strengthen \n     the protections of workers fortunate enough to still be \n     employed. But that's not what the Administration is about.\n\n  Since the Senate overwhelmingly supported the Hatch resolution last \nFriday, which I just quoted from--passed unanimously--I would think it \nwould be a no-brainer to support my amendment saying the administration \ncannot take away overtime pay protection for millions of Americans. But \nI don't know what the situation is right now with the leadership. We \nwanted to vote on it today. We wanted to vote on it today, but I guess \nthe leadership on that side, on the majority side--I don't know what \nthey are deciding right now, whether or not we can vote on it today or \nnot.\n  But we are all here.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania earlier mentioned something about \nDemocratic Presidential candidates being gone. That is true. They are \nrunning for President. The Senator from Pennsylvania sought the \nPresidency himself once. So did this Senator from Iowa. You know what \nit is like when you have to be out there on the campaign trail and \nattend to your duties here. But it just so happens everyone seems to be \nhere today. So why don't we vote today? Why is there an empty Chamber? \nWhy don't we move ahead and vote--now, later, I don't care when--and we \ncan wrap up this bill by tonight.\n  Again, I don't know why we would want to make it easier to deny \nAmerican workers overtime pay. Why would we want to make it easier? It \nseems to me we would want to make it tougher. If we want people to \nspend more time with their families, reduce that kind of stress, you \nwould think we would want to make it tougher, harder to deny American \nworkers overtime pay. But the proposed regulations of the Bush \nadministration would make it easier. I don't know. Why would we want to \ndo that? How would this help the economy? How does it strengthen \nfamilies? How does it help people who need to work overtime for extra \npay?\n\n  I read into the Record last Friday a statement by a worker--I forget \nwhat State she was from--who had a disabled child, and she was saying \nshe needed the overtime pay for her upkeep and to keep her child home \nand she relied on her overtime pay.\n  Here it is. Michael Farrar, from Jacksonville, FL. He and his wife \nneed overtime pay to support their 21-year-old disabled son Andy who \nlives with them. Michael Farrar said:\n\n       When I took this job, it was clear that I was expected to \n     work more than 40 hours per week. And I agreed to it because \n     I knew I'd need the money. We'd be devastated without the \n     overtime now--we have no more corners to cut.\n       When I took this job it was clear that I was expected to \n     work more than 40 hours a week. And I agreed to it because I \n     knew I would need the money.\n\n  Michael Farrar of Jacksonville, FL.\n  Sheila Perez of Bremerton, WA said:\n\n       I began my career as a supply clerk earning $3.10 an hour \n     in 1976.\n       I entered an upward mobility program and received training \n     to become an engineer technician with a career ladder that \n     gave me a yearly boost of income. It seemed though that even \n     with a decent raise each year I really relied on overtime \n     income to help make ends meet. There are many more single \n     parents today with the same problem. How does one pay for the \n     car that broke down or the braces for the children's teeth?\n       When I as a working mother leave my 8-hour day job and go \n     home, my second shift begins. There is dinner to cook, dishes \n     to wash, laundry, and all the other house work\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\n     that must be done which adds another 3 to 4 hours to your \n     workday. When one has to put in extra hours at work, it takes \n     away from the time needed to take care of our personal needs. \n     It seems only fair that one should be compensated for that \n     extra effort.\n\n  These are not my words. These are the words of Sheila Perez of \nBremerton, WA.\n\n       It seems only fair that one should be compensated for that \n     extra effort. Overtime is a sacrifice of one's time, energy \n     and physical and mental well-being. Compensation should be \n     commensurate in the form of premium pay as it is a premium of \n     one's personal time, energy and expertise that is being used. \n     It has been a crime that many engineers and technicians were \n     paid less than even their straight time for overtime worked. \n     It has never made sense to me that the hours I work past my \n     normal 8 are of a lesser value when those additional hours \n     are a cost of my personal time.\n\n  What do we say to Sheila Perez? What do we say to Michael Farrar? I \nthink what we say to them is that we understand. We passed a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution last Friday. That is what we did. We passed a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that \nworkers are over-stressed and overworked. They are concerned about \nspending more time with their families. We said it is the sense of the \nSenate that reducing the conflict between work and family life should \nbe a national priority. Yes, Michael Farrar, that is what we said. Yes, \nSheila Perez, we said that on your behalf last Friday. But, Michael \nFarrar; but, Sheila Perez, today, on Tuesday, the week after, we are \nnot going to do one single thing to stop the Bush administration from \nchanging rules and regulations that will take away your overtime pay \nprotection.\n  It is not what we do, Ms. Perez or Mr. Farrar, that is important \naround here. It is what we say that is important. We said: We are on \nyour side. We understand your problems. Gosh, we think it should be a \nnational priority. But don't count on our votes to make it happen. \nListen to what we say but don't watch what we do around this place.\n  It is time for us to stand and be counted and to put into form what \nwe said last week the facts are. These are all nice words on a piece of \npaper. This is what we believe without actions to back up our beliefs.\n  What I am asking is the Senate now back up those nice words that we \nsaid last Friday in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution--back them up \nwith a strong vote saying that we are going to protect overtime pay \nprotection. We are not going to permit overtime pay protection to be \ntaken away. If you do not to strengthen it, or if you want to extend \novertime pay protection for more workers, that is fine. But don't take \nit away from the workers who now have it.\n\n  That is what this amendment that I have offered is all about. I am \nhopeful we can get to a vote on it today. We are here to vote. It is \nTuesday. It is already 11:30. We haven't had one vote today. Why not? \nWhy don't we vote on this? It is the pending amendment. I don't know \nwhy we can't vote on it. But evidently, for some reason, the Republican \nmajority doesn't want to vote on my amendment. The majority, for some \nreason, doesn't want to bring it up for a vote. Why, I don't know. \nAfter all, Republicans, as well as Democrats, voted unanimously last \nFriday saying that it is the sense of the Senate that reducing the \nconflict between work and family life should be a national priority. \nWhy we don't want to vote on this today, for the life of me, I can't \nunderstand.\n  I end my comments now, but I will be back to talk more about this \novertime issue because it is a national issue. It is one that strikes \nat the very heart of the middle-income and middle-class families in \nthis country. It is an issue that strikes at the very heart of our \nproductivity as a country. It is an issue that strikes at the very \nheart of what kind of society we want to be and to become. It strikes \nat the very heart of working women who have children and who want some \ntime, as Ms. Sheila Perez said, to attend to personal needs and to a \nsecond shift at home with their kids and family. That is what it \nstrikes.\n  It is time for us to do our duty, to do our job, to stand up for \nworking families and to stand up for the men and women of this country \nwho are now being overworked and underpaid. If this proposed change in \nregulations goes through, it will mean more overwork and more underpay. \nThat is the wrong direction for our country. It is time for the Senate \nto say no to these changes in regulations that would take away overtime \npay protection for millions of middle-income Americans.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Department of Labor overtime \nproposal is the latest in a series of assaults on working Americans \nthat began in the early days of this administration. Right out of the \ngate, the President made it his first legislative priority to overturn \na Federal ergonomics standard that was more than 10 years in the \nmaking. I am also concerned about the approach this administration has \ntaken on the collective bargaining process through its use of the \nRailway Labor Act and the Taft-Hartley Act. We have also seen the \nreintroduction in Congress of so-called ``family friendly'' workplace \nbills that we all know really seek to rob working families of vital \novertime pay.\n  In March of this year, the Department of Labor proposed a regulation \nthat builds upon these efforts to tear down worker protections by \ndenying millions of Americans vital overtime pay. This proposed rule \nwould change the three tests that must be met to declare a worker \nexempt from the wage and hour protections of the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, thus opening the door to denial of overtime benefits to more than \n8 million workers who currently are entitled to this extra pay for \nworking more than 40 hours per week.\n  Under current law, a worker must meet each of three tests to be \ndeclared exempt from overtime protections. First, workers earning less \nthan a certain level each week cannot be exempted. Second, workers must \nbe paid a set salary, not an hourly rate, in order to be exempt. \nFinally, only workers whose job responsibilities are primarily \nclassified as administrative, professional, or executive can be exempt \nfrom overtime protections. The proposed rule would reduce the \neducational levels required to be classified as a professional or \nadministrative employee, thus allowing employers to substitute as \nlittle as 2 years of work experience for education when considering \nwhether an employee should be entitled to overtime protections.\n  I am deeply concerned that the administration continues to \ncharacterize these changes to overtime protections as ``small'' or \n``insignificant.'' During an August 31 interview with National Public \nRadio, the Secretary of Labor said of the proposed rule, ``it's not an \novertime regulation. We have many, many overtime regulations. This is \nnot one of the major ones. This is a small part of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act that pertains to white collar workers. So it's got \nnothing to do with blue collar workers.''\n  The wage and hour protections of the FLSA are intended to protect all \nworkers from being forced to work excessive hours without additional \ncompensation. The Secretary's attempt to differentiate between white \ncollar and blue collar workers in such a way as to imply that only blue \ncollar workers are protected by the FLSA is troubling.\n  According to the Economic Policy Institute, EPI:\n\n       The revised regulations--would dramatically increase the \n     number of workers whose jobs are classified as professional, \n     administrative, or executive and therefore ineligible for \n     overtime pay. The blurring of the lines between managerial \n     and hourly staff, coupled with a downgrading of the \n     educational standards required to exempt employees from \n     overtime pay, will give employers a powerful incentive to \n     switch millions of workers from hourly to salaried status in \n     order to reap the benefit of a newly created pool of unpaid \n     overtime hours.\n\n  In essence, this rule would create a larger force of employees who \ncan be required to work longer hours for less pay. This could also mean \nfewer opportunities for paid overtime for the workers who would remain \neligible for it.\n  The administration has claimed that they are trying simply to update \nand clarify the FLSA as it applies to white collar employees. According \nto the Secretary:\n\n\n[[Page S11197]]\n\n\n       ``[W]hat we are trying to do is clarify a regulation that \n     has not been modernized in well over 50 years. And the \n     ambiguity in the regulation is impeding the Department's \n     ability to enforce the law so that we cannot protect workers \n     who need protection. So what we are trying to do is to \n     guarantee vulnerable, low-wage workers the overtime that they \n     deserve, and we also want to provide clarity so that business \n     people know what they're supposed to be doing.\n\n  It seems to me that the FLSA is abundantly clear: if a worker who is \ncovered by the act works more than 40 hours per week, he or she is \nentitled to time-and-a-half pay for each extra hour worked.\n  According to the EPI, the administration's proposed changes go far \nbeyond simple clarifications. ``It is troubling that such dramatic \nlosses in overtime protection are being proposed as a means of bringing \nclarity to the regulations and reducing litigation. As [our report] has \nshown--the proposed rule is rife with ambiguity and new terms--that \nwill spawn new litigation.''\n  The Secretary's contention that the FLSA has not been updated in 50 \nyears is just plain false. Congress has amended and revised the FLSA \nnumerous times since its enactment in 1938, most recently just 3 years \nago. I regret that this administration continues to characterize \nFederal labor protections as ``outdated'' and claims that it seeks to \n``update'' them for the new century, when, in fact, many of its \nproposals would roll back protections for workers around the country.\n  Who are the 8 million workers who will be affected by this proposed \nrule change? According to EPI, 257 ``white collar'' occupational groups \ncould be impacted. EPI did a detailed analysis of the effect of this \nrule on 78 of those occupational groups and found that 2.5 million \nsalaried employees and 5.5 million hourly workers would lose their \novertime protections under the proposed rule. And that is less than \nhalf of the occupational groups that would be covered by this rule \nchange.\n  By broadening the FLSA wage and hour exemptions, the Department of \nLabor is seeking to deny overtime benefits to a wide range of workers, \nincluding police officers, firefighters, and other first responders, \nnurses and other health care workers, postmasters, preschool teachers, \nand social workers, just to name a few.\n  I am deeply troubled that the administration would propose a rule \nthat would deny overtime benefits to the people who put their lives on \nthe line each and every day to protect our communities and those who \nwork in health care professions, which, of course, as we know, already \nare facing severe staffing shortages. I am also disappointed that the \nOffice of Management and Budget issued a ``Statement of Administration \nPolicy'' document on this bill that states that the President's \nadvisers would recommend that he veto this important appropriations \nbill if the Harkin amendment is adopted. I think it is irresponsible to \nthreaten to veto a bill that includes crucial funding for labor, \nhealth, and education programs because the administration, apparently, \nis digging in its heels about a proposal that would deny millions of \nAmericans overtime pay. I regret that this administration is so \ndetermined to undermine labor protections for American workers that it \nwould actually threaten to deny funding for schools, health care, job \ntraining, and other programs that it regularly claims are a priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support working families by supporting the \nHarkin amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just prior to the caucus recess I had the \nopportunity to talk to Senator Frist about the pending schedule. We \nboth had indicated to each other that it was our expectation we would \ntalk to the caucus about where we are with regard to that schedule. I \nhad indicated it would be my expectation we could complete our work on \nthe Labor, Education appropriations bill prior to September 11; I \ncouldn't guarantee it, but that would be my expectation. What we really \nwanted was an opportunity to do what Senator Harkin has been calling \nfor since he offered his amendment on the overtime regulation last \nFriday. We have said if we can get a vote, which is, of course, the \nright of any Senator to expect if he offers his amendment, if we have \nthat vote, if they cooperate, then certainly we can reciprocate. It is \nour desire is to reciprocate and cooperate.\n  However, I come to the floor this afternoon simply to reiterate how \nvitally important this issue is. Eight million people in this country \ntoday will be affected by the vote to be taken here. With absolutely no \nconsultation, with no public hearings, with little public debate, last \nspring the administration promulgated new rules weakening overtime \nprotection for workers. Again, as I said, there was no consultation \nwith us or the millions of workers affected before the most sweeping \nchange in overtime rules was issued.\n  The overtime regulations have changed over the years but, as Senator \nHarkin has so ably and eloquently pointed out, this is the first time \nthe Department of Labor has used their efforts to update the salary \nthreshold as a back door to take away overtime protection for millions \nof workers. This is a major constraint being created in the overtime \nrules.\n  What is remarkable is that overtime pay now accounts for 25 percent \nof the income of workers who work overtime--25 percent. These rules \naffect firefighters. It affects policemen. It affects first responders \nin various ways--emergency medical technicians, licensed practical \nnurses, pilots, dental hygienists, health technicians, electrical \ntechnicians, air traffic controllers. They are all affected, and that \nis not a complete list.\n  Senator Harkin has noted it was just last Friday we passed S. Res. \n210. I will not reread the whole thing, he did such a good job earlier \ntoday, but we cite:\n\n     . . . the more overworked employees feel, the more likely \n     they are to report making mistakes, feel anger and resentment \n     toward employers and coworkers, and look for a new job . . .\n       Whereas 46 percent of salaried workers are parents with \n     children under the age of 18 who live with them at least \n     half-time . . .\n       Whereas nearly one out of every four Americans--over 45 \n     million Americans--provided or arranged care for a family \n     member or friend in the past year . . .\n\n  With all those ``whereas's''--again, I will not repeat them all--we \nconcluded just last Friday, unanimously, that it is the position of the \nSenate that we should reduce the conflict between work and family life; \nthat this should be a national priority; that the month of October--\nnext month--should be designated as ``National Work and Family Month''; \nand that the President should issue a proclamation calling upon the \npeople of the United States to observe ``National Work and Family \nMonth'' with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  If I had been on the Senate floor, I would have offered an amendment. \nI would have called for the passage, as well, of the Harkin amendment. \nHow could you possibly proclaim ``National Work and Family Month'' and \nthen tell millions of workers who earn overtime pay that they don't \nhave the right to the protection that the Fair Labor Standards Act has \nprovided them now for over 65 years?\n  The Republicans' actions makes a mockery of this resolution.\n  This is a critical vote. Whether it is today, tomorrow, or it is at \nsome point in the future, we will have a vote on this legislation. We \nwill vote on whether to protect American workers against\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\nthis incredibly sweeping and irresponsible attack on their right to be \ncompensated for overtime worked in this country today.\n  Nothing could be more important. As far as we are concerned, nothing \nin this bill is any more important than this amendment.\n  I come to the floor again to express the hope that we can have the \nvote today and that we can move to complete our work on the bill this \nweek and send the right message, along with the resolution we just \npassed last Friday, that we do respect the right of all workers and \nthat we respect their right to be paid fairly for the work they do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask this question: Is it not true that \nsince President Bush took office we have lost 3.3 million private-\nsector jobs in America, more jobs lost than any President since Herbert \nHoover and the Great Depression, and that 75 percent of the jobs lost \nhave been manufacturing jobs and good paying jobs across America? \nDespite the fact that manufacturing jobs account for less than 14 \npercent of our private-sector economy, 75 percent of the private-sector \njob loss has been in manufacturing jobs. These jobs have been lost to \nThird World countries--China and other nations.\n  Is it not also true that this proposal to cut overtime and basically \ndefy the sacred 40-hour workweek would result in the importation of \nThird World wage standards into the United States? It is bad enough \nthat we have lost millions of jobs to the Third World and overseas. Is \nthis proposal by the Bush administration adding insult to injury by \nbringing those Third World work standards to America's families we \nhonored with that resolution last Friday?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am afraid the Senator from Illinois is exactly right. \nThis is a license to import Third World wage standards into the United \nStates--to turn the clock back 65 years. That is exactly what we are \ndoing. We are telling the workers that you are not only not going to \nget overtime, but this is just the beginning. If they get away with \nthis, where does it end?\n  The Senator is right about unemployment, whether the number is 2.7 \nmillion or 3.3 million. There were 93,000 last month alone.\n  The situation is going from bad to worse. We are not only losing \njobs, but those who have jobs are losing pay. As the Senator from \nIllinois said so well, we are importing Third World standards on those \nwages as a result of these proposed regulations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to ask a question of my colleague. Here we \nare in the week of September 11. We are going to memorialize the heroes \nof September 11. The last memory we all have of our President going \ndown to Ground Zero and placing his arms around the shoulders of these \nbrave people--and we just found out they were in serious danger due to \nwhat was happening in terms of the quality of the air. We have found \nthat it was not what it was said to be. Everything that I am reading \nand the mail I am getting indicates that many of our firefighters, \nemergency workers, and nurses are workers who rely upon overtime pay in \norder to keep their families together. I have the most emotional \nletters which I have put in the Record on this point.\n\n  Does my friend not see the irony in the fact that we are approaching \nthe September 11 date and honoring the heroes of that day and they are \nthe ones who are going to be hurt by this terrible ruling of the \nadministration unless we prevail and have a vote to overturn it?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from California has \narticulated it better than I did. I would call it bitter irony as we \napproach September 11 in recognition of so many first responders who \ngave their lives--and in some cases because of the injuries inflicted \ngave their livelihoods--as we pass additional commemoration on \nSeptember 11 resolutions of praise and gratitude to the first \nresponders, how ironic that there would be an effort to promulgate a \nregulation that takes away their rights to compensation which they so \nrichly and justly deserve. How ironic.\n  The Senator from California is right. If we are going to pass these \ncommemorations again--and indeed we should--let us make them \nmeaningful. Let us say that we also recognize the contribution you make \nevery day--not just what you contributed on September 11, 2001, but \nwhat you are contributing on September 11, 2003, and every single day \nyou come to work. Let us acknowledge that contribution. Let us \nacknowledge it with a meaningful commitment in pay by overturning this \nharsh regulation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do I understand correctly that it is the position of the \nRepublican Party that rather than giving an opportunity for the Senate \nto express itself, the President has announced that if this particular \nprovision is turned over--effectively if we vitiate what the \nadministration is attempting to do on overtime--they are prepared to \nveto legislation which is vital for the education of the children, K-\n12, legislation which provides important help and assistance for those \nyoung students who are trying to continue along in terms of higher \neducation, and effectively emasculate or undermine, as well, the \nfunding that is necessary for the National Institutes of Health? This \nadministration evidently is saying it is more important to deny nurses, \nfirefighters, and policemen overtime than to provide the funding which \nis essential to educate the children and to provide for essential \nhealth needs.\n  Is that the understanding of our leader as to the position of the \nmajority on this legislation?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was struck by the extraordinary \nstatement made by the administration last week in a statement of \nadministration policy. Last week it said we know there is approximately \n$21 billion in here for education and for those going to college. The \nNIH funding is about $28 billion. This bill will affect every school \ndistrict in America. It will affect children under title I and disabled \nchildren under IDEA. It will affect afterschool programs, preschool \nprograms, and school lunch. It will affect virtually every aspect of \neducation in America. And the President said he is going to veto this \nlegislation if we overturn the regulation on overtime. What kind of \nmessage does that send to America and to those who heard this President \nsay over the course of his time in the White House that education is \nimportant to him, and that education is a special priority to him?\n  Apparently, it is not as much of a priority as it is to ensure that \nwe don't pass an amendment protecting workers from losing their earned \novertime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could ask one more question of the \nSenator, the Senator is very familiar with the fact that our Republican \nfriends refuse to permit the Senate to have a vote on increasing the \nminimum wage. If we don't increase the minimum wage, it will be the \nlowest in terms of purchasing power in the history of minimum wage. \nRepublicans won't permit that. They oppose the Davis-Bacon provision \nwhich permits construction workers to be able to have a decent income. \nThey have effectively also withdrawn--listen to this--the tuberculosis \nstandard in OSHA which is so essential in order to protect people who \nhave contamination in their lungs. We have seen the pensions of working \nfamilies collapse over the period of the last 3 years.\n\n  What in the world has this administration got against working \nfamilies? This seems to me to be symbolic of their attitude about \nworking families: Let them eat cake. Let them eat cake. As the Senator \nhas pointed out time and time again, it is the working families who \nhave been the backbone of our economy historically when things have \ngone well and it is the working families who have taken the brunt when \nwe have had mismanagement of the economy.\n  Does the Senator share my view? Is that a fairly good indicator of \nthe kind of contemptuous attitude the administration has generally with \nregard to working families?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has put\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\nhis finger on the right word, ``contemptuous.'' There was a \ncontemptuous attitude on the part of this administration with regard to \nthe importance of the minimum wage.\n  With regard to the importance of pension security, how many millions \nof workers have been adversely affected by the corporate governance \nscandals over the last couple of years? There is not one peep out of \nthis administration when it comes to pension security.\n  How many millions of workers, especially those first responders, 8 \nmillion workers, will be affected by this ban on overtime pay? How many \nmillions of workers are affected each and every day by the health and \nsafety issues they continue to fight--ergonomics and a whole array of \nother issues, issues we have forced the Senate to consider over the \nyears as we try to make the workplace a safer and healthier place for \nall workers?\n  On each and every one of these issues and many more, this \nadministration has demonstrated a contemptuous attitude. I say it is \nthe most antiworker administration we have seen, at least in my time in \npublic life.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his strong \nsupport of working families not only on this issue but on every issue \nthat comes up in the Senate. The Senator from South Dakota has always \nbeen there for working men and women and their families, as he is \ntoday. I thank the Senator from South Dakota, our Democratic leader, \nfor his stalwart, strong support to make sure we have fairness and \njustice for our working families. I thank the Senator for his strong \nsupport for making sure these workers who are asked to work overtime \nget paid justly for that.\n  The Senator mentioned a number of the people to be affected, first \nresponders and others. It has been said, and I ask the Senator to \nrespond, that perhaps the first wave of people to be hit by the changes \nin rules and regulations would be women because so many women have come \ninto the workforce in the last few years. Many of them are salaried and \nnow they would be exempt, they would not get paid for overtime.\n  One of the first waves to be hit is nurses. Right now, we are facing \na nursing shortage in our country. I know in South Dakota and Iowa and \nthe Midwest we have a terrible nursing shortage. Nurses under the age \nof 30 represent only 10 percent of the nursing workforce. By 2010, 40 \npercent of the nationwide nursing workforce will be over the age of 50, \nnearing retirement. Right now, nurses are already forced to work \nmandatory overtime. Go to a hospital anywhere and you will find nurses \nbeing told to work overtime. The only good thing is they are paid time \nand a half now.\n\n  With these proposed changes, if they were to go into effect, I ask \nthe Senator from South Dakota, since nurses are on salary, if they \ncould be reclassified and they would then have to work mandatory \novertime but they would not be paid for it; is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator's appreciation of the impact \nof this amendment on nurses is absolutely correct. I commend the \nSenator, again, for his extraordinary efforts and his leadership over \nthe last couple of weeks. He has made me so proud. Every working person \nin America owes Senator Harkin a debt of gratitude for his powerful \narticulation of their cause, as we have addressed this and other issues \naffecting employees, not just nurses.\n  In answer to his question, absolutely, nurses are affected because \nnurses often work extraordinarily long hours earning overtime. In fact, \nthere is probably no category of workers today, at least in the health \ncare field, more overworked than our nurses, in large part because of \nthe shortage the Senator has addressed in his question. We have a \nchronic shortage of nurses in America, especially in rural areas and \nespecially in South Dakota. Far too many nurses in South Dakota would \nbe adversely affected by this regulation.\n  We have to recognize what a blow it would be to them. If 25 percent \nof their income is derived from overtime, we are taking away one-\nquarter of their purchasing power in one fell swoop by this regulation. \nThat is why this is such a critical fight for us and why it is so \nimportant to make this case on this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield further for one more question, \nI thank him for his kind words on my behalf. I respond by saying I am \nfortunate to have good leadership, the leadership of the Senator from \nSouth Dakota and the Senator from Nevada, in carrying this fight \nforward. I thank both for their great leadership.\n  As I pursue this issue about women being affected, face it, most \nnurses are women. That is the way it is. They will be greatly affected.\n  Another figure we ought to look at--and I ask the Senator for his \nthoughts on this--in 1975, women who had children under the age of 3 \nmade up only 34 percent of our workforce; today that is 60.2 percent. \nOver 60 percent of women with children under the age of 3 are now in \nthe workforce.\n  I ask the Senator, is it true that these women--maybe not all but \nmost of them--have to have daycare, some childcare, for their children? \nSo now, these women who are paying a lot for childcare, if they do not \nhave to be paid overtime under the proposed changes the Bush \nadministration wants to make, would be forced to work overtime. Does \nthat not mean they would have to pay even more for childcare than what \nthey are paying now, yet they would not get one nickel more in their \nincome to help pay for it? Is this not also what would happen to women \nunder the proposed changes in the overtime proposal?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I say to the Senator from Iowa, that is exactly the \ncase. You do not need to be an accountant to realize the dramatic \nfinancial consequences this will have on so many working women but \nespecially those who are faced with extraordinary childcare costs \ntoday. I am disappointed on that front.\n  I understand we will take up the welfare reform reauthorization \ntomorrow. I am told the childcare funding increase was cut from $5.5 \nbillion to $1 billion in the markup before the Finance Committee. I am \nastounded that anyone could, with a straight face, say we want you off \nof welfare to work but we will cut your access to childcare under this \nlegislation. So not only is the problem for working women reflected in \nthis regulation but in the very legislation we could address as early \nas tomorrow in the Finance Committee.\n  This legislation cries out for fairness for working women, for those \nworking two and three jobs just to make ends meet. There is no way we \ncan pass the resolution we passed last Friday calling for a recognition \nof the American worker during the month of October and fail to \nrecognize the importance of repealing this regulation before October \neven begins.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for one last question, last \nweek I was talking to one of my colleagues on the Senate floor about my \namendment, about this amendment, and about the impact on overtime pay. \nMy colleague said: One of the strange things about this is that I have \nheard no big movement in my State. There is no uprising in my State \nabout changing the overtime laws. I have not heard from business. I \nhave not heard from workers. I got to thinking: You know, neither have \nI. I have not had any businesses in my State coming to me saying: \nSenator, we have to change these overtime laws. They are a terrible \nburden on us. We have to get rid of them. We have to change them. I \nhave not heard them say that. Where does this come from?\n\n  I ask my fellow Senators, I ask the Senator from South Dakota, has \nanyone here been really lobbied hard by anyone in their States to \nchange these overtime laws? Where is it coming from?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I respond to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nPresident, that this resolution could have been written by a good \nemployer because the good employers that you and I talk to in Iowa and \nSouth Dakota understand and agree with what this resolution recognizes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The one we adopted last Friday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, the one we adopted last Friday:\n\n       Whereas the quality of workers' jobs and the supportiveness \n     of their workplaces are key predictors of job productivity, \n     job satisfaction, commitment to employers, and retention.\n\n  Every good employer in South Dakota understands that. That is as \nclear\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\nand as unambiguous a principle of good management as you will ever \nfind. So is the next one:\n\n       Whereas there is a clear link between work-family policies \n     and lower absenteeism.\n\n  So the Chamber of Commerce could write that. If we want to make sure \nwe have low absenteeism, if we want to make sure we have high job \nproductivity, job satisfaction, commitment to employers, and retention, \nwhat do you do? You tell those workers in more than just a resolution \nthat their contribution matters, and that if we are going to ask them \nto work longer than a 40-hour workweek, we are going to compensate them \nfor that.\n  We became one of the most productive nations in the world over the \ncourse of the last 70 years. Why? Because we had the most productive \nworkers. Why did we have the most productive workers? Because there \nwere enough businesses who understand those basic principles of good \nbusiness.\n  That is all we are suggesting. Let's stick to those principles. Our \ncountry deserves no less.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator has been very generous with \nhis time. I bring two matters to the attention of the Senator and ask \nwhether he agrees; I have listened to the exchange between the Senator \nfrom Iowa and the Senator from South Dakota.\n  This chart I have points out that middle-income mothers are working \n55 percent more hours today than 20 years ago. This chart shows 1979 up \nthrough 2000. We have seen this dramatic expansion of the number of \nhours that women are working in the workforce to provide for their \nfamilies.\n  At the same time we are seeing this dramatic increase, we are finding \nout that there is a reduction in terms of overtime. As the Senator \npointed out earlier, we are finding out that American workers--this \ncolumn on the chart indicates the number of hours Americans are working \nin relation to other industrialized nations. So workers are working \nharder, they are working longer hours, they are more productive, and \nall they are asking is to be able to get decent pay.\n  But the question I ask the Senator is in relation to this particular \nchart. This is enormously interesting. Workers without overtime \nprotections are more than twice as likely to work longer hours. If you \ntake those workers who do not have overtime protection, they work more \nthan twice as long as those who have the overtime protection.\n\n  If you take away this kind of protection, the word ought to go out to \nworkers that they are going to have to work longer and harder for less \npay because that is what is happening today. And that is what is \nhappening for 40 hours a week. And for 50 hours a week, you work three \ntimes as long if you don't have any overtime protection than if you \nhave it.\n  It is very clear that the Business Roundtable and others are correct \nas they understand that by eliminating the overtime pay it is affecting \nthe bottom line.\n  Earlier I heard the Senator talking about what is happening in terms \nof the police and the firefighters. I bring this chart to the attention \nof the Senator and see whether he agrees. This is from the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations. The Bush proposal would deny \novertime:\n\n       Under such regulations, America's State and Local law \n     enforcement officers, already strained by countless overtime \n     hours ensuring community safety against terrorist threats, \n     could lose this basic benefit accorded to them for their \n     efforts.\n\n  This is from the International Union of Police Associations:\n\n       The alterations would also provide a strong disincentive \n     for agencies and municipalities to hire additional first \n     responders, as they seek ways to operate under the growing \n     constraints of historic financial burdens.\n\n  The implementation of these rules would mark a critical step \nbackwards for our public safety. . . .\n\n       I just wanted to reaffirm what the Senator said in his \n     excellent comments about the impact this would have on women, \n     the impact this would have on first responders, and the real \n     threat and danger this poses to the hardest working men and \n     women in industrial society. They are the American workers \n     and they have the most to lose.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his contribution \nand for his clarity with regard to the impact this will have on the \nworkers who he has again addressed, and women in particular.\n  The irony could not be more evident. As we praise the American \nworkers' productivity, we take away their very right to fair and just \ncompensation. We drive them into schedules that require even longer \nhours, away from their children, away from their families. We adopt \nresolutions lauding them--the American worker and the working family--\nfor the entire month of October. Yet we can't take 15 or 20 minutes on \na Tuesday afternoon in September to say that we mean what we say in \nOctober--we are going to make sure you get the overtime you deserve \nwhen you work over 40 hours. How bitter of an irony is that?\n  Then, perhaps the irony of ironies, as we turn our attention once \nagain to the great tragedy of 2001, in just 2 days, we will come to the \nfloor and we will speak with reverence for those who lost their lives. \nWe will thank those who continue to put their lives on the line. We \nwill express, in as heartfelt a way as I know everyone can, on \nThursday, how grateful we are to the first responders, to the policemen \nand the firemen all across this country--in South Dakota, in \nMassachusetts, and every place else--and then turn right around and \ntake away their overtime.\n  How, in Heaven's name, can we say to any of them, with any \ncredibility: We care for you. We support you. We are grateful to you. \nBut we just don't want you to pay you the overtime you have earned.\n  Let's not do that. The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, ought to rise \nabove that kind of hypocrisy and say: We are not only going to support \nyou next month, we are not only going to support you this Thursday, but \nwe are going to support you every day--by simply supporting the law \nthat has been on the books since 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act. \nThat is what this amendment is about, and that is why it is so \nimportant to many of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the \ndistinguished Democrat leader for his comments and others for their \ncomments. I was going to ask him a question myself, but I think our \nleader has already been standing on the floor for about an hour, so I \nwill spare him that. I commend him for his eloquence on this issue and \nfor his passion about it.\n  This is an issue that is befuddling, to put it mildly, to many of us. \nI have several amendments pending on the education bill. I would very \nmuch like to raise them on Head Start and on special education. We \ncan't get there apparently because we can't get a vote on this simple \nproposition.\n  Not only are we not going to be able to vote on overtime this \nafternoon, but we can't even vote on whether or not we ought to do more \non special education. We can't do something more on Head Start, title \nI, Pell grants. Here we are, coming in the midst of September, the \nwaning days of the Session, with huge issues before us, and it is now \nthe midpart of Tuesday--this started last week some time--and it would \ntake, I suspect--and the Senator from Iowa is here, our leader; he can \ncorrect me--maybe another 15 minutes of debate and we could have a \nrollcall vote on this and move on.\n  I will take a few minutes to express my views, which are very similar \nto those expressed by the distinguished minority leader, as well as \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, Senator Harkin, Senator Boxer, and \nothers, on this matter. But I think it is a great tragedy.\n  I thank the leader for taking the time to express to the American \npublic his great concern about this issue and the wonderment he \nexpresses about why we can't even have a vote on this proposal. I thank \nhim and I know he has a busy afternoon.\n  I want to share with my colleagues my own thoughts on this issue as \nwell. I think it is remarkable. This is yet one additional bad decision \nafter another when it comes to the economy.\n\n  We have seen what has happened regarding tax cut policy. I note an \narticle written by Mike Allen and Jonathan Weisman in the Washington \nPost appearing this past Saturday, page A6, titled ``Tax Cut Claims \nGain Criticism As Employers Shed More Jobs.'' I won't read the whole \narticle, but let me quote from it, if I may:\n\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\n\n       Before the latest tax cut plan passed, White House \n     economists had predicted it would add 1.4 million new jobs \n     through the year 2004, on top of 4.1 million jobs that a \n     growing economy would have generated anyway, a rate of \n     344,000 jobs created a month. By its own accounting, the Bush \n     administration has fallen 437,000 jobs short of its own \n     projections in August, a shortfall not lost on the \n     President's critics.\n\n  We have seen already tremendous job losses in this country. The \nminority leader mentioned a job loss of 3.2 million jobs; 2.5 million \nof those job losses have occurred in the manufacturing sector of our \neconomy; 93,000 jobs lost in America in the month of August, up sharply \nfrom the 43,000 jobs lost in July. For the seventh consecutive month, \ncompanies have slashed payrolls.\n  So the economy, when it comes to joblessness, is cratering. The tax \ncuts that the administration jammed through the Congress only a few \nshort months ago are already demonstrating what a hardship they pose to \nthe recovery and to putting Americans back to work.\n  As I mentioned, 93,000 jobs were lost in the month of August; 44,000 \nof those jobs in the manufacturing sector. Just over 2.5 million \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 32 months.\n  African Americans and Hispanics bear the brunt of the economic \ndownturn. The unemployment rate among African Americans is now hovering \naround 11 percent, almost twice the national average.\n  The unemployment rate among Hispanics is almost 8 percent. Long-term \nunemployment is on the rise. In August, almost 2 million people had \nbeen unemployed for over 6 months, triple the number at the beginning \nof the Bush administration.\n  A surge in discouraged workers masks the true impact of the economic \ndownturn. Currently, 1.7 million people are marginally attached to the \nlabor force. About 503,000 of these workers have stopped looking for \nwork altogether because they believe that no work is available for \nthem. That is an increase of 125,000 over the past year.\n  A new study suggests that job losses since 2001 are gone for good. A \nstudy by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has concluded that the \nvast majority of job losses since the beginning of the 2001 recession \nwere the result of permanent changes in the U.S. economy and are not \ncoming back. This means the labor market will not regain strength until \nnew positions are created in new economic sectors. Manufacturing is the \narea that is suffering the largest brunt of this decision.\n  An additional 1.3 million people are in poverty nationwide. The \nnumber of Americans living below the poverty line has increased by more \nthan 1.3 million in the last year, even though the economy technically \nedged out of a recession during the same period. The number of families \nliving in poverty went up by more than 300,000 in 2002, and the number \nof children in poverty rose by more than 600,000 in the same period.\n  We are heading in the wrong direction. On top of all that, we now \nhave a decision being made by the administration to eliminate overtime \npay. People in more than 250 white-collar occupations will lose their \nright to overtime. I won't list them all, but they include the critical \nareas of nursing, firefighting, police forces, emergency medical \nservices, health technicians, clerical workers, surveyors, chefs, TV \ntechnicians, and reporters. Overtime pay will be eliminated.\n  I don't understand--in light of the news we are getting about the \nunemployment picture in this country and the hardships being faced, the \nrising level of poverty, the more difficult time families are having to \nmake ends meet--why the administration persists in pursuing a policy of \ndenying overtime pay. There was a very close vote in the House of \nRepresentatives. At least they voted. I am told the vote was 210 to 213 \nagainst blocking the President's proposed rule, so it was narrowly \ndefeated by the Republican majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n  I want to know whether or not this body wants to confirm what the \nHouse and the President said they want to do. And should not the \nAmerican public have the right to know what the answer of this body \nwould be?\n  In 250 occupations, they want to know whether or not they are going \nto be able to get overtime pay. Overtime pay makes a huge difference \nfor them economically. It can amount to as much as 25 percent of a \nworker's annual income. Denying 25 percent of someone's income at a \ntime of already economic uncertainty is wrongheaded. It is dangerous \nfor us to be pursuing that path.\n  I regret deeply that we will not have a chance to vote this afternoon \non the administration's overtime proposal. We are faced with one more \nbad economic idea after another. We have the largest annual deficits in \nthe Nation's history, one of the largest percentages of the gross \ndomestic product, because they include, obviously, Social Security \nmoneys in their calculations. We have lost more than 3 million jobs in \nthe last 32 months.\n  Instead of working towards creating new jobs and helping working \nfamilies and individuals, the administration has proposed a regulation \nto deny overtime protection to millions of people. These workers would \nhave their jobs reclassified as professional, administrative or \nexecutive, even if their job duties do not change, thus losing the \nbenefit of overtime pay. As I mentioned, more than 250 white-collar \noccupations could be impacted. Employees could be forced to work longer \nhours without the benefit of overtime pay.\n  I was speaking with a group of nurses in Connecticut. They were \nsaying to me: We don't have the choice of not working additional hours \nin hospitals. If an emergency occurs, or there are problems with \npatients, you are always asked to stay on a few more hours and help \nout.\n  And they do it. The idea that we would be asking these people to \ncontinue to provide the valuable services they do to sick individuals \nin our Nation's hospitals and not provide them compensation for doing \nso is truly outrageous. The same goes for our firefighters and police \nofficers.\n  Senator Boxer had it right when she said earlier: You can well \nimagine in the next 48 hours or so the kinds of images we are going to \nhave, a replay of the tremendous outpouring of gratitude being \nexpressed to the police officers and firefighters in New York and \nConnecticut, New Jersey, and others who gathered to fight for the lives \nat the World Trade Center almost 2 years ago. Yet what expression of \ngratitude do we provide them 2 years later? We tell them: Sorry, but \nyour overtime pay no longer exists. What kind of a message is that to \nthese people?\n  Asking employees to work longer hours and not providing overtime pay \nis significant because overtime pay can provide as much as 25 percent \nof a person's annual income. This is not the type of balance between \nwork and family that the distinguished Democratic leader pointed out \nwhen we adopted unanimously a resolution offered last week. I was \npleased to cosponsor S. Res. 210, a bipartisan resolution supporting \nstriking a balance between work and personal lives as being in the best \ninterest of worker productivity.\n  I find it terribly disheartening that at a time when this body is \nasking the President to designate October as National Work and Family \nMonth, the administration is working to finalize a regulation to strip \novertime pay for millions of people.\n  The 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act has been the backbone of worker \nprotection. Never in its 65-year history have such sweeping overtime \nchanges been proposed.\n  Hard-working individuals are deeply concerned about these changes and \nmany of us here stand shoulder to shoulder with them in expressing our \noutrage. It is unfortunate that we are not going to be able to have a \nvote today in this body on whether or not we can overturn that \ndecision.\n  I also find it ironic that the President suggested he would veto the \nunderlying appropriations bill on education and health services if this \namendment is accepted. In fact, an August poll of nearly 900 adults \nfound that 74 percent--cutting across all regional and political \nlines--oppose the Bush administration's proposal to eliminate overtime \nprotection. Almost 75 percent of those polled said don't do it.\n  Further, in 2001, the Department of Labor commissioned its own study \nthat concluded that the current narrow overtime exemptions under the \nFair Labor Standards Act are still relevant today.\n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\n  Why then did the Bush administration unveil these proposals last \nMarch? One can only conclude that whatever the reasons, they do not \ninclude supporting the ability of working people to earn a decent pay \nfor a day's work.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator made two points. First, on the issue of police \nofficers, fire individuals, and first responders, I believe the \nadministration and the Department have made it very clear that those \nofficers would not be impacted by this decision in any way and, in \nfact, to quote the President of the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nlargest police union in the country representing 310,000 people, Chuck \nCanterbury, said:\n\n       Thanks to the leadership of Secretary Chao, we have no \n     doubt that the overtime pay will continue to be available to \n     those officers currently receiving it. And if the new rules \n     are approved, even more of our national police officers and \n     firefighters and EMTs will be eligible for overtime. This \n     development was possible because this is an administration \n     that listens to the concerns of the Fraternal Order of Police \n     and because of their commitment to the Nation's first \n     responders.\n\n  The Senator from Connecticut represented a couple of times how police \nofficers are going to be denied overtime pay. This is the president of \nthe largest representative group of police officers in the country \nsaying just the opposite. The Department has said just the opposite. \nThe administration has said just the opposite. I am wondering what \nfactual basis the Senator concludes that the head of the police, the \nNational Fraternal Order of Police, is wrong; the Secretary of Labor is \nwrong; and the administration is wrong on this point?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very simply, as my colleague pointed out, I \nwould be delighted if the administration was going to change its \npolicy. I wish they would do it across the board, just back this up all \ntogether.\n  The fact is, if you do a simple recategorization of what these people \ndo as either being professional, administrative, or executive, then you \nare covered under this rule. I don't know what the various heads of \nthese organizations are saying, but that is what the regulation that \nhas been proposed by the administration says. Within the 250 employment \ncategories, police and firefighters are included, if they are \nrecategorized. If you do not recategorize them, they are going to be \nfine. But you leave that up to the whim of whether you want to move \nthem to those different levels of pay. That is how they get covered.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I tend to side with the head of the \nNational Fraternal Order of Police in his assessment of this situation \nand the commitment made by Secretary Chao that the police officers, \nfire individuals, and EMTs will not be impacted. It has been made very \nclear the regulation has no impact on them, and I think it is just not \ncorrect to make that statement, although I can understand the Senator \ncan read the regulations and has concluded that, but nobody else has.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me respond to my friend. The National \nAssociation of Police Officers and the International Union of Police \nAssociations oppose the regulations. We have correspondence from them. \nThere is obviously some disagreement.\n  Mr. GREGG. Opposition is not the issue. The issue is whether police \nofficers, fire, and EMT will be affected. I believe the administration \nmade it clear they won't be affected, and I believe the assessment, as \nreflected in this quote from Mr. Canterbury, is accurate.\n  My second question is on the issue of nurses because the Senator also \nsaid all nurses would be affected. I am sure, as the Senator knows, \nnurses are already exempt from the FSLA, and to the extent nurses are \naffected by overtime, it is because of a contractual agreement in their \nunion contracts. As a practical matter, therefore, the vast majority of \nnurses who are subject to union contracts will have no impact on their \novertime, and there is no adjustment here in any way to the nurses of \nthis country, as again has been made clear by the administration and \nagain reflects the fact that the present law is in place and that nurse \novertime is tied to contractual agreements, not to FSLA regulations.\n  To throw the nurses in--and I can go down, actually, the whole list. \nI could go down to cooks, reporters, clerical workers, teachers, \nphysical therapists, lab technicians, social workers--all these \nindividuals who have been put on the Senator's list actually are not on \nthe list. They actually are not on the list.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me regain my time and respond. I \nappreciate my colleague raising these questions. I ask unanimous \nconsent that letters from the International Union of Police \nAssociations and the National Association of Police Organizations, \nexpressing their opposition to the regulation, be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                            International Union of\n\n\n                                  Police Associations, AFL-CIO\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA July 25, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: In the very near future, either an amendment, \n     or a stand-alone bill, will be brought forward in the Senate \n     which will seek to restrict the Department of Labor (DOL) \n     from implementing any regulatory rules changes in the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act that would remove workers' overtime \n     rights. It would not interfere with the Secretary's ability \n     to expand overtime protections for low income workers. On \n     behalf of the International Union of Police Associations \n     (IUPA), representing more than 100,000 active duty, rank and \n     file law enforcement officers from across the country, I urge \n     you to support this effort.\n       On March 31, 2003, the DOL's proposed rule changes were \n     first published under the guise of expanding overtime rights \n     to lower paid employees. These rule changes, if implemented, \n     would dramatically alter the classification of workers who \n     could be exempted from the provisions of the FLSA and the 40-\n     hour work week. These changes would reduce the compensation \n     for our nation's police officers and EMS personnel, just as \n     we are routinely calling on them to do more and more in the \n     interest of national security. The alterations would also \n     provide a strong disincentive for agencies and municipalities \n     to hire additional first responders, as they seek ways to \n     operate under the growing constraints of historic financial \n     burdens. The implementation of these rules would mark a \n     critical step backwards for our public safety officers, just \n     when we need to be moving ahead.\n       IUPA has been closely following the events surrounding \n     these changes. We consider this legislation to be the most \n     important single issue we face. Its critical impact on rank-\n     and-file law enforcement officers throughout the country \n     makes it a true litmus test, when it is time for us to decide \n     who truly supports the men and women who form the thin blue \n     line. We intend to carefully note and announce to our \n     membership those who are willing to stand with our nation's \n     police and firefighters with their votes. Whatever form this \n     struggle takes, I hope we can count on your support. If you \n     or your staff desires any additional information from IUPA, I \n     hope you will feel free to call upon us.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                   Dennis Slocumb,\n     International Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                   Police Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: The full Senate will soon consider the Labor \n     HHS Appropriations Bill, S. 1356. On behalf of the National \n     Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing \n     230,000 rank-and-file police officers from across the United \n     States, I would like to request your support for an amendment \n     to S. 1356, which will be offered by Senator Tom Harkin (D-\n     IA) and will safeguard the ability of millions of Americans, \n     and America's law enforcement officers, to continue to earn \n     overtime pay for their professional efforts.\n       On March 31, 2003, the Department of Labor issued a \n     proposal which called for significant alterations concerning \n     the ability of law enforcement officers to receive hard \n     earned overtime pay. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938, most workers, including law enforcement officers, are \n     entitled to overtime pay for excessive time worked. The \n     Department's proposal dramatically lowers the bar for \n     employers to classify employees as ``executive, \n     administrative or professional,'' thus exempting them from \n     paid overtime status.\n       If allowed to go into effect, these proposed regulations \n     will have a tremendous impact on workers who depend on \n     overtime pay, not as an added frill, but as a necessity to \n     ensure the promotion and well being of their families. Under \n     such regulations, America's State and Local law enforcement \n     officers, already strained by countless overtime hours \n     ensuring community safety against terrorist threats, could \n     lose this basic benefit accorded to them for their efforts. \n     These proposed regulations have seen no hearing nor achieved \n     any legislative approval.\n       The Harkin Amendment will protect these benefits and only \n     blocks the expanding of exemptions for those who are \n     currently eligible for overtime, while not blocking efforts \n     to expand overtime eligibility for more workers. I hope you \n     will support the amendment and ensure these hard earned \n     benefits. If you\n\n[[Page S11203]]\n\n     have any questions, please feel free to contact me, or NAPO's \n     Legislative Assistant, Lucian H. Deaton, at (202) 842-4420.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will address both points my colleague has \nraised. If my colleagues on the other side are so concerned about first \nresponders, why not just oppose the regulation altogether because this \nis the major group about which we are talking. For example, let me \npoint out what I am suggesting.\n  Police sergeants and lower-level police supervisors are likely to \nlose their overtime through the executive exemption. Let me explain \nwhy.\n  The fact that a sergeant performs nonmanual work such as walking the \nbeat during 90 percent of his work hours does not matter if he also has \na primary duty of supervising two officers or performing nonexempt \nadministrative work.\n  Highly compensated police officers will not even have to have a \nprimary duty of performing exempt work. If they perform any ``office or \nnonmanual work'' and perform any one exempt duty of an executive, \nadministrative, or professional duty--no matter how little of their \ntime is spent doing it--they lose the right to overtime.\n  How much imagination does it take to move people into those \ncategories to be exempt from overtime compensation?\n  Police departments have been prevented from exempting police officers \nwho teach in police academies because the instructors did not exercise \nsufficient independent judgment and discretion in how they taught their \ncourses. The proposed rule eliminates the requirement for independent \njudgment and discretion.\n  Under the current law, an exempt executive is an employee ``who \ncustomarily and regularly exercises discretionary powers; and who does \nnot devote more than 20 percent . . . of his hours of work in the \nworkweek to activities which are not directly and closely related to \nthe performance of [exempt] work. . . .\n  Under the proposal by the President, those current law requirements \nare eliminated.\n  Let me address the nurse issue. Nurses, skilled health technicians, \nand technologists could lose their overtime protection under the \nproposed regulations because of the changes to the educational \nrequirement.\n  Registered nurses who do not hold a bachelor's degree are currently \neligible for overtime protections, unless they hold administrative or \nmanagerial positions.\n  Under the Bush proposal, these RNs would lose their overtime \nprotection if they have a few years of work experience.\n  Nonmanagerial licensed practical nurses--LPNs--have a right to \novertime protection under current law. Under the administration's \nproposal, LPNs with a few years of work experience would also lose \ntheir right to overtime compensation.\n  Let me read current law and then read the regulation proposed by \nPresident Bush.\n  The current law:\n\n       Employees are exempt if they do ``work requiring knowledge \n     of an advance type in a field of science or learning \n     customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized \n     intellectual instruction and study, as distinguished from a \n     general academic education and from an apprenticeship, and \n     from training in the performance of routine mental, manual, \n     or physical processes.''\n\nUnder the President's proposal:\n\n       Employees qualify for exemption as a learned professional \n     if they have a primary duty of performing office or nonmanual \n     work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or \n     learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of \n     intellectual instruction, but which may also be acquired by \n     an equivalent combination of intellectual instruction and \n     work experience.\n\n  That is very broad, very general language. Obviously, one can drive a \nMack truck through it. That is why the nurses of this country, the RNs \nand LPNs, are vehemently opposed to this proposed regulation, because \nthey know exactly what is going to happen, just as police officers do. \nThat is why so many of us feel so strongly about this and why we would \nlike to vote on it.\n  If a majority wants to uphold the President and vote for this stuff, \nthen so be it; the Administration can go forward and it will become the \nlaw of the land. But I would like to know where 100 Senators stand. \nAmerica would, too. As I mentioned, nearly seventy-five percent of the \npeople polled in a recent survey said they are opposed to the \nadministration's proposed rule. Let's find out where this body is. I \nthink the proposed rule to eliminate overtime pay is wrong and I \nsupport the Harkin amendment. I hope that we will have a vote soon and \nI urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I always enjoy the eloquence of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I am a great admirer of him as a legislator and as a \ncolleague in this body, but I must disagree with his analysis of what \nthis proposed regulation does.\n  Let's begin with the fact that this is a proposed regulation. That \nmeans it is not final. It means the Department is still in the process \nof adjusting it, of building it, of designing it. They have received \n80,000 comments.\n  The approach of the other side of the aisle is to say we do not care \nwhat the 80,000 comments were; we do not care what the process is for \nregulatory review. We are going to step in, and we are going to \nunilaterally decide that a law that has not been adjusted in over 30 \nyears is a good law, shall be law, and shall never be changed. It makes \nvery little sense.\n  When this regulation was initiated, America was an entirely different \ncountry. It had a different employment structure, different individual \ntypes of responsibilities within the employment structure. We had \njobbers. We had people who were working on the line as the primary \nresponsibility of our manufacturing structure. Today we are a much more \nmobile society. We are a much more dynamic and flexible workplace. We \nare a workplace which reflects massive change in the way we compete and \nare successful as an economy.\n  Yet a law passed 30 years ago does not keep up with those changes. It \nhas not adjusted to the change in the workplace that has occurred as a \nresult of the information age coming to fruition. It does not reflect \nthe fact that so many people who work in the workplace today earn a \nheck of a lot more than what they were paid under this law when it was \noriginally passed.\n\n  On the face of it, the administration has done a job of trying to \naddress low-income individuals. They have said under the present law \nthat if someone earns $8,000 or less, they can get overtime by law. \nWell, that is ridiculous. That is a ridiculously low number.\n  What this administration has said is if a person earns $21,000 or \nless, they will have the right by law to get overtime. It does not \nmatter how their job is classified; they have the right to overtime. \nThat is a very reasonable approach. Basically, it empowers an \nadditional 1.3 million people in this country who will automatically be \nqualified for overtime who are not qualified for it today because of \nthis absurdly low threshold which was placed in law over 30 years ago. \nThat is the type of reason we need to revisit this type of regulation.\n  It is also important to recognize that there is a huge debate over \nwho is and who is not covered in this law. A think tank--and we have a \nlot of them in this city and they are all very aggressive--which is \nessentially funded by the national Washington labor movement came up \nwith this number of 8 million. So I have kept asking my staff: Well, \nhow did they get to 8 million?\n  The Department, which used outside counsel, outside consultants, and \na bevy of outside experts in this law, and economists, came to the \nconclusion that this will give 1.3 million people overtime and it may \naffect somewhere between 600,000 and 700,000 who might lose their \novertime under this law. They decided that that trade-off was worth it, \nfirst because on the plus side more people would be getting overtime \nthan not, but secondly because the law has become so convoluted, so \ncomplex, and has such a large gray area--as one moves into the higher \nincome brackets, people up around $65,000--that we basically created a \nlawsuit mentality in the area of the workplace relative to overtime pay \nquestions.\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\n  In fact, this is the fastest growing area of lawsuits for trial \nlawyers. This is sort of the new oil field they have struck. You know \nhow sometimes we strike oil fields in Kansas or in Saudi Arabia or in \nthe North Slope. Well, this is the new oil field that the trial lawyers \nhave struck, which is the inconsistency, the confusion, of the overtime \nlaw. It has become the new gusher for one element of the bar.\n  The Labor Department said: Let's try to straighten these regulations, \nget some order to them, make sense of them. Did they do a perfect job? \nNo, they did not. That is why 80,000 comments came in. I do not \nsubscribe to this regulation as it is presently structured. I think it \ncan be improved and I think the 80,000 comments are probably going to \nsignificantly impact the way the Department of Labor addresses this \nregulation, but I do not think we should short-circuit the process and \nsuddenly say no, it does not work.\n  If it is such a bad regulation when it finally comes out, we have the \nability in this Congress, as we are now proceeding to do under the \nproposal of the Senator from North Dakota in the area of FCC ownership, \nto bring to the floor an amendment on a privileged resolution within a \nvery short period of time that only requires 36 signatures. We have to \nbring it to the floor, we have to debate it for 10 hours, we have to \nvote on it, and then we can repeal this. We ought to at least give the \nprocess the ability to move forward to see if we can straighten out \nsome of the fundamental flaws of this law which have over the years \nevolved to a point where we basically have created a new gusher for \ntrial lawyers but very little constructive, efficient, market-oriented \nevents for the productive side of our community, which is the workers.\n\n  To get back to the question of how many people are impacted, as I \nsaid, the Department of Labor came up with their numbers which were \nindependently evaluated, independently reached, and which were \ncertified essentially by people who understand and who are expert in \nthis area. Where did this 8 million number come from, that we have \nheard bandied about as if it had been sacrosanct, delivered to us from \nthe mountain on high, by some tablet that said 8 million workers are \ngoing to be impacted?\n  This number came, as I mentioned, from some think tank in Washington, \nwhich think tank is funded by an interest group which has a very \nsignificant role in this debate, which is the major labor union \nleadership in Washington. It was put together not by a group of \neconomists, not by a group of experts in this law. It was put together \nby two individuals whose expertise in this law is new, to be kind. I \nthink one has a social worker's degree and the other has some sort of \nother degree, but they are not recognized national leaders in this \narea.\n  They did not support their findings with anything that was \nsubstantive. They just sort of picked a number, 8 million. They picked \nthat number, it appears, without, one, understanding the regulation as \nit was proposed, two, maybe stretching it as it has been proposed, or, \nthree, just simply fabricating the number in the sense that the number \nhas no relationship to anything the regulation actually says.\n  Let's begin with the biggest fabrication in their proposal of 8 \nmillion, which is that they have included part-time employees. Now, how \nthey can include part-time employees, which is probably about 6 to 7 \nmillion of the people they added to the 8 million--I do not know the \nnumber because they did not attach a number to it, but part-time \nemployees is a big number in our society--is beyond me when we are \ndealing with a law that requires someone to work 40 hours a week before \nthey can get the overtime. By definition, a part-time employee is not \nkicked into overtime except in that rare case where they decide to \nbecome a full-time employee, and then they should not be counted as a \npart-time employee under this proposal.\n  So right off the bat, that 8 million is extraordinarily suspect as to \nthe vast majority of the numbers in that 8 million.\n  Then we go down to the other folks they added to their list, and we \nbegin with the firefighters. Independent of what my learned friend on \nthe other side of the aisle says, the fact is it has been made very \nclear by this administration, by the Secretary, and by the people who \nare involved in the drafting of this regulation that firefighters--\nfiremen and first responders, such as EMTs--will not be impacted by \nthis language. That is why, I presume, the national chairman of the \norganization, the Fraternal Order of Police, has essentially signed off \nand said that is the case.\n\n  I submit, since we are submitting materials, a release from the FOP, \nwhich is entitled ``F.O.P. Confident of Satisfactory Resolution on DOL \nOvertime Regulations,'' and ask unanimous consent it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nF.O.P. Confident of Satisfactory Resolution on DOL Overtime Regulations\n\n       Today, National Fraternal Order of Police President Chuck \n     Canterbury announced his full confidence in the success of \n     the F.O.P.'s efforts to protect the right to overtime pay for \n     more than a million public safety officers across the nation. \n     Following a productive dialogue with U.S. Department of Labor \n     (DOL) officials regarding the proposed changes to the rules \n     governing overtime compensation, Canterbury asserted that the \n     issue would be resolved to the benefit of our nation's public \n     safety officers.\n       ``Thanks to the leadership of Secretary Chao, we have no \n     doubt that overtime pay will continue to be available to \n     those officers currently receiving it and, if the new rules \n     are approved, even more of our nation's police officers, fire \n     fighters and EMTs will be eligible for overtime,'' Canterbury \n     said. ``This development was possible because this is an \n     Administration that listens to the concerns of the F.O.P., \n     and because of their commitment to our nation's first \n     responders.''\n       On 31 March, the Department of Labor published a Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register to revise and \n     update the exemptions from overtime under the FLSA for \n     executive, administrative, and professional employees. The \n     F.O.P. was the first union to weigh in on behalf of America's \n     law enforcement community regarding the proposed change and \n     recommended the exclusion of all public safety personnel from \n     the Part 541 or ``white collar'' exemptions from overtime--\n     including those employees who are classified as exempt under \n     the existing regulations. The organization argued that the \n     exclusion of these employees was necessary because of the \n     increased burdens placed on public safety officers following \n     the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.\n       ``Since the beginning, it's been clear from our dialogue \n     with Secretary Chao and Department officials that it was \n     never their intention to cut overtime for public safety \n     employees,'' Canterbury said. ``So we decided early on that \n     the interests of our members could best be served by working \n     cooperatively with the Department. While others saw an \n     opportunity to demonize this Administration, we chose \n     cooperation over conflict, partnership over partisanship.''\n       Canterbury also noted that it was this spirit of \n     cooperation that led DOL to agree that public safety officers \n     should not be classified as exempt under the proposed \n     regulations. ``To the F.O.P., this was never a partisan \n     political issue,'' Canterbury said. ``Instead, it was a \n     chance to make things better for police officers and their \n     families.''\n       ``Thanks to the dialogue between the F.O.P. and the \n     Department, we are confident that when the final regulations \n     are issued, that overtime pay will be available to even more \n     public safety officers in the country than under current \n     regulations,'' Canterbury said. ``What we have accomplished \n     by working together will be arguably the most significant \n     victory for public safety officers in decades.''\n       In a recent speech at the organization's 56th Biennial \n     National Conference in Providence, Rhode Island, Labor \n     Secretary Elaine L. Chao praised the F.O.P.'s work on the \n     issue. ``The bottom line is that Chuck Canterbury and the \n     F.O.P. are known for bringing facts and constructive \n     solutions to the table,'' Chao said. ``That's why you are \n     respected, that's why you get results, and that's why police \n     officers trust the F.O.P. to look out for their interests.''\n       On 1 September, Canterbury also traveled with President \n     George W. Bush to a Labor Day event at the Ohio Operating \n     Engineer's Richfield Training Center in Richfield, Ohio, \n     where the President spoke on jobs and the economy. Traveling \n     with key Administrative officials afforded President \n     Canterbury the opportunity to continue the dialogue on this \n     important issue.\n       Canterbury concluded by clarifying what the new rules, if \n     adopted, will mean to rank and file officers across the \n     country: ``Basically, if you get overtime pay now, you're \n     going to keep it. If you're currently exempt from overtime \n     pay, you may be getting it very soon.''\n       The Fraternal Order of Police is the largest law \n     enforcement labor organization in the United States, with \n     more than 310,000 members.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. That is a big chunk, but how many police officers and \nfirefighters and EMT workers they included in that number, I don't \nknow. I would not be surprised if, of the million\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\nor million and a half or maybe 2 million who were not part time who \nwere included, it is probably close to about half that. I don't know \nbecause this report did not have the integrity to put the numbers on \ntheir people.\n  They also included nurses. As we just had this little exchange, \nnurses are already exempt from FLSA. The reason for that is they are \ndeemed to be essentially professional as a result of their training \nexperience. The present law is fairly clear in this area. I believe I \nhave it somewhere here. Basically it makes it very clear that nurses \nare not covered by FLSA. The reason nurses get overtime is because the \nvast majority of nurses reach a contractual agreement in their union \nnegotiations which gives them overtime. Those are not going to be \nchanged, obviously. As a practical matter, nurses should not be \nincluded. So there you have another, who knows, 200,000-plus people who \nwere added to this 8 million number, which is bogus.\n  Then you have cooks. There is a difference here on cooks. There are \nchefs, professional chefs--yes, they would probably lose overtime, or \nbe suspect, or have that as part of the compensation, depending on \nwhether they have a union contract. The 4-year culinary school graduate \nwho is a professional chef who manages a kitchen, that person is \nprobably going to have to negotiate their overtime independent of these \nrules. But there are not any other cooks who are going to be covered. \nThe fellow working down at the local diner or the persons working in a \nrestaurant are not going to be covered by this law because they are \nclearly not exempt individuals. The vast majority--who knows, probably \n90 or 95 percent--are not going to be exempted and will continue to get \novertime.\n  So you have a number, however, that was included, which I believe is \nall the cooks. At least that is the implication of the language. \nProbably another 200,000 people are in that category of work.\n  Reporters--this is another one listed by my colleagues across the \naisle. All reporters are going to lose their overtime. That is a fight \nreporters have been having for a long time. That is a fairly public \nfight, whether reporters are professionals or not professionals. I \nguess every reporter has to get up in the morning and look in the \nmirror and decide whether they are professional. But those who decide \nthey are not professional who want overtime are going to have to \nnegotiate their union contracts for that, probably, because as a \npractical matter that reporter issue is being settled in the court \nsystem.\n  How it breaks down is very much an issue. But it certainly is not \ngoing to be affected by these regulations. It is already decided in \nlarge part by court decisions and will continue to be so. So to throw \nreporters in here is again a very bogus figure.\n  Clerical workers clearly are not going to be covered. The vast \nmajority are not going to be covered, vast majority are not going to be \ncovered by this regulation nor will it have any impact on their \novertime.\n  Teachers are entirely exempt by law already from FLSA. To put \nteachers on the list is again misleading. It either reflects a lack of \nknowledge of how the law works or an intent to try to inflate the \nnumber. Teachers clearly get overtime, but it is a function of their \ncontract negotiations, not a function of FLSA.\n\n  The same goes for physical therapists, lab technicians, and social \nworkers. In all these categories the vast majority of people who fall \nin the last three categories are not going to be impacted in any way by \nthis proposal--by exemption, but will continue to get coverage for \novertime activities or will pick it up through their union contracts, \nmany of them being unionized, especially social workers, for example.\n  As a practical matter, what we have here is a grossly inflated number \nwhich has no economic or statistical support behind it, which has \nvirtually no law support behind it, especially in the biggest \ncategories--part time, police, fire, first responders, nurses, and \nteachers. And as a result, this number of 8 million which we keep \nhearing thrown out on the floor is a bogus number. It is a completely \nbogus number.\n  The real number is probably closer to what the Department had \nassessed by outside counsel, by outside review, and which shows a plus. \nIn other words, it shows more people are going to get overtime out of \nthis regulation change than have the potential of losing overtime under \nthis regulation change.\n  Does that mean it is perfect? Of course not. There are ways to \nimprove it, as I mentioned when I started, with 80,000 people \ncommenting on it. But this issue is clearly not ripe for this Senate to \nbe acting on it. Let's wait and give the Department a chance to review \nthe options, review what it hears from the various people including, I \nthink, some very cogent and thoughtful comment that came in from some \nof the major labor unions that are concerned about this. Although if \nyou are in a labor union, by definition you are probably not going to \nbe impacted by this law. But as a practical matter--you may be. As a \npractical matter, there was cogent, thoughtful comment put forward. \nThere were 80,000 comments. Not all of them, I assume, were cogent and \nthoughtful, but a great deal made some thematic sense. Let's allow the \nDepartment to sift through this and update a law or regulation that has \nbeen on the books for 30 years and really does need updating. We are a \ndifferent society. We have a different work structure now. We have a \nmuch more flexible and educated workforce, a highly technical \nworkforce, a value-added workforce. We need to have an overtime law \nwhich reflects and answers the needs of that workforce, not the needs \nof a workforce in 1950 or 1960.\n  I simply say it is premature to be going forward with this proposal \nat this time. Let's wait until the final regulation is passed. It is \nextremely inappropriate for us to be going forward on the basis of a \nnumber which is being used as the bludgeon for pushing through this \namendment, this 8 million figure, which is totally inflated and, in my \nopinion, clearly bogus and inaccurate, especially if you compare it \nwith the hard figures which were brought forward by the administration \non this proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, and I \ndon't want to keep him waiting while I make my statement, I think he \nmade some interesting points. As he knows, I generally have great \nrespect for him. But some of these things sort of don't pass the smell \ntest. I ask the rhetorical question: Does anybody in here believe this \nadministration is changing work rules in order to be able to pay more \npeople overtime?\n  Let me say that again. Does anybody believe the Secretary of Labor, \nand this President of the United States, backed by the Chamber of \nCommerce and many other decent, honorable business people as their core \nsupporters, is trying to change the law to give more people access to \novertime?\n  Mr. GREGG. If that is a question which the Senator has presented, \nwhich I think was rhetorical in its nature?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be happy to have you answer it.\n  Mr. GREGG. By definition, this administration has shown it intends to \ngive more people overtime. It has said people now earning up to $21,000 \nwill be guaranteed overtime. Under the present law, if you are earning \nup to $8,000 you are guaranteed overtime, but between $8,000 and \n$21,000 you can be doing a number of jobs in the country which deny you \novertime, where your employer can say, I am sorry, we are not going to \npay you overtime because you happen to be an exempt employee. Under \nthis proposal from this administration, over 1.3 million people will be \ngetting overtime they would not get under the present law because the \nthreshold goes up to $21,000.\n  I appreciate the Senator's question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to hear that. I am glad to see the \nPresident has had an epiphany. I find it absolutely fascinating. I come \nfrom a corporate State. I come from a State where business is a great \ncitizen and they are very active. I have never had one small \nbusinessman, I have never had one large businessman, I have never had \none come and say: You know what the problem is here, Biden? You \nDemocrats are denying people overtime. We want to expand that contract \nmade in the thirties between labor and management to make sure our \nworkers who are not getting it get overtime.\n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\n  As they say in the neighborhood I come from, give me a break. Give me \na break.\n  I am going to go to my formal statement in a moment. My friend from \nNew Hampshire made a couple of very important points that are accurate, \nbut draw exactly the wrong conclusion. He said that, in effect--my \nwords--the social contract we entered into 30, 40, 50, 60 years ago \nwith American workers said if you engage in manual labor, you will be \nrewarded for your efforts. We the American people, we the American \nGovernment value manual labor. We value what you have done to build \nthis country. We are going to make sure that you get treated fairly. \nOne of the things they said that related to being treated fairly was \nthat nobody should have to work more than 40 hours. That was a judgment \nmade. In Germany, or in France--I don't know which one it is--they say \nyou only have to work 35 hours, and there is a debate about whether it \nshould be 40 or 50 hours.\n\n  We made a deal as a nation. We said: Look, if you work more than 40 \nhours--those of you who do manual labor--you ought to be compensated \ntime and a half for doing it--just like you work on Sunday. They say \nthat is a day of rest. Most contractors say if you have to work Sunday, \nwe will pay double time. That was the deal we made.\n  As my friend points out, there are not many manual labor jobs left in \nAmerica. We have exported them overseas--or the bulk of them overseas. \nWe made it easier for business to take all those manual labor jobs and \nsend them overseas. This is a different world. We have now become a \nservice economy. We have a lot less people doing manual labor. What was \nthe underlying rationale as to why we were going to pay people \novertime? We were going to pay overtime not to those who did manual \nlabor. That is what it happened to turn out to be. We said we are going \nto give people overtime if in fact they are in the workplace and they \ndon't have control over their destiny. They do not get to determine the \nwork rules. They don't get to decide how much longer they will keep the \nlathes going. They don't decide whether or not they work on Saturday or \nSunday. It is about control.\n  The underlying rationale was we said workers who by and large were \nmanual laborers and do not have a say in their work conditions, do not \nhave a say in how they function, do not have a say in whether they \nstart at 8 or 10 in the morning or 4 in the morning, do not have a say \nin when the shifts run, and do not have a say in whether or not they \nget a window outside their work space, we are going to pay those guys \nsomething when we ask them to work more than 40 hours.\n  But for those folks who have a say, and those folks who have some \ncontrol--theoretically white-collar workers, people who get a room with \na view, people who have some say on whether or not the boss starts the \nshift or opens the door at 8 in the morning or 4 in the morning or 10 \nin the morning, and those folks who are more like management--they have \na say and we are not going to compensate them. Their compensation is in \neffect because they have a say.\n  As a former Governor of California used to say, there is psyche \nremuneration for being white collar.\n  Just like around here, I get to pick my office. I get to decide \nwhether I have a room with a view. I get to decide to have a more \ncommodious work space. The person who works for me who happens to be \nanswering the mail doesn't get that decision. If I put the mail room in \na place where there is no window, as long as it meets OSHA's \nrequirements, they work. Guess what. Hang on everybody. For those of \nyou who ain't management, you ain't going to get overtime anymore when \nthe boss says: By the way, show up. I have an election. You get \novertime now. You all get overtime. Get ready.\n  At any rate, the point is this: It is about control.\n  My friend said the world has changed. It is a different economy than \nit was in the 1950s and 1960s. That is right. But if it is based upon \nthe premise of control, which is the underlying rationale for the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, I would argue my friend from New Hampshire is \nright. The world has changed. But guess what. White-collar workers \ndon't have control now. As we move to a service economy and white- \ncollar workers, we don't have people digging ditches. We don't have \npeople lifting lumber. We don't have people moving heavy equipment. \nThey are still there, but we have white-collar workers who wear blue \ncollars and who are in high-tech industries and industries that are the \nservice economy--who work in restaurants and work at all these other \nplaces--who, in fact, still have no control.\n\n  Let me ask you a rhetorical question. Am I missing something here? \nEvery single survey I have read during the last decade asking about \nsatisfaction that American workers derive from their jobs--am I wrong \nor have all those surveys come back and said there is less \nsatisfaction?\n  We are not allowed to talk to the galleries. So I am not going to.\n  But I wonder whether people watching this or sitting in the galleries \nas I ask a rhetorical question will ask themselves this: Am I satisfied \nin the workplace? Do I feel my job is rewarding? Do I have any element \nof control over my job?\n  The funny thing I have found is whether they are a DuPont engineer or \na chemist or an analyst at a brokerage house, they are all afraid they \nare going to show up one day and find that the company has been sold \nand they don't have a job. They don't have any control. Guess what. \nThey don't have much.\n  I agree with my friend. The world has changed. But the values haven't \nchanged. The value we are operating on is that people who do not get \nmuch say in how and when and where and under what conditions they work \nwhen you ask them to work more than 40 hours should get paid overtime. \nThe fact that there are fewer people wearing sweatshirts and sweating \nas they perform their jobs is not the issue. How many of those folks in \nthe new service economy have any more control over their jobs than \nthose folks who did manual labor 40 years ago?\n  That is the first point I want to make.\n  The second point I want to make to my friend from New Hampshire, who \nis a very bright guy--I am not being solicitous; he really is.\n  The second point I make, I agree. He says there is more flexibility \nin the workforce. I will make a bet. I will make the staffers and my \nRepublican colleagues a bet. I bet if they go out tonight, as they stop \nin the grocery store or stop to pick up the bottle of milk, or if they \nare single, stop at the local watering hole to commiserate with their \ncolleagues, ask the following question to whomever they encounter: What \ndoes flexibility in the workplace mean to you? Although I have never \ndone this, I make a bet the answer everyone gets is the following: It \nmeans my boss can fire me when he wants. It means I have to work part \ntime. It means I am flexible, but they do not have to pay health care. \nIt means I do not have to get benefits I used to get when it was not so \nflexible.\n  Flexibility does not translate into control. It does not translate \ninto you being able to determine, in effect, compensation for being \nasked to stay longer, the environment in which you work or the \ncircumstances in which you work. Flexibility translates to most \nAmerican workers as flexibility for the boss to tell me I am part time.\n  My friend did point out part time. I am not going to get into a \ndebate whether it is 8 million or 1.3 million. That is focusing on the \ntrees and not the forests. What is the big picture, folks? The big \npicture is my Republican colleagues have a very different set of values \nthan I have. They are good people. They are decent people. I am not \nimpugning their motive, but they have a different value set. I think \nthe basic principle is if, in fact, you work in a circumstance where \nyou do not have much control over your environment, and I ask you to \nwork longer than 40 hours, you should have to be paid overtime. That is \na basic fundamental value. To me it is simple.\n  What has this President done? He is a decent, honorable man. What has \nhe done? He has a very different view of American labor and the rights \nof American labor. Look at his tax structure. All our existence in this \nlast century and the beginning of this century, what was our tax \nstructure designed to do? It was designed to treat the guy and woman \nwho make their living using their hands the same way as the guy who \nmakes his living using his head.\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\n  We did not make a distinction in this country based upon whether you \npay taxes--until now. What has this administration said now? It depends \nwhether you have--and it is a fancy term--earned income or unearned \nincome. All those listening to me know the difference. Earned income \nmeans when you receive a salary, basically. Unearned income is when you \nhave a return on an investment.\n  What have we done in trying not to tax dividends? We have said, if \nyou sit in your living room, in your home library, in your corner \noffice on the 67th floor, wherever you sit, and you manage your \ninvestments, you do your work with your brain alone trying to figure \nout how to best place the money you have to get a return, if you make \nmoney, if you make that week $1,000, then we are not going to tax you. \nBut if you run a piece of heavy equipment, digging out the World Trade \nCenter, and you make $1,000 because of your hourly wage and your \novertime, we are going to tax you. Ain't that sweet?\n  This is the administration--my friend from New Hampshire wants me to \nbelieve--that is changing these rules in order that more people will \nget overtime. That does not pass the laugh test. Look, even the \nstenographer knows I am telling the truth. It does not pass the laugh \ntest. Let's get real here, OK.\n\n  There is a sound philosophic argument for the position of the \nRepublicans based on a different value set than I have, but it is \nsound. They argue the reason why you shouldn't tax the guy who doesn't \nbreak a sweat is because he will provide the liquidity, the pooling of \nmoney out there from which people can borrow money, make investments, \ncap investments, to put guys like my dad to work when he was alive. God \nlove them being so concerned about my dad. But that is a legitimate \nargument. And what they say is, we value that effort, because it is a \nmore societal consequence, than we value the guy sitting behind a crane \nor a heavy piece of equipment because we will tax him, but we will not \ntax the guy who creates something of greater value. He does not break a \nsweat. He does not put his body at risk. He puts his money at risk.\n  Now we are creeping into a two-tiered notion of what is the most \nvaluable thing to be compensated in this country. It is a legitimate \nargument with which I fundamentally disagree. Make no mistake about \nwhere those guys are coming from. Don't try to tell me they are trying \nto help my brother, the laborer. Don't try to convince me they are \ntrying to help the average middle-class guy. Don't try to tell me they \nare trying to create wealth among those who are raising their kids in \nsplit-level homes and trying to pay for tuition. Don't try to tell me \nthat. They are trying to do that indirectly because if you let the big \nguy have more money, he will take a greater risk and he will invest it \nand maybe employ that man or woman in the $100,000 split-level home \nwith three bedrooms and four kids. But for God's sake don't tell me \nthat is their major concern.\n  This is about values. It is obvious this administration does not have \nthe same value set, at least speaking for myself, that I have, or that \nwe have had, or value the social contract in effect that we fought over \nall during the teens, 1920s, and 1930s, and began to put into place in \nthe 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.\n  The nature of the economy has changed, but the nature of those who \nhave control and do not have control has not changed. That has not \nchanged. Those numbers and proportions have not changed. This is not \nfair. But it is consistent. It goes back to the trickle-down, bubble-up \ndisagreements, a very simplistic way to show the differences between \nour parties. We think average folks can actually make decisions for \nthemselves. We think they can actually and should be rewarded for what \nthey do. That will generate economic growth. They think, no, let the \nwealthiest among us make those judgments and that will trickle down and \nbenefit my noncollege-educated father and mother. It is a legitimate \nargument. But it is different value set. It is a different way of \nlooking at the world.\n  For Lord's sake, do not try to convince me this administration is \nseeking to change the overtime work rules so more people get overtime. \nIn the last 3 years, more than 3 million private sector jobs have \ndisappeared. And for each of those 3 million jobs lost, there is a \nstory of a child without health care, a family in crisis without \ndignity or hope, their dreams lost or at least deferred. A job loss is \nnot just another statistic, it is a real human tragedy.\n  Paraphrasing President Truman, and I didn't know what he was doing at \nthe time, my grandfather Finnegan from Scranton used to say, Joey, when \nthe guy up in Throop loses his job, it is an economic slowdown; when my \nbrother-in-law loses his job, it is a recession; when I lose my job, it \nis a depression.\n  There is a lot of depression for a lot of folks out there. For 3 \nyears now, this administration has told us that tax cuts are the only \nthing we need to do to get this economy rolling. They said tax cuts \nwere all we needed to create new jobs. You know the talk about creating \nnew jobs. But here we stand today, trillions of dollars in tax cuts \nlater, and we have not added a single--hear me now--a single, not one \nnet new job to the economy in the United States of America--not \none. And I will bet the President anything he wishes to bet that at the \nend of his term--defeated or reelected--on election day 2004, this will \nbe the first administration since Herbert Hoover not to create one \nsingle solitary net new job. As they used to say on ``Saturday Night \nLive,'' ``Ain't that special?''--not one new job.\n\n  Not only have we failed to create new jobs, we are losing the ones we \nhave. Tax cuts were the only policy we had, but it is painfully clear \nthey haven't worked, at least in relation to jobs. And now it is clear \nthat tax cuts and deficits are credited for crippling our ability to \nmeet our responsibilities here at home in homeland defense and to \nshoulder the burdens we face around the world, at exactly the time the \nPresident has rightfully called on us to come up with another $87 \nbillion for Iraq.\n  I think it is time to ask the question: If we are not going to create \nany new jobs--and the President's Council of Economic Advisers argued, \nby the way, that last year's tax cuts would produce 5.5 million jobs \nbetween now and the end of 2004. With the loss of 93,000 jobs last \nmonth, that puts them 437,000 jobs behind their promise already. I \nchallenge them to create one new job during this administration.\n  The latest official numbers look slightly improved on paper, but that \nis because nearly 2 million men and women who have been out of work for \nover half a year know that good jobs are just not there so they have \ncompletely given up looking for work.\n  I know my friend from West Virginia has been through a lot. He could, \nnot figuratively but literally, write a book on this. He has witnessed \nwhat has happened to his coal miners. He has witnessed what has \nhappened to the folks in his State. He has been through a depression. \nHe was part of those who worked us out of that. He knows what not \nhaving a job means to somebody.\n  So most of us here--all of us, Democrat and Republican, know that the \nkey to our dignity as human beings is being able to provide for \nourselves, and it is also the key to a healthy economy.\n  A jobless recovery, which we have right now, means nothing to the \nmillions still out of work. And this so-called jobless recovery is in \ndanger of causing the recovery as a whole to sputter out because its \nfoundation is not very solid.\n  There is little hope for sustained, healthy economic growth without \nsolid, good-paying jobs. Consumer confidence and consumer spending--the \nkeys to our economy--ultimately depend on Americans' confidence that \nthey are going to have a secure job, a job that pays a fair wage for a \nfair day's labor.\n  For over half a century, American workers have known what that meant: \na 40-hour workweek and time and a half for overtime. You could count on \nthat extra pay in exchange for the extra burden of working more than 40 \nhours a week.\n  So I would just ask, what has changed in America that says when you \nwork more than 40 hours a week, you should not get compensated more for \nit? What is it that has changed that says the premise of overtime pay \nis no longer sound? What is it? What is it that has changed, that is \ndifferent from the agreement we made--business and management and \nlabor--that if you\n\n[[Page S11208]]\n\ndon't control your work environment, you should be compensated \nmonetarily when you are asked to work in that environment beyond 40 \nhours? What has changed?\n  What is happening? Have we taken on a new set of basic values or is \nthere something in the marketplace that has changed that demands this?\n  I will conclude with this. The irony of all of this is that at the \nvery time when people are feeling less secure physically, the very time \nwhen people are feeling less secure about their jobs, at the very time \nwhen we have lost millions of jobs, and no reasonable prospect of \nseeing them regained in the near term, why is it they have to pile on \nnow--pile on now--and begin to change that basic contract?\n  You would think they would at least have the good grace and the \ncourtesy to wait until things have improved a little bit. It just seems \nto me to be really bad form, just bad form, because you know a lot of \nthose guys and women who are making overtime are helping pay their \nmother's prescription bill, are making sure that their brother, who \nlost his job, is able to keep his kids in school.\n  A lot of that money for overtime is family overtime. And now we want \nto change that. I think it is getting a little bit greedy. I think it \nis just a little bit greedy. I think it is bad form. And I sincerely \nhope I turn out to be wrong. I sincerely hope the economic \nconservatives in this administration really are attempting to provide a \nchange in the rules to make sure that more people get overtime. I will \ncome to the floor and say: I'm sorry, I misjudged you. I thank you for \nyour concern for working-class people. I thank you for your concern \nthat not enough of them were getting paid overtime, and I appreciate \nthe fact you are now willing to pay more people more overtime. I don't \nthink I will have to make that speech. I hope I am wrong.\n  Mr. President, last month 93,000 Americans lost their jobs. Over the \nlast 3 years, more than 3 million private sector jobs have disappeared. \nAnd for each one of those 3 million lost jobs, there is a story of a \nchild without health care, a family in crisis without dignity or hope, \ntheir dreams lost or deferred.\n  A job loss is not just another statistic, it is a real human tragedy.\n  For 3 years now this administration told us that tax cuts are the \nonly thing we need to get the economy rolling again. They said tax cuts \nare all we need to create new jobs. But here we stand today, trillions \nof dollars in tax cuts later, and we have not added a single new job to \nthis economy.\n  Not only have we failed to create new jobs, we are losing the ones we \nused to have. Tax cuts were the only policy they had, but it is \npainfully clear that they have not worked. And now it is clear that the \ntax cuts and the deficits they created are crippling our ability to \nmeet our responsibilities here at home and to shoulder the burdens we \nface around the world--at exactly the time the President has rightfully \ncalled on us for $87 billion for Iraq.\n  It is time to ask the question: Can this administration create just \none new private-sector job, one more job than existed when they took \noffice?\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisors claimed that the last \ntax cut would produce 5.5 million new jobs between now and the end of \n2004. With the loss of 93,000 jobs last month, that puts them 437,000 \njobs behind their promises already.\n  I challenge them to create just one new job during this \nadministration, one new job before the next election.\n  The latest official unemployment number looks slightly improved on \npaper, but that is because the nearly 2 million men and women who have \nbeen out of work for over half a year know that god jobs are just not \nthere and they have completely given up looking for work.\n  Jobs are the key to our dignity as human beings. And they are the key \nto a healthy economy.\n  A jobless recovery like we have right now means nothing to the \nmillions still out of work. And this so-called jobless recovery is in \ndanger of sputtering out because it lacks a strong foundation.\n  There is little hope for sustained, healthy economic growth without \nsolid good-paying jobs.\n  Consumer confidence and consumer spending--the keys to our economy--\nultimately depend on Americans' confidence that they have a secure job, \na job that pays a fair wage for fair days' work.\n  For over half a century American workers have known what that meant, \na 40-hour work week, and time and a half if you worked overtime. You \ncould count on that extra pay in exchange for the extra burden of \nworking more than 40 hours a week.\n  Many workers often have no choice about working overtime, it is up to \ntheir boss. But they have to work those extra hours, their employer is \nrequired to pay them time and a half.\n  This has been a cornerstone of the social contract between labor and \nmanagement, between workers and employers.\n  For other workers, higher overtime pay is often absolutely essential \nto making ends meet. For those struggling along on the minimum wage or \na little more, overtime pay can make all the difference when you are \ntrying to make ends meet.\n  We know that many workers simply schedule themselves as much overtime \nas they can physically bear so that they can stay above water \nfinancially. But despite the key role of the 40-hour work week, despite \nthe wide-spread reliance on time and half pay for work past those 40 \nhours, this administration has proposed crippling changes in the \nregulations governing overtime pay.\n  That is why I am here as a cosponsor to the Harkin-Kennedy amendment \nto prohibit funding for those new overtime regulations.\n  Senator Harkin deserves our thanks, and the thanks of millions of \nworkers, for his leadership on this issue.\n  On its face, the issue could not be clearer. The administration wants \nto take away the rights of millions of workers to overtime pay. They \nwant to make it easier for employers to reclassify as many as 8 million \nhourly workers--who now get overtime pay--to make them ineligible for \novertime pay.\n  Right now, for most workers, if you are not ``white collar'' working \nin management, your boss has to pay you time and a half for all the \nwork you do over 40 hours a week. The idea is that more highly educated \nworkers, who participate in management, who have significant authority \nover the workplace, are more properly classified as salaried, not \nhourly, workers. They get a fixed amount of pay, no matter how many \nhours they may put in a week.\n  Hourly workers, on the other hand, who do not manage the conditions \nunder which they work, who have less to say about the work week is \norganized, must be compensated if they work more than the basic 40 \nhours.\n  That has been the definition of a fair day's work for a fair day's \npay for more than half a century, and its basic fairness still makes \nsense today.\n  America has changed, but not our values. But the administration's new \nregulations would make it easier--would actually create an incentive \nfor employers to classify workers who have little advanced education \nand little or no authority--to classify those workers as white collar \nworkers.\n  Those regulations would lower the amount of education currently \nrequired to classify someone as white collar or professional. And they \nwould also loosen the definition of management activities to make it \neasier to claim that a lot of the basic paperwork many hourly workers \ncurrently do actually makes them administrators or executives.\n  Overnight, with the stroke of a computer key, millions of workers \ncould lose the right to overtime pay. These rules are designed not only \nto make it easier to reclassify workers, but to make it pay for \nemployers who do so.\n  Employers will save money, since they will no longer be required to \npay workers time and a half for work that they are now guaranteed. \nThere would be no change in the number of hours they could be required \nto do, no change in their education, no change in their \nresponsibilities, just one change in the regulations in Washington--and \nthey are out overtime pay and out of luck.\n  Today, when the biggest problem facing our economy is the loss of \njob, when a well-paying job is so hard to come by, these regulations \nare the worst thing we could do.\n  This administration has the worst record of job loss since Herbert \nHoover--3.2 million jobs lost. Faced with the obvious fact that his \neconomic\n\n[[Page S11209]]\n\npolicies have failed to create a single new job, faced with the fact \nthat years into a so-called recovery, we are still losing jobs, the \nPresident recently announced a warmed over package of his failed \npolicies and labeled it a job creation plan. I suppose it is a good \nthing that he finally realizes that he is presiding over the worst job \ncreation of any modern President.\n  Unfortunately, there is nothing new in his announcement, and \nabsolutely nothing that would create one new well-paying job. If he \ntruly wants to do something for the working men and women of America, I \nrespectfully suggest that the President simply rescind these proposed \nregulations. That alone would protect the overtime pay on which so many \nmen and women and their families depend today.\n  Now is not the time for this administration to use its regulatory \npower to cut the pay of millions of American workers. But if we will \nnot stop this pay cut for millions of Americans, we can do that today \nhere in the Senate. We can vote to prohibit any funds from going to \nenforce this unfair and wrong-headed change in our basic social \ncontract, in the deal we have struck between millions of workers and \ntheir employers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and yield to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, are we operating under any time constraints?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Mr. President, when President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind \nAct, he promised to give schools the funding they needed to help every \nyoung person in this country succeed in the classroom.\n  That promise has not been kept. And there is no better example of \nthat broken promise than the education funding levels in this \nappropriations bill. The most glaring example is the title I program. \nTitle I helps the students who need help the most--the millions who are \nbeing left behind. It is also the program that, under the No Child Left \nBehind Act, will hold schools accountable for improving student \nperformance.\n  We did not have this program in my day and schools did not have to be \nheld accountable, either, for improving student performance. It was a \ngiven that students went to school to learn and that they were expected \nto study hard. That is why we had our schools. We were there to get an \neducation.\n  That is why, when Congress wrote the No Child Left Behind Act, it \nauthorized specific funding levels for title I for every year through \nfiscal year 2012. The authorized amount for fiscal year 2004 is $18.5 \nbillion. That is enough to fully serve 6.2 million needy children, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service.\n  How much does this bill provide? This bill provides just $12.4 \nbillion. That is enough to fully serve only 4.1 million children.\n  The amendment I am offering would increase title I funding by $6.1 \nbillion, for a total of $18.5 billion, the fiscal year 2004 authorized \nlevel, and it would extend the full educational benefits of title I to \n2.1 million children who otherwise would be left behind. This would \nallow us to keep the promise we made in the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I have to my left a chart. This chart shows what this amendment will \nmean for schools in all 50 States. I know that their listing here \ncreates a chart on which it is difficult to read from any distance \nvirtually. But here they are, 50 States. Let's take a few examples.\n  Take for example New Hampshire. Under my amendment, New Hampshire \nschools will receive $19.5 million more than they would receive under \nthe Senate bill. That is a 66-percent increase over the fiscal year \n2004 level.\n  Let's take a look at Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania schools will receive \n$223.4 million more under my amendment. That represents a 51-percent \nincrease over the fiscal year 2003 level.\n  In Maine, schools will receive an additional $24 million for a 50-\npercent increase. In my State of West Virginia, schools will receive \n$47 million, $46.8 million more under my amendment than they would \nreceive under the Senate bill, also for a 50-percent increase over the \nfiscal year 2003 level.\n  There are other schools. All of the States on this chart--and there \nare 50 of them--under my amendment every State receives an increase \nover the Senate bill.\n  Massachusetts will receive $129.3 million more under my amendment \nthan it would receive under the bill. Alaska would receive $18.4 \nmillion more. New York would receive $682.2 million more. California \nwould receive $899.5 million more than it would receive under the \nSenate bill. That is the way it goes all the way down the line. The \nDistrict of Columbia would receive $27.8 million more. The State of \nOhio would receive $203.8 million more. So every State would gain under \nthe Byrd amendment.\n  This amendment is fully offset for fiscal year 2004. It achieves this \nby rescinding fiscal year 2004 advance appropriations in the fiscal \nyear 2003 Labor-HHS appropriations bill and reappropriating those \nmoneys in fiscal year 2003. That is the exact same mechanism that \nChairman Stevens and Chairman Specter are using to add $2.2 billion to \nthe base bill--the same mechanism. My amendment simply builds upon \ntheir mechanism and adds $6.1 billion more for title I.\n  Unfortunately, there has been some confusion over this point. I was \ndisappointed last week to hear a Senator from the other side of the \naisle refer to my amendment as a gimmick. Yes, referred to my amendment \nas a gimmick. Think of that. That Senator on the other side of the \naisle said my amendment was a gimmick. The exact words were ``a gimmick \nof classic proportions.''\n  Well, I would like to call the Senate's attention to page 76 of the \nbase bill. Lines 1 and 2 add $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2003 spending. \nNow read exactly what is in the bill, lines 1 and 2, ``by striking \n$4,651,199,000 and inserting $6,895,199,000.'' So you see, lines 1 and \n2 add $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2003 spending.\n  Now just drop two lines; just go down the page two lines and read \nlines 3 and 4; 3 and 4 offset that increase by rescinding $2.2 billion \nin fiscal year 2004 advance appropriations in the fiscal year 2003 \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill. So my amendment uses the same funding \nmechanism as has been used in this bill.\n  Mr. Specter, chairman of the subcommittee, can verify that. Mr. \nStevens, chairman of the full committee, one of the finest chairmen \nthere have been since that committee was created in 1867, will verify \nthat. He will verify that I am reading this accurately and that that is \nwhat is being done.\n  So my amendment uses the same funding those two illustrious gentlemen \nused in writing the bill. And if my amendment is a gimmick--hear me--if \nmy amendment is a gimmick, what does that say about the base bill? Is \nit also a gimmick? I ask, is the base bill also a gimmick?\n  Opponents of my amendment have also argued that the Congress is under \nno obligation to fund title I at the authorized level because \nauthorizations are just guidelines.\n  Well, title I is not your average authorization program. Most \neducation authorizations don't put mandates on States. The title I \nprogram in the No Child Left Behind Act puts more Federal mandates on \nour Nation's schools than any law in 35 years.\n  This law requires every State to develop a plan for helping all \nstudents reach a proficient or advanced level of achievement within 12 \nyears. That is all students--all students, not just those in the \nwealthy suburbs but poor students, students from Appalachia to Alaska, \nchildren with disabilities, students of all races and ethnicities.\n  Schools must leave no child behind, and if schools that receive title \nI funds fall short of this goal, they face serious consequences. \nSchools that fail to make adequate yearly progress in raising student \nperformance for 2 consecutive years have to give the students the \nopportunity of transferring to another public school. That means the \nschool has to take money it would have spent for instruction and use \nthat money instead for transportation. The penalties get more severe as \ntime goes on. Ultimately, if a title I school fails to make adequate \nprogress for 5 years in a row, it can be taken over by the State or the \nentire staff can be fired and replaced.\n\n[[Page S11210]]\n\n  These are serious penalties, Mr. President, and I support them. I \nbelieve it is high time we held schools accountable for their \nperformance, but I also believe if we are going to threaten schools \nwith penalties--and these are severe penalties--we have a \nresponsibility to provide those schools with the resources they need to \nimprove.\n  Senator Kennedy and President Bush agreed on what those resources \nwould be when they negotiated the No Child Left Behind Act. Senator \nKennedy and President Bush agreed that title I should be funded at \n$18.5 billion in fiscal year 2004 and Congress voted overwhelmingly to \nendorse that figure when it passed the law.\n  When President Bush signed that law a few weeks later, he said:\n\n       We are going to spend more money, more resources, but they \n     will be directed at methods that work.\n\n  But this appropriations bill which mirrors the President's budget \nrequest falls more than $6 billion short.\n  Let me take just a moment to explain what schools could do with that \n$6 billion. The amendment I am offering would provide enough funding to \nhire more than 100,000 highly qualified teachers for the students who \nare most at risk of being left behind. That means over 2 million \ndisadvantaged students would be taught in smaller classes, and they \nwould receive the full range of instructional services called for under \nthe No Child Left Behind Act.\n  It is no wonder students and teachers across the country are \nclamoring for this funding. In West Virginia, the Department of \nEducation announced this summer that 326 of the State's 728 schools \nfailed to make adequate yearly progress under the No Child Left Behind \nAct. That is 45 percent of all the schools in the State.\n  In many other States, more than half of all the schools failed to \nmake adequate progress. So I ask my fellow Senators: Where is the money \ngoing to come from to help these schools improve? State governments are \nfacing a fiscal crisis. So State governments are not in a position to \nrespond to the needs. Where will the schools turn? State governments \nare in no position to make up a funding shortfall from the Federal \nGovernment. Yet this appropriations bill underfunds title I by more \nthan $6 billion.\n  This bill is a betrayal of the No Child Left Behind Act. It is unfair \nto all the people in this country who are working so hard to implement \nit. Parents and teachers want their schools to be held accountable. \nThey want every child to succeed. They are holding up their end of the \nbargain.\n\n  Where is the President? What happened to his commitment to education? \nI will tell you what happened. Once the President signed the No Child \nLeft Behind Act and the cameras stopped rolling and the sound bites \nfaded away, the President walked away from the job of funding \neducation.\n  Sadly, we have seen this picture before. This January in his State of \nthe Union Address, President Bush announced a 5-year, $15 billion \nglobal AIDS initiative. Later he signed a law promising to fund that \ninitiative at $3 billion a year. Then this summer, he went to Africa \nand promised to do all in his power to make sure Congress fully \nfinanced that law. But when it came time to put the money behind that \npromise, where was the President? The President fell short. And he is \ndoing the same thing with education.\n  The Congress is being asked to provide billions of dollars for the \nreconstruction of Iraq--the Appropriations Committee, I hope, will \nconduct hearings on that request--for what we are told is Saddam \nHussein's willful neglect of all major infrastructure needs, including \nschools. So the President wants money for Iraq. He wants to make up for \nSaddam Hussein's willful neglect of all major infrastructure needs, \nincluding schools.\n  Mr. President, if the United States Government is to address \ninfrastructure needs in Iraq, why can we not find the money to support \nour own domestic education system in the form of funding the No Child \nLeft Behind Act? Where are our priorities? I voted for the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. I support the reforms in that law, but schools need \nmore funding if we are truly going to leave no child behind.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to approve this amendment. We gave our word \nto the people when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act. So let us, \nMr. President, keep our word.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator from West Virginia be kind enough to \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from West Virginia was here at the time we \nhad the debate on the No Child Left Behind Act and remembers it very \nclearly. I remember one of the finest education talks I have heard in \nthe Senate was where the good Senator from West Virginia reviewed for \nthe Members of the Senate his personal experience--it was shared by a \nfew others--in terms of the value of education as a young person when \nhe was growing up in the State of West Virginia. As he remembers the \ndebate on the No Child Left Behind Act and the debate we had the year \nbefore when we were looking at the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, there was a general recognition in this \nbody that just providing resources without reform was not meeting our \nresponsibility to the children of this country. But if we were going to \nhave reform, we were going to have to have resources.\n  As I remember the discussions we had with the President of the United \nStates on this point, this was a simple concept, but a rather basic \nconcept, one which gathered broad bipartisan support and was the \nkeystone of the whole No Child Left Behind Act. I am wondering if the \nSenator remembers at least that general debate and discussion in which \nthis body said, OK, we have not been able to use the resources we have \nused in looking at title I and elementary and secondary as effectively \nas we would like to, but we are strongly committed toward reforming our \neducational system because education is so important to the future of \nour country, and that was a debate that took place, that resulted in No \nChild Left Behind, and it is to that issue that the Senator from West \nVirginia is addressing the Senate, as I hear him this afternoon; that \nwe have put in place the reforms but what is not there are the \nresources to give life to the reforms. This is what is at the heart of \nthe Senator's amendment, as I understand it and as I interpret it. Am I \ncorrect?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who has \nbeen a leader in this field, and who is a leader in this field, \nremembers very clearly and accurately the purposes and the debate on \nthe No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I have never wanted to just throw money at anything. I never felt \nthat just throwing money at education was going to educate our \nstudents, but I have been in favor of the reforms that are in this act. \nI believe we ought to do everything we possibly can to utilize those \nreforms, to put them into effect, enforce them, and at the same time \nhave the money available to these schools so the reforms can be made, \nwill be made, and will be enforced. They are pretty tough reforms.\n  As I indicated in my remarks, we have an obligation to provide the \nmonies to those schools. When I was going to school, I started out in a \nlittle two-room schoolhouse in Algonquin, WV, in the southern part of \nWest Virginia. I entered school long about 1923. Of course, we did not \nhave Federal aid to education then. We had good teachers, although they \nwere not paid a lot. During the Depression, many of them had to take a \nreduction on their paychecks to get those checks cashed, but we had \nteachers who cared. I had foster parents who cared. Our schools were \nnot much, but we studied hard and we tried to make a better life for \nourselves and our parents. So I know something about the disadvantaged \nchildren and disadvantaged schools. I came through that Depression. I \nam proud to say I was alive in that Great Depression. I am proud to say \nI lived through it because it taught me a lot of lessons. It taught me \nthe worth of an education.\n  Benjamin Disraeli, who was Prime Minister of Great Britain, said in \nthe House of Commons in 1874--the reason I remember the date easily is \nit was the year before my foster father, Titus Dalton Byrd, was born. \nSo it was 1874. Benjamin Disraeli said: Upon the education of the \npeople of this country the fate of this country depends.\n  I think the Senator will join me in saying we ascribe to that; that \nupon the education of the people of our\n\n[[Page S11211]]\n\ncountry the fate of this country depends. So this is a vote to improve \nthe education of disadvantaged children. It is a vote to keep our word \nthat we gave when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts. I said he has been a \nleader. I said he is a leader and he was a leader on this bill. He \nspoke with President Bush and he worked this approach out with \nPresident Bush. I congratulate him for it, but we have to do what we \ncan to live up to it, and that is what we are doing here.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate what the good Senator has said in his \ncomments. These figures might get complex for people who are watching \nthis debate. Basically, the No Child Left Behind Act said, No. 1, we \nare going to let the States develop their own curriculums.\n  No. 2, we are going to have well-trained teachers who are going to \nlearn that curriculum and be able to teach the students.\n  No. 3, we are going to have smaller class sizes so a well-trained \nteacher in the classroom is going to be able to interact with the \nstudents in those classrooms.\n  No. 4, we are going to find out how much those children learn over \nthe course of the year by giving them not just robot tests and \nsituations where teachers teach to the test but really inquire about \nwhat these children are learning in the classroom.\n  No. 5, we are going to have supplementary services to help those \nchildren if they fall behind so they will be able to keep up. That is \neffectively what we were looking at in the No Child Left Behind \nproposal.\n  We demanded accountability, as the Senator remembers. We demanded \naccountability from parents because we gave parents the report cards \nnot only about how the children were doing but how their school was \ndoing. We gave accountability to the teachers that they were going to \nhave to upgrade their skills in the courses they were going to have to \nteach. We gave accountability to the school systems that unless the \nschool systems were going to perform, if they were going to effectively \nabandon their children or not perform for their children, that they \nwould effectively be taken over by the State. And we were going to \ninsist on a good quality education.\n  Does the Senator, in his comments today, agree with me that we are \ngetting accountability with the students who are working in America and \nthe teachers who are trying hard and those in local communities who are \ntrying to get the small classes, but we do not have the accountability \nby the President of the United States and the administration providing \nthe resources to let them do it and that the amendment of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia would meet our accountability and our commitment \nwhen we voted on behalf of that bill?\n  Would the Senator agree that is effectively what we are trying to do? \nThat is the way I read the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator reads it as I intended it to be read and as \nother Senators who are cosponsoring this amendment intended likewise.\n  There is no question about the fact that we were trying to give our \nchildren smaller classrooms. The Senator might know--of course he would \nnot know how many students were in my graduating class. I was \nvaledictorian of that class in 1934. If there had been one more student \nin that class, I might not have been valedictorian. There were 28 \ngraduates. What a large class. But it was not by virtue of the kind of \nlegislation that we have been supporting. That was the number of \nstudents in those southern Virginia coalfields.\n  We had good teachers. They were not paid a good deal, but we knew the \nworth of a good teacher. They were dedicated. What we are trying to do \ntoday is give our children smaller class sizes so they will get from \nthe teachers the kind of attention they need. We are trying to give \nthem good teachers. We are holding the teachers to high standards, \nalso.\n  Yes, I am somewhat amazed and offended by the fact that our President \nis wanting $87 billion now for Iraq. That is $87 billion for Iraq. That \nis not counting the $69 billion the Congress has already appropriated, \nno questions asked, by the way, for Iraq, making a total of $166 \nbillion for Iraq. So we are going to be asked to consider a \nsupplemental for Iraq.\n\n  I am going to consider that. But why not consider more moneys for our \nown students, for our own teachers, for our own schools? That is what \nwe are trying to do here. We are trying to live up to the word the \nPresident and Senator Kennedy and I and others in Congress gave to the \nAmerican people, to the students of our country, and to the parents, \nand to the teachers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to just bring to the attention of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia the results of the scores that are taken in my own \nState of Massachusetts, which really began this effort, which is very \nsimilar to what I have just outlined here, 5 years ago.\n  Let me just read the front page on September 4, 2003 of the Boston \nGlobe:\n\n       Scores show broad gains on MCAS test.\n\n  That is the statewide standard test, which is basically equivalent to \nwhat we call the NAEP test. Let me read this.\n\n       More Massachusetts high school students passed the MCAS \n     graduation test on their first attempt this year, as scores \n     climbed in nearly every grade, every subject, and every \n     racial group, statewide results released yesterday show.\n       About 75 percent of the class of 2005, or about 52,000 \n     students passed both the English and math portions of their \n     10th-grade test on their first try this spring. That is \n     significantly better than 69 percent of students in the class \n     of 2004 and 68 percent of students in the class of 2003 who \n     passed the first time they took it.\n       Jubilant state officials hailed the scores at a State House \n     news conference yesterday as ``extremely impressive'' proof \n     that the Massachusetts 10-year effort to improve public \n     schools is bearing fruit.\n\n  Curriculum reform, better teachers, smaller class size, afterschool \nprograms--this is just what has happened in one State, I say to Senator \nByrd. These were the same things we were committed to for every State \nin the country, to see this kind of progress.\n  We have not solved all the problems. We still have many others. I \nwill not take the time of the Senate to review all of the different \ncategories, the ethnicity, the student status, all the different \ncategories. I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Scores Show Broad Gains on MCAS\n\n                          (By Anand Vaishnav)\n\n       More Massachusetts high school students passed the MCAS \n     graduation test on their first attempt this year, as scores \n     climbed in nearly every grade, every subject, and every \n     racial group, statewide results released yesterday show.\n        About 75 percent of the class of 2005, or about 52,000 \n     students, passed both the English and math portions of the \n     10th-grade test on their first try this spring. That is \n     significantly better than the 69 percent of students in the \n     class of 2004 and the 68 percent of students in the class of \n     2003 who passed the first time they took it.\n       Jubilant state officials hailed the scores at a State House \n     news conference yesterday as ``extremely impressive'' proof \n     that Massachusetts' 10-year effort to improve public schools \n     is bearing fruit. But they acknowledged that a racial \n     achievement gap persists, with more than half of Latino \n     students and almost half of African-American students failing \n     one or both of the 10th-grade tests.\n       ``There have not been wholesale brain transplants. There \n     has not been an increase in the IQ of the citizenry of \n     Massachusetts,'' Governor Mitt Romney said. ``Instead, our \n     education system is doing a better job with our kids.''\n       About 527,000 students in grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 \n     took one or more sections of the MCAS in April and May, in \n     English, math, or science.\n       The results were particularly encouraging for 10th-graders, \n     members of the class of 2005, who were in first grade when \n     the 1993 Education Reform Act, which introduced the tests, \n     became law. About 80 percent passed the math test on their \n     first attempt, and 89 percent passed English.\n       Scores also improved for students with disabilities and \n     those with limited English skills--two groups that have \n     struggled with the exam since it became a graduation \n     requirement with the class of 2003. About 46 percent of \n     disabled students passed the 10th-grade test after just one \n     round, up from 32 percent of limited-English students passed, \n     double the 17 percent who passed a year ago. The jump came \n     despite new federal and state laws allowing few students with \n     a native language other than English to skip the test.\n       To some observers, the signs were clear that 10 years of \n     efforts on education, from billions of dollars in new funding \n     to the first statewide curriculum standards, were paying off. \n     Massachusetts has recorded parallel gains on national tests \n     such as the SAT and the National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress.\n       ``All signs are that education reform is taking root, and \n     this is part of the harvest,''\n\n[[Page S11212]]\n\n     said Andrew Effrat, dean of the School of Education at the \n     University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n       Still, Effrat said, the battle is not over, calling the \n     failure rates for minority students significant.\n       For example, 84 percent of white 10th-graders passed MCAS \n     on their first try, compared with 44 percent of Latinos and \n     52 percent of blacks.\n       Last year, a group of student in the class of 2003 sued the \n     state, saying the Board of Education had exceeded its \n     authority in enacting a graduation requirement and that \n     schools had not prepared them for it.\n       Students in 10th grade can take the test five times before \n     graduation, but they must pass MCAS and all of their classes \n     to earn a diploma. Individual school and district scores will \n     be released in about two weeks along with retest scores from \n     the class of 2003 and 2004 that will show how many students \n     still must pass before earning their diploma.\n       MCAS opponents yesterday questioned how the gains could \n     last as schools facing significant budget cuts this year have \n     laid off teachers, boosted class sizes, and slashed supplies. \n     In addition, the Legislature sliced the $53 million in state \n     money for MCAS tutoring to $10 million this year, and a \n     Romney spokeswoman said she could not say whether the \n     governor will include more money for MCAS help in his \n     forthcoming supplemental budget.\n       Some MCAS critics attributed the gains to a relentless \n     focus on test preparation in schools and the practice of \n     holding back ninth-graders who are not prepared for the exam, \n     and who may later drop out.\n       ``Clearly, test preparation makes test scores go up, and \n     other things contribute, like attrition, which has been a \n     consistent theme and not so much paid attention to'' by the \n     Department of Education, said Lisa Guisbond, a statewide \n     coordinator for the Massachusetts Coalition for Authentic \n     Reform in Education, which opposes the MCAS graduation \n     requirement. ``These are things that continue to be \n     troubling.''\n       However, Massachusetts commissioner of education, David P. \n     Driscoll, and the state Board of Education chairman, James A. \n     Peyser, pointed to higher scores for black and Latino teens \n     as evidence of a ``dramatic breakthrough'' in the achievement \n     gap. In 2001, 77 percent of white 10th graders passed MCAS on \n     their first try, compared with 29-percent of Latinos and 37 \n     percent of blacks.\n       Left unanswered yesterday were questions about a steep drop \n     in the number of black test-takers. State education officials \n     said they will need to study why only 3,530 black 10th-\n     graders took the test this spring, down from 4,587 last year. \n     The number of white test-takers also dropped, from 49,866 to \n     44,131. One possible explanation is that fewer students \n     specified their race this year, state officials said.\n       It could also stem from an increase in the number of \n     students dropping out, leaving Massachusetts, or repeating \n     ninth grade.\n       First administered in 1998, the MCAS test has sparked \n     rallies, protests, and a campaign for a statewide ballot \n     question to get rid of the graduation requirement.\n       Guisbond also questioned whether changes in scoring could \n     have inflated results. This year, 10th-graders needed 19 out \n     of 60 points on the math test to pass, down from 20 out of 60 \n     last year, state officials said. On the English test, they \n     needed 38 out of 72 points to pass, down from 41 out of 72.\n       Jeff Nellhaus, associate commissioner for students \n     assessment, said the Department of Education lowered the \n     number of points needed to pass because a statistical \n     analysis of the exam showed that it had harder questions than \n     the year before.\n       School districts received their students' scores last month \n     and are just now analyzing the results. Tyshawanna \n     Richardson, a junior at the Codman Academy Charter School in \n     Dorchester, passed English but not math. Twenty-five \n     sophomores at the school took the exam--all passed English, \n     and about two-thirds passed the math section.\n       ``I plan on going over whatever I didn't get, to understand \n     it so this time I can pass,'' said Richardson, 16, of \n     Mattapan. ``It wasn't that hard.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But I want to ask the Senator this last question. In the \nBudget Act, the budget for fiscal year 2002, the conference report--\nthis is what bothers me. We have seen the increase in the education \nbudget going from 1997 to 2001 up to 13 percent, to 2002, to 16 \npercent. That is when Democrats and Republicans worked with the \nPresident to try to begin the downpayment on this effort. This is when \nwe had the bipartisan agreement.\n  Then the next year, as the Senator has pointed out, after the \ntelevision lights had faded and the crowd had disappeared, we have in \nthe budget, with the Republicans in charge:\n\n       For the years beyond 2002, this report assumes the 2000 \n     discretionary function level grows by inflation.\n\n  It grows by inflation. Therefore, under the Republicans, it was going \nto be zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. That is what was in the Republican \nbudget. After we passed the bill and we saw the bill increase, this is \nwhat they were saying.\n  Many of us were saying that might have been, but we will hope for the \nnext year from the President of the United States, who specifically \nnegotiated those increases--we thought: That's a mistake--we will find \nsomething different. But instead what we have effectively found, as \nthis chart here indicates, under the Bush budget, it leaves millions of \nchildren behind. We are going to be leaving 6.2 million children \nbehind; 5.89 in 2005; 5.8 million in 2006; 2007, more than 5 million; 5 \nmillion; 5 million. Effectively, under the Byrd proposal, if we \ncontinued that progress we achieve what the No Child Left Behind \ncommitted us to, and that was we were going to have, at the end of 12 \nyears, proficiency in the public schools for the disadvantaged children \nof this country. That is what the Byrd amendment puts us on a pathway \nto. That is why it is so important, so essential.\n  If the Senator would permit me one more moment? We attended the Armed \nServices Committee meeting earlier today. Does the Senator not agree \nwith me the investment in education is essential if we are going to \nhave the best fighting men and women in the world; that investing in \neducation is essential if we are going to have the strongest economy in \nthe world; and that investing in education is absolutely necessary if \nwe are going to be able to preserve democratic institutions in the \ngreatest country of the world? That this is the core value?\n  Parents understand that. You and I understand it. Senator Harkin and \nSenator Murray understand that. That is what the amendment of the \nSenator from West Virginia commits us to here, at a time when we are \nbeing requested $87 billion, to say we can have a downpayment of $6 \nbillion for the children of this country.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is no question about it. I want to \nthank the distinguished Senator for his work in this field. I want to \nthank him for his work on the Armed Services Committee. And I want to \nthank him for his leadership in making laws that will better prepare \nour young people for the future, for what lies ahead of them. Of \ncourse, we need better educated people in our Armed Forces. Of course, \nwe have to have better educated people if we are going to keep this \ncountry as the superpower of the world.\n  I want to thank him for what he has done in this respect. I know he \nmust feel very proud of the record that has been established by his \nschools up there, to which he referred a little while ago. Those \nperformances were in English and math. They are not easy subjects, as I \nrecall--not the easiest. But there is no subject matter that is more \nimportant than that of English, grammar, mathematics. He must feel \njustly proud of the performance those schools have made, that has been \nmade possible, to a considerable extent, by his work on this \nlegislation. So I thank him for his contribution here to our debate \ntoday also.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. BYRD.\n\n     I took a piece of plastic clay\n     And idly fashioned it one day,\n     And as my fingers pressed it still,\n     It moved and yielded to my will.\n\n     I came again when days were past--\n     The bit of clay was hard at last;\n     The form I gave it, it still bore,\n     But I could change that form no more.\n\n     I took a piece of living clay\n     And gently formed it day by day,\n     And moulded with my power and art\n     A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n\n     I came again when years were gone--\n     It was a man I looked upon;\n     He still that early impress wore,\n     And I could change him nevermore.\n\n  That is what we are talking about. That little piece of clay. That \nlittle piece of clay.\n  Just a closing thought about our teachers:\n\n     A builder builded a temple,\n     He wrought it with grace and skill;\n     Pillars and groins and arches\n     All fashioned to work his will.\n\n     Men said, as they saw its beauty,\n     ``It shall never know decay;\n     Great is thy skill, O Builder!\n     Thy fame shall endure for aye.''\n\n     A teacher builded a temple\n     With loving and infinite care,\n     Planning each arch with patience,\n     Laying each stone with prayer.\n\n     None praised her unceasing efforts,\n     None knew of her wondrous plan,\n     For the temple the teacher builded\n     Was unseen by the eyes of man.\n\n     Gone is the Builder's temple,\n\n[[Page S11153]]\n\n     Crumpled into the dust;\n     Low lies each stately pillar,\n     Food for consuming rust.\n\n     But the temple the teacher builded\n     Will last while the ages roll,\n     For that beautiful unseen temple\n     Was a child's immortal soul.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following Senators be \nadded as cosponsors to the amendment I have offered: Senators Harkin, \nDodd, Dorgan, Kohl, Bingaman, Lieberman, Dayton, Pryor, Corzine, \nMikulski, Schumer, Kennedy, Johnson, Edwards, Murray, Rockefeller, \nLautenberg, Lincoln--the first name of the Senator who graces the chair \nand presides over this August body at this moment, with a degree of \ndignity and skill that is so rare as a day in June-- Leahy, Graham, \nKerry, Levin, Clinton, Jeffords, Reed, Sarbanes, Cantwell, Landrieu, \nStabenow, and Durbin.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I came to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak about the amendment offered by Senator Harkin, and I will do so \nin just a minute. But first I want to congratulate Senator Byrd for his \ntremendous work on education and thank him for his extremely strong \nvoice in this area.\n  I know many students are starting school this week. Many young people \nare just starting out in kindergarten across the country this year. \nThey will be grateful for Senator Byrd and his strong support of \neducation. But so will the many students who have traveled to school \nwhile he has been here in the Senate advocating for them. I thank him \nfor his work on their behalf over the many years. For all the young \npeople out there who benefited from his wisdom and support but also, \nvery importantly, for the teachers who will benefit as well, I thank my \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1580\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to speak in \nstrong support not only of Senator Byrd's amendment but also of the \namendment offered by Senator Harkin. The amendment Senator Harkin has \noffered is extremely critical in today's world. It is offered in order \nto protect hard-working Americans such as our police, firefighters, and \nour nurses who rely today on overtime pay.\n  It is unbelievable to me that today as families struggle in this \nextremely difficult economy, the Bush administration wants to cut \novertime pay for millions of Americans who depend on it just to make \nends meet at home.\n  My colleagues have been in the Chamber discussing the Bush \nadministration's proposed changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act which \nsets the rules regarding overtime pay in this country. According to the \nEconomic Policy Institute, those changes are going to mean a pay cut \nfor up to 10 million working families. These proposed changes will mean \na pay cut for up to 10 million working Americans. These families are \nworking really hard today. They are playing by the rules. They are \ntrying to make ends meet. And this administration is squeezing them \nonce again. To me that is unacceptable. That is why the Harkin \namendment is so important today.\n  The question I have is this: Haven't American workers been punished \nenough by this President's economic policies? Not only have we seen \nmillions of Americans lose their pensions but we have seen massive tax \ncuts for the few while everyone else struggles just to get by.\n  In my home State of Washington alone, we have lost more than 73,000 \ngood-paying jobs since this administration came into office. My State \nunemployment rate is now the third highest in the Nation at 7.5 \npercent. In fact, just recently one of our business columnists \nsuggested that the actual unemployment rate for Western States could be \nas high as 11.8 percent, if you count all of our unemployed workers.\n\n  Here we are with so many people out of work and so many people \nstruggling to keep their jobs. Now this administration wants to force a \npay cut on those people who are working overtime for their employers \nand are just trying to make ends meet. I don't think we should forget \nthat these workers are now often the only breadwinners in their family. \nThis change will hurt up to 10 million hard-working Americans. I come \nto the floor today to talk about some of the real people who are going \nto be squeezed by this amendment.\n  Right now, our firefighters, our policemen, and our EMTs are working \nvery hard on the front lines on homeland security. They have gone above \nand beyond the call of duty, often with inadequate training and often \nwith inadequate equipment. But they are doing it to protect us in this \ndangerous age. Today, many of them are working overtime in order to do \nthat.\n  Now the Bush administration is telling our firefighters, our \npolicemen, and our EMTs that they don't deserve overtime pay for the \nextra work they do. I find that very insulting. We know it will hurt \ntheir ability to provide for their families who every day watch these \nmen and women go off to work and hope they return safely at the end of \nthe day. Even worse, it really violates the great trust we place in \nthis country on our first responders.\n  The International Union of Police Associations has estimated that \n200,000 midlevel police officers will lose $150 million in overtime pay \nif these new regulations are implemented. I believe our firefighters, \nour policemen, and our EMTs deserve overtime pay for their overtime \nwork. The Bush administration is trying to squeeze them, and that is \nwrong.\n  Let me give you another example of whom this change will hurt. In \ncommunities across the country we have a shortage of nurses. I hear it \nfrom everyone who comes into our office. It is really causing hardship \neverywhere. These nurses are working really hard. They are providing \ncare under extremely difficult conditions. Now the Bush administration \nis going to prevent more than 230,000 licensed practical nurses from \ngetting overtime pay. They work hard for it. Frankly, in my view, they \ndeserve every penny they get.\n  When I first heard about this disturbing proposal, I joined with my \ncolleagues to tell the Bush administration they are on the wrong track. \nAs the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety, and \nTraining, I was proud to join with Senator Kennedy and 40 other \nSenators in sending a letter to Secretary of Labor Chao. We asked her \nnot to implement the proposed regulation that would deny overtime pay \nto hard-working Americans.\n  In our letter, we asked the Secretary to consider millions of workers \nwho depend on overtime pay to make ends meet and to pay for things such \nas food, childcare, housing, health care, and sending their kids to \ncollege--what every family wants today. We know overtime pay also makes \nup to 20 to 25 percent of an eligible worker's wages. But it seems this \nadministration would rather provide tax cuts for the rich--that is \nwhere their priorities are--while cutting the pay of working Americans \nwho most often live paycheck to paycheck.\n  During this debate, we heard some dubious arguments from the other \nside. We heard that we need to update the Fair Labor Standards Act \nbecause it was passed back in 1938. But what they haven't told us is \nthat Congress has updated that act in fact eight times.\n  In 1985, Congress reviewed the law and extended it to State and local \ngovernments, leaving in place the current overtime exemptions.\n  Furthermore, the Bush administration is taking some unprecedented \nsteps. Never before has the legislative branch authorized changes in \nthe overtime rule. Never before has Congress directed the Department of \nLabor to take overtime pay away from millions of American workers.\n  You have to wonder, why the urgent need now to gut these time-tested \nworker protections? Could it be that the Bush administration and its \nbusiness allies want to reduce the amount they pay in wages? Maybe it \nis because employers know in this very tough economy employees will \njust go along and accept the loss of overtime because they are so \nafraid they will be laid off. I will leave it to others to answer those \nquestions.\n\n  The Senate should not support this coercive antiworker proposal. It \nwill drain the wallets of millions of Americans who are working hard \ntoday to put food on the table. This proposal from the White House, in \nmy opinion,\n\n[[Page S11214]]\n\nis just another slap to working Americans. We need to stop it in the \nSenate.\n  I commend the Senator from Iowa for offering this critical amendment. \nSenator Harkin has always been a great friend to working Americans, and \ntoday those Americans need this Harkin amendment to protect them from \nthis administration's designs.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for our firefighters, stand up for \nour police, stand up for our EMTs, stand up for our nurses who work \nevery day for Americans. Stop this proposed pay cut for American \nworkers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague, Senator \nMurray, for speaking on the overtime amendment offered by Senator \nHarkin, and Senator Robert Byrd for speaking on his amendment involving \nfunding the President's mandate, the No Child Left Behind legislation. \nI address both of those issues for a moment.\n  First, I say to the Senator from Washington, what she has outlined in \nher State can be repeated in virtually every State across America. For \nthe last several years, we have seen a loss of jobs in America \nvirtually unprecedented in recent history. In fact, you have to go back \nso far as President Herbert Hoover in the Great Depression to find a \ntime when America has lost as many jobs as we have lost since President \nBush took office. Remember, in the preceding 8 years we created 22 \nmillion new jobs in America, but since President George W. Bush has \ntaken office we have lost almost 3 million jobs. This is a modern \nrecord, a sad record felt in every State, my own included.\n  I have also been told that some 90 percent of the jobs we have lost \nhave been manufacturing jobs, jobs which have been lost to Third World \ncountries, countries such as China, that have taken away the \nmanufacturing jobs that used to be the bread and butter for the \ncommunities of America. They are leaving in droves. Since President \nBush took office we have lost 120,000 manufacturing jobs in Illinois. \nIn the last 5 years, we have lost one out of every five manufacturing \njobs, and there is no end in sight.\n  I held a press bipartisan conference today with some of my colleagues \nwho decried the current situation in China where they are sucking away \nall of our jobs because of currency manipulation. The point is that \nwill be addressed in another bill.\n\n  In this bill, we have to be concerned not with the exodus of American \njobs to Third World countries but the immigration of Third World labor \nstandards into the United States. The Bush administration, through the \nDepartment of Labor, is establishing a standard which says that some 8 \nto 10 million workers in America will no longer qualify for overtime \npay. Those included in that group, as we have heard from my colleagues \non the floor, are firefighters, nurses, many who have important jobs in \ncommunities related to health and safety. The Bush administration has \nsaid they will not be entitled to overtime in the future.\n  Those with a sense of history can remember from our history courses \nand our readings how many lives were lost in America in the \nestablishment of the labor movement to fight for one particular thing: \nthe 40-hour workweek. This was, frankly, one of the most contentious \nissues. We finally said, as a matter of law in America, businesses \ncould only work their employees 40 hours a week or they would have to \npay time and a half for the extra time. That was a bitter battle that \nwent on for decades with a lot of bloodshed and lives lost because of \nsocial upheaval as workers across America spoke out for their rights. \nBut eventually it was established. The 40-hour workweek in America \nbecame a sacred precept, not just in collective bargaining contracts \nbut as well in legislation, to apply to everyone. The understanding was \nthat beyond 40 hours you would have to pay extra.\n  What is the basis for it? Certainly so the workers' rights would be \nrespected. It would lessen exploitation. It would say to the employer, \nif you are going to work someone beyond 40 hours, that certainly is a \nphysical impediment, one that could be a hardship, as well as a family \nhardship, and you should pay more for it.\n  Now comes the Bush administration saying it is family friendly and \neliminating the right to overtime pay for 8 to 10 million Americans. It \ncould not come at a worse time. It could not be a worse idea.\n  Senator Harkin of Iowa offers an amendment which my friends on the \nother side of the aisle are afraid we will call for a vote on, an \namendment that says we will not allow the Department of Labor to go \nforward with this bad idea.\n  I totally support the Harkin amendment. We need to protect the rights \nof workers in America today, rights that have been fought for decades, \nover a century of effort by men and women to bring dignity to the \nworkplaces under assault because of this proposal from the Bush \nadministration.\n  Let me say a word about the Byrd amendment before the Senate. Senator \nRobert C. Byrd of West Virginia has offered an amendment which \nbasically says to the President: Keep your word. Keep your word.\n  When this President came to office as the education president, he \nsaid: I am going to bring Democrats and Republicans together. He turned \nto my friend and colleague behind me, Senator Kennedy, and said: Join \nme in passing the No Child Left Behind legislation. Let's do it right. \nLet's do it in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Senator Kennedy joined him, as did Congressman George Miller of \nCalifornia, in a bipartisan effort, supported by many, including \nmyself. No Child Left Behind demanded accountability in schools but \nsaid if the children are having a tough time passing the test, we want \nto provide extra resources to school districts across America so the \ntest scores will improve.\n\n  Resources for title I is a program where school districts directly \nhelp students and their families, students who are falling behind. The \namount that was to be authorized for this was spelled out in law, \nwritten down and approved by the President, signed into law, and No \nChild Left Behind went into effect.\n  Across America, public schools are bound by the requirements and \nmandates of No Child Left Behind. But, unfortunately, when it came to \nPresident Bush's budget, he failed to appropriate the funds necessary \nto pay for this mandate. So the mandate goes unfunded at the local \nlevel.\n  I don't know about the States of my colleagues but I can speak about \nIllinois. We are in a terrible fiscal crisis. We had to cut $5 billion \nin State funds this year--a very difficult thing to do--and our schools \nhave suffered in the process. For us now to say that this Federal \nmandate of No Child Left Behind is not going to be funded as President \nBush promised means that the President is not keeping his word to the \nschoolchildren and families of America.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment says to the President: Keep your word. Find \nthe $6 billion you promised to send to these school districts.\n  I happen to think Senator Byrd is right. I am happy to be a cosponsor \nof his amendment. We cannot at this point in time establish new \nmandates and new responsibilities on school districts across America \nstruggling to survive and not provide the resources.\n  In my home State of Illinois, almost half of the school districts are \nnow in desperate financial straits. In the city of Elgin, IL, a growth \narea in my State, they appropriated funds 2 years ago to build four new \nschools that were to be open this fall when school opened. Sadly, the \nElgin School District does not have the resources to open the schools. \nThey cannot afford the teachers. They cannot afford the overhead costs. \nThe four brandnew school buildings sit vacant, an indication of how \ndifficult it is to fund education at the local level in the midst of a \nrecession, in the midst of a situation when State budgets are \nstruggling to find balance.\n  That is a compelling argument for us to keep our word, to make \ncertain that school districts across America have the money to help the \nkids improve their test scores, improve their education, become better \nreaders, understand math and science, and improve as students. Unless \nand until we do that, we have no business mandating on these school \ndistricts that they have to start transporting students across school \ndistrict lines and all of the other penalties associated with No Child \nLeft Behind.\n\n[[Page S11215]]\n\n  Let's pass the Byrd amendment. Let's keep our word to the \nschoolchildren across America, even if the Bush budget does not.\n  The last point I make is an amendment which I plan to offer at the \nfirst opportunity. Again, it relates to a promise made by President \nBush. I was at the State of the Union Message, as most Members of the \nSenate attended, just a few months back. I listened carefully as the \nPresident made a pledge on behalf of the people of the United States. \nIt was historic in terms of its commitment. The President said: We in \nthe United States would lead the world in battling the global AIDS \nepidemic. President Bush said to standing, thunderous ovation from both \nsides of the aisle that he was pledging $15 billion a year over the \nnext 5 years to fight the scourge of HIV and AIDS around the world. It \nwas the right thing to do. The President was showing the leadership, \nwhich we expect of him, and leadership which makes all of us proud as \nAmericans. Frankly, most of us believed at that point the deal was cut, \nthat from that point forward no questions would be asked.\n\n  Now look at the bill before us and what do you find? Do you find that \nthe $15 billion over 5 years results in $3 billion in spending in the \nnext year, as one might expect? No. Scarcely $2 billion will be \navailable--$2 billion to meet a $3 billion commitment.\n  There have been many serious casualties in Iraq. We have lost many \nlives. Many of our service men and women have been injured. But now we \nare dealing with the other Iraqi casualties--funding for our schools, \nfunding for the global AIDS epidemic.\n  The President again must be held to the standard that he set, the \nstandard of American leadership around the world in dealing with the \nglobal AIDS epidemic. I certainly hope my colleagues, many of whom \nvoted for the resolution offered by Jeff Bingaman, the Senator from New \nMexico, a few weeks ago--I think there were over 80 votes in favor of \nit, and we said we should put $3 billion in the budget this year for \nthe global AIDS epidemic. I hope they will support my amendment which I \nhope I can offer later today or the first thing tomorrow, because in \nthat amendment we will be able to keep our word.\n  Recently, in the Chicago Tribune, there was an editorial. This \neditorial suggested that this is a key floor vote on whether we are \ngoing to implement President Bush's bold $15 billion 5-year plan to \nfight AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean. The Tribune went on to say:\n\n       The vote will go a long way toward determining if the U.S. \n     will keep its promise to lead the world in the fight against \n     AIDS.\n       That noble pledge seems to be wilting under the heat of \n     other budget pressures. Bush has lobbied Congress for no more \n     than $2 billion for the first year. The Global Fund to Fight \n     AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria would be particularly hard-hit \n     by the reduced commitment.\n\n  They go on to say, my colleague from Illinois, Representative Henry \nHyde, in the House:\n\n       . . . secured approval for legislation specifying that $2 \n     billion, plus an additional $1 billion for the Global Fund, \n     would be disbursed each year, rather than ``backloading'' the \n     money into later years.\n\n  Make no mistake, the AIDS epidemic is upon us. Every year we delay, \nevery dollar we delay will increase the number of deaths and hardships \nand orphans created by this terrible disease. We have an opportunity to \ndo something significant in terms of the global AIDS epidemic, in terms \nof our Nation's commitment, in terms of what President Bush has said he \nwould do as our leader in this country. But we need to follow through. \nLet's not look for excuses. Let's, instead, look for the opportunity to \nlead, which is before us today.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join on these three amendments by \nsupporting Tom Harkin to stop the overtime pay change, which the Bush \nadministration is pushing; secondly, to support Senator Robert Byrd, \nwho has said the President must keep his word to fund the mandate which \nhe has sent to public schools across America; and again, in my \namendment, to offer the $3 billion to a world desperately in need of \nour help to deal with the global AIDS epidemic.\n  We can do this. We can keep our word. We can show the leadership that \nthe President has promised.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1566\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will speak briefly about my higher \neducation amendment, which I offer with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Collins, from the State of Maine.\n  It is our hope that we might be able to vote on the Byrd amendment \nand the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut and this amendment \nlater this evening. I do want to take a few moments, once again, to \nreview the importance of adding the $2.2 billion to make sure the Pell \nGrant Program will continue to be alive and well.\n  Very quickly, the issue of availability of college for young people \non the basis of their talent and educational achievement goes back to \nthe 1960 campaign. That was a prime issue in that campaign: whether we, \nas a matter of national policy, were going to say to any young person \nin America, that if they had the ability to get admitted to any of our \nfine universities across this country, the size of their pocketbook or \nwallet would not limit them in terms of attending any of the great \npublic or private universities, that they would be able to put through \na package which would include grant programs, some loan programs, \nperhaps some work-study programs, perhaps a summer job program, and \nwhatever else they might bring to the table, but at least it was going \nto be available.\n  There was going to be help and support for any young person in \nAmerica. And any young person who was to take advantage of it was not \ngoing to have to mortgage their future in terms of borrowing from banks \nor from loan agencies. That was enormously important.\n  As a result of that, we have seen the opportunity for higher \neducation available to millions of Americans. It was not really much of \na surprise because we had seen the GI bill and then the cold war GI \nbill that was made available to veterans who took advantage of it.\n  The GI bill, after World War II, opened up enormous opportunities for \nnew generations. Any careful review and study of that GI bill would \nfind that paid back into the Treasury $9 for every $1 that was invested \nin students. It more than paid for itself just in terms of the bottom \nline economics of it, let alone the opportunity it gave to millions of \nyoung people. And then we had the cold war GI bill.\n  So this issue has been discussed and debated in this country as a \nmatter of national policy. But what we are seeing, in the very recent \ntimes, is the sliding away from that fundamental commitment that says \nyoung people, if they are able to meet the academic standards, would be \nable to go to college.\n  In fact, I can remember a Secretary of Education, under a Republican \nadministration, testifying before the Education Committee and saying: \nThat is not what this Republican administration is really all about. \nAny young person will go where they can afford to go. And it should not \nbe the Federal Government that is going to provide them with any of the \nhelp and the assistance.\n  That was an absolute retreat on what I thought for a time was a \nmatter of a national kind of policy and priority. But, nonetheless, we \nhave had to have that battle every several years. We have to have that \nbattle on this Appropriations Committee because any careful reading of \nthis appropriations bill would reflect that this Republican bill does \neffectively nothing to help families afford college. This has a zero \nincrease in individual Pell grants. It has a zero increase in campus-\nbased aid. It has a zero increase in the college work study. These are \nprograms to provide job opportunities in the schools, as well as the \nPell Grant Program.\n\n  If we look at the difference, the contrast between grants and loans, \nwe can look back over the recent history. This goes back to 1980, 1981, \nwhere you will see that 55 percent of the education assistance was \nactually in grants, and then about 42 or 43 percent were actually in \nloans.\n  If you look at where we are now, in 2001, 2002, you will find 58 \npercent are loans and 41 percent are grants. This is a dramatic shift.\n  What this has meant is that great numbers of young people--estimates\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\nare anywhere from 35 to 45 percent--who are attending higher education \nare working 25 hours a week or more.\n  If you visit any of the campuses, you will find that the young \npeople, at the time there is a break in the instruction, are talking \nabout their jobs rather than talking about the books or their poems or \nthe ideas which they are taking from their classes.\n  What we have seen is enormous indebtedness that the young people have \nexperienced over this period of time, and this is for the average \nstudent who is going to any of the schools. About 68 percent of any of \nthe young people who are attending schools or colleges get some \nfinancial aid.\n  Four years ago, when they were graduating from any of the public and \nprivate institutions across the country, the average was $27,000, \n$28,000 a year in terms of debt. Now that has doubled effectively \nbecause of the increase in the amounts the young people have to \nborrow. That has increased dramatically with a number of the young \npeople who are going to graduate schools. And it is not infrequent that \nthose who are graduating from the graduate schools end up with debts of \n$100,000 or $120,000.\n\n  This chart shows the shrinking buying power of the Pell grant. Going \nback to the late 1970s, if you got a Pell grant, it was about 84 \npercent of the cost of your education, if you went to a public 4-year \ninstitution. If you went to a private institution, it was still about \n40 percent. Now we find it is 39 percent instead of 84 percent, if you \nare going to a public 4-year institution. If you are going to a private \n4-year institution, it is down to 15 percent.\n  One of the most dramatic factors is the median income for the Pell \ngrant recipients. It has gone from a little over $11,000 for family \nincome in 1989 to 1990, to the year 2000 where it is now $15,000. This \nis the average income, 15,200 for 4.8 million young people who get the \nPell grant who go to college today. But these are individuals who have \nthe academic know-how and who have worked hard, come from humble \nbackgrounds, and have been able to excel academically and gain entrance \ninto some of our finest schools and colleges in the country. They are \ndemonstrating an extraordinary perseverance.\n  What we are saying with this amendment is that we are going to make \nsure the Pell grant is going to continue its value in terms of young \npeople who are qualified for it. Under this particular amendment, it \nwill add $450 to the value of the Pell grant, which will mean 200,000 \nmore children will be able to take advantage of the Pell grant in this \n$15,000 range. These are young people of talent, commitment, and \nconviction, who are hard working. This gives them the opportunity. That \nis what this is about. If this amendment is not successful, there will \nbe over 100,000 Pell grant recipients, it is estimated, receiving the \nPell grant today who will lose it as a result of the increase in the \ntuition that we have seen escalate over the past year.\n  I will not take the time to go over the increases, but every Member \nof the Senate understands what has happened in terms of increases in \ntheir States.\n  Finally, I draw the Senate's attention to the administration's policy \nitself, talking about Pell grants. The bill provides $12.7 billion for \nPell grants, $538 billion less than the President's request for the \nhigh priority program. We are asking for $2.2 billion in order to \nprovide for the Pell grant but also the TRIO programs, which are the \nindispensable link for children who come from disadvantaged educational \ncircumstances but are gifted and talented, so they are able to gain \nentrance into the schools, as well as the GEAR UP Program which has \nbeen such a success.\n  We believe this is one of the most important amendments. If you care \nabout education, you will stand with Bob Byrd, with his increase in No \nChild Left Behind. If you care about providing opportunities for the \nsons and daughters of low- and middle-income families who have ability, \nwho have creativity, who have demonstrated their willingness for hard \nwork, you will vote for this amendment. This amendment makes sense. It \nis an expression of a nation's priorities. I hope we will have a strong \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will engage in a colloquy now to explain \na little bit about what has been going on today and yesterday and \noutline what the plans will be for tonight and tomorrow. It will be \nmyself and Senator Daschle and the managers of the bill, to clarify our \ngeneral understanding.\n  First of all, last week tremendous progress was made on the bill. The \nmanagers have done a superb job in taking what we all know is a large, \nvery important bill, a complicated bill, and systematically addressing \nthe amendments that Senators have brought to the floor. A particular \namendment, the Harkin amendment, has been the amendment talked about \ntoday and over the last 3 days. And it is an amendment that people feel \nvery strongly about on both sides of the aisle.\n  In addition, both sides have looked at a whole range of amendments. \nAnd the managers have been made aware of those amendments.\n  As is always the case, the list is very long. But after discussion \nwith the managers, it is clear that we have a manageable number of \namendments that can be addressed if we started right now, tonight, in \nwhich case we would have to go very late tonight, tomorrow, and \ntomorrow night and complete action on the bill.\n  What it would mean is going back, in essence, to regular order in the \nsense of going back and voting shortly on four amendments, starting in \na few minutes, after which the general understanding is that we would \ndebate about six amendments tonight. Again, these are amendments which \nhave been presented. They have been talked about and discussed. They \nwould be debated tonight with the expectation that tomorrow morning we \nwould vote on those amendments that require a vote and that we would \nvote on the Harkin amendment in the morning.\n  All of this is with the understanding that we would complete the bill \ntomorrow night and that we would stay and complete the appropriations \nbill as long as it takes tomorrow night, understanding that it is going \nto be challenging, that we are going to have to stay right on the bill \nand the amendments under discussion and stay focused in order to \ncomplete that bill tomorrow night.\n  If that could be done--and it will be done, based on the agreement--\nthen it would be possible for us not to have rollcall votes on Thursday \nor Friday. We have September 11 on Thursday. We will have services here \nat the Capitol, and most of us will be participating in services either \nin our districts or here. So it is a challenging day. But I also think \nit is important for us to continue the normal business of the Senate on \nSeptember 11 around those services. We would have a legislative day on \nFriday. In fact, we would be able to move to other business on Thursday \nand on Friday. But when we finish the bill tomorrow night, it would be \nwith the understanding that we would address the amendments that I \nmentioned tonight, the specifics of which we will talk about shortly, \nand that we would finish the bill tomorrow night; that we would not \nleave until we finish the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur with what the majority leader \nhas just described as the current understanding. It is not our \nintention to ask for unanimous consent. That is not necessary. We have \na number of amendments under regular order that can now be called up. \nIt is our hope that we could get at least through four of them, perhaps \nmore. It is also our expectation that we will have additional \namendments offered tonight with an understanding that those votes will \noccur in a stacked sequence tomorrow morning, following the vote on the \novertime amendment.\n  I believe it is possible for us to finish our work tomorrow if we put \nin a full day. We have lost a lot of time, unfortunately. But I think \nwe can make up for that lost time tomorrow, with the understanding that \nSenators have to travel to their States, in many cases. We know of at \nleast eight Senators, those most affected by 9/11, who will want to be \nin their States on Thursday.\n  I think it is important that we accommodate their understandable need \nto be in the States they represent. To do that, we really, out of \nnecessity,\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\nwill have to try to finish tomorrow night. I think we can do that.\n  The managers on both sides have done a very good job of working \nthrough the list of amendments we have, and we are prepared to vote on \na substantial number of amendments already. If we do that tomorrow, \nwith the assurances given by the majority leader--and there is also one \nother assurance. It is my understanding from previous conversations \nthat we would be going to another appropriations bill as the next order \nof business whenever we complete this one. I know there is the \noutstanding question of when the so-called legislative veto of the FCC \nrule will occur, but except for that, it is the understanding, I think, \non both sides, that we will stay on appropriations bills for the \nforeseeable future.\n  Mr. President, it would be my hope that we could begin voting soon to \naccommodate that schedule. I would like to work with the majority \nleader to complete our work on time tomorrow night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the two leaders are on the floor, I \nhave spoken with Senator Byrd. His amendment has been pending for a \nlong time. He indicated he is ready for a vote now. I wonder when the \ntwo leaders wish to begin that first vote. It is on amendment No. 1543, \nSenator Byrd's amendment. Can we do that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I understand the regular order, that \nwould be the first amendment. With his cooperation, I see no reason \nwhy, at least on our side, we couldn't begin the vote almost \nimmediately.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before we call for the regular order, \nagain, a lot of what we are going over today, tonight, and tomorrow is \non good faith that we are going to finish this bill tomorrow night and \ndo everything within our power.\n  A lot of people say: Why don't you put it in writing; get a unanimous \nconsent agreement. We are not doing that because of this determination \nand good-faith effort as we go forward.\n  Before going to the regular order, I ask the managers to make a \nstatement that they understand what the two leaders have said in terms \nof completion of the bill; that we will start voting here shortly, \noffering other amendments tonight, stacking votes in the morning, \nhaving a full and productive day, and staying here as long tomorrow \nafternoon or tomorrow night as it takes to complete the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader for their statements. I am prepared to move ahead \nwith the vote on the Byrd amendment. We have Senator Durbin waiting to \noffer an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. REID. To give people a little bit of notice, Senator Durbin is \ngoing to be one of the four votes tonight. He is going to take 10, 15 \nminutes to offer his amendment, which is one of the four amendments \ntonight. As soon as he does that, maybe we can start voting. He needs \n15 minutes and the Senator from Pennsylvania needs time to speak in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that arrangement is satisfactory. I want \nto be sure we do not go to the vote on Senator Byrd's amendment before \nwe give Senator Durbin a chance to offer his amendment with a brief \nreply, if necessary, on this side.\n  I reiterate, perhaps supplement, what has been said that we are going \nto be looking for at least six more amendments to debate tonight. We \nwill be discussing with the Members during the votes their intentions, \nwith an effort on all sides to pare down the list to the maximum extent \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the leader for yielding. I wish to express my \nthanks to the majority leader, the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, \nSenator McConnell, and, of course, my appropriations leader, Senator \nSpecter, for helping to work this out. In good faith, we are going to \nmove ahead on this bill.\n  I concur with everything our majority leader has said. I believe we \ncan move ahead. I believe we can get these votes in tonight. We can \nhave debate on a number of amendments, and we can stack them for votes \nin the morning. I see no reason why we cannot finish this bill tomorrow \nnight. I will make every effort to make sure that is accomplished.\n  Again, I want to make it clear, that after Senator Durbin offers his \namendment and makes his speech, we could then move to four amendments \nwe can vote on quite rapidly. That will be Senator Byrd's amendment on \ntitle I, Senator Kennedy's amendment on Pell grants, Senator Dodd's \namendment on Head Start, and Senator Durbin's amendment on global AIDS.\n  For those Senators who may be watching in their offices right now and \ntheir staffs, we are going to move ahead very aggressively on this \nbill. We have a number of amendments people have contacted me about, \nstating they want to offer them and on which they want a vote. If \nSenators want to offer an amendment and get a vote on it, be here this \nevening and offer that amendment and debate it. We will stack it in the \nmorning because after tomorrow morning, things are going to move pretty \nrapidly. We know how things go.\n  I am saying: A word to the wise. If any Senator has an amendment and \nwants to offer it and wants an up-or-down vote, I respectfully suggest \nand hope they will come over this evening and offer that amendment so \nwe can vote on it in the morning.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, may I ask the majority and minority \nleaders, who are in the Chamber, a question about another scheduling \nitem? I understand there is no unanimous consent request pending with \nrespect to this bill, and I understand the desire to finish this \nappropriations bill. I am a member of the committee and know we have a \nlot to do, so I am fully supportive of moving ahead and finishing this \nbill.\n  As the leaders know, there is a privileged resolution on the calendar \ndealing with the Federal Communications Commission rules and the \nresolution of disapproval. I filed that with a discharge petition with \n35 signatures. It is bipartisan. We will need time to have a Senate \nvote on that. This is attendant to a 10-hour period for debate and then \na vote on the resolution of disapproval on the rules that the FCC has \nnow developed dealing with broadcast ownership.\n  These are very controversial. This is a very important issue. I have \nspoken with both the majority and minority leaders previously about \nthis. I ask the majority and minority leaders if we can expect at some \npoint in the next day or so to set a time so the Senate will know when \nwe will vote on the resolution of disapproval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is, in part, related to the Democratic \nleader's request about order of business. The Dorgan issue will be \nbrought up at a mutually agreed time, and I think we will have an \nopportunity to do that this week. Depending on how things go tonight \nand tomorrow night, that means we have Thursday and Friday which, when \nwe complete the bill tomorrow night, the agreement is we will not be \nvoting Thursday or Friday. I think what we might well consider is doing \nthe Dorgan bill Thursday or Friday. Again, I am a little hesitant \nbecause Thursday there is so much going on in terms of ceremonies, \nalthough I know we will be in session Thursday afternoon--we will be in \nsession all day--but Thursday afternoon there is a block of time, or \nThursday night or Friday. I would like to move to another \nappropriations bill on either Thursday or Friday. I think we can work \nthat out. We would probably vote Monday night, if that is a reasonable \ntime. We will have other votes Monday night because if we go to an \nappropriations bill, likely we will have several votes Monday evening.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my intention to be cooperative, and \nI want to finish the appropriations bill as well. I think we can work \nin a way that gives the Senate an opportunity to know when the vote \nwill occur. We can find a way to do the debate and give us an \nopportunity to weigh in on this issue.\n  Incidentally, it is the Dorgan-Lott proposal. It is bipartisan, with \nmany Members of the Senate from both sides\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\nof the political aisle. What I hear correctly is we probably could get \nsome final arrangements for a vote next Monday evening. That makes \ngreat sense to me. Then we can have the debate between now and that \nperiod. I am only interested in nailing this down so Senators \nunderstand exactly what will happen.\n  I thank the majority leader for his response.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to proceed. Thus, I \nask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to the Byrd amendment \nNo. 1543 occur at 5:50 this evening, with 15 minutes for Senator Durbin \nand 5 minutes for Senator Specter, and that there be no amendment in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1591 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will offer an \namendment which I understand will be fourth in order for voting \ntonight.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment to fulfill our pledge to the \nmillions of people around the world, in Africa in particular, who \nsuffer from HIV/AIDS.\n  AIDS is fast becoming the worst plague the world has ever endured. \nAlready, 25 million people have been killed by the disease. These \ncharts have been provided to us by the United Nations World Health \nOrganization. If we will look at these startling numbers, they indicate \nthe number of adults and children newly infected with HIV during the \nyear 2002: 3.5 million in sub-Saharan Africa; 700,000 in South and \nSoutheast Asia; 270,000 in East Asia; 150,000 in Latin America; 250,000 \nin Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The numbers of newly infected \npeople last year are truly startling.\n  Take a look at those who are living with HIV/AIDS at the end of the \nyear 2002: 29.4 million in sub-Saharan Africa; 1.2 million in East \nAsia; 6 million in South and Southeast Asia; 1.2 million in Eastern \nEurope and Central Asia; almost a million in North America. The numbers \nare startling.\n  Then, of course, the mortality tables really tell an equally sad \nstory. The estimated adult and child deaths from HIV/AIDS during the \nyear 2002: 2.4 million in Africa. I know what happens when these \nnumbers are read. Eyes glaze over, minds turn numb, and one thinks, I \ncannot calculate all of these numbers.\n  If you had been there, as I and so many of my colleagues have been, \nto meet with the families who are infected, who understand that they \nhave a death sentence from HIV/AIDS, families who show extraordinary \ncourage every single day getting up and doing their work, realizing \nthey will never be able to afford the medicine necessary to prolong \ntheir life, families trying to keep it together with their children for \nthat last moment, realizing their time will soon come, you would never \never forget it.\n  The statistics, as I said, may be something that numbs our mind but, \nfrankly, for those who seen it firsthand, as I have, they will never \nforget it. As parents are dying, 14 million AIDS orphans have been left \nwithout the care and support they need. Unless we act soon, there will \nbe 25 million AIDS orphans. Each year, the world loses a population \ngreater than the city of Chicago because of AIDS.\n  We know how to stop the deaths. In his State of the Union Address, \nPresident Bush made a 5-year pledge of $15 billion to help millions of \nAIDS sufferers in Africa and around the world in fighting the AIDS \nepidemic. Listen to what he said:\n\n       We can turn our eyes away in resignation and despair, or we \n     can take decisive, historic action to turn the tide against \n     this disease and give hope of life to millions who need our \n     help.\n\n  Unfortunately, the President's solid and courageous rhetoric was not \nbacked up by his own budget request. His budget this year falls nearly \n$1 billion short of the $3 billion for the coming year that is needed \nto meet the 5-year $15 billion pledge.\n  Sadly, the President's shortchanging on AIDS will cost lives. The \nadditional $1 billion we seek to restore today will put 1 million \npeople on treatment and prevent 2.5 million new infections.\n  In July of this year, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a real \nleader on this issue, asked us to enact a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to tell the world, listening carefully to what we have to \nsay on this issue, what we believe. Senator Bingaman offered a very \ncourageous resolution, as follows:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress, when considering \n     appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2004, should fully \n     appropriate all the amounts authorized for appropriation in \n     the Act, even to the extent that appropriating such amounts \n     will require Congress to appropriate amounts over and above \n     the funding levels in the Concurrent Resolution on the \n     Budget. . . .\n\n  Senator Bingaman said we should put $3 billion into this fight on \nAIDS as we promised, and he said we should do it even if it violates \nthe budget resolution.\n  What happened to Senator Bingaman's resolution? It passed with 78 \nMembers voting in favor of the resolution.\n  The Members who stood up and said they are prepared to vote for $3 \nbillion to fight the global AIDS epidemic include the chairman of the \nsubcommittee on appropriations which brings this bill to the floor, \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania; the Republican majority leader, \nSenator Frist, his assistant leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky; as \nwell as the Presiding Officer from Georgia. All of these Senators and \nmany more voted in favor of this resolution, saying they were prepared \nto stand up and vote for $3 billion to fight for AIDS. In just a few \nminutes, they are going to have that chance. They will be able to \ndemonstrate to the world that what they voted for in the Bingaman \namendment was more than just posing for holy pictures, that they were \nin fact prepared to cast the vote even if it broke the budget \nresolution because the AIDS epidemic was that powerful and that \noverwhelming.\n  With those 78 votes, this Durbin amendment should pass easily. Maybe \nI do not even need to complete my speech, but on the off chance that \nsome of my colleagues might be thinking of changing their minds--having \nvoted for the Bingaman resolution and now given a chance to actually \nvote for the money, decide they want to vote the other way--let me tell \nthem why they should not. Remember what the President himself said:\n\n       We care more about results than words. We're interested in \n     lives saved.\n\n  Now is our opportunity to go beyond words and fulfill the pledge the \nPresident made in his State of the Union Address and the pledge we made \nin the Senate this last July. Keeping our promise and fighting against \nAIDS is in America's interest. AIDS is not just a humanitarian crisis, \nit is a security crisis. Living up to President Bush's promise on AIDS \nis important for showing the world we will keep our commitments.\n  As the CIA Director recently said when asked is AIDS a security \nissue, Director Tenet said: You bet it is. With more than 40 million \npeople infected right now, a figure that by 2010 may reach 100 million, \nAIDS is building dangerous momentum in regions beyond Africa. As this \ndisease spreads, it unravels social structures, decimates populations, \nand destabilizes nations around the world.\n  The National Intelligence Council found that in five of the world's \nmost populous nations, the number of HIV-infected people will grow to \nan estimated 50 million to 75 million by the year 2010.\n\n  AIDS is particularly devastating to national armies around the world \nthat ensure the stability of their nations. In South Africa, according \nto the Rand Institute, some military units have infection rates as high \nas 90 percent. Keeping our promise on AIDS to the world is not only the \ncompassionate thing to do, it is the smart thing to do in terms of \nnational security as well.\n  Today, we have a chance to change the course of the AIDS pandemic by \nproviding $3 billion, as promised, in the next fiscal year. The \namendment I am putting forward would close the gap between the rhetoric \nof our promise in the State of the Union Address and our 78 votes on \nthe Senate floor and the real needs of AIDS sufferers by fully funding \nthe $3 billion. The amendment provides $939.7 million to close the gap \nand fully fund this $3 billion pledge.\n  The stakes could not be higher. Let me quote Majority Leader Frist \nwho said recently:\n\n       History will judge whether a world led by America stood by \n     and let transpire one of\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\n     the greatest destructions of human life in recorded history \n     or performed one of its most heroic rescues.\n\n  Senator Frist is right. In just a few moments, with the Durbin \namendment, on a bipartisan basis, we can say to the world we will not \nstand idly by and make budgetary excuses about an epidemic that \nthreatens our world; we will come to the rescue as we promised.\n  Instead of fulfilling this pledge, unfortunately, the White House is \nclaiming that the full amount cannot be spent in the next year. All the \nleading development organizations and medical authorities have rejected \nthis White House claim. This week in Roll Call, a newspaper on Capitol \nHill, all--and I underline ``all''--of the leading relief and \ndevelopment organizations in the United States placed an ad endorsing \nthe fact that the full $3 billion could be well spent. Don't fall for \nthe argument: That $3 billion, they won't know what to do with it.\n\n  The fact is, there are ample opportunities to stop the spread of AIDS \nright now. There are not enough funds available, and $2 billion does \nnot meet the global need. By putting in the full $3 billion we \npromised, we will save lives. By not appropriating that money, lives \nwill be lost, more people affected, and more AIDS orphans to populate \nthis troubled world.\n  The White House is also ignoring the capacity of the Global Fund to \nfight AIDS, TB, and malaria, the most effective tool we have to beat \nAIDS. The Global Fund that is chaired by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, a member of President Bush's Cabinet, Secretary Tommy \nThompson, is scaling up successful programs on the ground in Africa and \nis working to stop the wave of the pandemic in India. It needs hundreds \nof millions of dollars this fall to fund the grant applications which \nthey know will work to slow down the spread of AIDS.\n  The White House should not forget the extraordinary needs of AIDS \norphans. According to a soon-to-be-released report by the Earth \nInstitute at Columbia University, orphans and vulnerable children need \n$15 billion each year for basic health, education, and community \nservices. The Global HIV Prevention Group found that AIDS prevention \nspending falls $3.8 billion short of what is needed by 2005. Although \nwe can spare the lives of babies with AIDS for the price of a Sunday \nnewspaper in the United States, only 5 percent of the women at risk \nhave access to medication to prevent mother-to-child transmission.\n  I say to my 78 colleagues who voted for the Bingaman amendment just a \nfew weeks ago, understanding that to meet the $3 billion funding \nrequest might cause us to go beyond the allowed amounts in the budget \nresolution, you, including my friend from Pennsylvania, who is the \nchairman of this subcommittee, voted in the affirmative and said you \nunderstood the seriousness of this challenge. You were prepared to take \nan extraordinary step on the floor of the Senate for an extraordinary \nchallenge which faces the world.\n  Have they forgotten? Will the rollcall reflect political amnesia on \nthe part of my colleagues or will they stand strong and stand tall for \nthe position that they took not that long ago when we voted on this \nBingaman amendment just a few weeks back?\n  I hope they will join me and commit to fully funding the $3 billion \nto fight AIDS. We have a unique chance to change the future and save \nlives. It is in our hands.\n  Today, a 15-year-old boy in Botswana faces an 80-percent chance of \ndying of AIDS. I have been to Botswana. This wonderful country \nunfortunately has a clouded future because of the specter of AIDS which \nhangs over it today. If we act now, we can change the future for these \nchildren before it is too late. I beg my colleagues in the Senate, \nplease look beyond the sterility of this budget resolution. Look in \nyour heart and realize, as Senator Frist has said, we cannot stand idly \nby. We cannot make procedural arguments. We cannot find any comfort or \nrefuge in some procedural element that suggests maybe we can't afford \nit. We know better.\n  We voted with Senator Bingaman. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nvoting for this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Murray be added as a cosponsor to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know if it is appropriate now to ask that the \namendment be read by the clerk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. Murray, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1591.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for the prevention, treatment, and control \n                  of, and research on global HIV/AIDS)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. For necessary expenses to carry out the \n     provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the \n     United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \n     Malaria Act of 2003 for the prevention, treatment, and \n     control of, and research on HIV/AIDS, in addition to funds \n     appropriated in this Act and under the heading ``Global AIDS \n     Initiative'' in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n     Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004, $939,700,000, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That funds \n     appropriated under this section that are made available for \n     the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \n     shall be made available in accordance with sections 202(d)(1) \n     and 202(d)(4) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/\n     AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-\n     25): Provided further, That if the President certifies to the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives that the \n     funds provided under this section can not be effectively used \n     to implement HIV/AIDS prevention or treatment programs or \n     programs that improve health care infrastructure to more \n     effectively deal with the HIV/AIDS pandemic, then the funds \n     provided by this section shall be returned to the Treasury: \n     Provided further, That the amount $6,895,199,000 in section \n     305(a)(1) of this Act shall be deemed to be $7,834,899,000: \n     Provided further, That the amount $6,783,301,000 in section \n     305(a)(2) of this Act shall be deemed to be $5,843,601,000: \n     Provided further, That of the funds appropriated in this Act \n     for the National Institutes of Health, $330,000,000 shall not \n     be available for obligation until September 30, 2004.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Durbin \namendment regarding the global AIDS fight. I commend Senator Durbin for \nhis brave leadership on this issue.\n  Less than 4 months ago, the President signed into law a bill \nauthorizing his administration to spend $3 billion for the next 5 years \non a comprehensive program to combat AIDS. Congress passed this \nlegislation in response to the President's call for action in his State \nof the Union address. Legislators on both sides of the aisle commended \nthe President for his leadership and vision in recognizing the need to \nlaunch a major offensive against the spread of a disease that has \nalready killed 25 million people worldwide, and infected 42 million \nmore.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush's call to action proved to be nothing \nmore than empty rhetoric. Despite Congress's commitment to combating \nAIDS, President Bush's own budget request has fallen fall short of his \npromises, seeking under $2 billion, more than $1 billion less than what \nhe is authorized to spend.\n  President Bush argues that the full $3 billion amount cannot be \ninvested effectively in the fight against HIV/AIDS, citing the lack of \nadministrative infrastructure in Africa and other regions plagued by \nthe disease. He says that he does not believe Africa and Asia can \nabsorb so much in the way of resources for the fight against AIDS.\n  I wholeheartedly disagree. I traveled to Africa last summer and \nvisited with health care workers and their patients at Africa clinics \nin South Africa, Botswana, Nigeria, and Kenya. I saw the overwhelming \npositive impact of voluntary counseling and testing programs on women \nin Soweto and Nairobi and Kasane. Those who test positive are taught to \nprevent the virus's spread, and those who test negative are taught to \nstay virus-free. I saw how Nevirapine can save a child's life when it \nprevents mother-to-child transmission of the virus. I saw what we in \nthe United States now consider a standard course of anti-retroviral \ndrugs rescue an AIDS-ridden man from the virtual throes of death.\n  My trip to Africa showed me clearly that what Africa needs to fight \nAIDS is\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\nnot fewer resources, but more. I believe that the $3 billion Congress \nhas authorized not only can be spent, but is desperately needed.\n  First, the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria assures us it \ncan put millions of dollars of additional resources to critical use \nimmediately. Moreover, as the President argued in France earlier this \nspring, additional investments in the Fund from the United States will \npressure our friends in Europe and Asia to contribute their fair share \nto this fight.\n  Second, additional resources can dramatically expand the remarkable \ntraining programs the United States runs through the CDC, NIH, and \nUSAID, particularly in those countries not included in the President's \nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief covered, so that we can jumpstart our \nefforts to improve health infrastructure in those countries already \nstruggling with HIV/AIDS--and those, like India, we know soon will be.\n  Third, we ought to vastly expand education programs in schools and \nuniversities throughout Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, increase the \nvoluntary counseling and testing centers that have already helped \nthousands of AIDS-positive men and women, and expand the work of those \ncenters to provide treatment for those who need it. As the Washington \nPost reported recently about local women overturning that country's \ntradition of the sexual healer, women armed with information and \noptions will halt the transmissions of this deadly disease.\n  It's easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the \nproblem. Misinformation and misguided traditions exacerbate this crisis \nand absolutely must be addressed. But there are thousand of public \nhealth experts and community leaders across Africa and Asia who \nunderstand the problem and are ready to take these concrete steps to \nsave millions of lives--if they only had the resources. We cannot hide \nfrom the fact--nor should we want to--that if we make an investment \nnow, we have the opportunity to avoid a tragedy of far greater \nproportions. For example, since the President's historic announcement \nin January, new studies have found what we feared may be the case--the \nepidemic is moving with a vengeance into huge population centers like \nIndia, where U.S. HIV/AIDS assistance remains inadequate--and we remain \nunprepared.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment will restore AIDS funding to the full \nlevel authorized in this chamber earlier this year. It says, very \nsimply, that we will fulfill our promise. I commend the Senator for his \ncommitment to seeing the U.S. lead the world in this essential fight, \nand I encourage my colleagues to cast their votes for saving lives.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer my overwhelming \nsupport for Senator Durbin's amendment on AIDS funding, of which I am a \nco-sponsor. I urge my colleagues to vote on this matter based on \nprinciple rather than politics. This amendment does nothing more than \nfulfill President Bush's promises to the international community that \nhe made this year in his State of the Union Address.\n  In January, President Bush called on Congress to increase U.S. \nfunding for global anti-AIDS work to $15 billion. In the spring, he \nsigned a bill authorizing $15 billion over the next 5 years. And he \nspoke often of this comment during his recent trip to Africa, the \ncontinent hardest hit by the AIDS plague.\n  But while the President signed a bill to authorize this important and \ncritical cause, he failed to appropriate adequate funding for it. While \nsignaling his intent to help deal with the global AIDS crisis, he did \nnot back his intentions with actions.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment holds the administration's feet to the \nfire. It will fully fund the $3 billion authorized to combat HIV/AIDS \nin Fiscal Year 2004. This should be an easy vote for my colleagues, who \nseemed to support the AIDS authorization bill in May.\n  Some of my colleagues have registered concern that we cannot fully \nappropriate funding this year to the authorized level because the \nnecessary humanitarian and non-governmental organizations would not \nknow how to handle so much money so soon. With all due respect, this is \njust not accurate.\n  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which was \nestablished with support by this administration, is inundated with \napplications for international AIDS/HIV treatment, vaccination, and \npublic education projects that cannot even be read because of the \nscarcity of funds.\n  AIDS killed 2.5 million Africans in 2002. Current infection rates in \nAfrica, Asia, Central Europe and elsewhere are staggering. I urge my \ncolleagues to recognize the awesome responsibility they hold to save \nlives and to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, of which \nI am a cosponsor, and I commend my friend from Illinois who has been so \npassionate, and so relentless, in seeking additional funding to combat \nAIDS.\n  Senator Durbin has been carrying on this fight for several years. He \nhas offered amendment after amendment. He has urged the White House to \ndeclare AIDS an emergency, which we all know that it is. And time and \nagain he has been opposed, by the White House and some in the Congress. \nI hope that does not happen again today.\n  This debate is not about whether AIDS is a catastrophe of historic \nproportions. It is not about whether it is the worse public health \ncrisis in history. There is no dispute that 15,000 people are becoming \ninfected with this deadly disease each day, that over 42 million people \nare already infected, and that over 25 million people have already \ndied.\n  Nor is this debate about what needs to be done. We know what types of \nprevention programs work, and that it depends on the culture and \npractices in each country. We know that only a tiny fraction of people \ninfected are receiving treatment, and that care often amounts to \nnothing more than a hospital bed, if that.\n  We know that in many countries, where the infection rate is \nincreasing and where there are already millions of AIDS orphans, faith-\nbased and other private voluntary organizations are working around the \nclock, with nowhere near the staff or resources they need.\n  There are countless examples of grandmothers struggling to care for a \ndozen orphaned grandchildren, or children as young as 9 years old \ncaring for their younger siblings.\n  We know that no country is immune, and that the number of people \ninfected is increasing exponentially, especially in Asia.\n  We also know that people infected with HIV often succumb to \ntuberculosis, which is rampant in many countries, including drug \nresistant TB. And we know that malaria kills 1 million people each \nyear, mostly African children. Many of these deaths could be prevented. \nAn estimated 500 million people get sick from malaria each year.\n  Again, this debate is not about any of that. Rather, it is about \nwhether the United States should spend $2 billion in 2004 to combat \nAIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, or $3 billion.\n  Earlier this year, at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, the President \nspent a good deal of time talking about the global AIDS crisis. I \ncommend him for that, and for going to Africa, where he highlighted the \nsuffering caused by AIDS there.\n  President Bush has shown real leadership on AIDS, although Senator \nDurbin and I and others have been pushing for stronger action on AIDS \nfor years.\n  A short time after the President's Coast Guard Academy speech, we \npassed the United States Leadership Against AIDS, TB and Malaria Act, \nwhich authorized $15 billion over 5 years. That was consistent with \nwhat the President proposed in his State of the Union address back in \nJanuary. It was an important step. It showed that we are beginning to \ntake AIDS seriously.\n  But that was an authorization bill. It did not appropriate any money. \nFor all intents and purposes, it was like writing a check without \nenough money in the bank.\n  The President's budget for 2004 contains only $2 billion of the $3 \nbillion we authorized for AIDS.\n  The United States Leadership Against AIDS, TB and Malaria Act also \ncalled for up to $1 billion for the Global Fund to fight AIDS and TB \nand Malaria. Again, a promise. For 2004, the President only budgeted \n$200 million for the Global Fund, which is one-fifth of the amount \nauthorized. It is also a cut of $150 million from what was appropriated \nlast year.\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\n  There is another problem. While the President's 2004 budget for \nForeign Operations includes approximately $1.3 billion to combat AIDS, \nTB and malaria, it robs Peter to pay Paul to pay for increases in these \nprograms. The President's budget would cut other essential global \nhealth programs.\n  Child survival and maternal health programs would be cut by 12 \npercent. These are the programs that provide lifesaving child \nimmunizations. They help to prevent the 600,000 pregnancy-related \ndeaths each year that could be avoided. The President's budget cuts \nthese programs by 12 percent.\n  It would cut programs to combat other infectious diseases like \nmeasles, SARS, or ebola, by 32 percent. Measles kills 1 million \nchildren not 100,000 or 200,000 but 1 million children a year. Again, \nthis disease is easily preventable.\n  These are not my numbers; these are the administration's numbers. \nThese numbers are in the President's budget.\n  Anyone who knows anything about public health knows that building the \nhealth infrastructure in developing countries is essential if you are \ngoing to fight AIDS. It is the same with child nutrition. It is the \nsame with maternal health. You don't fight AIDS in a vacuum. It isn't \nan either/or proposition. People who are malnourished, who are in poor \nhealth, who have weak immune systems, who are at risk of other \ninfections, are far more vulnerable to AIDS. It is common sense.\n\n  Senator McConnell and I were able to restore the funds for these \nother global health programs. In fact we increase funding to combat \nother infectious diseases, and to support child and maternal health. \nBut because of that, we did not have additional funds to fight AIDS. \nThat is why we need this amendment.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment builds on an amendment in July by Senator \nBingaman to the State Department Authorization bill. That amendment, \nwhich passed 78-18, called for full funding--$3 billion--for the first \nyear of the President's $15 billion AIDS initiative, even if it means \nexceeding the budget ceilings.\n  His amendment would provide an additional $984 million that we \nalready authorized. That is what we said we would do when we passed the \nAIDS authorization bill, and again when we passed the Bingaman \namendment. Senator Durbin's amendment would do it.\n  If we are going to lead, and especially if we are going to ask others \nto do more, we are going to have to stop playing shell games with the \nforeign aid budget. We are going to have to start doing what we say.\n  We are spending over $4 billion each month in Iraq. This amendment \nwould provide an additional $1 billion for the year to combat the worst \nhealth crisis in world history. Americans are threatened with AIDS not \njust in this country, but every time they travel abroad.\n  I have traveled to Africa, to Haiti, to Vietnam and China, to Central \nEurope and the former Soviet Union. I have seen how AIDS is ravaging \nthose countries.\n  In all my travels, and in all my conversations with the leaders of \nthose countries and with public health experts--from the Gates \nFoundation, to USAID, to the World Health Organization, to the \ndirectors of America's public health institutions, to the private \nvoluntary and faith based organizations doing the work in those \ncountries, I have never met anyone, no one, who believes that the \nadditional funds provided by this amendment could not be well spent.\n  No one who works in the field or AIDS prevention and treatment, or TB \nor malaria, who I have spoken to, believes that we do not need these \nadditional funds. We need them now, not a year from now.\n  The White House argues that $3 billion could not be spent effectively \nin combating AIDS in the 14 countries where it plans to focus. They may \nbe right, but that is not what the United States Leadership Against \nAIDS, TB and Malaria Act says. Why limit our efforts to 14 countries, \nwhen 5 times that many countries are being ravaged by these diseases? \nWhy ignore the other two dozen countries in Africa, or Russia, or China \nor India where AIDS is spreading out of control? It makes absolutely no \nsense. It is a false argument.\n  Fighting AIDS is not about 14 countries. There are dozens of \ncountries that need help, and if there are not enough trained people or \ninfrastructure, we should help build that capacity. We should train \nmore people and provide the vehicles, the testing equipment, the drugs, \nto carry out effective prevention and treatment programs. Ask anyone \nworking in public health in those countries, and they will tell you \nwhat needs to be done.\n  I really cannot understand the White House's argument. It is not \nbased on fact. It is not based on reality. It is not based on public \nhealth.\n  Is it because they don't want to spend the money? We are paying far \nmore today to fight AIDS than if we had faced up to this disease back \nwhen it was just beginning. We wasted two decades, and 25 million \npeople died, in part because we and others failed to act. We will spend \nfar more tomorrow if we do not do what is needed today.\n  That is what this amendment does. I commend the Senator from \nIllinois. I urge the White House not to oppose this amendment. I urge \nthe majority leader to support it. He recently traveled to Africa and \nsaw the same tragic consequences of AIDS that many of us have seen \nthere. We need to work together. Let's not make the same mistake again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding I have control of the time until \n15 minutes before 6, and I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining. The \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I support the Senator and his \namendment. There are certain things in life, if we apply our efforts, \nour research, our development, our technology, we can ultimately lick. \nOne of them that, of course, we are working real hard on is cancer. One \nof them, another big killer, is heart disease. And clearly the plague \nof AIDS is one of them.\n  I support the Senator and thank him for bringing this amendment to \nthe floor.\n  At the appropriate time I would like to address another amendment \nwith the manager.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the remaining few seconds I have under \nthe unanimous consent agreement, I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to help us. We heard from the President the other night. We \nneed to rally as a nation to put up our resources where we made our \ncommitment in Iraq. We made a commitment, as well, through the \nPresident and through the Senate, to deal with the global AIDS crisis.\n  Frankly, I think it would be difficult for us to explain how we can \nfind $87 billion in Iraq and not find the $3 billion that the President \npromised to the world, and we in the Senate stood behind him by a vote \nof 78 in favor to support. This will be our chance to do it.\n  When we do it, we will be able to look back at this moment as not \nonly doing the right thing, but doing something very important for \ngenerations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I request of the manager of the \nbill I be given some opportunity to speak on another amendment, but at \nhis pleasure. I will speak whenever he would prefer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Senator from \nFlorida, we are now moving ahead to the 5 minutes on my time, in \nresponse to the Senator from Illinois. We are then going to proceed to \nfour votes. But we will be here following those votes. We are looking \nfor amendments, and we will put the Senator from Florida first on the \nlist following the votes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the vote in relation to the Byrd amendment, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Kennedy amendment, No. 1556, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the Durbin amendment, No. 1591; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order to the mentioned\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\namendments prior to the votes. I also ask unanimous consent there be 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate prior to the second and third votes \nin sequence. And, finally, I ask unanimous consent the last two votes \nin this sequence be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we think this \nis a tremendous step forward. However, we are trying to get a fourth \nvote as the two leaders have requested. Both of those amendments are \nthose by the Senator from Connecticut, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut: one dealing with Head Start and one dealing with special \neducation. The one on Head Start he has not offered yet, but he wanted \nto do that tonight. There was a time period--we were told we could not \ndo that because there was a second-degree amendment. We next come to \nthe special education amendment, No. 1572. We are told the same thing.\n  We are in good faith trying to move this bill. But we can't be \nexpected to meet the impossible. We have waited here a couple of days \ntrying to move this stuff forward. We come up with amendments and \npeople say we can't let you do that one. We are doing our best to meet \nthe suggestion of the Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader. We \nasked Senator Dodd, and he has agreed to do it in 20 minutes evenly \ndivided--Head Start.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I was just \ninformed of a different proposal than I was operating under when I had \nthe discussion with the distinguished minority whip and the ranking \nmember of the chair of the committee. If you will give me 2 minutes to \nresolve the conflict, which of these matters should be dealt with \ntonight or tomorrow, we could come right back to this. I am sure we \nwill get an agreement. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor and cannot \nsuggest the absence of a quorum. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. There is no objection at this point to the unanimous \nconsent request. We hope we can add to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe in short order we will be able \nto work out an additional portion of the unanimous consent for the vote \non the Head Start amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I hope so, yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We will sequence that prospectively fourth in line for \nanother 10-minute vote. The expectation is there will be a short time \nfor debate, expected to be 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DODD. Something like that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We can work that through in just a few moments.\n  Mr. REID. We can announce that prior to the next vote beginning.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, inquiry: Do I now have 5 minutes to \nrespond to the Durbin amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 18 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree a great deal with what the \nSenator from Illinois has said about funding on HIV/AIDS. Just a few \nmonths ago, the Senator from Illinois and I offered an amendment of \n$700 million on the foreign aid bill. Before it became generally \nrecognized that there should be major U.S. appropriations for AIDS, the \nPresident included in his State of the Union speech a program for $15 \nbillion. As much as I would like to see another $900 million-plus \nadded, we simply do not have it in the budget resolution. We are now up \nto the amount of $137.6 billion in the budget resolution and in the \nallocation.\n  I think it is important to note that we have in this bill in excess \nof $14 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         GLOBAL HIV/AIDS

Mr. President, we are making enormous strides with some \n$19 billion. Much as I would like to see another sum added, we simply \ndo not have the money in our resolution.\n  I refer to a letter from Dr. Joseph O'Neil, Director of the Office of \nNational AIDS Policy, to Senator Frist dated July 17 specifying--and I \nwill not take the time to read it now--that the $2 billion on this \nparticular program is all that can be usefully expended.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Frist: It is my understanding that an amendment \n     regarding funding for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria may \n     be offered today to the Department of Defense FY2004 \n     appropriations bill currently under consideration on the \n     Senate floor.\n       I want to reiterate the Administration's strong support for \n     the FY2004 budget request of $2 billion for all international \n     HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria activities, including $200 \n     million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and \n     Malaria. This request is a solid first step in fulfilling the \n     President's commitment of providing $15 billion over the next \n     five years to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, the \n     Caribbean and around the world.\n       I recently finished traveling to Africa with the President \n     where he saw first-hand the positive impact that current U.S. \n     funding is having in caring for the sick, providing treatment \n     for individuals living with HIV/AIDS and extending lives. He \n     also witnessed the vast infrastructure and capacity \n     challenges that need to be addressed in order to scale-up \n     many of these efforts.\n       It is by careful design that the President's FY2004 budget \n     request is for $2 billion. This request was based on the \n     sound judgment that funds in excess of this amount could not \n     be spent effectively in this first year. These funds will be \n     spent in a focused manner, increased each year, to \n     efficiently and effectively create the necessary training, \n     technology, and infrastructure base needed to ensure delivery \n     of appropriate medical treatment protocols and the long term \n     success of this initiative.\n       These funds are vital to our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS \n     abroad, but must be spent in the right way, at the right \n     time. Similarly, efforts to increase funding to the Global \n     Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria are not appropriate at \n     this time. Currently, the United States is responsible for \n     over 40% of all contributions made to the Global Fund. We \n     have reached a critical time in the Global Fund's \n     development, and other nations must join the U.S. in \n     supporting the work of the Global Fund.\n       For the reasons stated above, the Administration strongly \n     opposes any efforts to increase funding beyond the $2 billion \n     requested in the President's FY 2004 budget. I appreciate \n     your unwavering leadership on this issue and look forward to \n     the continued strong bipartisan support of the Senate in \n     ensuring the success of this lifesaving initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Dr. Joseph F. O'Neill,\n                         Director, Office of National AIDS Policy.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe last stacked vote in this sequence, Senator Dodd be recognized to \noffer an amendment relating to Head Start; there be 10 minutes equally \ndivided for debate in relation to the amendment; further, that \nfollowing the debate, the Senate then proceed to a vote in relation to \nthe Dodd amendment, with no amendment in order to the amendment prior \nto that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd amendment \nto fully fund title I. America's strength is our opportunity ladder. \nOne of the strongest rungs on the ladder is our public schools. \nEducation is what gives parents hope for their children. That is why it \nis so important to continue our commitment to improving public schools.\n  When Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we placed the \nburden on schools to improve. It is a worthy goal--but it will be a \ndifficult task. We knew this when we passed No Child Left Behind, and \nso we promised to give schools adequate resources. Yet only 1 year \nlater, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill \nfalls far short of our commitment to providing the resources needed to \nmake the reforms work. I have heard from teachers and parents from all \nover Maryland. They all tell me that they are worried about whether \ntheir school will make the grade. They are worried about how they're \ngoing to meet all the requirements in No Child Left Behind--especially \nin this time of budget cuts and budget crunches.\n  This bill shortchanges our schools and our students. I am concerned \nthat we have lost track of what America stands for--empowerment, hope, \nand opportunity. Instead of funding for our schools, this Congress \npassed a tax cut for the rich. And guess what? The tax cut left us \nshackled. It left us with no money in the Federal checkbook for \neducation.\n  That is why I am proud to cosponsor this amendment, which would \nprovide an additional $6.15 billion for title I. Title I is vital to \nthe success of No Child Left Behind. Reforms without resources is a \nhollow opportunity. Fully funding title I will help our Nation's \npoorest schools hire more teachers, buy more computers, and implement \nthe kind of reforms they need to improve student achievement.\n  There is a lot of talk about leaving no child behind. Yet today we \nare still fighting to make sure our children go to good schools with \ngood teachers and up-to-date books and facilities. The No Child Left \nBehind Act will be a hollow promise if we don't match our rhetoric with \nresources. That is why this amendment is so important. We must make \nsure no child is left out of the budget. I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor the Byrd amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I support the Byrd amendment, which \nprovides $6.15 billion in additional funding for title I grants.\n  Two years ago, we promised school districts that they would have the \nresources they needed to meet new standards mandated by the Federal No \nChild Lift Behind Act.\n  As it stands, this bill fails to adequately, fund title I--the \ncornerstone of No Child Left Behind, NCLB. In fact, it provides $6.15 \nbillion below the amount promised to school districts for fiscal year \n04.\n  This funding level in this bill is even $334 million below the \nincrease that was slated for title I in the budget resolution for \nfiscal year 04.\n  Children are failing in many of our schools in all of our states. \nThese children need extended learning time. They need instruction from \nhigh-quality teachers and they need to learn in smaller classrooms.\n  The Byrd amendment gives schools the resources they need so that they \ncan create the best possible condition in which all teachers can teach \nand all children can learn.\n  Today, 23.3 percent of all children in New York are living in \npoverty, more than all but six other States.\n  The proposed appropriation in this bill fails to meet the need for \nmore resources for these children. As a result, 458,745 eligible New \nYork children would not be fully served and will consequently be left \nbehind.\n  Funding title I at its NCLB-authorized level of $18.5 billion would \nprovide New York with $682,595,000 more than the current proposal.\n  Title I grants help school districts in all State pay for tutoring \ninstruction, specialized services, class size reduction and other \ncritical support services to help the neediest of all children achieve \nhigh standards.\n  With this funding, New York school districts can hire up to 13,379 \nteachers to reduce class size and provide specialized instruction in \nmath and reading aimed at helping these needy children meet state \nstandards.\n  The impact of the proposed funding level is especially felt in key \ncities across New York State. Without the resources provided by this \namendment, 243,803 eligible children in New York City, 2,902 children \nin Albany, 15,222 in Buffalo, 7,362 in Syracuse and 5,887 children in \nYonkers will not be fully served. These children will be left behind.\n  Securing these additional funds could enable districts to hire an \nadditional 72\n\n[[Page S11224]]\n\nteachers in Albany, 385 in Buffalo, 7,862 in New York City, 312 in \nRochester, 164 in Syracuse, and 159 teachers in Yonkers.\n  If we expect every single child to succeed there should be no \nexception to our commitment to turning around struggling schools. This \namendment will reaffirm our commitment by giving schools the resources \nthey need so that teachers can teach to the highest standards and all \nof our children can learn.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \namendment of my colleague from West Virginia to increase funding for \nthe title I program by $6.15 billion. By bringing the total up to $18.5 \nbillion, title I would be funded at the level authorized in the No \nChild Left Behind Act for fiscal year 2004.\n  The title I program is critical for disadvantaged students because it \ntargets federal resources to the poorest school districts where Federal \ndollars are needed most.\n  In my State of Arkansas, this funding is crucial because 67 percent \nof students attend title I schools. These schools depend on these \nimportant funds to upgrade technology, provide professional development \nfor teachers, and implement school-wide programs.\n  Like dozens of other States today, Arkansas is currently experiencing \na serious budget crisis at the same time the State is expected to meet \nthe new requirements we imposed in No Child Left Behind.\n  To make the situation even more challenging for my State, the \nArkansas Supreme Court ruled last November that the current funding \nlevel for education in Arkansas is inadequate and that the distribution \nof funding is inequitable. The AR Supreme Court gave the state until \nJan. 1, 2004 to comply with its order.\n  Arkansas is not alone. States all across the country are facing \nsimilar financial woes, which means title I funding is more important \nthan ever.\n  Like title I, additional funding for IDEA is also critical to \nstudents and school districts in my State. I hear more complaints from \nconstituents about the Federal Government's failure to meet its \nobligation under IDEA than any other Federal education program.\n  Even though Congress has increased funding for IDEA in recent years, \nthe funding level in this bill falls far short of the promise we made \nin 1975 to pay 40 percent of the costs of providing a quality education \nto special needs students.\n  Currently, IDEA is an unfunded mandate, which is profoundly unfair to \nschool districts, teachers, and the students they serve. I am \ndisappointed that an amendment offered last week by Senator Dayton to \nfully fund IDEA in fiscal year 2004 was not adopted.\n  For the sake of the students who depend on the services provided \nunder IDEA and the educators who are responsible for implementing the \nlaw, I am hopeful the Senate will have another opportunity to consider \nfull funding either on this legislation or another bill before Congress \nadjourns this year.\n  We also need to pass meaningful legislation that will encourage more \nstudents in Arkansas and the Nation to pursue a college education. I \nthink that promoting post-secondary education is an essential element \nof any effort to prepare our workforce to meet the demands of today's \nglobal marketplace.\n  I also believe we should continue to build on our success regarding \nFederal student financial assistance. That is why I am pleased to \nsupport an amendment to this bill by Senator Kennedy that would \nincrease student financial aid in fiscal year 2004 by $2.2 billion, \nwhich is essential to keep up with the growth in college costs.\n  One of the most worthwhile financial assistance programs is the Pell \ngrant. Since its inception in 1972, students nationwide have received \nenormous benefits from Pell grants, so I think we need to continue to \nmake a larger investment in this area. The higher education funding \namendment would increase the maximum Pell grant by $450, which would \ngive close to 2,000 more Arkansans access financial assistance for \nhigher education.\n  This higher education amendment also includes additional funding for \nthe TRIO programs, which are particularly important to Arkansas. The \nTRIO programs are designed to help low-income, first-generation college \nstudents prepare for, enter, and graduate from college. While student \nfinancial aid programs help students overcome financial barriers to \nhigher education, TRIO Programs help students overcome class, social \nand cultural barriers. Considering Arkansas has one of the lowest \npercentages of residents with a four-year college degree, the more than \n50 TRIO programs currently serving participants in my state provide a \ncritical source of encouragement and support to thousands of students \nwho might otherwise never receive their college degree.\n  As many of my colleagues know, for the last 3 years I have circulated \na sign-on letter with the Senator from Maine to increase Federal \nsupport for the TRIO programs. Our goal is to increase the population \nserved under these programs from 6 percent to 10 percent of eligible \nstudents. By passing the Kennedy higher education amendment, we would \nbe making a significant downpayment on that goal.\n  Nearly 40 percent of the children in this country attend rural \nschools. These schools face enormous challenges such as teacher \nrecruitment and retention and small student populations.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the Senate rejected an amendment \nthat I supported which would have fully funded the Rural Education \nAchievement Program, REAP. This program recognizes the unique needs of \nsmall and rural schools while ensuring accountability. It provides \nessential funding that many of these schools rely on because they lack \nthe personnel and resources to apply for competitive grants.\n  Last year, well over half of Arkansas' school districts received \napproximately $5.6 million in total funding under this program to help \nmeet critical educational needs. And this funding is needed now more \nthan ever as schools strive to meet the new accountability measures of \nthe No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I want to close my remarks by emphasizing my strong belief that \neducation can be and must be a high priority for our Nation.\n  I was proud to support a bold reform plan for our Nation's public \nschools a few years ago because I believe firmly that every child \ndeserves a chance to receive a quality education regardless of where \nthey live or go to school.\n  The approach I supported created a new contract between the Federal \nGovernment and local school districts--more funding and flexibility for \npublic schools in return for greater academic achievement for all \nstudents.\n  I said at the time that additional funding and reform go hand in \nhand--you can't have one without the other and expect to succeed.\n  As many of the accountability requirements of No Child Left Behind \ntake affect, it is critical for Congress to meet its obligation to \nprovide schools and students with the resources they need to meet \nhigher standards.\n  I hope my colleagues will rise to the occasion during consideration \nof this bill and deliver on the promise of equal opportunity for all \nstudents.\n  My greatest fear is that we won't meet our obligations to our \nchildren in this bill. In the years ahead, our children will provide \nthe workforce and leadership for our nation. Indeed, our children are \nour future. We don't have the luxury of waiting to fund these programs \nadequately at some undetermined time in the future. We should fulfill \nour responsibility today.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section \n504 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 \nthat the amendment exceeds discretionary spending limits in this \nsection and, therefore, is not in order; that is, as to the Byrd \namendment on which we are about to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on the Kennedy amendment No. \n1566.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  There are 4.8 million young Americans who take advantage of the Pell \nProgram. That is $4,050. The average cost of public university tuition \nhas increased 10 percent. This amendment effectively provides the $2.2 \nbillion that will increase the Pell grant to $4,500. That is an \nincrease of 10 percent. Without this kind of increase, more than \n100,000 students who have been admitted to colleges on the basis of \nmerit will drop out. There is no question about it; this amendment is \nabout opportunity. It is about hope. It is about the future of America. \nI hope the Senate will accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt that the Pell grants \nare very important. We have increased Pell grants in the past decade, \nalmost doubling them. And while I would like to see more money in this \neducation budget and fought to have a greater allocation, we simply do \nnot have it within the budget resolution to appropriate any more money. \nWith respect to the higher education items, there is very substantial \nfunding in TRIO, GEAR UP, Perkins, and other education programs. So as \nmuch as I would like to see this appropriation, we simply do not have \nthe funds in the budget resolution or in the allocation of the \nsubcommittee.\n  I raise a point of order under section 504 of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 that the amendment \nexceeds discretionary spending limits in this section and therefore is \nnot in order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to waive section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution for the purpose of the pending amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nof debate evenly divided prior to a vote on the Durbin amendment No. \n1591.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my colleagues will remember the \nPresident's State of the Union Address, during which $15 billion over 5 \nyears was pledged to fight global AIDS.\n  This bill only provides $2 billion. When Senator Bingaman offered his \namendment on the floor on July 10, by a vote of 78 to 18, we said we \nwant it to be $3 billion regardless of the budget resolution; 45 \nDemocrats and 33 Republicans voted for $3 billion in spending. It can \nbe spent. Every major organization has come forward and said the need \nis there, the need is now.\n  To my friends on the other side of the aisle, including the chairman \nof the subcommittee, who voted for the Bingaman resolution, if 33 \nRepublicans will step forward today as they did July 10 for the same \nproposition, we guarantee our 45 Democratic votes will be there with \nyou. Let's pass this resolution and keep our promise to fight the \nglobal war on AIDS. Stand behind President Bush's promise of $3 \nbillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Illinois on \nthe importance of fighting HIV/AIDS. A few years ago, Senator Durbin \nand I joined together on an amendment for $700 million before there was \na general recognition of the importance of U.S. funding on AIDS and \neven before the President made his speech committing some $15 million.\n\n[[Page S11226]]\n\n  We have in the budget at the present time $14 billion. We have some \n$4 billion from other agencies. The Director of the Office of National \nAIDS Policy has expressed the view that the $2 billion now for global \nAIDS is all that can be used.\n  Much as I would like to see additional funds, we simply do not have \nit in the budget resolution or in our allocation. So I must oppose the \namendment, and I raise a point of order under section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 that the \namendment exceeds discretionary spending limits specified in this \nsection and, therefore, is not in order.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To increase funds for Head Start)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Head Start Funding.--In addition to any \n     amounts otherwise appropriated under this Act to carry out \n     programs and activities under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. \n     9801 et seq.), there are appropriated an additional \n     $350,000,000 for such programs and activities.\n       (b) Offset.--Of the funds appropriated in this Act for the \n     National Institutes of Health, $700,000,000 shall not be \n     available for obligation until September 30, 2004. The amount \n     $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $7,245,199,000, and the amount $6,783,301,000 in \n     section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be deemed to be \n     $6,433,301,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand a number of my colleagues. I will not recite the entire list of all \nof those who have joined with me on this Head Start amendment.\n  This amendment would increase the appropriation by $350 million above \nthe increase recommended by the Appropriations Committee over the \ncoming fiscal year. Very briefly, what this means, in the absence of \nthis amendment being adopted, we will have to cut the number of \nchildren who are presently in Head Start programs. With the adoption of \nthis amendment of $350 million, we can increase the enrollment by \n36,000 children in Head Start programs across the country.\n  There are 19,000 centers and 50,000 classrooms. This is a program \nthat has worked remarkably well over the past almost 40 years. It \nserves children by helping them get ready to learn. It has been \nremarkably successful. We are still underserving a very needy \npopulation, as the Presiding Officer knows. If we do not get them \nstarted right, these are the children who drop out of school, who \nbecome teen parents, who end up in the juvenile justice system, and \nbecome people who abuse substances.\n  Head Start works. We are going to be reauthorizing the program in the \ncoming year, to do a variety of things to improve the program even \nfurther. In the absence of this kind of a start, when we now know the \npoor population of children has been increased by 600,000 just in the \nlast 2 fiscal years, to be reducing the number of children presently in \nthe program would be a huge mistake. These are poor children. They come \nfrom single-parent families. They are struggling to make ends meet. \nHead Start gives them an opportunity to get on the right track early on \nbefore they begin a formal education.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides to be able to find the resources \nto do this. Head Start has been remarkably successful. It deserves our \nbipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield to my distinguished friend from Florida who would like to be \nheard on this issue as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have been to Head Start \nfacilities all over my State. What a wonderful little academic \natmosphere for these 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds who are starting the \nprogram, as well as those who are younger than 3. It is this little \nacademic atmosphere where they start to learn their letters, the \nalphabet, and their numbers. They start to learn respect for their \nfellow little citizens, respect for property. In addition to that \nacademic environment, we are looking at their health, their physical \nhealth, their mental health, their dental health.\n\n  Back in July, the House of Representatives by a 1-vote margin, 217 to \n216, started to sound the death knell on this fantastically successful \nand wildly popular program by saying, instead of funding it directly to \nthe Head Start centers, they were going to put it in a nice little \nblock grant and send it to eight State legislatures and Governors.\n  You know the fiscal distress the States are in. You know the \ntemptation it is going to be for those States if we ever entertain \nanything like that.\n  To the contrary, here we have an opportunity to take a stand with the \namendment of Senator Dodd, to say responsibly we are going to increase \nthe Head Start Program that gets these little fellows, these little \nchildren, prepared to enter prekindergarten and the first grade.\n  I support the Senator's amendment.\n\n[[Page S11227]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to close by talking about the \nreauthorization of Head Start. We need these resources to keep trying \nto expand the number of children who can participate in this program. \nWe all know the importance of literacy. We know the importance of \ngetting these children ready to learn. If we end up reducing the number \nof children presently in the program, as we will if we accept just the \nlanguage of the pending appropriations bill, it is a major setback in \nearly education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the Dodd amendment to add $500 \nmillion to the Head Start Program. I have heard from communities all \nover Maryland that are being forced to make tough choices because \nfunding for Head Start is inadequate. Communities have to choose \nbetween two bad options: diluting the quality of Head Start, or \nshutting the doors on some eligible children.\n  And what does President Bush propose to solve this problem? Instead \nof putting the resources in the budget, he proposed dismantling Head \nStart by handing it over to the States. Head Start is already one of \nthe more successful Federal programs. Head Start can be even more \neffective than it already is. But you know what? It is going to take \nFederal leadership and a serious investment--not a block grant and a \nprayer. That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Dodd amendment.\n  Currently, only 60 percent of eligible preschool children are in Head \nStart, and only 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers are in Early \nHead Start. In Maryland, about 25 percent of eligible children under 5 \nare in Head Start and Early Head Start. At the same time, we are trying \nto improve Head Start by requiring stricter teacher qualifications, by \nimproving academic instruction, and by maintaining vital health and \nsocial services. Yet this bill provides only $148 million more for Head \nStart. That is not even enough to cover inflation.\n  The Bush budget puts communities in a tough position. They have to \nchoose between diluting the quality of their Head Start programs or \nserving fewer children. In my own State of Maryland, we are facing this \nkind of impossible choice. For years, Montgomery County contributed $16 \nmillion of its own money to run a very high quality Head Start Program. \nBut they still didn't have enough money to serve to all the low-income \nchildren in Head Start.\n  Recently, the county proposed using its money for a pre-K program \nthat would serve more children. But they also proposed making cutbacks \nand sacrifices. They proposed cutting back on comprehensive health and \nfamily services for the new pre-K classes. They proposed shortening \npre-K classes, which would mean teachers couldn't accomplish as much. \nAnd they proposed reducing the number of children in Head Start by \nalmost half.\n  The Bush budget forced Montgomery County into this situation by not \nproviding the resources to serve all children in Head Start. I think we \nneed to put the money in the Federal checkbook so that communities \nwon't have to make bad choices between bad options. The Dodd amendment \nis a step in the right direction.\n  You can't get more for less. You get what you pay for. We need to \nincrease Federal funds so that all eligible children can benefit from \nhigh-quality Head Start. I urge my colleagues to support the Dodd \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Connecticut \nabout the desirability of Head Start. I think it is a marvelous program \nand the increase in appropriations reflects a doubling in the past \ndecade. In my capacity as chairman of this subcommittee, whenever we \ncould find an extra dollar we put it into Head Start.\n  In fiscal year 2000, we increased Head Start by more than $600 \nmillion. In fiscal year 2001, we increased Head Start by $933 million.\n  I just wish we had the funds available now to add the $350 million \nrequested by the Senator from Connecticut. For next year, we have \nfunded an increase in Head Start for almost $150 million. Regrettably, \nwe are stretched very thin with respect to the budget we have here, on \nthe budget resolution and on the allocation to this subcommittee.\n  My colleagues are coming to me for relatively small sums, some in \ntribute to former Members of this body, and we simply do not have the \nmoney. The Senator from Wisconsin wants $1 million, not a large request \nin a $137.6 billion bill, but there is just not enough money here. \nBeing a manager of a bill has a great many challenges getting it \norganized and getting it in gear. But in the last 3 days I have cast \nmore controversial votes--I would consider really bad votes, according \nto my own instincts of what I would like to see done--than I cast in \nthe whole last year.\n  The title I Amendment offered by Senator Byrd, I voted against and I \ndeplore the inadequacy of funding on title I. With regard to Pell \ngrants, Senator Harkin and I have led the way. When we pushed it up to \n$4,000 a couple of years ago, the Director of OMB came to my office and \nthreatened a broad-scale rescission of the entire bill.\n  I would very much like to see more money for Head Start. But we just \ndo not have it in the resolution and we don't have it in the \nallocation. You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip and this bill has \nturned into a turnip. I don't think it is a lemon but I think it is a \nturnip.\n  Mr. President, for that reason I raise the point of order under \nsection 504 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for the fiscal \nyear 2004 that the amendment exceeds the discretionary spending and \ntherefore is not in order.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to waive the Budget Act and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, in our sequencing, we now turn to the \nSenator from Nebraska; how long does the Senator intend to speak?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I request 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1572\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise tonight in support of an amendment I \nhave offered, along with my colleagues, Senators Dodd and Jeffords and \nothers, to increase funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Act, \nIDEA, part B, by an additional $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2004. This \namendment would bring the total IDEA fiscal year 2004 increase to $2.2 \nbillion, which was the level approved by the Senate in the fiscal year \n2004 budget resolution earlier this year.\n  For the past 3 years, I have worked with Senators Harkin, Dodd, \nJeffords, and many of my Republican colleagues to increase funding for \nIDEA. I have argued that no education funding priority is as important \nor will do more for States in this time of budget crisis than meeting \nour Federal commitment to IDEA.\n  As we all know, in 1975 Congress guaranteed children with \ndisabilities the right to free and appropriate education. This meant \nthat, whatever the cost, States and local school districts would be \nmandated by Federal law to provide the necessary services to educate a \nchild with a disability. Congress understood that this Federal mandate \nwould be costly. As a result, they agreed to provide States with 40 \npercent of the cost of educating these children. That was almost 30 \nyears ago.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has not kept its end of the deal. While our \nschools continue to meet the necessary requirements under IDEA year \nafter year, they also bear more than their fair share of the costs for \ncomplying with this law. Today, the Federal Government's commitment to \nIDEA is only 18 percent.\n  As in years past, I offered legislation with Senator Harkin and \nothers to ensure that the Federal Government provides for special \neducation by making funding increases for this program mandatory. But \nwe will have this discussion on mandatory versus discretionary funding \nfor this program when we take up the IDEA reauthorization legislation \nlater this year.\n  We are here today because, again, as years in the past, this \nappropriations bill has failed. We failed to keep our funding \nproposition. That is why we need this amendment. The fiscal year 2004 \nbudget resolution approved by this body allowed for a $2.2 billion \nincrease for IDEA, part B funding. Unfortunately, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee underfunded this program, only providing an \nincrease of $1 billion.\n  The Dodd-Hagel-Jeffords amendment provides an additional $1.2 billion \nfor IDEA, meeting the approved budget increase of $2.2 billion already \napproved this year.\n  Additionally, the amendment would put us on a realistic path to \nreaching our obligation to provide States and local school districts \nwith 40 percent of the cost of educating children with disabilities.\n  This is the responsible thing to do. I ask my colleagues to support \nthis amendment when it comes up for a vote tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Dodd-\nHagel-Jefford amendment to increase funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act or IDEA. I am pleased to join Senators \nColeman, Murray, Dorgan, Bingaman, Kerry, Mikulski and others as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  IDEA is based on two fundamental principles: first, that all disabled \nchildren are entitled to a free and appropriate public education. And \nsecond, to the maximum extent possible, these children should be \neducated along side their nondisabled peers.\n  To help States achieve these principles, Congress authorized funding \nat 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditures. Unfortunately, \nthis funding level has never been realized, leaving States with \ninsufficient resources and jeopardizing the achievement of IDEA's \ngoals.\n  In 1996, the year I was first elected to the Senate, the Federal \nGovernment provided only $2.3 billion for IDEA funding, about 7 \npercent. Last year, IDEA funding had risen to $8.9 billion, about 18 \npercent. While clearly we have made great strides in this area, the \ncurrently IDEA funding is still less than half of the 40 percent \noriginally promised by Congress. Over the years, this shortfall has \nplaced a tremendous financial stress on States in providing these \nservices, and in particular on small rural communities such as those in \nMaine.\n  As startling as these shortfalls are, they fail to fully convey the \ncrushing financial blow which can result to a small community when a \nmedically fragile, high cost child locates there. In these situations, \nschool systems are often forced to cut back in services to all \nchildren, both disabled and nondisabled, in an attempt to meet their \nlegal obligations. Unfortunately, this can result in resentment of \nthese children by members of their own community.\n  Increased Federal support is desperately needed, and that is why I \nwant to thank Chairman Specter for the substantial increase in IDEA \nfunding he has included in the Senate base bill. He has included nearly \na billion-dollar increase over last year's level.\n  Our amendment seeks to further boost this funding by providing an \nadditional $1.2 billion for IDEA Part B State Grants. This increase \nwould result in a $2.2 billion increase over fiscal year 2003 funding \nand will keep us on the track toward full funding. Our amendment would \nalso be consistent with action taking during Senate consideration of \nthe fiscal year 2004 budget resolution, which similarly provided for a \n$2.2 billion increase for IDEA. In Maine, passage of this amendment \nwould result in a $10 million increase over fiscal year 2003 funding \nlevels.\n  With this amendment, we would raise the Federal Government's \ncommitment to roughly 21 percent of the costs of special education. I \nurge my colleagues to join us in support of this amendment. Let's \ncontinue our efforts to make good on our promise and fully fund IDEA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1598 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to increase \nthe funding levels in the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Ms. \n     Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Cantwell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1598 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funding for programs under the Ryan \n                            White Care Act)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act to carry out programs and activities under \n     title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-\n     11 et seq.), there are appropriated an additional--\n       (1) $74,010,000 to carry out part A of such title XXVI (42 \n     U.S.C. 300ff-11 et seq.);\n       (2) $50,000,000 to carry out part B of such title XXVI (42 \n     U.S.C. 300ff-21 et seq.);\n       (3) $214,800,000 to carry out State AIDS Drug Assistance \n     Programs under section 2616 of such title XXVI (42 U.S.C. \n     300ff-26);\n       (4) $21,130,000 to carry out part C of such title XXVI (42 \n     U.S.C. 300ff-51 et seq.);\n       (5) $25,450,000 to carry out part D of such title XXVI (42 \n     U.S.C. 300ff-71 et seq.);\n       (6) $10,450,000 to carry out section 2692(a) of such title \n     XXVI (42 U.S.C. 300ff-111(a)); and\n       (7) $5,590,000 to carry out section 2692(b) of such title \n     XXVI (42 U.S.C. 300ff-111(b)).\n\n     Provided, That of the funds appropriated under this Act for \n     the National Institutes of Health, $750,000,000 shall not be \n     available for obligation until September 30, 2004: Provided \n     further, That the amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) \n     of this Act shall be deemed to be $7,296,629,000: Provided \n     further, That the amount $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) \n     of this Act shall be deemed to be $6,381,871,000.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief because I know we have a \nlot to do to finish this bill tomorrow.\n  This amendment increases the funding levels of all titles contained \nin the\n\n[[Page S11229]]\n\nRyan White CARE Act by a total of $401 million, with $214 million \nspecifically going toward the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, commonly \nreferred to as ADAP.\n  The CDC estimates that nearly 900,000 people are living with HIV in \nthe United States, and among those are 362,000 who are living with \nAIDS.\n  Forty percent of the new estimated HIV infections each year occur in \nthe New York City metropolitan area. So obviously this has great \nimportance to us.\n  Adolescents, women, and minority communities are particularly hard \nhit by this epidemic. Over 80 percent of the new estimated HIV \ninfections in women occur among African-American and Latino \npopulations.\n  In the last 10 years alone, the number of AIDS cases among women has \nmore than tripled, and every hour in this country two people under the \nage of 25 become infected with HIV.\n  Now the interesting thing here is, this is not just limited to New \nYork. Cleveland, OH, and Atlanta, GA, have been named as two hot spots \nfor this growing trend in the increase in AIDS and HIV, particularly \namong women.\n  In his fiscal year budget of 2004, President Bush stated his goal to \nhelp reduce the number of HIV infections in the United States by 50 \npercent by 2005. However, the President's budget provides no new \ndomestic prevention funding for CDC to meet this goal.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act provides resources to State and local health \ndepartments and community-based organizations for primary medical care, \ndrug treatments, and supportive services for low-income, uninsured \npeople living with HIV and AIDS.\n  The ADAP program provides access to vital but costly new drug \ntreatments that have enabled many people to live longer, more \nproductive lives.\n  Since 1996, the number of people served by ADAP alone has more than \ndoubled, expenditures have quadrupled, and the need for services still \noutpaces available services. If we do not provide full funding for \nADAPs, we will accumulate as many as 21,000 Americans on waiting lists \nin the next 20 months.\n  With no access to lifesaving drugs, they will experience HIV disease \nprogression, they will end up in hospital emergency rooms and intensive \ncare units, and they will incur very significant, avoidable costs to \nlocal health care systems.\n  Currently, Oregon, Kentucky, and Alabama have the longest waiting \nlists. Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, South \nDakota, Washington, and West Virginia all currently have severe access \nlimitations due to the lack of funding and will have to close \nenrollment sooner than they planned.\n  To effectively fight the spread of HIV/AIDS in the United States, \nAmerica's leading organizations committed to fighting this epidemic \nhave called for an increase of $400 million for domestic prevention \nactivities at CDC. My amendment attempts to fill in these gaps.\n  As increasing numbers of people with HIV/AIDS live longer, the cost \nof their care and treatment places greater financial demands on State \nand local governments and community-based organizations. We can provide \nfunding for these needed services through the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this much-needed amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for \naddressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic on behalf of the millions of people \naffected by HIV/AIDS in New York and around this country. The profound \nhuman tragedy of HIV/AIDS has exacted an incalculable economic and \nhuman toll on civilization--the Ryan White CARE Act programs have \nhelped to fill the gaping holes in care and survival we have \nexperienced these last few decades. This amendment will provide \nessential funding for those programs so that those struggling to \nsurvive each day can access necessary, life-saving treatments.\n  We are all familiar with the statistics--800,000 to 900,000 Americans \ncurrently live with HIV/AIDS, 77,000 in my State of New York alone. \nFurthermore there are a devastating 40,000 new infections in the U.S. \neach year.\n  This is why we need the $401.43 million that this amendment would \nprovide for the Ryan White CARE Act programs, including a $214.8 \nmillion increase for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program or ADAP. The Ryan \nWhite CARE Act provides invaluable resources to State and community \nhealth organizations for primary medical care, drug treatments, \nsupportive services for low-income, and uninsured people living with \nHIV/AIDS. Ryan White is also crucial to helping people follow \ncomplicated drug treatments, to alleviate high medical costs for people \nwith low incomes and to combat HIV/AIDS in communities with a high \ndegree of new HIV/AIDS cases.\n  It is precisely because of Ryan White CARE Act's documented success \nthat we need to help the program survive, so they can help patients \nsurvive. Improvements in care and powerful drug therapies are well \npublicized and indeed many people with HIV/AIDS are living longer, more \nproductive lives. Yet as patients live longer, the cost of their care \nand treatment places greater demands on community-based organizations \nand State and local governments. This funding is vital for health \nfacilities and State budgets, which have come under considerable \nfinancial strain due to costly new drugs.\n  For example, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, ADAP under Title II of \nthe CARE Act was created in part to address the enormous need brought \non by the advent of new combination drug therapies. However, several \nStates have been forced to cap or restrict access to drug treatments \nthrough ADAP, and continually deplete their ADAP budgets long before \nthe fiscal year ends. Turning our backs on patients who have clearly \nbenefited from better access to newer, more effective drugs would be a \nstep backwards.\n  I urge my colleagues, on behalf of patients and states, to support \nthis amendment. We need to keep one step ahead of this disease with \neducation and prevention efforts, focusing on hard hit populations such \nas women and minorities, or else we risk sliding backwards in our \nbattle. Millions continue to face the daily grind of living with this \ninsidious disease, and it is my sincere hope that funding these \nprograms will bring a measure of help and hope to New Yorkers and \nAmericans who suffer each day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program \nis a very important one. I wish we had additional funding so we could \naccept the amendment offered by the Senator from New York, who seeks to \nadd $400 million to this program.\n  There have been very substantial increases in the program. In 1999, \nthe program was set at approximately $1.4 billion and that has \nincreased to the current appropriation of $2.041 billion.\n  Overall, on HIV/AIDS, in the Labor-HHS bill, we have in excess of $14 \nbillion. The entire bill, which we have, has an allocation $137.6 \nbillion. I fought to have a larger allocation, but this is the maximum \nappropriation we can make within the budget resolution and within our \nallocation, as much as I would like to see even more resources directed \ntoward HIV/AIDS.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, because it does exceed the budget, \nI raise a point of order under the Budget Act.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I move to waive the appropriate section of the Budget \nAct, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are going to vote on this tomorrow, Mr. President, \nbut now we are set to go.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1595 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1595 with respect to \nLIHEAP.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mr.\n\n[[Page S11230]]\n\n     Leahy, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Sarbanes, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Levin, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Durbin, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1595.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for home energy assistance needs under the \n             Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec.____. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for additional home energy assistance needs of \n     one or more States arising from a natural disaster or other \n     emergency, under section 2602(e) of the Low-Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621(e)), there are \n     appropriated an additional $300,000,000 for such needs: \n     Provided, That of the funds appropriated in this Act for the \n     National Institutes of Health, $264,000,000 shall not be \n     available for obligation until September 30, 2004: Provided \n     further, That the amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) \n     of this Act shall be deemed to be $7,195,199,000: Provided \n     further, That the amount $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) \n     of this Act shall be deemed to be $6,483,301,000.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first let me start off by commending \nChairman Specter for his efforts to meet the needs that are so evident \nin this appropriations bill in a very difficult budgetary climate.\n  The amendment I offer this evening, together with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, would be to increase funding for the Low-Income \nHome Energy Program to $2.3 billion for fiscal year 2004.\n  I thank my other colleagues and cosponsors--Senators Kennedy, Leahy, \nRockefeller, Voinovich, Jeffords, Kerry, Lieberman, Schumer, Corzine, \nSarbanes, Bingaman, Lincoln, Levin, Harkin, Clinton, Durbin, and \nSnowe--for cosponsoring this amendment.\n  The amendment Senator Collins and I are offering will provide $300 \nmillion for the LIHEAP contingency fund. This money is available under \ncertain specified conditions: a significant home energy supply shortage \nor disruption, a significant increase in the cost of home energy, a \nsignificant increase in home energy disconnections, a significant \nincrease in participation in a public benefit program, or a significant \nincrease in unemployment.\n  Contingency money for LIHEAP is very important to ensure that these \nresources can be quickly dispensed and targeted to those areas of the \ncountry and those populations that are experiencing either severe \nweather or severe economic distress.\n  Today, on September 9, it is a balmy day in Washington, DC, but no \none can forecast the weather that will take place throughout the course \nof this winter on the east coast, in the Northeast, or on the west \ncoast, nor can we forecast hot weather that could occur in the \nsummertime. So this contingency fund is absolutely essential.\n  What we need to do is to ensure that this funding is there in \nsufficient quantity so there will be no disruption in meeting the needs \nof people who are facing crises, either economic distress or severe \nweather.\n  I particularly thank Senators Specter, Harkin, Stevens, and Byrd for \ntheir commitment to the basic program. This appropriations bill \ncontains $2 billion for the LIHEAP State grant program. It is the first \ntime we have had $2 billion for the basic LIHEAP program since 1986, \nand it is a testament to the commitment and effort of Senators Specter \nand Harkin and their colleagues. It is the absolute minimum we need for \nthe state grant program. Any lower amount represents a real cut in \ndollars. But we also need something else, and that is the contingency \nfunds. If we don't have those contingency funds, I don't think we can \nrespond to the needs many of us foresee taking place this winter.\n  Last year, States provided LIHEAP assistance to over 4 million \nfamilies. Yet this is only about 15 percent of the 30 million \nhouseholds who were eligible for LIHEAP assistance. So 85 percent of \neligible Americans could not be helped because of constrained funding \nin LIHEAP.\n  My colleague, Senator Bingaman, is going to offer an amendment later \nwhich would try to increase the basic State grant by $1 billion up to \n$3 billion. This is a goal Senator Collins and I have aspired to for \nmany years. We annually send a letter asking for state grant funding of \n$3 billion. I certainly support that proposal. But I readily \nunderstand, given the constrained budget, where this is a very \ndifficult judgment to be made by the committee and by the Senate. \nNevertheless, I do believe--and that is why I offer, with Senator \nCollins, this amendment--we need, for operational efficiencies and for \nthe ability to respond, the $300 million in contingency funds. I hope \non a bipartisan basis we can support this $300 million contingency \nfund.\n  My colleague is here. I know she wishes to speak on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the program for low-income home energy \nassistance is a vital program. Pennsylvania, my State, compares about \nthe same as the State of the Senator from Rhode Island in terms of \nweather. It gets very cold. I am well aware of the fact that for many \npeople, especially seniors, it is a matter of heat or eat.\n  Since I have been on the subcommittee, we have made enormous progress \nin increasing the funding for LIHEAP. I thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for noting the allocation which Senator Harkin, the ranking \nmember, and I had put in at $2 billion. When the Senator from Rhode \nIsland cites statistics on the number of people who will not be \ncovered, it is true. If his amendment is adopted, there will be some \npeople who won't be covered. If a vastly increased sum of money were \nadded, we would simply have to make the allocations.\n  We had an allocation last year of $1.7 billion with a $300 million \namount in the contingency fund. This year the Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, and I decided to put the full $2 billion in the main \naccount so you wouldn't have to get the contingency to activate those \nexpenditures. I would like very much to have more money in this \naccount. I fought hard on the budget resolution for more money for this \nsubcommittee. If we had more money, nothing would give me greater \npleasure. I don't think I have voted against any increase in funding \nfor LIHEAP in the time I have been in the Senate.\n  There are very heavy responsibilities on the manager of the bill. One \nis to get the bill moving. If we don't get this bill through by \nSeptember 30, we lose $3 billion. So it is with great reluctance that I \nhave to oppose the amendment from the Senator from Rhode Island, \nbecause I would like to see this funding granted, but it does exceed \nthe budget resolution. And therefore, with reluctance, I raise a point \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order has been made.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, pursuant to section 504(b)(2) of the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, I move to waive section 504 of \nthat concurrent resolution and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be and is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the plan is to stack this vote until \ntomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my \ncolleague and friend from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in offering an \namendment that would increase the funding for the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, commonly known as LIHEAP, by $300 million.\n  Before I begin my formal comments, I, too, want to pay tribute to the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Specter, for his \nlongstanding support of low-income heating assistance funding. Due to \nhis efforts, there is in this bill a $200 million increase in LIHEAP \nfunding over last year. Moreover, the bill would provide $300 million \nmore in much-needed regular LIHEAP funding than either the \nadministration's request or the House bill. So the legislation before \nus represents significant progress.\n  Nevertheless, I am joining in the effort of my colleague from Rhode \nIsland because I think it reflects a realistic\n\n[[Page S11231]]\n\nappraisal of the needs for more assistance in this program.\n  During the past year, the Nation has gone from energy crisis to \nenergy crisis. In just this year alone, we have seen price spikes \ninvolving home heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, and electricity. \nEarlier this year, one of the largest suppliers of oil to American \nmarkets, Venezuela, ceased production as a result of political turmoil. \nA harsh cold snap occurred at about the same time, causing home heating \noil supplies to plummet and prices to surge upward.\n  More recently, we have run into a shortage of natural gas that has \nagain sent prices shooting upward. Three weeks ago, 50 million \nAmericans suffered through the biggest blackout in American history. \nAnd finally, most recently, the price of gasoline rose with \nunprecedented speed to approximately $1.75 per gallon.\n  These energy crises impose an especially heavy burden on our low-\nincome families and on those of our elderly who are living on limited \nincomes. Low-income families spend a greater percentage of their \nincomes on energy and have fewer options available when energy prices \nsoar. High energy prices can even cause some families to choose between \nkeeping the heat on, putting food on the table, or paying for much-\nneeded prescription medicine.\n  These are choices no American family should ever have to make. \nDespite the hardship which energy emergencies impose on low-income \nAmericans and despite the frequency with which we have all been forced \nto suffer through energy emergency after energy emergency, the bill \nbefore us does not provide any contingency LIHEAP funds to respond to \nthese kinds of emergencies. Given the frequency with which we have been \nbeset by energy crisis after energy crisis, in my view it is only \nprudent that we plan ahead and that we include some contingency funding \nto ensure low-income families can get through the next energy crisis on \nthe horizon.\n  I hope we won't have to use that funding. I hope prices will be \nstable, that the winter will not be unusually harsh or long, and that \nthere will be no energy emergencies in fiscal year 2004. If there \naren't, if we are lucky or fortunate, then we will have no need to \nspend this money and we will all be much relieved. But just in case the \nfuture repeats the past, doesn't it make sense, just in case there is \nanother shortage of home heating oil or natural gas or price spikes or \nheat-related crisis next summer, we be better prepared? Should we not \nset aside some funding to help those who will need the help the most?\n  I call upon my colleagues to join Senator Reed and me in supporting \nthis amendment which will set aside an additional $300 million for \nenergy emergencies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I believe we have concluded our discussions on this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1592 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1592.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Durbin, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1592 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To increase funding for immunization services)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. In addition to any amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act to carry out immunization \n     programs under section 317 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 247b), there are appropriated an additional \n     $50,000,000 to carry out such programs: Provided, That such \n     amount shall not be available for obligation until September \n     30, 2004: Provided further, That the amount $6,895,199,000 in \n     section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall be deemed to be \n     $6,945,199,000: Provided further, That the amount \n     $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $6,733,301,000.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, once again, I have to commend Senator \nSpecter and Senator Harkin for trying their best to meet extraordinary \ndemands with very limited resources. In this case, it is with respect \nto childhood immunization. This is an issue that is too often taken for \ngranted because it has been such a success throughout many decades in \nAmerican public health. They have tried extremely hard to maintain \nthese funds. They did not accept the President's proposal for a $28 \nmillion decrease from the previous year's funding.\n  Nevertheless, the CDC, the principal Federal agency for immunization \npolicy and implementation, after enjoying several years of increases, \nwill only receive a $5 million increase over last year's funding for \nglobal vaccine activities. Regrettably, it is not sufficient to \ncontinue meeting the challenge of vaccinating all of our children and \ntruly protect children from diseases that are preventable through \nimmunization.\n  States and public health authorities throughout the country are \nfacing difficult issues of increased prices for vaccines and increased \ndemands for services. These factors argue very strongly for increased \nfunding, not level funding.\n  Right here in the District of Columbia, school began last week and \nthe school department is struggling to contend with thousands of \nchildren who are not up to date with respect to their vaccinations.\n  The amendment I offer today, in conjunction with Senators Murray, \nDurbin, and Cantwell, would increase funding for the CDC National \nImmunization Program by $50 million. This additional funding will \nensure that State and local immunization programs can maintain their \ncommitment to protecting the health and well-being of our children.\n  One of our greatest successes in the area of public health has been \nthe campaign to have all children properly immunized by the age of two. \nDuring this century, substantial progress has been made toward \neliminating and controlling many vaccine-preventable diseases. Simply \nlevel funding this effort will not allow us to stay ahead of the \nproblem but to actually lose ground in this public health campaign. \nThat is why I am proposing this amendment.\n  Immunization initiatives have a proven track record of success. They \nare terribly cost efficient. Our efforts today have resulted in high \nlevels of coverage around the country and record low numbers of \noutbreaks of diseases. In fact, by looking at this chart, you can see \nthe success we have enjoyed with immunizations for vaccine-preventable \ndiseases, including diphtheria, measles, mumps, polio, and rubella. \nThese diseases struck fear in the hearts of Americans many years ago.\n  Today, we see a record of success in which diphtheria, for example, \nhas been reduced by over 99 percent on an annual basis; measles has \nbeen reduced by 99 percent; polio, which when I was a young child was \nthe most dreaded disease one could imagine, has been eliminated in the \nUnited States. This is a testament to the success of immunizations. We \nhave to do more than what we were doing last year just to maintain \ncurrent services.\n  Now, the other factor that we have seen in terms of the success of \nimmunization is the direct and indirect savings when it comes to health \ncare costs. For example, for every dollar invested in the hepatitis B \nvaccine for infants at birth to 2 months of age, that dollar saves \n$14.50 in direct and indirect costs. The mumps, measles, and rubella \nvaccine saves about $23, or approximately $9 billion each year. This is \nan incredibly cost-effective program as well as a very necessary \nprogram. We cannot rest on our laurels. We have achieved this success, \nbut if we relent and do not continue to put in the effort, we will find \nourselves with fewer children immunized and higher incidence of disease \noutbreaks.\n\n  There is another factor, and that is at the time we are funding these \nimmunization programs, we are discovering that science is making great \nbreakthroughs and creating new vaccines, but these vaccines add to the \ncost of the program.\n  This chart illustrates the recommended immunization schedule in the \nyear 2003--hepatitis shots, diphtheria shots, polio shots, et cetera. \nAll\n\n[[Page S11232]]\n\nof these are multiple dosages over a number of months. All of them are \nexpensive or getting more expensive. So what we have here is an \nincreased demand not only in terms of children but also in terms of the \nvaccines and the immunizations they must receive.\n  The CDC is at the heart of our efforts. This chart depicts the six \nstages or elements of a good immunization program: community \nassessment; outreach and education; delivery of the recommended \nvaccines by providers; followup; tracking; maintenance of coverage \nrates and outbreak control. On all of these efforts, CDC is using their \nresources by giving grants to States, by making vaccines available \nunder their programs.\n  This is an involved, intricate, and, frankly, expensive program that \nwe must support. To do otherwise would risk what I fear would be a lack \nof progress in the days ahead with respect to the protection of our \nchildren in particular.\n  Now, the next chart illustrates one other aspect of the dilemma that \nis facing public health authorities--many more vaccines to be \ndelivered, and also the cost of vaccines are going up, particularly the \nlatest vaccine added to the inventory, the pneumococcal vaccine. The \ndiagram describes the recommended vaccines in 1985. Back then, it was \ndiphtheria, polio, and 1-2 MMR, or measles, mumps and rubella. Also, \nnotice that the cost per child was very low, relatively speaking. \nToday, in 2003, with additional vaccination requirements, that cost has \nshot up significantly. So the range is almost $450 compared to $50. \nThat is putting a greater burden on States, causing an additional need \nfor Federal resources.\n  One of the things that is happening because of the clash of demand \nand limited Federal resources is that, in some cases, we are seeing a \ntwo-tier immunization system. Now, 32 States have implemented the new \npneumococcal vaccine using Section 317 funds; 19 States have not done \nit. So in many respects, these 32 States are on the leading edge of \nproviding total protection--or as much as we can ensure today for \nchildren--and yet 19 States are lagging behind. The principal reason \nfor that is the inability to finance these new vaccines. Another very \nimportant reason we must, I believe, increase the appropriation this \nyear for our immunization program.\n  You can see by these charts that we are beginning to lose a little \nbit of ground. This was 2001. The blue figures are the highest levels \nof vaccination, ranging from 80 to 89 percent. The yellow are the \npassing, if you will, 70 to 79 percent. The red is 60 to 69 percent of \ncoverage.\n  Back in 2001, there was one State, Louisiana; and in 2002, because of \nstrained resources, we are seeing many more red States show up. They \nare Louisiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico, and other States are on \nthe decline in terms of coverage. This is another reason why we have to \ninsist--at least I feel it is important enough to insist--that we \nincrease funding for this very important program. We all, as I said \ninitially, sometimes take for granted that our vaccine programs are \nworking, that polio and rubella and measles are something of the past.\n  You can just look around the country at some of the headlines we are \nseeing in local newspapers: ``Whooping Cough Rates Soar in Three Oregon \nCounties.'' This one says ``Tetanus Continues to Pop Up in the U.S.'' \n``Officials Warn of Pertussis Outbreak.'' ``Whooping Cough Cases Could \nDouble.'' There are other examples.\n  It reminds us that we cannot take immunization for granted. I know \nthe chairman has tried valiantly to put more resources into this \nprogram. I urge my colleagues to do what they can to support this \namendment so we can increase funding for this very worthwhile and very \nefficient program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt about the tremendous \nneed for adequate vaccines to protect our children from a wide variety \nof maladies. The Senator from Rhode Island seeks to add $50 million to \nexisting accounts. I appreciate his acknowledgment of the work which \nSenator Harkin and I have already done on the appropriations for \nvaccines.\n  The current bill has almost $3 billion for vaccination programs. \nHealth Resources and Services Administration has $1.6 billion. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention has $1.65 billion. From \nthat, $1.14 billion is for vaccines for children. The Center for \nMedicine and Medical Services has $300 million related to an \nimmunization program. The vaccine development at NIH has almost $1 \nbillion--$988 million. In addition to the funds provided in this bill, \nIndian Health Services has $1.526 million.\n  I suggest when we are dealing in the $3 billion range, there has been \nvery substantial consideration, really adequate consideration for this \nimportant issue.\n  The Centers for Disease Control is an installation which has received \nspecial attention from this Senator. Three years ago, I made a trip to \nthe CDC when I heard that it was in deplorable condition and I found \nprize-winning scientists with desks in hallways and poisonous materials \nunguarded in hallways.\n  With the cooperation of the ranking member, Senator Harkin, we made \nan immediate addition of $170 million and added to that $250 million, \nand last year $250 million, and have increased the administration's \nrequest by some $300 million this year with an additional $250 million \nfor capital improvements.\n  This past Saturday, I traveled to Atlanta and took a look at the \nCenters for Disease Control. I take second place to no one in my \nconcern for the Centers for Disease Control and all their important \noperations on SARS, on HIV/AIDS, and the bioterrorist threats which now \nconfront America.\n  Simply stated, I think we have done a pretty good job in this \nvaccination area. Certainly, $50 million more might be nice under some \ncircumstances, but I think this program is adequately funded.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island exceeds the \nbudget and, therefore, Mr. President, I raise a point of order under \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act and the allocation for \nthis subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order has been raised.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I move to waive section 904(c) of the \nconcurrent resolution on the Budget for fiscal year 2004 for purposes \nof the pending amendment, and request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a chart \nshowing the extensive expenditures on this line be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2004 BILL\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Fiscal     Fiscal     Fiscal\n                                         year 2002  year 2003  year 2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHealth Resources and Services                 $1.6       $1.6       $1.6\n Administration (in millions)..........\nCenters for Disease Control and              1.617      1.683      1.655\n Prevention (in billions)..............\nVaccines for children (in billions)....  .........  .........      1.145\nCenters for Medical and Medicaid               270        285        300\n Services (in millions)................\nVaccine development, NIH (in millions).      610.2        962        988\n                                        --------------------------------\n    Total in Labor-HHS bill (in              2.498      2.731      2.944\n     billions).........................\nIndian Health Service (in millions)....      1,526      1,556      1,580\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1596 with respect to \nmuseums and libraries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n     Johnson, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1596 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for certain literacy, library, and museum \n                               programs)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n\n       Sec. 306. (a) In addition to any amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated--\n       (1) an additional $15,081,000 to carry out subpart 4 of \n     part B of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965;\n       (2) an additional $24,100,000 to carry out the Library \n     Services and Technology Act; and\n       (3) an additional $5,182,000 to carry out the Museum \n     Services Act.\n       (b) Of the funds appropriated in this Act for the National \n     Institutes of Health, $20,000,000 shall not be available for \n     obligation until September 30, 2004.\n       (c) The amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this \n     Act shall be deemed to be $6,939,562,000, and the amount \n     $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $6,738,938,000.\n\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, once again, I rise to offer my final amendment of the \nevening, and I again commend Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin for \ntheir efforts.\n  My amendment is designed to increase funding for libraries and \nmuseums. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, \nCorzine, Levin, Lautenberg, Sarbanes, Boxer, Schumer, Johnson, and \nFeinstein in offering this critical amendment.\n  The appropriations bill before us essentially levels or cuts the \nfunds in the library and museum accounts for this fiscal year.\n  The Federal Government has a long history of supporting our Nation's \nlibraries and museums. The Federal Government started providing direct \nassistance to public libraries in 1956 and funding to museums in 1976. \nSo this is a function we have taken on for many decades.\n  We all understand that museums and libraries are rich sources of \nculture and learning. They are part of the fabric of our intellectual \nand civic life in every community, small and large, throughout America. \nLibraries have been the foundation of education for years. They are \nvital sources of literacy training, of community activities, and so \nmany things that are important to the quality of life in every \ncommunity in America. Our museums bring into the lives of our people \ngreat art, scientific discoveries--indeed a host of discoveries and \namazing items that educate, inform, and, inspire the people of this \ncountry. These institutions are more important now than ever because we \nmust recall our past to deal with a very difficult present and a \nchallenging future.\n  These facilities are also in great demand. If you speak to librarians \nand museum directors, they would like to stay open longer and offer \nadditional programs and services because the demand is there, but the \nfunds are not there.\n  We are facing these issues and facing this appropriations bill just a \nfew weeks after we passed the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003. \nThis body passed it with strong, bipartisan support. It would \nreauthorize these Federal programs for the next 6 years.\n  Among the many aspects of the bill that passed was providing for a \ndoubling of the minimum allocation to each State, which is very \nimportant to smaller states like Rhode Island. Also, it established a \nreservation of 1.75 percent for museum services for Native Americans, \nto match the reservation currently provided for library services.\n  We are charting down a new reauthorization path but, unfortunately, \nwe have not been able to, in this appropriations bill, match the design \nfor that authorization. Indeed, this is one of those situations in \nwhich the President's budget is much more robust with respect to \nfunding than the Appropriations Committee's proposal to the Senate. The \nPresident sometimes gets criticized for not following through, and then \nwe have to do more. This is a case where the President's proposals have \nbeen strong with respect to museums and libraries.\n  For example, in the No Child Left Behind Act, we authorized a program \ncalled Improving Literacy through School Libraries. This program is \ndesigned to provide library resources to schools throughout this \ncountry, a central part of learning. The bill before us would fund that \nat $12.4 million. The President requested $27.5 million because I \nbelieve both the President and the First Lady recognize the importance \nof school libraries and books and materials for those libraries.\n  I was the principal author of this legislation in the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and I feel very strongly that \nwe must make a greater commitment to our nation's school libraries. Too \noften when you go to a school library, you find books that are out of \ndate--vastly out of date--or books that are insufficient in number or \nquality for students to truly learn.\n  Indeed, in an ideal world, every young American should have two \nlibraries to call upon: A good school library and a good neighborhood \npublic library. This will allow them to learn, to explore, and to \nunderstand that education is not just the hours in school, but it is \nevery opportunity they have to read and to explore on their own.\n  I hope we could raise our efforts to increase the level of funding to \n$27.5 million, the President's proposal, and not the funding level \ncontained in the bill. Indeed, the President, in his statement of \nadministration policy on this bill, said:\n\n       The administration also urges the Senate to provide the \n     full request for . . . Literacy Through School Libraries.\n\n  My amendment will also increase funding for the Library Services and \nTechnology Act by $24.1 million to bring the new total to $171.48 \nmillion. This increase in funding for the Library Services and \nTechnology Act would reach the President's funding request of $169.6 \nmillion for library State grants plus provide an additional $1.6 \nmillion needed to double the minimum State allotment which is a key \nreform in the recently passed Museum and Library Services Act of 2003.\n  If we do not follow through with this funding, we are going to \ninhibit the ability of libraries to serve their neighborhoods. We are \ngoing to inhibit the ability of libraries to take part in literacy \nprograms which is one of the centerpieces of the President's overall \neducational policy. We see it every day in our hometowns and across our \nStates, where libraries cut back hours, cut back access, cut back \ncollections and, indeed, as many States face fiscal crises, one of the \nfirst areas that is cut in State budgets is libraries and museums.\n  I believe we should be able to, hopefully, step into the breach and \nhelp a bit more.\n  My amendment would also boost funding for the Museum Services Act by \n$5.18 million to again reach the President's funding request. Our \nmuseums are key partners not only of our educational programs but also \nof our culture and our national memory. I hope we can increase funding \nin this regard.\n  This is a modest amendment, in total increasing resources by $43.36 \nmillion that will directly help our museums and libraries throughout \nthe country.\n  I reiterate that I understand the difficult challenge both Senator \nSpecter and Senator Harkin face in trying to fund all of these \nprograms. I think they would be the first to point out how valuable \nthey are. I feel very moved to point out how I believe we can do \nbetter. In this case, simply matching the President's request would do \nmuch better.\n  My amendment is fully offset for fiscal year 2004. It achieves this \nby rescinding fiscal year 2004 advance appropriations and \nreappropriating those funds in fiscal year 2003. This is the same \nmechanism Chairman Stevens and Chairman Specter used to add $2.2 \nbillion to the underlying appropriations bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support museums, libraries, and the Reed \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island with some trepidation, because of two factors: My \nsister Shirley Katy is a professional librarian, and my sister Shirley \nKaty is reportedly watching this debate on C-SPAN. Senator Harkin just \nsaid, sotto voce--I had better be careful.\n  That is one of the problems of being a manager of a bill. You have to \ntry to keep the bill within the budget resolution, within the budget \nallocation. If it conflicts with the longstanding interests of my \nsister Shirley Specter Katy, that is just one of the costs of being the \nmanager of the bill.\n  I might say parenthetically, and not too much at length because of \nthe hour, that my sister was a great inspiration to me on developing \nearly reading habits. It actually led to my downfall; I became a \nlawyer. She was always\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\nwith a book. She has been a librarian in the Elizabeth, NJ, school \nsystem for many years. She recently retired.\n  From her and from my educational experience generally, I have great \nreverence for libraries. I would like to see the libraries funded even \nmore than they are. The Institute of Museum and Library Services has an \nappropriation of $243,889,000. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the \nbudget, we were able to maintain that figure.\n  It is worth noting that the figure is $1,865,000 above the \nPresident's request. Here again, I would like to see more money in \nlibraries, but we simply do not have the money within the budget \nresolution or within the allocation for this subcommittee. Therefore, \nit is with reluctance that I raise a point of order that this amendment \nexceeds the budget resolution and therefore is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order has been raised.\n  Mr. REED. I move to waive the Budget Act under Section 504 for \npurposes of the pending amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1602 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Lautenberg, \nand Senator Clinton, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendments are set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine], for himself, \n     Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Lautenberg proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1602 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To restore cuts in student aid)\n\n       At the end of title III add the following:\n       Sec. 306. None of the funds provided under this Act shall \n     be used to implement or enforce the annual updates to the \n     allowance for State and other taxes in the tables used in the \n     Federal Needs Analysis Methodology to determine a student's \n     expected family contribution for the award year 2004-2005 \n     under part F of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1087kk et seq.) published in the Federal Register \n     on Friday, May 30, 2003 (68 Fed. Reg. 32473), to the extent \n     that such implementation or enforcement of the updates will \n     reduce the amount of Federal student financial assistance for \n     which a student is eligible: Provided, That of the funds \n     appropriated in this Act for the National Institutes of \n     Health, $200,000,000 shall not be available for obligation \n     until September 30, 2004.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, my amendment is simple. It would block \nthe Department of Education from implementing recent changes in student \naid eligibility that will reduce financial aid to college students by \nbillions of dollars starting in the fall of 2004. Let me repeat that--\nbillions of dollars.\n  These changes come at a time when tuition is rising dramatically, \ndouble digits in many of our State schools across the country; just 9 \npercent in the State of New Jersey. Students and working families are \nstraining to provide the financial wherewithal to access America's \npromise of access to higher education.\n  This challenge to working Americans has been vividly documented in a \nfeature article in U.S. News & World Report September 8, entitled \n``Beyond Their Reach.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORZINE. It goes through tuition hikes. It goes through how \nFederal funding for grants and loans has not kept pace with the rise in \ntuition. It talks about students having to work many additional hours \nto be able to meet the financial stress. It is a very complete review \nof what the burden on working families is with regard to paying for \nhigher education and having access to the American promise that \nprovides.\n  I put that into the Record because it sets the framework for what I \nam talking about with regard to these regulations on financial aid.\n  I will explain these cuts in student aid which I feel are \ninappropriate for the times, but I think I can show they are totally \nunfair within the context of what is happening in the real world. This \nis a case where people in the Department of Education are operating off \nof information that is dated and is not applicable to the current \ncircumstances.\n  I will take a few minutes to explain the situation, which is not \nimmediately obvious, but it is very clear it undermines access to \nhigher education in a very substantial way. On May 30 of this year, the \nDepartment of Education changed the formula for determining eligibility \nfor Pell grants and other types of Federal financial aid. The formula \nis complex. It looks a lot like a tax return. I guess people have to go \nto H Block to figure it out, but it is very clear what this does. A \nfamily starts with their gross income and through a series of \ncalculations subtracts from that their income to calculate what is \ncalled the expected family contribution. They start with gross income \nand subtract away a number of items to get to expected family \ncontribution.\n  As the name implies, this is the amount a family is expected to \ncontribute toward the college education of their child in any given \nyear, at least for those families above $15,000 in gross income--hard-\nworking, middle-class families. Expected family contribution then is \nsubtracted from the cost of education for that year to determine a \nstudent's need for the purpose of Federal aid, such as Pell grants. The \nexpected family contribution is also used by many State and private \ninstitutions. This is important to understand. This doesn't just apply \nto Pell grants; it applies to private institutions as well, all kids \nwho are going to school, not in every instance but in most instances. \nIt impacts their ability to get financial aid and basic allocation of \nfinancial assistance for both loans and grants across the country.\n\n  In other words, changes in a student's expected family contribution \nhas direct impact on that student's eligibility for all kinds of \nfinancial aid. As a student's expected family contribution goes up, \ntheir eligibility for financial aid goes down.\n  As I noted earlier, the way the student's expected family \ncontribution is calculated is similar to the way Federal taxes are \ncalculated. One of those similarities is the fact that you get credit \nfor State and local taxes that you pay. For income tax purposes we call \nit a deduction, and it reduces the amount of your taxable income. In \nthe financial aid world it is called an allowance, but it works in a \nsimilar way. A student's family gets an allowance for paying State and \nlocal taxes. This allowance then reduces the amount of their student's \nexpected family contribution. So, as the State and local tax goes up, \nthe student's expected family contribution goes down. The eligibility \nfor financial aid goes up. If the allowance goes down, the opposite \nhappens: A student's family gets less credit for paying State and local \ntaxes and the student is eligible for a smaller amount of financial \naid. This gets at the heart of the problem, this issue I am trying to \naddress tonight.\n  The allowance for State and local taxes is not determined for \nfamilies based on what they pay; it is not individualized; it is \ndetermined by the Department of Education, and through publication in \nthe Federal Register they establish those for each and every State.\n  Each year, the Department of Education publishes a table, and the \npercentage of income that family can deduct from their income as an \nallowance for paying State and local taxes is established. Until this \nyear, the Department of Education had not changed these allowances in \n10 years. Let me repeat: They had not changed these allowances in 10 \nyears. Somehow or another they decided to do it this year but had not \ndone it in 10 years, while State and local taxes are moving up and down \nin different amounts in all different environments. On May 30 they \ndecided to slash the allowances across the board.\n  I will just show you this chart, show what actually is taking place \nin many States. I would like to show, for instance in South Carolina, \nthey would\n\n[[Page S11235]]\n\nargue taxes fell from 7 percent to 3 percent, so they reduced the \nallowance by 57 percent.\n  If I am reading this correctly, the Presiding Officer, who lives in \nMissouri--they have gone from 5 percent to 3 percent and they reduced \nthe allowance for Missouri citizens 40 percent, the deduction to change \nthe eligibility for families to access financial aid.\n  You can go through this chart for every State. Local tax allowances \nwere cut in every State but one, Connecticut. Some of those allowances \nwere 100 percent, 50 percent, 80 percent. New Jersey is one of the \nlucky ones; it was only 14 percent.\n  I see the Senator from Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's cut was, if I am \nreading it correctly, 50 percent.\n  It is important that people understand that, again, this is \ndetermining financial eligibility of families on a very wide basis. We \ncan talk about each of the States and how much is being cut. Almost \nevery State except, as I suggested, Connecticut has reduced the \nallowances we have here.\n  The bottom line is students and their families all across America \nwill get less on allowance for State and local taxes next year for \npurposes of applying for Federal financial aid. I repeat, it also \napplies for many private institutions and private aid beyond that.\n  As a result, the expected family contribution, what families are \nexpected to contribute, will go up for nearly all American families and \nstudents. While the financial aid impact will vary from family to \nfamily, it is clear that an increase will reduce aid for many students.\n  I am having a hard time understanding, as I read the newspapers and I \nhear that State income taxes and local income taxes are going up, why \nwe have decided to implement this today.\n  This is a very hard thing to calculate for a lot of different issues, \nbut one of the places the Department of Education has worked with CRS \nis with regard to local allowances as they apply to Pell grants. They \nhave acknowledged that there will be 84,000 students across America who \nwill lose their Pell grants entirely. Not everybody is going to lose \nthem. Some are going to lose just a portion of their eligibility. I \nwill go through an example later.\n  We know that for those 84,000, that is a $270 million drop in the \namount of financial aid being provided for students in grants across \nthe country. The fact is, if you sum it up for those who are partially \nparticipating and all the others, we are talking about billions of \ndollars. I emphasize, it is not just Pell grants.\n  Listen to the assessment of Bryan Fitzgerald, the Director of the \nAdvisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance, created by \nCongress to advise it on higher education. Mr. Fitzgerald was quoted in \nthe New York Times on July 18. Asked about whether damage from the \nDepartment's action would just affect the Pell Grant Program, Mr. \nFitzgerald said:\n\n       It doesn't stop there. It will have a ripple effect through \n     all the other financial aid programs--State grants, loans and \n     institutional dollars. The cumulative effect will be much \n     larger.\n\n  Bryan Zucker, president of the Human Resources Capital, in the same \nNew York Times article stated:\n\n       [I]n aggregate, there's no question that we're talking \n     about a swing of billions of dollars [in financial aid.]\n\n  I think it is important that we have laid out these facts, that \ntinkering around with the formula is going to end up undermining the \nability of literally hundreds of thousands of middle-class Americans to \nhave access to financial aid grants and loans. It is going to make \nsomething that is already very difficult even more troubling, to have \naccess to higher education.\n  I think it is very difficult to understand why we are doing it.\n  Let's put this in the context of what is going on in our States. The \nDepartment of Education is reducing the allowance families get for \npaying State and local taxes. But I think everyone in this Chamber \nknows State and local taxes are not going down; they are going up. \nAccording to the National Association of State Budget Officers, States \nraised taxes by more than $8 billion in fiscal year 2003 and already \nplan to enact additional tax increases of over $17 billion for 2004.\n\n  It is likely through the 2003 and 2004 period that we will see State \ntaxes go up by $25 billion, compared to what the Department is using, \nwhere they are saying they are going down. That is before we take into \nconsideration what is happening at the local level, local taxation in \nmany places.\n  I want to use one example. Students and families in Pennsylvania, for \nexample, will have their State and local tax allowance cut from 6 \npercent to 3 percent. For purposes of this calculation, Pennsylvania \nfamilies will get 50 percent less credit next year than they did this \nyear. But in fact the senior Senator knows, State taxes are going up in \nPennsylvania. In fiscal year 2003 they were raised by $569 million, and \nin 2004 Pennsylvania is planning more increases. I don't think that is \nfair to Pennsylvania any more than I think it would be fair in New \nJersey. In fact, we have many of the same situations.\n  I think you can go State by State and look at it, look at this \npossibility. I will not go through each State but I think you can \ncalculate it for every State but Connecticut and you will see there is \na loss. State taxes are going up. Local taxes are going up. The only \npeople who do not realize it seem to be the Department of Education.\n  I want working families to have an opportunity at this American \ndream. I think this needs to be done.\n  I also would cite this article about which I spoke. There is a \nspecific case of a lady named Lynn Caputo of Massachusetts, one of \nhundreds of thousands of students going through this process about \nwhich I spoke.\n  I am not going to read this article. We have a quote here that shows \nhow deeply flawed this is when you apply it to an individual. Ms. \nCaputo lost a father. By these calculations, she will lose over $1,000 \nin financial aid next year. Just at the time when her personal \nsituation is changing, taxes are going up in Massachusetts. By these \nstandards of how we deal with expected family contributions, she is \ndoing better than she would have been doing before. It is very hard to \nunderstand how that fairness fits with the reality of the world in \nwhich we live.\n  Eighty-four thousand students are losing Pell grant loans, and 270 \nmillion of them broadens it out to billions of dollars when you take \ninto account all of the other higher education needs.\n  I think we need to do something about this. We can do that without \nimpinging on our budget formulation. That is what my amendment would \ndo. It says the Department of Education cannot use any funds to \nimplement new State and local tax allowances to the extent that they \nwould reduce aid for any student.\n  By the way, there are some technical things about one class of \nstudents here or there. But the vast majority are losing.\n  I should note that the amendment is fully offset by provisions to \ndelay the obligation of $200 million in NIH funds until September 30, \n2004. As a practical matter, this should have no real impact on their \noperations or change their needs. We are talking about a serious impact \non a broad swath of middle-class Americans having access to financial \naid.\n  This isn't partisan. There are Republican States and Democrat States. \nThis is just bureaucracy not keeping up with the times.\n  Let me repeat that they haven't changed these formulas in 10 years. \nThey somehow or other woke up on May 30 and thought we needed to change \nthese formulas. They have not done it for 10 years. Now they are \nreducing that allowance for taxes at just the time taxes are going up. \nI don't get it. We are trying to do this in a fiscally sound way by \ngetting an offset. I think we can make a big difference in a very \nsubstantial way for a lot of folks. It will not cut Pell grants in any \nway. I think it will make a big difference in providing access to \nhigher education for kids who are really stretched.\n  I hope the Senate will consider this tomorrow. It really is something \nthat I think goes to the heart of everyone in this Chamber. We are not \ntalking about costing money. We are talking about costing working \nfamilies in America money.\n\n[[Page S11236]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the U.S. News and World Report, Sept. 8, 2003]\n\n                           Beyond Their Reach\n\n                       (By Rachel Hartigan Shea)\n\n       In July, administrators of tiny Unity College in Maine \n     tagged 100 fish with vouchers totaling $165,000 in \n     scholarships and other goodies and dumped the finned \n     financial aid into a nearby lake. Nearly 100 students and \n     parents pushed off from shore in canoes, kayaks, and \n     rowboats, all hoping to snag the big one: a fish carrying the \n     $56,800 that would cover four years tuition at the private \n     collage, known for its outdoorsy majors such as aquaculture \n     and forestry.\n       It was a good day to be a smallmouth bass. After seven \n     hours, all but one of the students participating in Unity's \n     first annual ``Fishing for Scholarships'' paddled back empty-\n     handed. Mike Bradford, a sophomore from Bear, Del., reeled in \n     a $50 tuition coupon and a free sea-kayaking trip donated by \n     a local merchant. Nice, but it hardly covered those hefty \n     college bills.\n       A lot of families these days feel as if they're facing \n     college costs without enough funds on the line. Salaries are \n     flat, jobs are scarce, investments haven't fully recovered \n     and savings are tapped out. Financial aid can't seem to keep \n     pace with financial need, and now the Department of Education \n     has tinkered with the financial aid formula to some families' \n     detriment [story, Page 54]. Tuition, particularly at state \n     schools, continues to rise. Families aren't alone in their \n     anxiety: Colleges, too, wonder how they will pay the bills, \n     with endowments down 6 percent last year, the biggest drop \n     since 1974, and 25 states cutting higher education \n     appropriations by as much as 14 percent. Many schools have \n     had to cut classes and sports teams, freeze salaries, and lay \n     off employees to deal with the budget shortfalls.\n       Yes, it looks like a crisis. But before you despair, listen \n     to this: It's still possible to get help paying for college. \n     There's more financial aid money available today than ever \n     before, and more students are getting a piece of it. But the \n     piece is smaller, and it might be in the form of an IOU. It \n     all adds up to a substantial shift in who ends up footing a \n     big chunk of the bill for college: you. ``Students and their \n     families are paying more of the share than they did a decade \n     ago,'' says Donald Heller, senior research associate at the \n     Center for the Study of Higher Education at Penn State.\n       Financial aid was originally designed, of course, to make \n     college affordable for everyone. In 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson \n     signed the Higher Education Act which gave colleges \n     government grants to distribute to needy students and \n     established a loan program for the middle class. Seven years \n     later came the debut of the Pell grant, the primary funding \n     mechanism for low-income students. In its early years, the \n     Pell--with a maximum award of $452 based on family income--\n     covered as much as 84 percent of college costs. But while \n     federal spending on Pell grants has gone up 8 percent since \n     1991, tuition and fees have increased by 38 percent. The \n     Pell's current maximum of $4,050 covers roughly 39 percent of \n     the average cost of tuition and room and board. And with the \n     White House and Congress eager to limit spending, it's \n     unlikely that the Pell will be raised this year.\n       Gap math. Because of the high cost of grants, the federal \n     government in the late 1970s began turning to loans to fill \n     the gap between federal grants and family need. Two thirds of \n     federal aid now comes in the form of loans. Subsidized \n     Stafford loans allow students with demonstrated need to \n     borrow up to $2,625 their first year ($6,625 for independent \n     students) and more in subsequent years, up to a maximum of \n     $22,265. The government pays the interest--currently 3.42 \n     percent--until the student has been out of school for six \n     months. Students not deemed needy can take out unsubsidized \n     Stafford loans; parents can turn to Parent Loans for \n     Undergraduate Students. Both also boast low rates.\n       It sounds like a pretty good deal. But more loans means \n     more students (who are today outborrowing their parents) are \n     paying the bulk of their college costs. ``The student aid \n     system was based on the parental responsibility to pay for \n     college,'' says Brian Fitzgerald, staff director of the \n     Department of Education's Advisory Committee on Student \n     Financial Assistance. ``Loans mean it's the actual student \n     who is bearing the burden.'' Nationwide, student debt is up \n     66 percent since 1997.\n       Take Erin Brindell, a 21-year-old from St. Louis. In April, \n     her father, an accountant, took early retirement rather than \n     risk losing his job. Her mother, a teacher who's been \n     fighting cancer, also retired. With Brindell's family income \n     down almost 60 percent from last year, and two other siblings \n     in college (another four have already graduated), the senior \n     asked her school, a private university in Missouri, for more \n     aid. The college said it was out of money and pointed her to \n     a state loan agency. She borrowed $9,700, bringing the grand \n     total of her debt upon graduation next spring to $60,000. \n     Brindell, who is majoring in secondary education, will end up \n     paying for what her family could not, which promises to be a \n     struggle on a teacher's salary.\n       Deep debt. This fall, Congress will consider raising the \n     Stafford loan cap during the reauthorization of the Higher \n     Education Act. The combination of low interest rates and a \n     higher limit, some education experts argue, will help more \n     students pay for college without resorting to private loans, \n     which generally have higher interest rates and require \n     quicker repayment. But critics respond that the debt load is \n     already too high and looms darkly over students' futures, \n     forcing them to consider majors--and careers--based on \n     potential earnings rather than academic inclination. Some \n     experts suspect a higher loan limit would not translate into \n     more aid: Institutions will just reduce grant aid by the \n     extra amount students can borrow.\n       At the same time that federal policy is influencing the \n     growth of loans at the expense of grants, states are driving \n     up public university prices and accelerating the cost shift \n     to students. State support for universities has been steadily \n     declining over the past two decades. Legislators see that \n     colleges have sources of funds like tuition and private \n     donations that other pressing budgetary needs like primary \n     education and healthcare do not. And the recent fiscal \n     crises have just exacerbated the decline. This year was \n     the third in a row of drastic cuts to university funding \n     nationwide. The Maryland university system lost 14 percent \n     of its budget, while California lost $700 million of the \n     $9 billion it usually spends on higher education. Experts \n     predict an additional 2.3 percent decline next year. And \n     remember this all comes at a time when many states expect \n     higher enrollments. Nevada, for example, is bracing for a \n     33 percent boom in high school graduates by 2007.\n       So what can the state systems do? Mostly, raise tuition. \n     The tab at the University of Virginia and the University of \n     California shot up 30 percent this year; the University of \n     Arizona's, nearly 40 percent. And many of the increases are \n     on top of previous tuition spikes; 16 states raised tuition \n     by more than 10 percent last year. Of course, state \n     universities are still a bargain for in-state students, \n     almost 70 percent of whom pay less than $8,000 per year. But \n     low-income students can't afford even small jumps in their \n     share of college costs. For the poorest families, the cost of \n     attendance at a public university is more than half their \n     income. And according to a study last year by the Department \n     of Education's Advisory Committee, there is a $3,800 gap \n     between what families in the lower income brackets need to \n     attend public universities and the financial aid they \n     receive.\n       Some states, like Arizona, have tried to shield the \n     neediest students. ``We ran the numbers to see how we can \n     increase tuition and set aside enough to hold the most needy \n     harmless,'' says Jack Jewett, former president of the state's \n     board of regents, who notes that 14 percent of all tuition \n     revenue will be funneled into financial aid.\n       But many states are coming up short. Indiana managed to \n     boost spending but not enough to cover higher tuition, so it \n     will now have to limit the amount of the awards. And \n     Minnesota couldn't give out any grants to new college \n     students last spring, despite an extra $8 million in the \n     budget, because current students had already consumed the \n     available money. ``I think that policymakers are siding with \n     aid programs more than institutions in terms of cuts,'' says \n     Kristin Conklin, a senior policy analyst with the National \n     Governors Association, ``but that relative protection is not \n     translating into more buying power for students.''\n       Individual universities are exhausting their financial aid \n     dollars as well. Take Penn State: While it raised tuition 9.8 \n     percent to about $9,500 for incoming freshmen, it has lost \n     $45 million in state funding over the past two years. \n     ``Something would have to be traded off, like competitive \n     wages for faculty or forgoing already delayed maintenance on \n     buildings,'' says Anna Griswold, an assistant vice provost.\n       But there may be another significant reason why there's not \n     enough money to go around. Some critics say that too much is \n     being spent on merit aid. Over the past decade, state grants \n     have gone up 447 percent, but much of that is not need-based. \n     Since 1993, the Georgia HOPE Scholarship, the granddaddy of \n     all the state scholarship programs, has doled out more than \n     $1.9 billion to more than 693,000 students with B averages or \n     better in high school. But programs like Georgia's tend to \n     favor middle- and upper-class students whose families \n     probably could afford college without a scholarship. And with \n     several states funding the merit programs through lotteries, \n     a 2002 study by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard \n     University argues that lottery players, who are \n     ``disproportionately low income, poorly educated, and \n     black,'' are paying for the college education of these \n     better-off kids. The study found that 12 states with merit \n     programs gave out nearly three times as much money for those \n     scholarships as they did for need-based aid.\n       Not surprisingly, colleges limit their financial aid bills \n     by being choosy in the admissions game. ``If a student is \n     marginal and has money, his chances of being admitted are \n     better than a student who is marginal and has no money,'' \n     says Robert Massa, vice president for enrollment, student \n     life, and college relations at Dickinson College. That said, \n     the private Pennsylvania school, which finances most of its \n     aid through tuition, enrolled more students this year because \n     the class as a whole was needier. ``Those additional 30 \n     students are helping us afford financial aid to assist the \n     entire student population,'' says Massa. Just a few dozen \n     schools--all of them private--still pledge that a student's \n     financial need won't influence the admissions process and \n     that they'll\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\n     meet the full need of the students they accept. Trouble is, \n     poorer students are gravitating to the few need-blind \n     colleges that are left. ``Places like Macalester are \n     reaching a point where we have to consider not being need \n     blind,'' says Michael McPherson, the Minnesota college's \n     former president.\n       Looking up. Yet there are bright spots on the horizon. \n     Institutional aid from private universities rose almost 197 \n     percent in the past decade. Schools with generous endowments \n     can purposely keep loans to a minimum. ``A one-year downturn \n     doesn't necessarily severely impact our ability to maintain \n     our [financial aid] policies,'' says Joseph Russo, director \n     of financial aid at Notre Dame. And a group of wealthy \n     schools (called the ``568 Group'' for a section of federal \n     law that allows them to collaborate) are giving out more \n     grant aid this year, having decided to cap home equity at 2.4 \n     times a family's income in its eligibility test. (The federal \n     government does not count home equity when assessing need.) \n     So, those families whose home prices shot up while their \n     salaries stagnated will find themselves with better aid \n     offers.\n       Even Erin Brindell, with her $60,000 debt, isn't gloomy. \n     ``I can't worry too much,'' she says. ``I've had a great \n     college experience.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Jersey yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Sure.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Has the Senator from New Jersey considered offering \nlegislation which would be taken up by the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions? I believe he is a member of that \ncommittee.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I wish I were. I wish the Senator from Pennsylvania \ncould make the argument that I could be on that committee. I would be \nhappy to be on that committee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I withdraw that portion of my question.\n  I ask the Senator: Isn't it true the Senator can offer an amendment \nwhich would be considered by that committee?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I very much will consider looking at all of the various \nways. I think we have legislation pending to be reviewed in that \ncommittee. It just so happens this is one of those places where we deal \nwith higher education. It seems quite appropriate since we have a \nbudget-neutral approach both to raise this issue and to make sure we \naddress it now so people can make their financial plans.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Aside from considering a substantive law change, has the \nSenator from New Jersey proposed one?\n  Mr. CORZINE. We have a bill that has been submitted. I will check out \nthe number for the senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I raise that question because this is an \nissue of some complexity. Nobody has been a greater proponent of higher \neducation than this Senator. It may be that the whole approach on \nmaking deductions or changes based on taxes is an inappropriate way to \ndeal with the funding of higher education. What we have here is an \neffort to stop funding on a change in a formula which involves a \nsubstantive change in law. We have very few amendments offered. We have \nto reach some substantive objective by limitation of funding.\n  If it is something which is fairly direct, I would think it \nappropriate. But where you have something which is as complicated as \nthis matter is--there have been no hearings on it, there has been no \nopportunity for the Secretary of Education to come in to offer an \nopinion, there has been no opportunity for the Secretary of the \nTreasury to come in and offer an opinion.\n  We have an article from U.S. News & World Report which I can't even \nget a copy of. I sent over for a copy a few minutes ago so I could have \nan opportunity to read it and so I would be in a position to know a \nlittle something about what the Senator from New Jersey offers an \namendment to effect, as he calls it, a ``swing'' of billions of \ndollars. I would not like to swing on billions of dollars on a U.S. \nNews & World Report article I can't even get a copy to read.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has an amendment. It would have been \nhelpful to have had it in advance of the moment when he offered it. If \nhe is relying on an article, it would have been helpful to have the \ninformation.\n  I am very much concerned about what is proposed to be an offset here. \nThe last part of his amendment, which I have just seen, provides that \nthe funds appropriated under this act to the National Institutes of \nHealth--$200 million--shall not be available for obligation until \nSeptember 30, 2004.\n  Anybody who tampers with the funding of the National Institutes of \nHealth for any amount of money is going to draw strenuous objection \nfrom this Senator. The ranking member, Senator Harkin, and I have \nworked for many years to double NIH funding from $12 billion to $27 \nbillion. On a murky amendment such as we have today and not knowing \nwhere it goes, I would strenuously object to it on the grounds that it \nought to be considered in an authorizing committee, and that before we \ntamper with the National Institutes of Health on this funding, even \nthough it may not amount to a great deal of money, because I don't know \nhow much they will obligate, the $200 million has the potential to be \nvery substantial. But I would strenuously urge my colleagues to reject \nthe amendment.\n\n  I hope to have an opportunity to read U.S. News & World Report before \nthe night is over.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am sorry. I don't know who has the \nfloor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the President. I will respond to the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  It is not the U.S. News & World Report calculations. The \nCongressional Research Service calculated what the impact is. It is a \nFederal study. The stimulus doesn't come from U.S. News & World Report. \nIt is reporting to the public what some of the changes are. I think it \nis important that we do what is necessary to make sure higher education \nis openly available to every student and to every family.\n  That is what the amendment is about. It is very simple. It is not \nchanging the law. It is dealing with an issue of regulation. The \nDepartment of Education has chosen to deal with one in 10 years. It is \ngoing to change the flow of funds that is made available--Pell grants, \nloans, and other financial aid--to students across the country.\n  I would be more than happy to provide my own copy of U.S. News & \nWorld Report. But they didn't do the analysis. The analysis was done by \nthe Congressional Research Service in a study provided to the \nDepartment of Education.\n  I hope we can consider this not on the basis of publications but \nlooking at it from the effective study of some of the Government \nagencies that have looked at it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Certainly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I thank the Senator for his amendment on issues at \nNIH. I very seldom disagree with my esteemed friend and chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Specter. I may have a slight disagreement here.\n  A couple of questions: First, I noticed on the chart that the \ndeduction for my State of Iowa was 57 percent. That looked to be one of \nthe highest of all the States, if I am not mistaken. Is a 57-percent \nreduction correct?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is reading the chart \ncorrectly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator state what that would mean? Give me \nsome idea what that might mean for a family in Iowa that applied for \nstudent aid, has been getting student aid, a son or daughter going to a \nprivate college--Simpson College or Graceland or Clarke or a number of \ncolleges in Iowa. They have been applying for student aid and all of a \nsudden they get hit with this change. Give me some idea what that means \nfor that family that is eligible for student aid with a couple of kids \nin high school and maybe they have a couple of kids in college.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Federal study has shown that 84,000 kids across this \ncountry would be dropped from the Pell grant program itself, completely \neliminated.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the Senator saying there could be young men and women \nin Iowa who are in college who are getting Pell grants, eligible for \nPell grants today, who, because of this change in this Department of \nEducation regulation--not a law, but a regulation--will be denied \naccess to Pell grants next year?\n  Mr. CORZINE. This change in regulation is done once in 10 years, by \nthe way, not on a systematic every-year basis looking at what is going \non in the States. It will have the potential to affect your students in \nIowa or my students in New Jersey and anywhere\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n\nacross the country. The effect is quite substantial, and it also can \nreduce that amount somebody would be eligible for a Pell grant. So \n$4,000-plus could be reduced to $2,000. This could be meaningful \ndollars in grants that are lost to students across this country just at \na time, by the way, when tuition is going up 10 percent a year--in that \nneighborhood--in State universities across the country, at the same \ntime that universities are having to cut back classes because they do \nnot have the resources coming and budgets are being reduced from the \nState governments. It is a difficult mix of things to be implemented.\n  We ought to act sooner rather than later. That is why we are talking \nabout it now.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator say further that this change in this \nregulation not only affects the families that need this student aid, \nthe young people going to college who need the student aid but, again, \nwhen they get the student aid, they use it usually to pay their tuition \nat school, so not only does it hurt the families--it is a double hit--\nit also hits the schools, too?\n  Mr. CORZINE. When students have to drop out or are not be able to go, \nand there is a decreased demand for higher education from students, \nthat would happen. We are losing a major investment in human capital as \ntime goes on.\n  Clearly, universities are hurt. They are having to deal with trying \nto find other sources of aid, basically trying to find jobs for kids so \nthey can work at the same time they go to school.\n\n  It seems to me we are being very shortsighted in implementing such a \nregulation which does not conform with the facts anywhere. It has been \ntalked about broadly, obviously in the media. There have been studies \nequally by a number of government institutions. I hope the Senate will \nconsider this in the long run best interest of the country. We are not \nchanging the fiscal year for the NIH funding, just delaying the timing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for my last question, I want to \nmake sure I am correct that the Senator in his amendment is not taking \nany money away from NIH; is that correct?\n  Mr. CORZINE. That is correct. As a matter of fact, I am supportive of \nwhat both the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa have \ndone to double NIH funding over a period of time. I will continue to \nsupport that. I believe very strongly in it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know the Senator has been supportive of our efforts to \nincrease funding of NIH.\n  As I understand the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey, it \ndelays until September 30, the last day of the fiscal year, by $200 \nmillion, NIH obligations. It is my information that NIH estimates that \nit will obligate $8 billion next September. In September of next year \nit will obligate during September, 1 month, $8 billion.\n  I assume they work on a 5-day workweek. I assume that. I know NIH \ndoes research 7 days a week, but in terms of this, that is 20 days out \nof the month, so $8 billion for 20 days. If we could figure out how \nmuch that is a day, that is $400 million a day.\n  What the Senator is basically saying, we are just asking for one-half \nday, to delay until September 30.\n  Now, if, in fact, they do $8 billion in September and do it evenly, \nwhich they do not normally do, but if they do, they will be obligating \n$400 million on September 30 anyway, so the Senator is saying that for \npurposes of getting the funding we need for this, we are simply going \nto ask to officially delay $200 million until the last day of the \nmonth. They can still obligate it. This gets us the money we need to \npay for the Senator's amendment. Am I correct in what I said?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Iowa is exactly correct. He is talking \nabout how budget accounting works in the Federal Government, which is a \ncashflow system. We are in no way trying to undermine the ability of \nNIH to be effective.\n  Mr. HARKIN. One last observation. If it is $200 million, we take no \nmoney away. They will obligate $8 billion in September anyway. That \n$200 million is one dollar out of every 40. That is all you are saying \nthey will obligate on September 30. I have to believe it. I have been \naround NIH now for the 19 years I have been privileged to serve on this \ncommittee, and I watched how they obligate money and how they spend \nmoney. Quite frankly, it is in this Senator's judgment that asking NIH \nto obligate $200 million the last day of the month is nothing. That is \na no-brainer. They will do that anyway, but it gets us the money needed \nto make sure we do not shortchange the kids and their families needing \nhelp for Pell grants and help meet the needs of our higher education, \nour institutions so they can get the young people in and pay the \ntuition.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent to add my name as a \ncosponsor, and I ask unanimous consent, also, that Senator Reid of \nNevada be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my calculations differ. I took $8 \nmillion--and I don't know if that is a correct figure or incorrect \nfigure--and that works, to me, to be $20 million a day. So if you are \ntalking about $200 million, that is considerably more than the \ncalculations we have just heard.\n  I don't think it is too important how much money it is. If it is \ndelayed funding which is available for the National Institutes of \nHealth, I think it is a bad idea.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Four hundred million dollars a day.\n  See, Mr. President, that is why we need a hearing. I thank the \nSenator from Iowa for proving my point. This is not something that you \ncan roll off the back of your hand going into the 15th hour of the day, \na little before 9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.\n  But whatever the calculation comes out to be, I would strenuously \nobject to tampering with any of the NIH money. And I say that after \nhaving put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, along with my colleague \nfrom Iowa, on getting the funding up.\n  When the Senator from New Jersey says he is not changing the law, I \nthink he is categorically wrong. If you are stopping the funding so \nthat the change in the formula cannot be worked out, it is conclusively \nchanging the law.\n  This amendment to this appropriations bill is a specific effort to \nchange the law. When you talk about a swing of billions of dollars--and \nI don't know whether that is right, wrong, or indifferent, but that is \nthe representation made by the Senator from New Jersey--the impact on \nlooking for an offset can hardly be de minimis, can hardly be \nminuscule, can hardly be irrelevant.\n  You are talking about a swing of billions of dollars. I don't know \nthat is so, but I would like to know a lot more about this amendment \nand what its impact is. And I would like to know a lot more about this \nwhole idea of reducing student aid based upon some formula. I am not \nfamiliar with it. And this is something which I think the Department of \nEducation and the Department of the Treasury would like to comment \nabout.\n  In an effort to peruse this Congressional Research Service document \njust a bit, I have some bedtime reading. In fact, I have quite a bit--\nU.S. News & World Report. But I note a paragraph in this CRS document. \nIt is CRS-8, and it says this:\n\n       Quantifying the impact of the May 30th revisions to the \n     state and other tax allowance tables will require \n     identification of which students will have their eligibility \n     for federal aid affected by changes in their [expected family \n     contributions] and to what extent. Although it would appear \n     that the levels of federal aid awarded to many students will \n     be affected by these revisions, without substantial and \n     complex modeling, the size of that student population and the \n     financial effect on federal aid programs remain largely \n     undetermined.\n\n  So to repeat, it says: ``It would appear that the levels of federal \naid awarded to many students will be affected by these revisions. . . \n.'' It does not know it for sure. It says ``without substantial and \ncomplex modeling''--which supports what I am talking about, that you \nneed to know what this is really all about, which you should have a \nhearing on--``the size of that student population and the financial \neffect on federal aid programs remain largely undetermined.''\n  I would ask the Senator from New Jersey, since he cites this as his \nauthority, How does he explain this authority saying that it is largely \nundetermined on the basis of the existing record?\n\n[[Page S11239]]\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Pennsylvania is asking me a question. I \nwould just remark that the Education Department indicates that Pell \ngrant costs will be potentially impacted by $270 million or less. And \nthey estimate--the Department of Education--based on the information of \nthe CRS, that 84,000 students would lose eligibility altogether. They \ndid not make an estimate about how many other students would lose \npartial eligibility, partial coverage. And they made no estimate with \nregard to how other people in private institutions or State \ninstitutions, using the same calculations of allowances for State and \nlocal taxes, would do it. Just know it will be quite substantial, not \nimpacting the Federal Government but impacting how student aid is \nallocated nationally.\n\n  Now, very clearly, the Education Department accepts the estimation of \n84,000 students losing eligibility for Pell grants. It is not U.S. News \n& World Report. It is their estimate from their own budget service.\n  I think the Senator is looking at the CRS report of June 25, 2003. \nAnd that point is made on--let's see if I can help the Senator from \nPennsylvania. It is on CRS-8.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, Mr. President, I have an additional question.\n  How can the Senator from New Jersey make the assertions he has when \nhis own authority says there would have to be ``substantial and complex \nmodeling'' to determine ``the size of that student population and the \nfinancial effect on federal aid programs'' which ``remain[s] largely \nundetermined''?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I think the Senator from Pennsylvania has heard me say \nthat the only number I have used specifically is the 84,000 that CRS \nhas estimated would lose all Pell grant assistance, not the full \ncalculation of how many individual students would lose partial benefits \non grants and student loans, by way of Stafford loans and other things, \nwhich would be much more complex. And that is what they are pointing \nout.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, Mr. President, the essence is that when you want \nto stop funding to carry out existing law, there ought to be a lot more \nunderstanding of what is going on. And our processes for legislation \nare customarily carried out by the introduction of bills and by \nhearings. And when you affect the Department of the Treasury, you \naffect the Department of Education, you affect swings of billions of \ndollars--again, the language of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  This is not the way to accomplish that result. I oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, are we prepared to move now to the final amendment of \nthe evening, the amendment from the Senator from Nevada?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1603 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1603.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funding for certain education and related \n                               programs)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. 306. (a) In addition to any amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act, there are appropriated, out of \n     any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated--\n       (1) an additional $85,000,000 to carry out title III of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (language \n     instruction);\n       (2) an additional $6,449,000 to carry out part A of title V \n     of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (Hispanic-serving \n     institutions);\n       (3) an additional $4,587,000 to carry out part C of title I \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (migrant education);\n       (4) an additional $11,000,000 to carry out high school \n     equivalency program activities under section 418A of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEP);\n       (5) an additional $1,000,000 to carry out college \n     assistance migrant program activities under section 418A of \n     the Higher Education Act of 1965 (CAMP);\n       (6) an additional $12,776,000 to carry out subpart 16 of \n     part D of title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (parental assistance and local family information \n     centers); and\n       (7) an additional $69,000,000 to carry out migrant and \n     seasonal Head Start programs: Provided, That such sum shall \n     be in addition to funds reserved for migrant, seasonal, and \n     other Head Start programs under section 640(a)(2) of the Head \n     Start Act.\n       (b) Of the funds appropriated in this Act for the National \n     Institutes of Health, $146,000,000 shall not be available for \n     obligation until September 30, 2004.\n       (c) The amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this \n     Act shall be deemed to be $7,085,011,000 and the amount \n     $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $6,593,489,000.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not going to debate this amendment \ntonight. We have no vote scheduled tomorrow. I am not sure we are going \nto have a vote on it tomorrow. But I will discuss it tomorrow. I am not \ngoing to discuss it anymore tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding you are going to raise a budget \npoint of order on the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, I am not because it does not lie. If I could, I \nwould.\n  Mr. REID. I missed the first part of the debate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I missed most of the debate myself.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Corzine \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it will be in order to \nrequest the yeas and nays at this time.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Corzine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the White House and the Republican \nCongress see a perfect storm coming. Our policy in Iraq is crashing, \nthe Federal budget is crashing, and so are State and local budgets. \nFamily budgets are crashing, too. The administration and the Republican \nCongress are worried that their power to stay in office is crashing \nalong with the electric power grid.\n  The overtime issue should be an embarrassment for anyone who supports \nthe Republican position. It's a symbol of all that's wrong with so many \nof their other policies.\n  Three million Americans have lost their jobs since President Bush \ntook office. Ninety-three thousand more were lost in August alone--the \nseventh consecutive month of job losses.\n  This is no time to end overtime. It's precisely the wrong time.\n  We need to create more jobs to bring this troubled economy back to \nlife.\n  But under the Bush proposal, businesses can raise their profits by \nasking employees to work harder for lower pay, and avoid hiring new \nemployees.\n  Especially in times like these, the right to overtime pay is a clear \nincentive for firms to create jobs, because it encourages employers to \nhire more workers instead of asking current employees to work longer \nhours.\n  We know that employees across America are already struggling hard to \nbalance their family needs with their work responsibilities. Requiring \nthem to work longer hours for less pay will impose an even greater \nburden in this daily struggle.\n  Protecting the 40-hour work week is vital to protecting the work-\nfamily balance for millions of Americans in communities in all parts of \nthe nation. The last thing Congress should do is to allow this anti-\nworker administration to make the balance worse than it already is.\n  What can the administration be thinking, when it comes up with such a \nshameful proposal to deny overtime protections on which millions of \nworkers rely?\n  According to the Congressional General Accounting Office, employees\n\n[[Page S11240]]\n\nwithout overtime protection are twice as likely to work overtime as \nthose covered by that protection. Americans are working longer hours \ntoday than ever before--longer than in any other industrial nation. At \nleast 1 in 5 employees now has a work week that exceeds 50 hours, let \nalone 40 hours.\n  Congress cannot sit idle while more and more Americans lose their \njobs, their livelihoods, their homes, and their dignity. Denying \novertime pay rubs salt in the open wounds.\n  The 8 million Americans who will lose their right to overtime under \nthe Bush administration regulation include police officers, \nfirefighters, nurses, and EMTs the heroes of September 11. With the \nanniversary of that tragic day just 2 days away, we can't help but \nremember the horrifying images of that day. The many lives lost.\n  The exhausted firefighters raising the American flag. And we recall \nthe long, grueling hours so many of our first responders invested to \nprotect and save their fellow Americans.\n  Today our first responders work long hours keeping our Nation safe \nfrom terrorism and other threats. President Bush wants to take away \ntheir overtime pay.\n  Cutbacks in overtime pay are a nightmare that no worker should have \nto bear. Overtime pay now makes up a quarter of the total pay of \nworkers who receive it. The administration's proposal will mean an \naverage pay cut of $161 a week for them. Hard-working Americans don't \ndeserve this pay cut, and it's wrong for the administration to try to \nforce it on them.\n  Our Democratic amendment is clear. It says that no worker now \neligible for overtime protections can lose it as a result of the new \nregulation.\n  The overtime protections in the Fair Labor Standards Act have been a \nfundamental right of the Nation's workers for more than half a century. \nThat basic law was enacted in the 1930s to create a 40-hour workweek. \nIt requires employees to be paid fairly for any extra hours.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this essential proposal to keep the \nfaith with the Nation's working families. We will continue the battle \nto restore jobs, provide fair unemployment benefits, and raise the \nminimum wage, and we will do all we can to preserve the overtime \nprotections on which so many Americans families depend.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:45 a.m. \non Wednesday, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the following \namendments in the order stated: Harkin 1580, Schumer 1595, Reed 1595--I \nhave two 1595s--the three Reed amendments, 1592, 1596, and Corzine \n1602. I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate prior to the vote in relation to each amendment \nbeginning with the second vote; further, that no amendments be in order \nto any of the amendments prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Senator Schumer has offered \nonly one amendment, so we will make sure that we are voting on the \nright amendment. Senator Schumer is No. 1598, so the Record should \nreflect that. I ask, further, that the request of my friend from \nPennsylvania be modified that the following would be added: That there \nbe 4 minutes for debate equally divided prior to Reed amendment No. \n1595. That would be after the Schumer amendment. Rather than 2 minutes, \nit would be 2 minutes on each side, a total of 4 minutes. Further, I \nask that the votes following the Harkin amendment be 10 minutes in \nlength.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Prior to entering the consent, Mr. President, I would note \nthat we hope to have three more votes lined up here. On the Mikulski \namendment, there has been a good faith offer made by the other side. We \nwill discuss that with Senator Mikulski in the morning. Maybe we won't \nhave to have a vote on that. And then we were hoping to have a vote on \nthe Dodd and Gregg amendments. We will do those side by side. The two \nleaders agreed that those two votes would follow the Harkin amendment. \nI am not going to say a lot about that now. I know Senator Gregg says \nhe does not have his ready to go yet. I have spoken to Senator Dodd at \nhome this evening. He said he is agreeable to doing it following this \nsequence of votes. So following the Corzine amendment, I hope we can \nhave the two votes that are going to be cast dealing with Dodd and \nGregg which are on the same subject matter, I understand.\n  Having said that, I have no objection to the consent as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, as modified, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11240-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11240-S11241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TERRORIST PENALTIES ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on a \nbill that I will introduce to increase the criminal penalties relating \nto terrorist murders and to deny Federal benefits to terrorists, and \nfor other purposes.\n  I authored the Terrorist Prosecution Act of 1986, which provides for \nextraterritorial jurisdiction to try in United States courts anyone who \nassaults, maims, or murders a U.S. citizen anywhere in the world. And \nthat bill, which provides for the death penalty, has been enacted into \nlaw and has been very helpful.\n  I have been trying to extradite Palestinian Authority terrorists who \nhave murdered United States citizens abroad. This bill would go beyond \nexisting law to provide for the death penalty in all terrorist offenses \nresulting in death. It adds the death penalty as a punishment in a \nnumber of situations that do not currently provide for the death \npenalty, such as sabotage of a national defense installation, sabotage \nof a nuclear facility, or destroying an energy facility.\n  In addition, this legislation includes conspiracy and attempt to \ncommit terrorist acts in the list of terrorism offenses subject to the \ndeath penalty. It would enable prosecutors to seek the death penalty \nfor terrorist fundraisers, for example.\n  Another important aspect of this legislation would be to remove the \nso-called gateway factors to impose the death penalty for terrorist \noffenses. It adds terrorism to the list of offenses, espionage and \ntreason, for which the death penalty can be imposed without the gateway \nfactors being met. For other offenses, the death penalty can only be \nimposed if there is a direct link between the criminal act and the \ndeath of a victim and prosecutors do not believe they can establish \nsuch a link in the case of a terrorist fundraiser.\n  There are Supreme Court decisions which preclude the imposition of \nthe death penalty, for example, on the driver of a getaway car in a \nfelony murder or robbery murder. Someone in the getaway car cannot get \nthe death penalty because the Supreme Court has said it is too remote. \nAnd when I have pressed the Department of Justice to proceed with \ncriminal prosecutions and to seek the death penalty for terrorists, for \npeople who contribute to organizations such as Hamas, where they know \nthere are terrorist branches and instigation of the murdering of U.S. \ncitizens, as they did some months ago at Hebrew University and in other \nsituations, the prosecutors have said to me they are concerned that the \nanalogy to the driver of a getaway car might prevent the imposition of \nthe death penalty.\n  Frankly, I disagree with that assessment because the driver of a \ngetaway car may not be considering the consequence of death. And the \ncontributors to terrorist organizations, knowing what those \norganizations do, are really on notice and are accessories before the \nfact to murder. I think they ought to be held liable under existing \nlaw. But to clear up any ambiguity, this legislation would remove those \nlimitations and would make such contributors to terrorist organizations \nliable for the death penalty as accessories before the fact.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  S.  \n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man of \nremarkable leadership, dedication, and courage and to join Nevadans and \nAmericans in mourning the loss of retired Air Force General Bill \nCreech.\n  As chairman of the Military Readiness Subcommittee, I have learned a \ngreat deal about what it has taken and what it will continue to take \nfor our armed services to be the top military in the world, bar none. \nFor the strength, effectiveness, and success of today's Air Force, this \nnation owes a debt of gratitude to Bill Creech.\n  Creech started as a private in the Air Force in 1944, and as he rose \n14 rungs to four-star general, he never forgot what it was like to be \nat the bottom. During almost 40 years of service to this nation, he \nflew 280 missions as a combat pilot and was decorated 39 times, \nincluding 22 awards for bravery in combat.\n  In 1960, he came to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas where he was \ndirector of operations for the ``Top Gun'' Fighter Weapons School and \nduring which his relationship to southern Nevada first formed.\n  In 1978, he earned his fourth star and became commander of the \nTactical Air Command, or TAC, at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. \nDuring his 6\\1/2\\ years as commander, Creech showed the Air Force how \nto get the job done, and his leadership continues to be a lesson to us \nall. Under his direction, TAC's productivity improved by 80 percent and \nresulted in $12 billion of savings for the government.\n  And while Creech cut out the fat and waste, he oversaw the \ndevelopment of a new generation of air fighters including many modern \njets as well as our prized Stealth fighter that eludes radar detection. \nCreech also used his experiences in Vietnam to develop night-flying \ntactics that led to our victories in the Persian Gulf War and Iraq.\n  After his retirement from the military, Creech became an \ninternationally recognized management consultant with a best-selling \nbook on total quality management based on his success restructuring the \nAir Force. For anyone who manages a single office or a multi-billion \ndollar corporation, Creech's message is invaluable. By rewarding \naccomplishments, creating pride in ownership, and developing a team \natmosphere, the human factor endures and success results.\n  To southern Nevadans, Bill Creech will always hold a special place in \nour hearts for his loyalty and dedication to our beloved Thunderbirds, \nthe air demonstration team that calls Nellis Air Force Base home. A \nThunderbird pilot who flew 125 demonstration shows, Creech was once \nreferred to as ``the father of the Thunderbirds,'' and he believed that \nthe Thunderbirds inspired young people to join the Air Force.\n  The Thunderbirds exist today because Bill Creech stood up for them. \nAfter four pilots were killed in fight, he publicly stated that if the \nteam suffered an accident during his tenure he would resign. We are \ngrateful that he took that stand. I have had the honor of watching the \nThunderbirds in action on many occasions. They display the power and \nawesomeness of our Air Force and the dedication of people like Bill \nCreech who lift this nation to new heights so that we may all continue \nto soar.\n  To Bill's wife, Caroline, I offer the condolences and admiration of \nNevadans and Americans. This great Nation that Bill Creech risked his \nlife for and lived his life for will always be grateful for his \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11241-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11241-S11242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 50TH ANNIVERSARY REAUTHORIZATION ACT \n                                OF 2003\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of S. 1375, the \nSmall Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of \n2003. This bill revitalizes existing SBA programs and brings to life \nnew pilot programs, all of which promote the demands and growth of the \nsmall business community. I commend the Chair, Senator Snowe, for \npassing this bill through the Small Business Committee with unanimous \nsupport.\n  Upon final passage of this bill, we will take a giant step toward \nimproving and refining the SBA and its programs. With the new \nprovisions that enhance Agency recordkeeping and realign program \noperations under a more appropriate department, it is clear that Agency \naccountability and oversight will be strengthened. In addition, small \nbusinesses will benefit from improvements in the lending programs, \ngreater access to capital, new innovations in the entrepreneurial \nprograms, expansion of procurement programs, and improved training and \nassistance provisions.\n  According to the SBA's Office of Advocacy, small businesses represent \nmore than 99.7 percent of all employers, employ more than half of all \nprivate sector employees, and generate 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs \nannually. Given these statistics and the difficult financial times we \nface in today's economy, I urge Congress to continue to nurture the \nneeds of the small business community. We must show enthusiastic \nsupport for this bill, which I am confident will provide the SBA with \ngreater tools to keep pace with the ever-changing global economy and to \nserve the small business community in a more effective and efficient \nmanner. To act otherwise could jeopardize this Nation's much-needed job \ngrowth and innovation.\n  I refer to an important small business program titled the \nHistorically Underutilized Business Zone Contracting Program, or as it \nis commonly referred to, the HUBZone Program. This small-business \nprogram was one of my personal priorities as former chairman of the \nSenate Small Business Committee. It was established in 1997 with the \nintent to create jobs in severely economically distressed communities, \nboth rural and urban. In addition, the HUBZone program provides a \nfederal contracting preference as an incentive for small businesses to \nlocate in these low-income areas. The jobs created by the HUBZone \nProgram bring money to those blighted areas and create a demand for \nmore goods and services, which leads to the creation of more small \nbusinesses and increased commerce in the area. Little\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\nby little, the community's economic base is reborn.\n  Today, there are over 8,378 small businesses that are HUBZone \ncertified, and the Government has procured approximately $1.7 billion \nin HUBZone contracting this year. The SBA reports that in fiscal year \n2001, each dollar spent on the program yielded a return of $288 in \ncontract awards and as a result, the program helped to create 12,782 \njobs in the U.S., approximately 8,974 of which were located in \ndistressed areas.\n  Based on fiscal year 2001 procurement statistics, HUBZone firms \nincreased employment 33 percent to 50 percent as a result of contract \nawards. Nearly 50 percent of HUBZone firms increased capital \nexpenditures as a result of receiving contracts in fiscal year 2001. As \nour economy struggles during these difficult times, this vital program \nwill continue to bring jobs to our Nation's inner cities, poor rural \ncounties, and Indian reservations.\n  I urge Congress to support the HUBZone Program in its current form \nalong with the new amendments provided in the Senate's version of the \nSBA Reauthorization Act of 2003. Any additional changes not supported \nby the full Senate Committee on Small Business could seriously \nundermine the original intent of the program.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to speak today on behalf of the small \nbusiness community. I encourage my colleagues to support Senator Snowe \nand S. 1375, the Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act of 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11242-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FINDING THE CONNECTION\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, it has been nearly 2 years since \nterrorists attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. As our \nNation prepares to honor the memory of those who were lost on that \ntragic day, I would like to submit for the Record a piece that I read \nin yesterday's Cleveland Plain Dealer that was written by Christy \nFerer, whose husband, Neil Levin, perished in the World Trade Center. I \nwas deeply moved by her words, which serve to remind us of the reason \nbehind our ongoing efforts to promote the virtues of freedom and \ndemocracy as our men and women in uniform remain on the front lines in \nthe fight against terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other parts of \nthe world. We owe them our deepest gratitude.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Plain Dealer, Sept. 8, 2003]\n\n                         Finding the Connection\n\n                           (By Christy Ferer)\n\n       When I told friends that I was making a pilgrimage to Iraq \n     to thank the U.S. troops, their reactions were underwhelming \n     at best.\n       Some were blunt: ``Why are you going there?''\n       They couldn't understand why it was important for me, a \n     Sept. 11 widow, to express my support for the men and women \n     stationed today in the Persian Gulf.\n       The reason seemed clear, as far as I was concerned. I was \n     going not to embrace the war, but to embrace the warriors.\n       I didn't intend to use the emotional capital generated by \n     my connection to Sept. 11, 2001, to defend the U.S. presence \n     in the Gulf. And I am certainly aware there is no proof yet \n     that Saddam Hussein was linked to those terrorist attacks.\n       But I wanted to go to Iraq because I am the daughter of a \n     World War II veteran who was decorated with a Purple Heart, \n     and because I am the widow of a man who lost his life in what \n     some feel was the opening salvo of World War III.\n       I wanted, needed, to honor my father and my husband, their \n     service and sacrifice, by standing before those who were now \n     making sacrifices and serving our country.\n       But my friends' reactions were so politely negative that I \n     began to doubt my role in the first USO/Tribeca Institute \n     tour into newly occupied Iraq. Besides, with Robert DeNiro \n     Wayne Newton and Rebecca and John Stamos, who needed me? \n     I'm hardly a celebrity.\n       Did U.S. soldiers really want to hear about my husband, \n     Neil Levin, who went to work as director of the Port \n     Authority of New York on Sept. 11 and never came home?\n       How would they relate to the two other bereaved people \n     traveling with me--Ginny Bauer, a N.J. homemaker and mother \n     of three who lost her husband, David, and former Marine Jon \n     Vigiano, who lost his only sons, Jon, a firefighter, and Joe, \n     a policeman?\n       As we were choppered over the bleached deserts, I wondered \n     if I'd feel like a street hawker, passing out Port Authority \n     pins and baseball caps as I said ``Thank you'' to the troops. \n     Would a hug from me compare to hugs from a Victoria's Secret \n     model, or the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders?\n       The first ``meet and greet'' made me weep. My own daughters \n     are old enough to be soldiers. Here were their peers--18-\n     years-olds, armed with M-16s and saddlebags of water in the \n     120-degree heat. The soldiers swarmed around the stars for \n     photos and autographs. Then it was announced that a trio of \n     Sept. 11 family members was also in the tent.\n       It was as if an emotional dam had burst.\n       Some wanted to touch us, as if they needed a physical \n     connection to our sorrow, and living proof of one reason they \n     were there. One mother of two from Montana told me she'd \n     signed up because of Sept. 11, and dozens of others said the \n     same. One young man showed me his metal bracelet engraved \n     with the name of victim he'd never known and that awful date \n     none of us will ever forget.\n       At every encounter with the troops, there was a surge of \n     reservists--firefighters and cops, including many who had \n     worked in the rubble of Ground Zero--who had come to exchange \n     a hometown hug. Their glassy eyes still didn't allow anyone \n     to penetrate to the place where their trauma is lodged, the \n     trauma that comes with devastation unimaginable to those who \n     didn't witness it. It's there in me, too. I forced my way \n     downtown on that terrible morning, convinced I could find \n     Neil beneath the rubble.\n       I was not prepared for the soldiers who showed us the World \n     Trade Center memorabilia they'd carried with them into the \n     streets of Baghdad. Others had been holding in stories of \n     personal Sept. 11 tragedies that had made them enlist.\n       To those men and women, it didn't seem to matter that \n     Saddam's regime had not produced the murderers of Sept. 11. \n     What they made clear to me was their belief that despotic \n     rulers like Saddam fuel the volatile anti-American sentiment \n     that breeds such terrorism: They feel they are in Iraq to \n     stabilize the Gulf region, and thus to protect U.S. soil.\n       At Saddam Hussein International Airport, where Kid Rock \n     gave an impromptu concert in a steamy hangar, Capt. Jorge \n     Vargas from the Bronx tapped me on the back. He'd enlisted in \n     the Army after some of his wife's best friends were lost at \n     the World Trade Center. When he saw the piece of recovered \n     metal from the Towers that I had been showing to a group of \n     soldiers, he grasped for it as if it were a grail.\n       Then he handed it to Kid Rock, who passed the precious \n     metal through the 5,000 troops in the audience. They lunged \n     at the opportunity to touch the steel that symobilized what \n     so many of them felt was the purpose of their mission. \n     Looking into that sea of khaki gave me chills, even in the \n     blistering heat.\n       When I got to the microphone, I told the soldiers we hadn't \n     made the journey to hear condolences, but to thank them and \n     to say that the families of Sept. 11 think of them every day. \n     The crowd interrupted me with chants of ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.! \n     U.S.A.!'' Many cried.\n       What happened next left me with no doubt as to why I had \n     come.\n       There I was on stage, quaking before thousands of troops \n     because I was to present a small piece of the World Trade \n     Center steel to Gen.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the memory of an extraordinary Floridian who was also an \nAmerican treasure--Chesterfield Harvey Smith.\n  On Wednesday, July 16, 2003, we lost this resounding voice of \nconscience to cardiopulmonary complications at Doctor's Hospital in \nCoral Gables, FL. He was 85.\n  Chesterfield Smith often called himself a ``country lawyer,'' but he \nwas a pillar of this Nation's legal community. After graduating from \nthe University of Florida's law school in 1948, he joined a law firm \nthat he led through mergers and acquisitions to become one of the \ncountry's largest, Holland & Knight. He served as president of the \nFlorida Bar Association in 1964, and then became president of the \nAmerican Bar Association in 1973.\n  While ABA president, Mr. Smith condemned President Richard Nixon \nfollowing the firings of an attorney general and others in the so-\ncalled ``Saturday Night Massacre'' during the Watergate scandal. Mr. \nSmith's comment--``no man is above the law''--has been described as a \nturning point in public\n\n[[Page S11243]]\n\nopinion. Smith urged that an independent special prosecutor be employed \nto investigate the President.\n  ``The justice system was being torn down by Nixon's actions,'' Mr. \nSmith recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 1999.\n  Mr. Smith challenged members of the legal profession to provide \nquality, affordable legal services for all persons in need, insisting \nthat law firms fill in where government funding came short. Always a \nvisionary, he proposed testing of lawyers to weed out incompetents and \nwas an early advocate of equal rights for women and minorities. Among \nhis many honors, in 1969, the Florida State Chamber of Commerce named \nChesterfield Smith the first ``Distinguished Floridian of the Year,'' \nand he was subsequently honored as a ``Great Floridian'' by Governor \nLawton Chiles and the Florida Cabinet.\n  In 2002, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg presented Mr. \nSmith with an award in recognition of his lifelong commitment to pro \nbono service.\n  Born in the small town of Arcadia in southwest Florida, Chesterfield \nserved from 1934 to 1938 with the Florida National Guard. He joined the \nArmy in 1940, prior to Pearl Harbor, where he quickly achieved the rank \nof Technical Sergeant and was recommended for Officer Candidate School. \nAfter attending OCS and being commissioned as a Field Artillery \nOfficer, he served during World War II combat as the Commander of B \nBattery with the 390th Field Artillery Battalion, 94th Infantry \nDivision, that participated in the Northern France, Rhineland, \nArdennes-Alsace and Central Europe Campaigns. His bravery in these \ncampaigns resulted in his being awarded the Bronze Star Medal. He was \nalso awarded the American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign \nService Medal, European Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with four Bronze \nService Stars and the World War II Victory Medal.\n  Chesterfield was discharged from the Army, having attained the rank \nof Captain, in December 1945. He served 6 more years in the Army \nReserve, retiring in 1951 with the rank of Major.\n  After the war, he returned to Florida and graduated from law school \nat the University of Florida. He joined the firm of Holland, Bevis & \nMcRae in Bartow and quickly made partner. Later, under Smith's \nleadership, the firm merged with the Tampa firm Knight, Jones, Whitaker \nand Germany in 1968, and the new firm became Holland & Knight. Smith \nserved as the firm's managing partner for 18 years. Today, Holland & \nKnight is our nation's eighth largest firm and sets the standard for \npublic service.\n  In short, this son of Florida bravely served his Nation as a member \nof the armed services and as a civilian. He truly was worthy of what \nwas his most cherished title: ``Citizen Smith.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing heartfelt condolences \nto Chesterfield's widow, Jacqueline Allee Smith of Coral Gables, FL and \nin expressing our appreciation for this great man's lasting \nlegacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11243-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11243-S11245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-3964.

A bill to amend the Head Start Act to improve provisions \nrelating to updating population data; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it's been more than a year and a half since \nthe No Child Left Behind Act became law. By passing that bill into law, \nwe reaffirmed our commitment to provide every American child with a \nquality education.\n  The education of our children must be one of our top priorities, \nbecause they are the future of this country. We have to give them the \ntools they need to succeed.\n  Unfortunately, the fight against terrorism and the war in Iraq have \ndriven education off the national agenda. This is especially \ndisappointing now because public schools across the Nation are in \njeopardy as States struggle to close unprecedented budget deficits. At \na time when NCLB is imposing new unfunded mandates on States and local \ngovernments, schools have watched helplessly as their budgets have been \nslashed. Many of these schools are located in poor and rural areas, \nwhere the achievement gap is widest. These schools simply don't have \nthe resources they need to do their job, and children are being left \nbehind as a result.\n  Some States, including Nevada, face an additional problem. These \nStates have extremely high rates of population growth, and as a result \nthey find themselves in a never-ending race to fund the growing demand \nfor education. The formulas that allocate Federal education dollars \nusually don't factor high growth rates into their calculations. So, \nschools in these States find their backs against the wall even in the \nbest fiscal conditions. You can imagine how precarious their situation \nis in a time of record federal and state budget deficits.\n  I mentioned my State, Nevada. The condition of its public schools is, \nin many ways, quite dismal. Nevada has one of the highest high school \ndropout rates in the country and one of the lowest high school \ngraduation rates. It is near the bottom in performance on national \nreading, writing, and math tests. Per-pupil, Nevada spends less money \non its students than all but five other States. I could cite many other \nstatistics, but you get the picture--and it isn't pretty.\n  There is no magic fix for the problems facing schools in Nevada, or \nany other state. And because schools are primarily the responsibility \nof individual states, there is only so much the federal government can \ndo to help. But I believe Nevada's problems stem in part from the fact \nthat its high growth rate prevents it from receiving its fair share of \nFederal education funding. Nevada is the fastest growing State in the \nNation by a wide margin. Its schools struggle each year to make room \nfor new students. Despite all this, Nevada is dead last in Federal per-\npupil education funding. And I want to reiterate that this problem is \nnot unique to Nevada--schools in other states also face budget strains \nas a result of high population growth rates.\n  These States deserve their fair share of federal education dollars. \nIt is an issue of fundamental fairness. I hope that we will address \nthis problem in a comprehensive manner the next time we revisit NCLB. \nIn the meantime, however, we should take this opportunity to correct a \nsimilar flaw in the way we fund Head Start.\n  Throughout its 38-year history, Head Start has helped put millions of \nat-risk children on the path to success by giving them the social and \nacademic skills they need to succeed in elementary school. It is a \ntextbook example of a Federal program that has worked.\n  Consider some of the statistics. At-risk children who participate in \na quality early childhood education program are 33 percent more likely \nto graduate from high school, and 25 percent less likely to repeat a \ngrade. Since a year of public education for one student costs \napproximately $5,900, it is safe to say that Head Start has saved \ntaxpayers millions of dollars.\n  Young women who participated in a quality early childhood education \nprogram have 33 percent fewer children out of wedlock, and are 25 \npercent less likely to become teen mothers. Every dollar we invest in \nHead Start translates into four dollars of benefits for at-risk \nchildren, their families, and American taxpayers.\n  So as you can see, Head Start is a critical component of public \neducation in this country. Its holistic approach also addresses many of \nthe underlying causes of poor academic performance by providing medical \nservices and guidance for parents of at-risk children.\n  But State budget crises have placed Head Start programs under siege \nalong with all other aspects of public education--and programs in high-\ngrowth states are among the hardest hit. Nevada has seven centralized \nHead Start agencies that administer almost 50 Head Start programs \nthroughout the State. At current funding levels, these programs serve \napproximately 2,500 at-risk children not nearly as many as they could \nserve with adequate resources.\n  We need to do everything in our power to help Head Start programs \nmeet demand, because better-prepared students make elementary and \nsecondary schools more effective. And because Head Start is a \npartnership between the Federal Government and States, Congress has the \npower to make a real difference on this issue.\n  That is why I am today introducing the High Growth Head Start \nAssistance Act. It will reward high-growth States, such as Nevada, for \ntheir commitment to Head Start by ensuring that programs in their state \nreceive their fair share of Federal funds.\n  Congresswoman Berkley has introduced a similar bill in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I applaud her leadership on this issue.\n  This bill will make a difference in the lives of thousands of at-risk \nchildren in Nevada and across the Nation. It is a matter of fundamental \nfairness. Most important, it represents a small but significant step \ntoward fulfilling the promise we made a year and a half ago--a promise \nto leave no child behind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1593\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. UPDATING POPULATION DATA.\n\n       Section 640(a)(4) of the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. \n     9835(a)(4)) is amended in the flush matter following \n     subparagraph (B)--\n       (1) by striking ``shall use the most recent data \n     available'' and inserting ``shall use data that is not more \n     than 2 years old''; and\n       (2) by striking ``use of the most recent data available'' \n     and inserting ``such data''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1594. A bill to require a report on reconstruction efforts in \nIraq; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Daschle, \nDodd, Lieberman, Bingaman, Johnson, Feingold and Lincoln to introduce \nlegislation to require the President to report to Congress on his \nvision for a democratic, economically viable, and politically stable \nIraq, his plan for achieving those goals, and an estimate on how much \nthis is going to cost.\n  After months of dodging questions, giving half-answers, and ignoring \nCongressional requests, the time has come for this Administration to \nlevel with the American people and Congress and spell-out its plan for \nrebuilding a country torn apart by years of dictatorial rule, ethnic \nstrife, war, and terror.\n  Our legislation requires the President within 60 days of the \nenactment of this act to report to Congress on: the current economic, \npolitical, and military situation in Iraq including the number, type \nand location of attacks on U.S. and Coalition military and civilian \npersonnel in the previous 60 days; a discussion of the measures taken \nto protect U.S. troops serving in Iraq; a detailed plan for the \nestablishment of civil, economic and political security in Iraq, \nincluding the restoration of basic services such as water and \nelectricity and the construction of schools, roads, and medical clinics \nin Iraq; the current and projected monetary costs incurred by the \nUnited States, by Iraq, and by the international community; actions \ntaken\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\nand to be taken by the Administration to secure increased international \nparticipation in peacekeeping forces and in the economic and political \nreconstruction of Iraq; a detailed time-frame and specific steps to be \ntaken for the restoration of self-government to the Iraqi people; cost \nestimates for achieving those goals; and U.S. and international \nmilitary personnel requirements for achieving those goals.\n  I am pleased that, as Secretary of State Colin Powell announced last \nweek, the Administration has finally decided to seek an additional \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution authorizing increased U.N. \nparticipation in multinational peacekeeping forces and the political \nand economic reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Nevertheless, President Bush waited far too long to seek additional \nhelp and, as a result, we will face an ever greater challenge in \nrebuilding Iraq in the months and years ahead. And this past Sunday, \nPresident Bush announced his intention to seek an additional $87 \nbillion to fund reconstruction efforts and military and intelligence \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  What we need now is a plan on how to rebuild Iraq, an estimate on how \nmuch it is going to cost, what personnel, both military and civilian, \nU.S. and international, will be needed, and what the end game will look \nlike.\n  Our troops, along with our British and Australian allies, performed \nbrilliantly in executing Operation Iraqi Freedom. Their unmatched \nskill, bravery, and professionalism made us all proud. They overthrew a \ntyrannical regime in three weeks and, for the first time in over thirty \nyears, brought hope to millions of Iraqis. We owe them a tremendous \ndebt of gratitude.\n  But I believe United States troops assumed too great a burden in \nterms of manpower and exposure to risk, and will be forced to remain in \nIraq longer than expected and at a higher financial cost.\n  Let us look at the facts.\n  Sixty-seven Americans have died in hostile action since the President \ndeclared an end to major combat operations on May 1, 2003. In total, \n286 U.S. troops have died in Iraq, 146 since May 1.\n  One hundred and thirty-nine thousand U.S. troops are currently \nserving in Iraq, comprising 85 percent of coalition forces.\n  Four car bombings in the past month have killed 121 people, including \nthe UN's top envoy to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello.\n  Earlier this year, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated that \nthe United States is spending approximately $4 billion a month in Iraq \nand, given the President's statement Sunday, there is no indication \nthat this figure will go down anytime in the near future.\n  These are enormous commitments, and yet, we do not have a clear \nindication from the Administration about its intentions in Iraq. And \nthat is why I am introducing this legislation.\n  We have assumed an enormous responsibility in Iraq and we must stay \nthe course. But let us hear from the Administration on how it intends \nto stay that course and where that course will lead us. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1594\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although President George W. Bush declared an end to \n     major combat operations in Iraq on May 1, 2003, as of early \n     September 2003, conditions in parts of Iraq continue to be \n     unstable, and President Bush has not yet provided Congress \n     with a detailed plan that outlines the strategic objectives \n     of Operation Iraqi Freedom, explains how and when the \n     President plans to accomplish these objectives, and estimates \n     the costs to be borne by United State taxpayers and the \n     international community.\n       (2) On September 7, 2003, President Bush announced his \n     intention to seek an additional $87,000,000,000 to fund \n     reconstruction efforts and military and intelligence \n     operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report \n     setting forth--\n       (1) a description of the economic, political, and military \n     situation in Iraq, including the number, type, and location \n     of attacks on United States and other Coalition military and \n     civilian personnel in the preceding 60 days;\n       (2) a discussion of the measures taken to protect United \n     States troops serving in Iraq;\n       (3) a detailed plan for achieving the goal of establishing \n     civil, economic, and political security in Iraq, including \n     the restoration of basic services such as water and \n     electricity and the construction of schools, roads, and \n     medical clinics;\n       (4) the monetary costs currently incurred and projected to \n     be incurred by the United States, the United Nations, Iraq, \n     and the international community;\n       (5) the actions taken and to be taken by the President to \n     secure increased international participation in peacekeeping \n     efforts and in the economic and political reconstruction of \n     Iraq;\n       (6) a detailed schedule and specific steps for achieving \n     the goal of restoring self-government to the Iraqi people; \n     and\n       (7) United States and international military and civilian \n     personnel requirements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1595. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nsmall business employers a credit against income tax with respect to \nemployees who participate in the military reserve components and are \ncalled to active duty and with respect to replacement employees and to \nallow a comparable credit for activated military reservists who are \nself-employed individuals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the continuing activation of military \nreservists to serve in Iraq and the war on terror has imposed a \ntremendous burden on many of our country's small businesses. Too many \nsmall businesses, when their employees are asked to leave their jobs \nand serve the Nation, are unable to continue operating successfully and \nface severe financial difficulties, even bankruptcy. At the same time, \nmore than one-third of military reservists and National Guard members \nsuffer a pay cut when they're called to defend our Nation. Large \nbusinesses have the resources to provide supplemental income to \nreservist employees called up for active duty and to replace them with \na temporary employee. However, many small businesses are unable to \nprovide this assistance or temporarily replace the employee. I believe \nthe Federal Government must take action to help small businesses \nweather the loss of an employee to active duty and protect small \nbusiness employees and their families from suffering a pay cut to serve \nour Nation. That is why I am introducing legislation that will provide \nan immediate tax credit to assist both military reservists who are \ncalled to active duty and the small businesses who must endure their \nabsence.\n  The Small Business Military Reservist Tax Credit Act that I am \nintroducing today will provide immediate help to affected small \nbusinesses through a Federal income tax credit and a reduced \nwithholding requirement to help pay the difference in salary for a \nreservist called up to active duty and the cost of temporarily \nreplacing that employee while he or she is serving our Nation. \nSpecifically, the bill will provide a tax credit of up to $12,000 to \nany very small business, defined as any business with up to 50 \nemployees, whose employee has been called up for active duty. Up to \n$6,000 can be used to assist in paying any difference in salary for the \nactivated reservist and up to an additional $6,000 can be used to help \nhire a temporary replacement. For small manufacturers with up to 100 \nemployees, the bill will provide a tax credit of up to $20,000, up to \n$10,000 to hire a temporary replacement. This tax credit is critical to \nimmediately help struggling entrepreneurs keep their small businesses \nrunning after the loss of an employee to temporary military service. \nToo many American small manufacturers are already facing a difficult \neconomy and strong international competition. This legislation provides \nhigher thresholds for small manufacturers because they need greater \nhelp and employ more technical workers who are more expensive and \ndifficult to replace. It will also help cushion the financial cost of \nbeing a citizen soldier for our reservists. I am pleased that this \nlegislation is supported by the Reserve Officers Association.\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\n  Since 1973, the United States has built an all-volunteer military of \nwhich reservists are an essential part. Our reservists are much more \nthan weekend warriors. When they are called to active duty, they are a \ncritical ingredient of any long-term or significant deployment of \nAmerican forces. Everyone knows the contributions our reservists have \nmade in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard. They have \nbeen serving our country with distinction and pride for many years and \nshould not be penalized financially for their honorable service. The \nuse of reservists is a significant way to reduce the costs of \nmaintaining a standing army and the cost of carrying a full standing \narmy, in lieu of having a critical reservist component, far outweighs \nthe small, targeted tax credit developed in this legislation.\n  Reservists have become a vital component of U.S. forces in Iraq and \nthe war on terror. On September 14, 2001, President Bush issued \nExecutive Order 13223 authorizing the activation of up to 1 million \nmilitary reservists for up to two years of active duty. Since October \n2002, there has been a presidentially approved ceiling of 300,000 on \nthe number of reservists that can be on duty at any one time. Some \n295,000 reserves have been called up cumulatively since the issuance of \nthe original Executive Order. Today, there are about 181,500 reserves \non active duty in the war against terrorism.\n\n  Just today, the Army announced that thousands of National Guard and \nArmy Reserve forces will be required to extend their tours of duty. The \nnew order requiring 12-month tours in Iraq and elsewhere means that \nmany National Guard and Army Reserve troops could have their \nmobilizations extended anywhere from 1 month to 6 months. Extending \ntours of duty will make it more difficult for reservists, their \nfamilies and the small businesses where they work to endure the \nhardships associated with serving our nation. It is imperative that we \nprovide them with immediate assistance.\n  A recent story in the Financial Times demonstrates the heavy price \nthat some small businesses are forced to pay when one of their \nemployees is called up for active duty. Lt. Col. Stephen Brozak, a \nMarine reservist and small business partner, was called up for active \nduty in November 2002. In addition to being a partner in the small \nfinancial services firm, Westfield Bakerink Brozak, Stephen is the only \nresearch analyst in the San Diego-based company. Since Stephen left to \nserve our country, the company has been unable to continue working on \nthe investment banking issues he covered. This has dramatically \naffected the company's profitability and bottom line. To compound the \nproblem, this small businesses is unable to provide Stephen a salary \nwhile he is on active duty and cannot afford to hire a replacement. \nSmall businesses, like Stephen's, should not be crippled or \nincapacitated when their workers are called to serve our Nation. Our \nreservist solders who are called away from their jobs to serve our \ncountry should not have to endanger their family's finances to do so.\n  The United States Chamber of Commerce estimates that 70 percent of \nmilitary reservists called to active duty work in small- or medium-size \ncompanies. Everyone knows that small businesses continue to be a most \neffective at creating new jobs and spurring economic growth nationwide. \nSmall businesses employ over 50 percent of the nation's work force. \nNationwide, small businesses are currently creating 75 percent of new \njobs. Furthermore, many these small businesses provide quality goods \nand services that are a vital link in the supply chain for our national \ndefense. Many these small companies need immediate help to keep their \nbusiness going while their employees are sacrificing for our country in \nIraq and elsewhere.\n  Many of our reservists left their companies in good shape. They were \nprofitable, providing goods or services, creating jobs, adding to the \ntax base. Our nation should do everything possible to ensure that upon \ntheir return, reservists and their businesses to do suffer unnecessary \nhardships that ranges from impaired operations financial ruin; from \ndeserted clients to layoffs, and even closure.\n  Beyond the hardship of leaving their families, their homes and their \nregular employment, more than one-third of military reservists and \nNational Guard members face a pay cut when they're called for active \nduty in our armed forces. Many of these reservists have families who \ndepend upon that paycheck to survive and can least afford a substantial \nreduction in pay. Unlike many big businesses that can afford to provide \nsupplemental income to make up for the salary disparity for military \nreservists called to active duty, most small businesses cannot afford \nto provide this benefit. This makes it more difficult for small \nbusinesses to attract and keep workers. I think it is imperative that \nwe help families of reservists maintain their standard of living while \ntheir loved one serves our nation. We must ensure that our great \ntradition of citizen soldiers does not fade or stop because of the \neffect service has on work and family.\n  Back in 1999, I wrote the Military Reservist Small Business Relief \nAct, which was enacted into law during the 106th Congress and \nauthorized the Small Business Administration (SBA) to defer existing \nloan repayments and to reduce the interest rates on direct loans that \nmay be outstanding, including disaster loans, for small businesses that \nhave had a military reservist called up for active duty. It also \nestablished a low-interest economic injury loan program administered by \nthe SBA through its disaster loan program. These loans have been \navailable to provide interim operating capital to any small business \nwhen the departure of a military reservist for active duty causes \neconomic injury. According to published reports, more than 10,000 small \nbusinesses have applied for these loans since August 2001. However, in \ntoday's economy, many small businesses are unable to take on additional \ndebt to continue their operations. These small businesses need \nimmediate tax relief to assist them in hiring a replacement and to pay \ntheir reservist worker who is away serving our country.\n  This bill will help every small business whose owner, manager or \nemployee is called to active duty. Most immediately, this bill will \nassist those small businesses whose employees are in service in Iraq \nand elsewhere but the act also applies to future contingency \noperations, military conflicts, or national emergencies.\n  I ask all my colleagues to support this important legislation to help \nboth military reservists and the small businesses they are forced to \nleave when they are called up for active duty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Dole, \n        Mr. Hollings, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Chambliss, and \n        Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1597. A bill to provide mortgage payment assistance for employees \nwho are separated from employment; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homestead \nPreservation Act which would make available low-interest loans to \nAmerican workers who have been displaced by international trade so they \ncan continue to make home mortgage payments. This legislation would \nprovide needed mortgage payment assistance to these Americans facing \ndifficult times.\n  While the relaxation of trade barriers and free trade agreements have \nopened some new markets to American products and services, it has also \nled to a decline in the U.S. manufacturing and textile industries. \nThese are the jobs that hard working Americans have depended on for \ngenerations and plants and facilities that have helped to sustain \ncommunities for decades.\n  Americans are industrious, hard-working and innovative, but it is \nunfair to ask them to compete for employment with workforces that do \nnot operate under comparable environmental or labor regulations and in \ncountries that do not reciprocate and violate trade rules. I want to \nmake sure that free trade is at the same time fair trade. The opening \nof the U.S. market offers great benefit to all Americans, but we should \nmitigate harm to people making a living in manufacturing or textiles. \nThe People's Republic of China through their currency manipulations, \ndumping of wood bedroom furniture, textile commands and illegal\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\nsemiconductor taxation violate rules of fair trade. One can also look \nto the recent decision by the Department of Commerce finding that South \nKorean subsidies provided to Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. have caused \ngreat damage to U.S. computer chip manufacturers. As our government \ncontinues to follow international trade rules, we owe it to our workers \nto hold foreign governments accountable for their violations of these \nagreements.\n  Going forward, I pledge to take a hard look at all proposed free \ntrade agreements to make sure the interests of the United States are \nnot being compromised. It is essential in the negotiation of these new \ntrade pacts not to place traditional U.S. industries at a distinct \ndisadvantage. Free trade agreements have the opportunity to greatly \nenhance the economies of the U.S. and its partners, but they must offer \ngenerally equal benefits to people in both countries.\n  Unfortunately, recent years have seen the closing of numerous textile \nand manufacturing plants in the Commonwealth of Virginia and many can \nbe attributed to international competition. These economic disasters \nare not unique to my Virginia alone. People in communities in our \nsister States of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia have \nexperienced such disasters as well. People from Maine to Ohio to \nCalifornia understand and have endured these large layoffs. With each \nof these closings, a community is thrown into turmoil with families \nleft wondering how ends can be met until new employment is found.\n  I understand no government program or assistance can substitute for a \nsecure, well-paying job, but I believe the U.S. government can \nreasonably assist these families as they transition from one career to \nanother. Presently, there are useful assistance programs that aid \nAmerican workers seeking new employment, but unfortunately, there is \nnothing currently in place to protect what is usually a family's most \nvaluable financed asset--their home.\n  The Homestead Preservation Act has been introduced to meet that need. \nMy legislation would provide families vital temporary financial \nassistance enabling them to keep their homes and protect their credit \nratings as they work toward strengthening and upgrading their skills \nand search for new employment. Individuals seeking to take advantage of \nthis program would need to be enrolled in a job training or job \nassistance program. Training and education programs that focus on new \ntechnology and emerging industries would aid displaced workers in \ngaining a skill that will allow them to find a good-paying and secure \njob in a new field.\n  At a time when families are dealing with an uncertain future they \nshould feel secure that food will be on the table and a roof will be \nover their heads. The loans to be provided by the Homestead \nPreservation Act would not solve all of the problems facing unemployed \nworkers, but they would provide important assistance for families \nfacing the prospect of losing their home.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues Senators Warner, \nEdwards, Dole, Hollings, Graham, Chambliss and Snowe for joining me in \nintroducing this legislation. They know and understand the hardship \nfacing these families and I am grateful that they have signed on to \nhelp provide this needed assistance. When offered in the 107th \nCongress, this Homestead Preservation Act received tremendous \nbipartisan support. I would respectfully urge my colleagues to consider \nthe value Americans place on owning a home and support this caring and \nneeded initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Comptroller General to carry out a \nstudy to determine the feasibility of undertaking passenger rail \ntransportation security programs that are similar to those of foreign \ncountries; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, since the terrorist attacks of September \n11th, 2001, we have experienced a steep learning curve as a country and \nas a Congress in our efforts to improve homeland security.\n  As we saw during the drafting and consideration of the airline \nsecurity bill, the United States has not cornered the market on \nsecurity innovations and measures--there is much that we can learn from \nother countries that have faced or addressed the same challenges. For \nthis reason, I am introducing legislation that would require the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to initiate a study examining passenger \nrail security measures that have worked for other regions and countries \nsuch as the European Union and Japan.\n  For example, the $15 billion channel tunnel--or ``Chunnel''--linking \nEngland to the European continent has been open to train service, for \npassengers and freight, since 1994 without a major security incident. \nIn 2000 alone, 2.8 million cars, 7.1 million passengers, and 2.9 \nmillion tons of freight made the 31 mile journey under the English \nChannel safely.\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\n  Security has always been a major concern for the Chunnel and Britain, \nFrance, and Eurotunnel, the company operating the tunnel, have made \nsecurity a top priority without degrading passenger service. In fact, \nin addition to its private security staff provided by Eurotunnel, the \nChunnel is policed by a bi-national force of police, immigration, and \ncustoms officers with armed patrols in the British and French \nterminals. And both the company and the respective government agencies \nalso conduct routine intelligence-led security checks on both passenger \nand freight vehicles.\n  So I suspect that our friends in Europe, and in Asia, and other \nregions, may be able to provide valuable insight on how we can improve \nour rail transportation security. It is my intent with this bill to \ndirect GAO to complete, no later than June 2004, a study of rail \ntransport security measures in other countries in an effort to seek \ninnovative screening procedures and processes and other security \nmeasures that may be a benefit to the United States. Subsequently, an \nassessment of these measures would be provided to Congress.\n  In the hours and days after September 11, Americans discovered we are \nnot alone in this struggle and I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill that encourages the United States to reach out and learn from \nothers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1599. A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nconduct a study of the feasibility of implementing a program for the \nfull screening of passengers, baggage, and cargo on Amtrak trains, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to enhance the security of our Nation's passenger rail \nnetwork.\n  Before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, boarding an \nAmtrak train was little harder than riding the subway--and in some ways \nit was easier, because you could purchase a ticket on board the train. \nThose days have passed, as Amtrak now requires photo identification and \nno longer permits ticket purchases on-board the train. But there has \nnot been a similar change in the screening of baggage. The bill I am \nintroducing today would create a new pilot initiative to screen \npassengers and carry-on baggage on the Amtrak passenger rail system. In \naddition, my legislation will examine ways to provide this screening, \nproviding a proportional response that will reassure train passengers \nand step-up security.\n  As a member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation, I believe that by conducting a limited test of security \nscreening of passengers and carry-on baggage on certain Amtrak routes, \nwe can determine the feasibility of expanding screening to other Amtrak \nstations. Moreover, by starting with a cross-section of stations \nthroughout the network, we can gain perspective on the expense, the \ninfrastructure, and the personnel who might be needed to bring \nscreening system-wide.\n  This legislation will direct the Department of Transportation to \ninitiate a demonstration project at five of the ten stations with the \nheaviest passenger traffic. Amtrak would be required to conduct random \npassenger and carry-on baggage checks or screening at these stations. \nUnder the legislation, the Secretary of Transportation would be given \nauthority to select additional stations in order to determine how \nscreening works at smaller facilities. The bill envisions examination \nof a variety of X-ray and explosive detection devices, and metal \ndetectors that would help assure safety on Amtrak.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support for this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1600. A bill to provide for periodic Indian needs assessments, to \nrequire Federal Indian program evaluations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye to introduce the Indian Needs Assessment and Program \nEvaluation Act of 2003.\n  Recently, a significant report has been issued that, once again, \ncalls into question the equity and effectiveness of Federal spending on \nIndian programs.\n  This is not a new problem and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission's \nreport entitled ``A Quiet Crisis: Federal Funding and Unmet Needs in \nIndian Country'' shows that the volume and methodologies of Federal \nspending are still both off the mark.\n  The Commission's report found an ongoing failure to provide funds for \nthe health, education and safety of Indian communities at levels \nequivalent to other U.S. populations and determined that, despite many \nstudies, ``no coordinated, comprehensive Federal effort has been made \nto audit spending and develop viable solutions.''\n  The Commission's Report recommended each of the six agencies \nprimarily responsible for delivery of Federal services to Indians to: \n(1) conduct internal monitoring of its spending and budgeting for \nIndian programs; (2) ensure better coordination with other agencies; \nand (3) monitor unmet needs. It also urged Congress to appropriate \nfunds to meet the unmet needs of Indian people and urged the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB) to create uniform standards for tracking \nand spending on Indian programs.\n  The bill I am introducing today will address these ongoing problems \nand bring a rigorous analysis to the actual needs of Indian people, \ngauge how Indian programs are funded, and better tailor these programs \nso that needs are met and programs are carried out in an effective and \nefficient way.\n\n  The bill: 1. directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a \nuniform method, criteria, and procedures for determining, analyzing, \nand compiling the program and service assistance needs of Indian tribes \nand Indians nationwide; 2. requires Federal agencies to conduct Indian \nNeeds Assessments aimed at determining the actual needs of tribes and \nIndians eligible for programs and services administered by such \nagencies; 3. directs the Secretary to develop a uniform method, \ncriteria, and procedures for compiling, maintaining, keeping current, \nand reporting to Congress all information concerning: (a) agency annual \nexpenditures for programs and services for which Indians are eligible/ \n(b) services or programs specifically for the benefit of Indians; and \n(c) agency methods of delivery of services and funding; 4. requires \nFederal agencies responsible for providing services or programs to or \nfor the benefit of tribes of Indians to: (a) file Annual Indian Program \nEvaluations with specified congressional committees; and (b) publish \nannual listings in the Federal Register of all agency programs and \nservices for which Indian tribes may be eligible; 5. directs the \nSecretary to: (a) report to specified congressional committees on the \ncoordination of Federal program and service assistance for which tribes \nare eligible; and (b) file a Strategic Plan for the Coordination of \nFederal Assistance for Indians.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1600\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Needs Assessment and \n     Program Evaluation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States and the Indian tribes have a unique \n     legal and political government-to-government relationship;\n       (2) under the Constitution, treaties, statutes, Executive \n     orders, court decisions, and course of conduct of the United \n     States, the United States has a trust obligation to provide \n     certain services to Indian tribes and members of Indian \n     tribes;\n       (3) Federal agencies charged with administering programs \n     and providing services to or for the benefit of Indian tribes \n     and members of Indian tribes have not provided Congress \n     adequate information necessary to assess the adequacy of the \n     programs and services meeting the needs of Indian tribes and \n     members of Indian tribes, hampering the ability of Congress \n     to determine the nature, type, and magnitude of those needs \n     or the ability of the United States to respond to those \n     needs; and\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\n       (4) Congress cannot properly fulfill its obligation to \n     Indian tribes and Indian people unless it has an adequate \n     store of information concerning the needs of Indian tribes \n     and members of Indian tribes nationwide.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that Indian needs for Federal programs and \n     services are known in a more certain and predictable fashion;\n       (2) to require that Federal agencies carefully review and \n     monitor the effectiveness of programs and services provided \n     to Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes;\n       (3) to provide for more efficient and effective cooperation \n     and coordination of, and accountability from, the agencies \n     providing programs and services, including technical and \n     business development assistance, to Indian tribes and members \n     of Indian tribes; and\n       (4) to provide to Congress reliable information regarding \n     both Indian needs and the evaluation of Federal programs and \n     services provided to Indian tribes and members of Indian \n     tribes nationwide.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Indian Child Protection and Family \nViolence Prevention Act to provide for the reporting and reduction of \nchild abuse and family violence incidences on Indian reservations, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye to introduce the ``Indian Child Protection and Family \nViolence Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2003'' to combat child abuse \nin Native American communities.\n  First enacted in 1990, the Indian Child Protection and Family \nViolence Prevention Act was aimed at prosecutions of Federal and tribal \nemployees for child abuse and issues arising from child abuse and \nfamily violence.\n  The act established extensive reporting requirements and character \ninvestigations for Federal and tribal employees who have regular \ncontact with Indian children, and provided funding for prevention and \ntreatment programs.\n  Like so many social pathologies, American Indians are victimized by \nviolence more than any other ethnic group.\n  Research also shows that Indian victims of violence by family members \nor intimate partners are more likely than any other ethnic group to be \ninjured and need hospital care.\n  The act is expiring and needs to be reauthorized, but it also needs \nto include tougher criteria for background checks and a structured \nmethod for tribal assumption of child abuse prevention, prosecution and \ntreatment programs.\n  The bill is designed to improve the ability of the tribes to combat \nchild abuse in their communities, build tribal capacity, and identify \nthe impediments to more effective prevention, investigation and \nprosecution of child abuse.\n  The bill also authorizes funding for building comprehensive tribal \nprograms, and training and technical assistance--the cornerstones in \ndeveloping the necessary expertise in the field. The bill will also \nfacilitate establishment of safety measures for child\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\nprotection workers to reduce unnecessary stress and improve program \neffectiveness.\n  In its 2002 report entitled ``Violence Against Women: Data on \nPregnant Victims and Effectiveness of Prevention Strategies are \nLimited'', the General Accounting Office cited the Centers for Disease \nControl and other researchers who found that there was a need for \nprevention strategies that incorporate cultural perspectives in serving \nethnic populations. This bill will promote cultural perspectives by \ngiving special considerations to tribal programs which incorporate \ntraditional healing methods.\n  Abuse by the Federal and tribal employees was the main reason for \nenacting the 1990 Act, however, employees are not the only ones that \ncome in contact with Indian children. The bill I am introducing today \nwill expand the scope of positions subject to character investigations \nand include contractors who have regular contact with Indian children.\n  This bill clarifies the requirement that all positions within the \nDepartments of Interior and HHS--not simply the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and Indian Health Service--that have regular contact with \nchildren must undergo character investigations.\n  I ask Unanimous Consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nmeasure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1601\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund \nof 2001 to extend the deadline for filing a claim to December 31, 2004; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``September \n11 Victim Compensation Fund Extension Act of 2003'' to extend the \npending deadline of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund to \nDecember 31, 2004. I thank Senators Durbin, Schumer, Dodd, Lieberman, \nClinton, Corzine, and Lautenberg for joining me as original cosponsors \nof this legislation.\n  Along with Senator Daschle, Representative Gephardt and others, I \nworked hard to create the Victims Fund over the objections of some in \nthe administration and Congress. We insisted that it be included in the \nlegislation to bail out the airlines passed in the wake of the most \ndevastating terrorist attacks on American soil. The current deadline \nfor applying for compensation from the Victims Fund is rapidly \napproaching, but it has become apparent that many families need more \ntime. Thus far, just under a third of eligible families have applied to \nthe Fund for compensation--only about 1,282 death claims and 1,050 \ninjury claims have been filed so far by victim families, according to \nthe Department of Justice.\n  Ken Feinberg, the Special Master for the Fund, is doing his best to \nget victims families to understand their rights. Recently, he has even \ntaken out extensive advertisements in a number of newspapers and \ncreated a series of informational meetings and claim assistance sites \nto assist victims' families to file for compensation with the Victims \nFund instead of filing a lawsuit against the airlines industry. I \ncommend him for his efforts.\n  It appears that only a few relatives of victims of September 11 are \nopting out of eligibility for the fund by filing a lawsuit against the \nairlines industry. While some families are likely weighing that \ndecision, the number of disqualifying lawsuits is low--69 as of last \nmonth--and only three of those were in the last three months, according \nto The New York Times.\n  Instead, victims support groups have told me that they receive calls \ndaily from individuals who understand that the deadline is approaching \nbut cannot face the emotional pain of preparing a claim. Mr. Feinberg \nhas also commented that many victims are still too paralyzed by their \ngrief to confront the logistical burden and emotional pain of filing a \ndeath claim.\n  In light of this painful reality, I believe it is appropriate to \nextend the deadline for filing applications to the Victims Fund to \nDecember 31, 2004--an extension of just over a year. This extension \nwould give grieving families additional time to mourn those who were \nlost and to overcome the emotional challenges of filing paperwork with \nthe Victims Fund. In recent days, I have been in contact with several \nSeptember 11 victims support groups, all of which agreed that such an \nextension would provide some relief during these dark days for victims' \nfamilies as they endure the grieving process.\n  As the anniversary of the tragedy of September 11 approaches, \nvictims' families have many burdens. They do not need this arbitrary \ndeadline confronting them between September 11 and the year-end \nholidays. This is something we can do now for victims of September 11. \nI urge my colleagues to support the ``September 11 Victim Compensation \nFund Extension Act of 2003.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11255-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 219--TO ENCOURAGE THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO \n   ESTABLISH A MARKET-BASED VALUATION OF THE YUAN AND TO FULFILL ITS \n            COMMITMENTS UNDER INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nVoinovich, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Allen, Mr. Specter, Mr. \nEnzi, and Mr. Kyl) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, at nine minutes after the hour of nine \nin communities across Alaska and around the world, people are pausing \ntoday to observe International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Awareness \nDay. International FAS Awareness Day was first observed on September 9, \n1999. It began with a small group of parents of children afflicted with \nFAS and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE) who came together on the Internet to \nask this compelling question, ``What if a world full of FAS and FAE \nparents all got together on the ninth hour of the ninth day of the \nninth month of the year and asked the world to remember that during the \nnine months of pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol?''\n  These pioneering activists, most of whom were adoptive and foster \nparents, led by Brian Philcox and Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, did \nnot have the resources of large public relations firms or well \nconnected lobbyists. They organized the first International FAS \nAwareness Day on a shoestring using the Internet. Rapidly their group \ngrew to include more than 70 volunteer coordinators in eight countries. \nThrough this grassroots awareness effort, many women of childbearing \nage learned for the first time that no amount of alcohol in pregnancy \nis good.\n  Each year their simple message travels further. On this fifth \nInternational FAS Awareness Day, we know that the message is getting \nacross. Numerous observances are planned in my home State of Alaska. In \nNome, a birthday cake celebration will honor all babies who will be \nborn in the region in the coming year. In Kenai the American Legion \nwill sponsor a breakfast and the ringing of bells at 9:09 AM. The \nMayors of Anchorage, Haines and Wasilla, to name a few, have issued \nlocal proclamations.\n  The Commissioner of our Alaska Department of Health and Social \nServices, Joel Gilbertson, and the staff of his Division of Behavioral \nHealth, are to be commended for their diligent efforts in bringing \nInternational FAS Awareness Day to Alaska. An excellent resource manual \nto help communities plan their observances, is accessible through the \nInternet page of the State of Alaska, Department of Health and Social \nServices. I would also like to thank the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration of the US Department of Health and Human \nServices, which is publicizing International FAS Awareness Day on their \nwebsite.\n  Yet, in spite of all of the hard work of dedicated volunteers over \nthe last several years to publicize International FAS Awareness Day, I \nwas surprised to learn that legislation has not been introduced in the \nCongress to ask that the President designate September 9 of each year \nas National FAS Awareness Day across the United States. The resolution \nthat I am introducing today would do just that.\n  The resolution, like the day itself, is intended to focus attention \non the high cost of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders to our Nation and \nthe ease of prevention. At the same time it asks that the American \npeople treat those afflicted with these disorders with compassion and \nsupport. FAS is the largest cause of mental retardation in Alaska, the \nUnited States and all of western civilization and it is one hundred \npercent preventable. The simple fact is that no amount of alcohol \nduring pregnancy has been established as safe for the fetus. If women \ndo not drink alcohol--any alcohol--during the nine months of pregnancy; \nalcohol-related birth defects will be eliminated.\n  It is high time that we recognize the efforts of the dedicated \nvolunteers who conceived and developed International FAS Awareness Day \nwith a national\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\nobservance in the United States. On the first International FAS \nAwareness Day in 1999, Bonnie Buxton put forth this question to those \nwho care for FAS and FAE children, ``What if we made a noise? Would the \nrest of the world listen?''

Mr. President, I am proud today to join my colleague \nfrom Maryland and others in the Senate in submitting a Senate \nResolution recognizing the accomplishments and importance of our \nNation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. This resolution \nis a companion to a resolution my colleague from Maryland in the House \nof Representatives and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus--Elijah \nCummings--introduced earlier this year.\n  There was a time in our history when African Americans had few \nchoices to further their education other than Historically Black \nColleges and Universities. Legal and historical segregation closed the \ndoors of many colleges and universities, leaving them few options. \nFortunately, Historically Black Colleges and Universities filled the \nvoid magnificently. They may be small in number compared to other \nuniversities, but their impact is impressive. In the 1950s, \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities produced more than ninety \npercent of Black professionals. It is difficult to imagine where this \ncountry would be without the service and dedication of the professors, \nadministrators and supporters of our Nation's Historically Black \nColleges and Universities.\n  For example, Thurgood Marshall, denied admission at a segregated \nUniversity of Maryland School of Law, went on to obtain his law degree \nat Howard University. He later was appointed to the United States \nSupreme Court and was on the bench when the Court decided Brown v. \nBoard of Education, the landmark decision that once and for all held \nthat separate learning facilities for school children are \nunconstitutional. The University of Maryland--now a very different, a \nmore just and diverse place, much like the United States--acknowledged \nthe historical error of its ways and welcomes all students. In fact, it \nhas named its law library after Justice Marshall. We may have missed \nthe benefits of Justice Marshall's brilliant contributions to the legal \nprofession had Howard University not been there to accept, nurture and \nsuperbly educate African American legal scholars of his era. It is \nimpossible to calculate how many doctors, Members of Congress, \nattorneys and engineers might not have completed their educations if \nthese institutions had not been there to serve them.\n  Historically Black Colleges and Universities continue to demonstrate \ntheir value as thousands of students who have the opportunity to attend \nany school choose to enroll in these unique institutions. Maryland is \nfortunate to have four of these institutions: Bowie State University, \nCoppin State University, Morgan State University, and the University of \nMaryland, Eastern Shore. According to the National Association for \nEqual Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), 103 Historically Black \nColleges and Universities enroll more than 370,000 students and \ngraduate approximately one-third of all Black students each year. NAFEO \nnotes that students who attend Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities graduate with greater frequency than African American \nstudents at predominantly white institutions and receive greater \nacademic and social support.\n  As many universities face the challenges of State budget constraints, \ndisappearing corporate donations, and reduced endowments, Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities are hit especially hard. Many of them \nmake it their goal to educate low-income students, making their student \nbodies even more reliant on financial aid. As our Historically Black \nColleges and Universities face struggles, the Federal Government, State \ngovernments, alumni and friends must make sure they continue to thrive. \nWe must guarantee that future generations will continue to benefit from \nthe academic and cultural richness Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities provide. Let this resolution symbolize Congress' \ncommitment to continuing the mission of Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities and ensuring their future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11256-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11256-S11257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 66--COMMENDING THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR \n DEMOCRACY FOR ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE \n WORLD ON THE OCCASION OF THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF \n                  THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Frist, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Graham of \nFlorida, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Hagel) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Res. 210, as \nfollows:\n\n       Whereas the quality of workers' jobs and the supportiveness \n     of their workplaces are key predictors of job productivity, \n     job satisfaction, commitment to employers, and retention;\n       Whereas there is a clear link between work-family policies \n     and lower absenteeism;\n       Whereas the more overworked employees feel, the more likely \n     they are to report making mistakes, feel anger and resentment \n     toward employers and coworkers, and look for a new job;\n       Whereas employees who feel overworked tend to feel less \n     successful in their relationships with their spouses, \n     children, and friends, and tend to neglect themselves, feel \n     less healthy, and feel more stress;\n       Whereas 85 percent of U.S. wage and salaried workers have \n     immediate, day-to-day family responsibilities off the job;\n       Whereas 46 percent of wage and salaried workers are parents \n     with children under the age of 18 who live with them at least \n     half-time;\n       Whereas job flexibility allows parents to be more involved \n     in their children's lives, and parental involvement is \n     associated with children's higher achievement in language and \n     mathematics, improved behavior, greater academic persistence, \n     and lower dropout rates;\n       Whereas a lack of job flexibility for working parents \n     negatively affects children's health in ways that range from \n     children being unable to make needed doctors' appointments, \n     to children receiving inadequate early care, leading to more \n     severe and prolonged illness;\n       Whereas nearly one out of every four Americans--over 45 \n     million Americans--provided or arranged care for a family \n     member or friend in the past year;\n       Whereas nearly all working adults are concerned about \n     spending more time with their immediate family; and\n       Whereas as an increasing number of baby boomers reach \n     retirement age in record numbers, more and more Americans are \n     faced with the challenge of caring for older parents: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) reducing the conflict between work and family life \n     should be a national priority; and\n       (B) the month of October of 2003 should be designated as \n     ``National Work and Family Month''; and\n       (2) the Senate requests that the President issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe ``National Work and Family Month'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/09/senate-section/article/S11260-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2003\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Following those votes, the \nSenate will continue to work on the bill. The majority leader has \nstated his intention to complete the bill tomorrow. There are a number \nof pending amendments. The chairman and ranking member will be here \nthroughout the day to work through the amendments. Senators can expect \nrollcall votes.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield for a brief statement, all Senators \nshould recognize that we will have no more rollcall votes if we finish \nthis bill tomorrow night. That would work well because of September 11. \nThings have already been scheduled. We have eight Senators who will be \ngone a good part of that day because of their States having been so \nbadly affected by the events of 9/11.\n  I say to all Senators, if we finish tomorrow, no matter what time, \nthere will be no more votes for the remainder of this week, and we will \ndo other legislative business.

Mr. President, I thank the assistant Democratic leader. \nI think it has been a productive day--starting at 5 o'clock. I am happy \nto have had the votes. It breaks the logjam. We had quite a number of \namendments offered this evening. I think the stage has been set to move \nwith dispatch tomorrow.\n  The assistant Democratic leader has made the suggestion about early \nvotes, which I think is a good idea. Very little remains on both sides. \nThere is always great temptation to proceed with alacrity once the \nlight at the end of the tunnel signifies no additional votes, at which \npoint the railways and airlines become congested with 100 passengers. \nSo we now have that incentive to move ahead with dispatch tomorrow to \ncomplete the bill.
