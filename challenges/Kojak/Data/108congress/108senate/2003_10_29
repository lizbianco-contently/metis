Mr. President, today there will be a period of morning \nbusiness until 10 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Foreign Operations appropriations measure. \nUnder the order from last night, Senator Dorgan will be recognized to \noffer an amendment relating to 9/11 in which there will be 40 minutes \nof debate. The procedural vote with respect to the Dorgan amendment is \ntherefore expected at approximately 10:45 this morning.\n  Following that vote, we will begin consideration of the Healthy \nForests bill. Senator Cochran had hoped, and we tried on several \noccasions, to reach an understanding that the bill will be open for \nrelevant amendments. We were unable to reach a formal agreement for \nthat, but I do hope we will debate amendments that are related to \nHealthy Forests and the Healthy Forests initiative. We all recognize \nthe tragedy and the suffering and misery that surrounds the wildfires \ncurrently raging in California. I do think it would be unfortunate and \nirresponsible in many ways for this to be delayed or not to stay on the \nissues related to the underlying bill. We will have votes throughout \ntoday as we make progress on that bill. There is a clear urgency to \nfinish that bill this week.\n  We will be looking also to execute the order with respect to the \nclimate change bill. That agreement from July 31 allowed for 6 hours of \ndebate. I will be working with principals on both sides of this bill in \nan effort to begin that debate during today's session.\n  There are a number of other issues that we are currently working on, \nincluding the Internet tax, which has an expiration date surrounding \nthe issue this Friday night. We continue to talk to the interested \nparties to bring that to some conclusion before Friday. We have the \nissue of gun liability. We are discussing on both sides of the aisle as \nto when we might address that--not this week but possibly the following \nweek.\n  On nominations, a cloture motion had been filed on the nomination of \nCharles Pickering to be a United States circuit judge for the Fifth \nCircuit. That vote will occur on Thursday. Again, we will be working in \ngood faith to finish these measures. I thank everyone for their \nattention and cooperation in these matters. We do want to finish in a \ntimely fashion and be able to leave for the recess period. There is a \nlot to accomplish. I think we are on track to do just that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the leader yield for a quick question about the \nschedule?\n  I thank you for your comments about the tragedy in California. I was \nwondering whether it would be possible, when we take up the Healthy \nForests bill, to complete work on that without interruption simply \nbecause it would send a signal of hope in terms of how we are going to \ndeal with the communities close to forests. It is a very important \npiece of legislation.\n  Would that be possible? Could I get the Senator's commitment on that?\n  Mr. FRIST. We will certainly consider that and work very hard.\n  As my colleagues know, we are adjusting the schedule and interrupting \nthe appropriations bills quite appropriately to address this issue, \nwhich reflects the joint priority in responding in large part to the \nimmediacy of that response to the fires that are underway.\n\n  As I mentioned, the main obligation on both sides of the aisle is to \naddress the issue of the climate change bill and the agreement from \nJuly 31. My intention is to stay on Healthy Forests and work \naggressively. But we have to ask for cooperation on both sides of the \naisle.\n  I would like to finish Healthy Forests as soon as possible, \nabsolutely finish it this week. It will take focus to stay on that bill \nand on relevant amendments as we have been requesting.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could make----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator address the Chair, \nplease.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Through the Chair, I would like to address another \nquestion to the leader.\n\n[[Page S13424]]\n\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I just wanted to say that as far as I am concerned we will work with \nyou to ask Senators on our side if we could have time agreements on \namendments on Healthy Forests. We need to give a message of hope to \npeople that their communities will have more help than they had in the \npast.\n  I thank you very much for your expressions here in the hope we can \nwork together and get through that bill and move on to the global \nwarming bill which, of course, is very important in its own right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13424-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will comment briefly on the schedule. I \nthink that the majority leader has set exactly the right tone. We have \nto recognize the days for this session are numbered. We have a lot of \nwork to do. I agree with his prioritization in terms of his urgency in \nbringing up the forest health bill, given our circumstances now in \nCalifornia, particularly.\n  Senator Reid and I have had conversations with Members of our caucus \nand have expressed our strong desire to keep amendments to the forest \nhealth bill relevant. Now, ``relevant'' is loosely interpreted, but it \nis important they stay relevant. We can give the assurances to the \nmajority leader that we will maintain relevancy in that loosely \nstructured definition in order to complete the work on the bill. I am \nhopeful, as he is, if we cannot complete it today, or certainly \ncompleting it by tomorrow, recognizing that we may move to the climate \nbill tonight.\n  I also think it is critical we keep our emphasis on the \nappropriations process. We have a lot of work there to do and, frankly, \nI must say, through no fault of the majority leader, we are in a real \ndilemma right now with completion of the work on the foreign operations \nbill. We made such progress yesterday and everyone worked to try to \nbring it to closure. We have an AIDS amendment that deserves a vote. \nWith that vote we could go to final passage. There is no reason we \ncannot complete our work on that and move to Agriculture appropriations \nand all the remaining bills that are to be considered.\n  I hope all Senators will recognize, given the plethora of work we \nhave to do, we cannot afford to delay indefinitely appropriations \namendments. We will work on this side to try to expedite consideration \nof these bills. But it has to be a cooperative effort on both \nsides. Right now that is not the case.\n\n  So I thank the majority leader for outlining the schedule. We will \nwork with him to see if we can complete our work on time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just one final response.\n  As I think our colleagues can see, we are working together in trying \nto move the schedule forward. I, too, am committed to the \nappropriations process. On foreign operations, I think we ought to work \nover the next hour and see if we can resolve the differences on the \noutstanding amendments. Indeed, my objective is to complete that bill \nas soon as possible.\n  I will say, if we get to where we are really locked up, because \nHealthy Forests is important, the other issues are important, we are \ngoing to have to have some flexibility. But again, I think we ought to \nstart working right now to resolve the outstanding amendments on \nforeign operations and try to finish it by midday today.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the leader desire that we have 30 \nminutes of morning business now?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let's continue with the 30 minutes of \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13424-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I begin by thanking the Chaplain for his \nprayers for our brave fighting men and women in Iraq, as well as in \nAfghanistan, as well as for the first responders and law enforcement \npersonnel who are putting their lives on the line every day for us. In \nCalifornia, we pray for those who are fighting the fires. Certainly our \nhearts and sympathies go out to them.\n  I also note, Mr. President, as you well know, that we are working \nhard to complete the Iraqi supplemental, which will provide the support \nthat our troops need to be safe in Iraq, as well as the reconstruction \nmoney, which I hope we can pass quickly so we can bring the troops \nhome.\n  Having said that, let me share with you an experience I had this \nweekend. It came as a great surprise to hear on the news this weekend \nthat newspapers were reporting that the Intelligence Committee was \npreparing a report saying that the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee was trying to do something with a report that \nwas uncalled for and that would whitewash the administration, and \npurporting to outline material in that report.\n  That caught me by surprise, No. 1, because I am on the Intelligence \nCommittee. As reported by Chairman Roberts, we have not completed a \nreport. We have not started a report. We have worked very diligently \nwith our staff to interview a hundred witnesses from the intelligence \nagencies. They have reviewed tens and perhaps thousands of documents, \nand they are continuing to do so. As Chairman Roberts said, there will \nbe information sought from the Director of the CIA, Director George \nTenet. So whatever was leaked was not based on fact.\n  The second thing that bothered me is that what was supposedly a work \nin the classified confines of the Intelligence Committee had been \nsomehow shared with the press. Now, that is a problem. The President \nhas come down very strongly in saying that he absolutely abhors leakage \nof classified, sensitive material, as he should. We all should. He said \nhe will not tolerate it in the administration, in the White House, or \neven in Congress. But it appears to me that somehow in the Intelligence \nCommittee it is leaking like a sieve, and people are saying things that \nare not true.\n  So I would caution those who are listening, when you hear about \nsomething that is going on in the Intelligence Committee, perhaps you \nought to take it with a great big grain of salt.\n  Chairman Roberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller are conducting these \nhearings, and all Members of this body can come to Hart 219 and have \naccess to the material if they want to find out what we are working on. \nBut what you hear being discussed is not necessarily relevant to \nanything that is going on.\n  What is relevant, and what many people have cited--and I am afraid \nthey have not read--is the work of Dr. David Kay, the Interim Progress \nReport of the Iraqi Survey Group, the ISG. This is a declassified \nreport from this distinguished person who is heading the intelligence \ngathering in Iraq. He has been cited as saying: Well, we have found no \nweapons of mass destruction; therefore, there must not be any.\n  Well, I would say, by that same reasoning, we have not found Saddam \nHussein; so by that reasoning, maybe Saddam Hussein did not exist. But \nwe have seen in the tragedies that have occurred in recent days and \nweeks in the Sunni Triangle and in Iraq and elsewhere that the \nproteges, the adherents to Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, continue \nto carry on their war of terrorism. They are attacking our troops. They \nare attacking Iraqi civilians. They have attacked the U.N. They have \nattacked the Red Cross. They are very dangerous, and we know that the \nbattle on terrorism goes on. That is why we have to complete work on \nthe Iraqi supplemental appropriations.\n\n[[Page S13425]]\n\n  But what has David Kay found? Why hasn't he found any weapons of mass \ndestruction? I might note that it was only this summer, after we had \nbeen there several months, that we found a squadron of Russian-made MIG \nairplanes hidden in the desert. They were buried in the sand.\n  Well, weapons of mass destruction, chemical or biological weapons, \nwhich we know Saddam Hussein has had in the past and has used in the \npast, could be hidden in a two-car garage, and they could be hidden in \nmuch smaller samples.\n  There is speculation in the media that they could have been taken out \nof the country, which should really worry us. There is speculation \nelsewhere as to what may have happened.\n  But Dr. Kay said, talking about the extensive program of denial and \ndeception engaged in by Saddam Hussein's regime:\n\n       From birth all of Iraq's WMD activities were highly \n     compartmentalized within a regime that ruled and kept its \n     secrets through fear and terror and with deception and denial \n     built into each program;\n       Deliberate dispersal and destruction of material and \n     documentation related to weapons programs began pre-conflict \n     and ran trans-to-post conflict;\n\n  In other words, they were concealing, they were denying they had it \nbefore the war, during the war, and even after the war.\n\n       Post-OIF--\n\nIn other words, after Iraqi Freedom--\n\n     looting destroyed or dispersed important and easily \n     collectible material and forensic evidence concerning Iraq's \n     WMD program. As the report covers in detail, significant \n     elements of this looting were carried out in a systematic and \n     deliberate manner, with the clear aim of concealing pre-OIF \n     activities of Saddam's regime;\n       Some WMD personnel crossed borders in the pre/trans-\n     conflict period and may have taken evidence and even weapons-\n     related materials with them. . . .\n\n  In other words, what Dr. Kay is saying is, the people involved with \nSaddam Hussein, his loyal thugs, could have taken the material out of \nthe country. But he says what we have found and what we have discovered \nare:\n\n     dozens of WMD-related program activities and significant \n     amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United \n     Nations during the inspections that began in late 2000. The \n     discovery of these deliberate concealment efforts have come \n     about both through the admissions of Iraqi scientists and \n     officials concerning information they deliberately withheld \n     and through physical evidence of equipment and activities \n     that ISG has discovered that should have been declared to the \n     UN.\n\n  He then goes on to cite many of the things they have found and also \ndiscussions and reports on interviews he has had.\n  For those who wonder what has happened to Saddam Hussein's WMD \nprogram, the information already prepared and presented by Dr. Kay \nshould be a good example.\n  But, Mr. President, I would say that the ISG's progress report is not \nfinal. They have made an extensive investigation of Saddam's biological \nand chemical weapons program, and the work that was going on to restart \nthe nuclear program. But unless we accept the fact that Saddam is \nsomehow reformed, his track record of not just developing but actually \nusing weapons of mass destruction stands as a brutal and tragic fact of \nhistory.\n  It is clear that Saddam Hussein actively deceived the international \ncommunity and was in clear violation of U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1441 and was actively pursuing WMD programs.\n\n  That Saddam may have redesigned programs around concealment \nactivities is something this body should find deeply troubling, \ncertainly not grounds, as some would say, to acquit him of any \naccusation of WMD use or pursuit. Our troops are doing an outstanding \njob under difficult conditions. They are away from their families in \nharsh conditions, and they are in harm's way, risking everything. Yet \nthey complain less and bicker less than many here in Washington.\n  Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden-like terrorists know they cannot \ndefeat our brave military men and women on the ground. The only chance \nthey have is to create division here at home in the hope that we will \ncut and run. They cannot conceive of retaking Baghdad from our troops, \nso their only chance of victory is here in Washington.\n  Yesterday we had a very interesting discussion with Tom Friedman of \nthe New York Times, a very seasoned observer, one who doesn't share my \npolitical views on a lot of issues. But he has been in Iraq. He knows \nwhat is going on, and he believes we did what we had to do. He said it \nis clear that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden are the motivating \nforces, the leaders behind these attacks, and that they know that if \nthey can create enough division here at home, that is their one chance \nof winning. It is almost unthinkable in this day and age that someone \nwould attack the Red Cross, the ultimate humanitarian institution, to \ntry to drive them out of the country so they cannot minister to the \nsuffering of the Iraqi people.\n  The Iraqi people share our goal, which is to create a free, stable \nIraq, independent of Saddam Hussein or the rule of ayatollahs or others \nwho do not tolerate human rights, freedom, and the rights of women. We \ncannot leave this country in chaos. If we do, Saddam and Osama bin \nLaden win.\n  Those who would say pack up and leave would turn over all of the \nfruits of victory and turn them into the spoils of those who have \nwreaked such havoc on the country. I believe Mr. Friedman said that \nwhen we got into Iraq, we discovered a country that had been devastated \nback to the stone age. We are working hard to restore security and to \nbring them out of the stone age. The President has outlined a clear \nplan. He is asking for our help, $87 billion.\n  I hope today we can complete efforts on the conference report on the \nIraqi supplemental. We need the $66 billion to make sure our troops are \nprotected and adequately well served. We need the other $21 billion as \na grant, not as a loan, to go to rebuilding the security forces, the \nmilitary, the police, to assure that they can maintain stability. We \nneed to turn on the lights and turn on the water so they can get back \nto making a productive country. We have to pass this bill to give them \nsupport, to show Congress is behind them. We need to continue to work \nto see that Iraqis can control their own destiny.\n  We have some 55,000 Iraqi policemen. We have 700 Iraqi Army trained. \nWe are training more every day. What we need to do is provide them the \nresources so they can be the eyes and ears because they, the Iraqi \npeople, and their police and military are the ones best suited to go \ninto the dangerous parts of Baghdad and Fallujah and elsewhere in the \nSunni triangle and identify those who are Saddam adherents and Osama \nadherents and drag them out in the middle of the night and bring them \nto justice or stop their terrorist activities before they continue to \nstrike innocent Iraqis and international institutions such as the U.N. \nand the Red Cross, the U.S. Army, and the military who are there.\n  Hospitals are open. We have people going back to school. Progress is \nbeing made. But we have to complete action. We have to provide the \nassistance to bring Iraq out of the stone age to the point where, with \nthe help of the donations from the U.N. conference in Madrid, they can \nhave the basic infrastructure that will support loans that will enable \nthem to rebuild their oil-producing facilities, to rebuild what was a \nvery fruitful agriculture.\n  There is hope not only for the Iraqi people but for people throughout \nthe Middle East. If we will translate the victory over the Saddam \nHussein government into a victory over the Saddam and Osama bin Laden \nterrorists who continue to carry the battle to Baghdad, there is hope \nfor freedom for people in the Middle East. That is in our best long-\nterm interest. We are battling against terrorism in Baghdad. Far better \nwe battle in Baghdad than in Boston or Ballwin, MO, or Belton, MO. That \nis our choice.\n  The President has outlined a consistent and coherent plan that led to \npeace, avoided the problems we thought could occur, and now we have to \nsecure the peace.\n   Make no mistake about it, today, I feel no differently about Saddam \nand his regime and the threat it posed as the day I voted with 77 of my \nother colleagues to remove Saddam. The threat he posed was real. There \nis no question that the world is better off without Saddam, his \nhenchmen, and his two despicable sons who were poised to sustain the \nlegacy of Saddam for another half century.\n\n[[Page S13426]]\n\n  The key lesson of September 11, 2001, is that in a world of \nproliferating weapons of mass destruction, we cannot afford to wait \nuntil threats become actual attacks. The stakes and risks are just too \nhigh and the brutal track record of Saddam is clear.\n   And clearly, as demonstrated recently by David Kay's interim report, \nwe have seen unequivocally, that Saddam remained a danger to the world \nup to the last day of his regime.\n   Mr. Kay stated ``his WMD programs spanned more than two decades, \ninvolved thousands of people, billions of dollars''--(billions of \ndollars, I might add, that belonged to the Iraqi people and should have \nbeen reinvested in Iraq's infrastructure) ``and was elaborately \nshielded by security and deception operations that continued even \nbeyond the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom.''\n   For months after the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution \n1441, Saddam Hussein continued to violate his obligations to the \ninternational community by filing false declarations deceiving the \ninspectors and terrorizing the Iraqi People.\n   Mr. Kay stated in his interim report that dozens of WMD-related \nprogram activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq \nconcealed from the U.N. during the inspections in late 2002 were \ndiscovered. According to his report, the discovery of these concealment \nefforts were learned primarily through the admission of Iraqi \nscientists and officials. Some of the examples he cited were:\n   A clandestine network of laboratories and safehouses within the \nIraqi intelligence service existed that contained equipment subject to \nU.N. monitoring and suitable for continuing CBW research;\n   A prison laboratory complex, possibly used in human testing of BW \nagents, that Iraqi officials working to prepare for U.N. inspections \nwere explicitly ordered not to declare to the U.N.\n   Reference strains of biological organisms concealed in a scientist's \nhome, one of which can be used to produce biological weapons;\n   A line of UAVs not fully declared;\n   Documents and equipment hidden in scientist's homes that would have \nbeen useful in resuming uranium enrichment by centrifuge and \nelectromagnetic isotope separation;\n   New research on BW-applicable agents, brucella and congo crimean \nhemorrhagic fever and continuing work on ricin and aflatoxin were not \ndeclared to the U.N.\n  The ISG has also uncovered thus far the first documented link between \nIraq and North Korea, with documents detailing Iraq's attempt to buy \nequipment from North Korea to make missiles with ranges of up to 1,300 \nkm.\n  The Iraqi Survey Group's progress report is not final. Extensive \ninvestigation of Saddam's biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons \nprograms remains to be done, but unless we accept that Saddam was \nreformed, his track record of not just developing but actually using \nwmd stands as a brutal and tragic fact of history. It is clear that \nSaddam Hussein actively deceived the international community, was in \nclear violation of UN Security Council Res. 1441 and was actively \npursuing wmd programs.\n  Mr. President, that Saddam may have redesigned programs around \nconcealment is something that this body should find deeply, deeply, \ntroubling--certainly not acquitting, as some seem to be suggesting.\n  Our troops are doing an outstanding job under very difficult \nconditions. They are away from their families, in harsh conditions and \nthey are in harm's way risking everything, yet they complain less, and \nbicker less than many here in Washington\n  Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden-like terrorists know that they \ncannot defeat our brave military men and women on the ground. The only \nchance they have is to create division here at home in hope that we \nwill cut and run. They cannot conceive of retaking Baghdad from our \ntroops so their only chance of victory is in Washington.\n  Our enemies perceive that our failure to respond to the Khobar Towers \nand the USS Cole and our withdrawal from Lebanon and Somalia shows a \nlack of conviction and a weakness of our resolve.\n  The terrorists working for Saddam and Osama, who are trying to thwart \nour efforts by targeting not only our service men and women, but also \nIraqi civilians, humanitarian workers, and recently the Red Cross, are \ntrying to break our will and believe that Americans are weak and lack \nthe will to win the peace.\n  Cowardly terrorists are shooting at our soldiers and innocent \ncivilians, but are aiming at American public opinion and our resolve to \ncomplete the mission.\n  If we leave the country in chaos, Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden \nwin. This would not only prevent us from seizing a tremendous \nopportunity to create a stable, representative government in the heart \nof the Middle East, but it also would send a signal to terrorists \naround the world that America is weak and invite future acts of terror \nagainst the United States and our allies.\n  Most all know that we cannot afford to retreat. We must strengthen \nour resolve and complete the mission in Iraq, with self-governance of \nthat nation as our ultimate end.\n  Through joint United States/Iraqi operations, we have captured \nhundreds of foreign fighters and killed a number of them in combat. \nWith each passing day, we are witnessing more and more Iraqis assuming \nresponsibility for the safety and security of their nation. Currently, \nthere are over 85,000,000 Iraqis working to provide security for their \ncountry with: 6400 Iraqi border patrol forces that will eventually \nreplace coalition forces at checkpoints along the border; 55,000 Iraqi \npolice that will contribute to a stable society; 18,700 facilities \nprotection service members that will secure power lines, refineries and \nother key infrastructures that are targets for sabotage; 700 new Iraqi \narmy soldiers that will be a professional force for maintaining peace \nand stability versus Saddam's instrument of terror and repression; and \nlastly, over 4,700 Iraq civil defense citizens that will remain in \ntheir communities providing valuable local intelligence to coalition \nand Iraqi forces while receiving on the job training in security \npatrolling.\n\n  The men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces serving so dutifully in \nIraq represent America's finest. As the most highly trained, best-\nequipped fighting force ever assembled, they are executing their \nmission and achieving success. I recently visited with some of these \nincredible patriots at Walter Reed to thank them for their patriotic \nand heroic service. What they and their fellow service men and women \nstill in Afghanistan and Iraq need from us is our support, not just in \nthe form of equipment and supplies, but support and affirmation that \nWashington believes the mission they are carrying out--the one we voted \nto authorize by a three to one margin--continues to be necessary to \npromote peace, stability, and democracy in a world less threatened by \nterror.\n  Our service men and women are helping the Iraqi men, women, and \nchildren establish a foothold of peace and stability in the region, \nwhich will be a catastrophic blow to the terrorists who have joined the \nfight in Iraq. Our people on the ground get to see first hand the \nextent to which Saddam destroyed a society--a society of people whom \nhave never until this day had the opportunity to be safe and free. \nMurder and mass graves are headlines in Washington but they were a way \nof life under Saddam.\n  After 9/11, we vowed to stick together and we have. The President \nasked for our support in a sustained effort which will be measured in \nyears, not months.\n  He told use that the world had changed and that we would have to \nchange with it. No longer would be in the mode where we would fire one \nshot then fall back. He realized that the war on terrorism had to be \ncarried to the terrorist--we could not just wait for the next attack.\n  He has asked Congress and the people to support a sustained effort \nand he warned that it would be a fight like never before. It will have \nits ups and its downs. Mistakes will be made and measures will be taken \nthat may not always be popular.\n  We are fighting an enemy that wears no uniform and swears an \nallegiance to a radical ideology, not to humanity or a country. One who \nis willing to kill innocents without the slightest remorse.\n\n[[Page S13427]]\n\nIt is an unconventional war without borders--and it requires \nunconventional methods to win it. By taking the fight to the enemy, we \nhave more opportunity to fight on our terms but on their ground--using \nour best soldiers and spies. So we fight in Baghdad and Bagram so the \nwar is not fought in Boston, Boise, or Bolivar, MO.\n  I believe that it remains instructive to note that there are two \nmajor investigations ongoing in Washington. One, in relation to 9/11, \nasks why the Government did not act based on imperfect information. The \nother, in relation to Iraq, asks why the Government did act based on \nimperfect information. This helps us understand the predicament that \nany President faces in a hostile world where lives and freedom at stake \nwith intelligence that can almost never be perfect and sometimes can be \nwrong.\n  In Afghanistan and Iraq, our people are facing hardship and death. \nYet they are getting the job done. We have seen reenlistment ceremonies \nthat are taking place in Iraq by our dedicated service men and women \nwho are committed to staying until their mission is complete.\n  A central bank and Iraqi currency have been established months ahead \nof schedule. We went from 0-60,000 trained Iraqi security and military \npersonnel in less than 5 months. Schools, which were formerly weapons \nstorage depots, are open. Electricity has been restored to prewar \nlevels and is delivered not just to Saddam's Bathist friends as before, \nbut to the population at large. Hospitals are open, working, and caring \nfor patients; and the political leadership of the country has begun \ncoalescing. In Afghanistan, where there were once 800,000 boys in \nschool, there are now 2.5 million boys and 1.5 million girls in school. \nBaghdad, which once got its news only from Saddam, Aljazeera and CNN, \nnow may have more news sources than Washington, DC.\n  The Marshall Plan after World War II cost almost $80 billion, in 1998 \ndollars, and we had roughly 100,000 troops in Germany for 4 years after \nthe war. Who at that time asked after Pearl Harbor, how much was it \ngoing to cost to defeat the Japanese; who asked how much was it going \nto cost to defeat the Germans after they sank the Lusitania? The cost \nof the war on terror is great but it must be weighed against the human \ntragedy and economic costs of 9/11.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill that the Congress needs to pass \nout of conference is necessary to help protect our troops, win the \npeace and create conditions so that our troops can return home safely \nand victorious. The same resolution that the Senate voted 77-23 to \nauthorize war almost 1 year ago expressly stated the need to restore a \nstable, peaceful Persian Gulf. Lets honor that commitment today and \npass the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  We need to let our service men and women complete their mission so \nthey can come home.\n  I say to our men and women serving here and abroad, to their families \nat home, and to those Saddam loyalists and terrorists who doubt our \nwill; don't equate public discourse in a free society with weakness. We \nvoted overwhelming to authorize to take the fight to the enemy and we \nhave voted overwhelmingly to support our troops in the field and to \nhelp the Iraqi men, women, and children, who were until now, hopeless \nof living with peace and freedom.\n  We will not cut and run. We will not let those who have already paid \nthe ultimate price die in vain. We will not turn our backs on the \ncommitments we have made.\n  Some doubted our ability to turn back Nazism and communism but \ncollectively, we did. Doubters that we can overcome terrorism will be \njust as wrong now as doubters were then.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13427-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13427-S13430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I have risen on numerous occasions over \nthe last several months to pay tribute to our Nation's troops serving \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, and across the globe in support of the war on \nterrorism. Today I would like to add to that ongoing tribute by \nhonoring the troops of the 39th Infantry Brigade or ``the Arkansas \nBrigade,'' as we know it at home. The 39th was recently mobilized for \naction in Iraq with troops pulling out this week for training in Fort \nHood before a 12-month deployment in the Middle East.\n  Last weekend I had the honor of attending a send-off ceremony for the \n39th Brigade in Little Rock. That ceremony brought together soldiers, \nfamilies, friends, and loved ones to commemorate the occasion and to \nwish them the best in their mission. The send-off was not a \ncelebration. In fact, it was a sober occasion. After all, no one \nrelishes the prospect of traveling halfway around the world, far from \nfamily, friends, and home, to take on a dangerous but necessary \nmission.\n  But along with the sense of sobriety at the ceremony, there was an \nenormous sense of duty, honor, and pride among these individuals. These \nmen and women recognized that they were taking on a great personal \nrisk, but they also recognized that, in so doing, they are part of a \nlong tradition of American soldiers taking up arms to defend our \nfreedoms and to bring security and stability to the world. As their \nfathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers fought in the First and \nSecond World Wars, in Korea, Vietnam, the gulf war, and in countless \nother conflicts in the last century, these men and women are embracing \na new historic mission.\n  The 39th Infantry Brigade is the largest combat command in the \nArkansas Army National Guard, with nearly 3,000 troops comprising 47 \nunits from across the State. While this is the first time since World \nWar II that the entire brigade has been activated for overseas service, \nthe 39th has been remarkably active within Arkansas for decades.\n  At the Governor's behest, the 39th has been quick to respond in the \nevent of State emergencies. When floods, tornadoes, forest fires, ice \nstorms, and drought have struck Arkansas, the members of the 39th have \nbeen there to offer their expertise and to lend a hand to communities \nin need. The 39th has offered assistance to law enforcement in missing \npersons cases, anticrime efforts, and counterdrug programs. Members of \nthe 39th have offered themselves for countless hours of leadership and \nvolunteer service in their communities, in schools and churches, civic \norganizations, private businesses, law enforcement, and even elected \noffice.\n  Consider, for example, the small town of Bradford just a few miles \nnortheast of Little Rock. This town of 800 people is preparing to lose \ntheir mayor, their police chief, and the school librarian, all of whom \nare leaving for Iraq. While these temporary losses may bring temporary \nhardships, I have every confidence that these communities, Bradford and \nmany others, will pull through.\n  I am happy to report that Bradford is already coping--Grebe Edens, a \n78-year-old former school teacher who serves as the town's recorder and \ntreasurer, will be serving in the mayor's place until he returns.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an October 24 Washington Post article \nabout how the town of Bradford is coping be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this is but one example of the effect \nthis deployment will have on my home State of Arkansas. Many \ncommunities in Arkansas will no doubt be able to share similar stories \nof losing key personnel in the next 18 months.\n  Furthermore, let us not lose sight of the impact of this deployment \non the families of these troops.\n  I was standing in that auditorium on Sunday visiting with mothers, \naunts, daughters, as well as wives and children, and watching their \nfaces with a sense of not knowing what is coming down the pike and yet \nbeing so incredibly proud of their loved ones who are serving this \ngreat Nation.\n  I have an October 27 newspaper story written by Stephen Ziegler, \neditor of the Searcy Daily Citizen in White County, AR.\n  Mr. Ziegler's story focuses on the troops of the Second Battalion, \n153rd Brigade, and their families. Some are newly married, or have \nyoung children.\n   The stories illustrate the mixed emotions that many Arkansans \nexperience\n\n[[Page S13428]]\n\nin seeing loved ones, friends, and neighbors leave to serve our great \nNation.\n   Here is one young couple who are expecting a child in May. Here is a \nschool superintendent who has been away from his job for 3 of the last \n6 years on account of frequent deployments. Here is a young Army medic \nwhose greatest fear is that he may see a friend die.\n   But coupled with the uncertainty is a clear sense of dedication and \ncommitment.\n   I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Daily Citizen be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks, so that we may be ever \nmindful of the effects of war both on those who serve and on those they \nleave behind.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. As recent events have made startlingly clear, the \nsituation in Iraq remains dangerous.\n  It is true that some parts of the country--notably in the south and \nin the Kurdish north--have achieved a measure of stability and \nsecurity. To the extent that stability has been achieved in these \nareas, it has been entirely attributable to the hard work, commitment, \nand ingenuity of American troops on the ground. We praise them for \nthat.\n  Unfortunately, it is also true that parts of Iraq remain critically \nunstable, particularly in the country's central region around Baghdad \nand Tikrit. With these facts in mind, let us salute the remarkable \ncourage of our men and women who are placing themselves at great risk \nto serve in bringing security and peace to Iraq. We owe them a \ntremendous, tremendous debt for this service and sacrifice.\n  Finally, I would like to once again pay tribute to the troops \ncurrently serving in Iraq--roughly 140,000 American troops, with an \nestimated 5,000 from Arkansas. Many have given their lives to this \nmission, and many more have been wounded, some quite seriously. Those \nwho remain in Iraq, and those who are preparing to enter into rotation \nin theater, will be in our thoughts and prayers in the months to come. \nWe pledge to take care of their families and loves ones who are left \nbehind.\n  We wish our troops safety, we wish them success, and we wish them a \nswift and safe return to their homes and loved ones as soon as their \nservice is complete.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Oct. 24, 2003]\n\n                  A Town's Leaders Marching Off to War\n\n                          (By Lee Hockstader)\n\n       Bradford, AR.--For months, Paul Bunn had an inkling that \n     his unit of the Arkansas National Guard would be shipped to \n     Iraq, and there were a few things he wanted to get done \n     before he left.\n       Such as running the drug dealers out of town, ensuring a \n     safe supply of drinking water and compelling his more \n     slovenly constituents to get rid of the junk in their yards--\n     if necessary by fining them.\n       Bunn, 36, took office in January as the supercharged mayor \n     of Bradford, a one-blinking-stoplight hamlet of cow pastures, \n     low-slung houses, rickety shacks and modest churches set \n     among the rice and soybean fields an hour's drive northeast \n     of Little Rock. His impending departure for the Middle East--\n     Bunn has already reported for training and expects to be in \n     Baghdad early next year--has shaken this town of 800.\n       So has the scheduled deployment of the police chief, the \n     school librarian and five other townsmen, all members of the \n     39th Infantry Brigade of the Arkansas National Guard.\n       ``I'd say our town is paying one heck of a price, but to me \n     it's a price worth paying,'' said Bunn, a former Army Special \n     Forces soldier who fought in Panama and the Persian Gulf War.\n       The deployment of the 39th Infantry Brigade, announced in \n     late September, means about 3,000 Arkansas Guardsmen from 47 \n     units scattered across the state will be going to Iraq early \n     next year as part of a major deployment with the Army's 1st \n     Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Tex. The troops are \n     expected to replace soldiers of the 1st Armored Division who \n     have been serving in Iraq since April.\n       For Arkansas, the effect is dramatic. Counting 2,000 \n     guardsmen already deployed elsewhere overseas, including in \n     Afghanistan, the departure of the 39th means that more than \n     half the state's 11,000 guardsmen will be serving overseas. \n     Only a handful of other states--Oklahoma, North Carolina \n     Washington--have a similarly large portion of their guardsmen \n     serving overseas, according to the National Guard.\n       To the extent that Bradford--or at least its leadership--is \n     being decapitated, the town is unusual. But it is also \n     typical of communities that, disproportionately, are sending \n     military men and women to serve in Iraq and other areas of \n     conflict.\n       ``Broadly speaking, [the military] tends to be more rural \n     and more southern,'' said Doug Bandow, who has analyzed the \n     demographics of the U.S. military for the Cato Institute, a \n     think tank. ``But it is also a broadly Middle America, \n     middle-class force.''\n       The departure of so many prominent citizens is causing \n     ripple effects and dislocations not easily absorbed in so \n     small a rural town. At the town's one school, for instance, \n     the departure of the librarian, Nolan Brown, 57, a \n     grandfather of nine who is a personnel clerk in the Guard, \n     triggered a domino effect in which one new teacher was hired \n     and three others, in the departments of math, science and \n     social studies, were compelled to add or drop courses they \n     had already begun.\n       At Bradford's somewhat misleadingly named city hall, a one-\n     story red brick building that also houses the police and \n     water departments, Mayor Bunn's powers have been transferred \n     to Greba Edens, 78, a retired schoolteacher whose last \n     specific memory of a combat casualty that touched her life \n     involved a friend's brother--killed in World War II.\n       ``I'm not moving into the mayor's office,'' said Edens, \n     known locally as Miss Greba, the town's recorder-treasurer \n     for 19 years, who by law will assume Bunn's duties until he \n     returns. ``But he made promises that he'd clean up the trashy \n     places around town and try to get rid of some of the drugs, \n     so I guess I'll try to do that.''\n       Like the mayor and the librarian, the police chief, Josh \n     Chambliss, 28, is expected to be gone from 18 months to two \n     years on duty in Iraq. Chambliss, recently married, had been \n     hoping to start a family, but those plans may be on hold for \n     now. His five-officer police department, which deals mainly \n     with domestic disputes, thefts and a methamphetamine drug \n     problem common in small rural towns, will be led in his \n     absence by Michael Ray, the assistant chief.\n       Ray, 34, who counts the chief as well as the mayor among \n     his best friends, seems slightly uneasy both at their \n     departure and his own ascendance.\n       ``In the last Gulf War, they were all surrendering to \n     anyone who came along,'' said Ray, whose badge, affixed to \n     his belt, still says assistant chief. ``This time, it's just \n     a whole different ballgame, and there's a good chance that \n     some of [the Americans] aren't coming back.''\n       Ray's apprehension about the fighting in Iraq is widely \n     shared, even though most people in this resolutely \n     conservative town are quick to say they support the troops as \n     well as President Bush. Many say they want to see the troops \n     ``get over there, get the job done and get home quickly''--\n     intoning their wishes almost like a mantra--and in \n     practically the same breath acknowledge that they see no \n     swift end to the fighting or the U.S. engagement in Iraq.\n       ``We don't want to get into another situation like in \n     Vietnam, of not supporting these people,'' said Larry \n     Robinson, a county veterans services officer. ``You bet we're \n     behind them, and this is really bringing the Iraqi situation \n     right to the front door. But this is a new type of war, and \n     it worries me.''\n       For his part, Bunn has no illusions about the toll that may \n     result from the 39th Infantry Division's deployment. A \n     sergeant who expects to be a Humvee squad leader in Iraq, \n     Bunn has already bluntly told his two children and two \n     stepchildren, ages 11 to 15, that he and some of his fellow \n     guardsmen may not be coming home alive.\n       ``I'm hard as woodpecker lips when it comes to this, but in \n     this job here there's gonna be body bags coming home and \n     bullets going downrange,'' he said. ``I don't believe in \n     lying to the kids about it.''\n       Bunn worries nearly as much about what he is leaving behind \n     in Bradford as what he will face in Iraq. He worries about \n     his insulation business, in which he has several hundred \n     thousands of dollars in loans, and whether it will survive \n     his absence. He worries about miss Greba, the stand-in mayor, \n     and whether she will be able to oversee an $800,000 grant \n     from the state that Bunn secured to improve the town's \n     drinking water. He worries about what will happen in the \n     event of tornadoes hitting Arkansas--Bradford lies in the \n     heart of twister country--in the absence of thousands of the \n     state's National Guard troops.\n       ``I'm a wheeler-dealer, and it doesn't bother me to pick up \n     the phone and call the governor,'' Bunn said. ``But I'm not \n     even going to try over there. My job now is to be a soldier \n     and take the guys I got and bring them over there and bring \n     them back safe.''\n       Yet he also worries about making it back to Bradford for \n     his stepson Bradley's high school graduation in the spring of \n     2005. And he frets about his friend Chambliss, a staff \n     sergeant in the Guard who has never been in combat.\n       ``Josh to me is a special person,'' Bunn said of his police \n     chief. ``Not too many people that you find who have an \n     innocence about them, and Josh does. . . . That innocence \n     will be shattered, and that's what bothers me.''\n       Bunn believes he will be prepared for Iraq, but the other \n     guardsmen are much less experienced. Nolan Brown, the school \n     librarian, was in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive of 1968, \n     but he was a clerk in a dental unit at the time, not involved \n     in combat.\n       The younger men enlisted, in some cases while still in high \n     school, were lured mainly by the Guard's generous provisions \n     for helping pay for college and health insurance. Few \n     imagined they would be heading off to combat anytime soon.\n\n[[Page S13429]]\n\n       Two of them, both privates in the Guard, wandered into the \n     Bradford school the other day dressed in green fatigues, \n     their hair cropped short. One, Richard Farmer, 21, a supply \n     specialist, joined the Guard a few years ago when he was \n     still in school. The other, Wesley Hodges, 20, an \n     administrative assistant in the Guard, joined shortly \n     thereafter.\n       Asked if they would have joined then had they known it \n     would mean duty in Iraq, the two shrugged and mumbled an \n     unconvincing ``yeah.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit II\n\n                [From the Daily Citizen, Oct. 27, 2003]\n\n                 Focus on White County: Called to Duty\n\n                          (By Stephen Zeigler)\n\n        White County gave a rousing sendoff Friday at Spring Park \n     in Searcy to the 140 local troops of the 39th Infantry \n     Brigade who begin heading to Fort Hood Tuesday. From there, \n     the troops go to Iraq sometime in March.\n        There were balloons, hugs and tributes.\n        But it is the third deployment since 1998 for members of \n     the Second Battalion, 153rd Brigade, who went to Kuwait on \n     the Iraq border in 1999 and then to Egypt in 2001, just \n     returning in August.\n        It is safe to say they were hoping for an extended time \n     home before being deployed again.\n        The honor to White County is significant, but so are the \n     sacrifices. Lt. Sgt. Kirk Van Pelt estimates the soldiers' \n     active duty time will be 18 months, including deployment to \n     Iraq for a year.\n        Many businesses will have to compensate for the loss of \n     valued employees for that period. Many cities will lose \n     public officials, including police and firemen.\n        Bradford is losing a mayor. The Riverside School District \n     is losing a superintendent.\n        Some soldiers are newly married. Some are leaving behind \n     pregnant wives. Many families are losing a parent for a time \n     very important in children's lives.\n        The soldiers themselves face worries about what to expect \n     in Iraq, concerns for their wives and children, and \n     uncertainties about their safety and their friends' safety.\n        But they are called to duty. Here are just some of their \n     stories.\n        Command Sergeant Major James ``Larry'' Nowlin, 55, was \n     born in Searcy and now lives in Jonesboro.\n       ``For the first 30 years, the only tours I went on were to \n     Honduras, Panama, and Wales, each for two weeks' training. \n     After 9/11, everything changed,'' Nowlin said.\n       He has two boys, but doesn't worry too much about them \n     because they are 23 and 19. He does worry about the other \n     families, however.\n       ``We'll be so busy we'll think about our families when we \n     have time, but the time will pass so fast for us. The wives \n     will be pulling the load for the whole family while we're \n     gone. A lot wives are expecting.''\n       Nowlin has been superintendent of the Riverside School \n     District for six years.\n       For three of those, he has been gone.\n       ``I always try to e-mail with my students but will probably \n     be limited this time,'' Nowlin said. ``When we were in Egypt \n     I e-mailed with about 60. They want to know what the kids are \n     like there, the culture, the schools. When I got back from \n     Kuwait they'd made me a quilt with messages on it, and they \n     made me a throw when I got back from Egypt.''\n       His biggest worry is the usual one for officers.\n       ``What I'm scared of is the possibility of losing soldiers. \n     The though of having to notify families that their loved ones \n     might not come back or be disabled is the biggest fear I \n     have. We're fixing to put 3,000 soldiers over there from \n     Arkansas, altogether in one group. That's a concern.''\n       Staff Sergeant Joshua Stewart, 24, was married in July to \n     Dana Martin from rural White County, where they both went to \n     White County Central school. They now live near Fayetteville \n     in West Fork. Dana is attending the University of Arkansas.\n       ``We got a phone call the unit had been put on duty the day \n     our honeymoon in Pigeon Forge ended,'' Stewart said. ``I \n     wasn't surprised, but I'm not at all eager to go. My \n     enlistment ended last February, but I was involuntarily \n     extended.''\n       ``I wasn't married or thought that I would be soon when I \n     wanted to quit in February.\n       ``It's not what I wanted in the first six months of my \n     marriage but I'm prepared. What we'll face will be different \n     from our training. A lot of weight will bear down on every \n     decision we make. The outcome will be more than a slap on the \n     wrist if we make a mistake.''\n       Pfc. Tyson Weaver, medic, 20, of Little Rock, has been in \n     the Guard two years and three months. He and his wife \n     Jennifer, 19, were married May 31.\n       ``I had a feeling I was going to be able to come home from \n     training and raise my family,'' said Weaver. ``This was a \n     complete shock to me, but I'm ready to go do my job and come \n     back to my family.''\n       Weaver says his extended family gave him a party at his \n     grandmother's house a couple of months ago.\n       ``When I was walking out the door in my greens, my \n     grandmother started crying because it's the last time I'll \n     see her for about 18 months. At first I was completely torn \n     up, but then I remembered this is what I signed up to do, so \n     there's no point crying about it. If you're accepting \n     taxpayer money you can't gripe when you're called to do your \n     job.''\n       Even at 20, Weaver has seen what happened to some veterans \n     of the Vietnam war. He fears being traumatized by what he may \n     see.\n       ``I'm most afraid of changing, of being a different person \n     when I get back. I believe now I'm a happy person. I'm secure \n     and things don't get to me. I'm afraid of coming back a hard-\n     hearted person, cold to my family. That's not who I am.''\n       Weaver says he will try to keep himself centered with lots \n     of letters and communication back home.\n       He and Jennifer have a baby girl, Olivia, due Christmas \n     day.\n       ``We're coming home Dec. 20 to Jan. 3, so I'll be there \n     when the baby's born. It tears me up. She'll be walking and \n     talking when I finally get home. But my wife is a very strong \n     person. She'll cope.''\n       Like many other medics, Weaver fears another thing.\n       ``I'm scared of having to bag one of my buddies.''\n       Specialist Jeremy Abele, 21, of Bald Knob, has been in the \n     Guard four years. He and his girlfriend Jennifer have been \n     together 14 months.\n       ``I slightly expected it but it hasn't bothered me yet. I \n     won't think about it until I get there. I'm a medic, so I'll \n     probably see things a lot of doctors in a hospital don't see. \n     I'm taking it day by day.''\n       Abele's 16-year-old brother Derreick was in school Friday \n     in Bald Knob, missing the Spring Park tribute.\n       ``I don't want him to enlist. I don't want him to go \n     through this.''\n       Sgt. Randall Martin, 27, of Searcy, will turn 27 on Monday. \n     He has been in the guard 7.5 years, went to Kuwait in `99 and \n     Egypt in `02, and is first-year nursing student at ASU-\n     Searcy.\n       ``I wasn't expecting it so soon. You have mixed emotions. \n     You feel good you're selected out of so many units in the \n     nation. But sometimes, it's sad and heartbreaking to miss out \n     on the experience of being there.''\n       He and his wife Kelly have a child due May 10, to be named \n     Mac if It's a boy, Emma if a girl.\n       Kelly said, ``I just try to be positive. I know he likes \n     the military and that's what he chooses to do so there's not \n     much I can do about it. I have a great support system \n     in Randall's mom and my grandparents.''\n       Specialist James Poyner, medic, 26, from Bald Knob, has \n     served 7.5 years and also has just returned from Egypt. His \n     wife Leah was born in Searcy and raised in Bald Knob. They \n     were married in 1998. They, too, heard about the new \n     deployment in July.\n       ``I wasn't expecting it, neither was my wife. These two \n     deployments back-to-back are really difficult. I've got a \n     four-year scholarship to UALR. Now it'll take seven years.''\n       The timing is as bad for him as for most.\n       ``Leah's upset. We're best friends and it's hard to be away \n     from each other. It's time to start having children, but we \n     don't want to be apart for that.''\n       Poyner does operations and network administration for a \n     restaurant equipment company in Searcy. His absence will be \n     stress on his boss, John Faucett, and the company, he said, \n     but added that Faucett has been very supportive.\n       ``He's a true patriot, and he says my job will be waiting. \n     It's a great company, and going back to it is something I'll \n     think about every day to keep me going in Iraq.''\n       Poyner is confident about his readiness.\n       ``I'm in a treatment squad, recently moved from the field. \n     We'll see 80-100 percent of the injuries, and we're not \n     treating strangers, they'll be friends and guys I'm close to. \n     Seeing them go through pain is something I'm trying to be \n     prepared for. This past summer camp a friend went down with \n     heat stroke and stopped breathing. We cut him out of his \n     clothes and doused him with water, and he's OK. When you're \n     doing the treatment you're in a zone doing the work.''\n       Sgt. Jerome Geroge, 40, has served 17 years, counting two \n     in the Army.

They have four children: Chance, 13; Annie, \n     12; Hunter, 10; Savanna, 8.\n       ``The last time I was deployed, in Egypt, the loss was \n     apparent in Chance. He didn't get in trouble or anything, but \n     his grades fell. A dad needs to be there to explain things at \n     that age,'' George said.\n       ``I'll miss the holidays, the anniversaries, the birthdays, \n     children's dance recitals and sports.

At city hall, meanwhile, officials have been rushing to \n     prepare paperwork necessary to transfer the mayor's power to \n     a 78-year-old retired school teacher.\n       The soon-to-be acting police chief says Bradford is just \n     one example of how the war in Iraq has affected small town \n     America.\n       ``One way or another we're going to handle it,'' said \n     Michael Ray, who will become the new police chief, along with \n     his job as a school resources officer. ``It's going to be OK. \n     I'm going to run it the same way as if the chief was here.''\n       In addition to Mayor Paul Bunn, Chief Josh Chambliss and \n     librarian Nolan Brown, five other citizens of this farm town \n     have received orders to report to Fort Hood, Texas. There, \n     they will prepare for a tour of duty in Iraq that is expected \n     to put them in Iraq by Christmas.\n       Greba Edens, the town's recorder-treasurer, will take over \n     for the 35-year-old mayor. Previously, she spent 24 years as \n     Bradford's fourth-grade teacher.\n       ``Most of the people on the city council now, she's paddled \n     them before,'' Bunn said.\n       Edens said she plans to carry on with Bunn's ideas. ``As \n     the mayor says, we're a family here,'' she said.\n       At the elementary school, Brown was organizing the library \n     ahead of his deployment, He served in Vietnam and has been in \n     the National Guard for 31 years. Now 57, he was hoping to \n     leave the guard at age 60.\n       ``I've got stuff scattered from here to there getting \n     ready,'' he said. ``I want to leave it as if I'm not coming \n     back.''\n       ``The children here, they ask me, `Are you going? When are \n     you going?''' he said. ``They know there's some turmoil \n     somewhere. I tell them they may not take me because of my age \n     . . . but it would be unwise not to prepare them.''\n       The school had a going-away party for Brown in the \n     cafeteria, presenting him with a cake that read, ``Our \n     prayers are with you.'' The school will shuffle around \n     teachers to make up for Brown's absence.\n       After nine years at the school, all the students know him. \n     As he leaves, he shouts a goodbye to his cousin's son in the \n     hallway.\n       ``Tell your Mom, since things have escalated, that I may \n     not get to see her,'' he said to the boy. ``Tell her I'll \n     miss her and love her.''\n       Brown says he's edgy about his departure, as are his wife \n     and the three children they care for. But he's adamant that \n     he has to give back to a country that gave him an education.\n       ``The U.S. has been very good to me,'' he said, adding he \n     believes citizens need ``to be willing to do whatever it \n     takes to make sure kids in the future have the same \n     opportunities that we have.''\n       Unlike Brown, who works in a headquarters group, the police \n     chief and the mayor are infantry soldiers responsible for \n     more dangerous security duty.\n       ``I'll make a deal with the president,'' said Bunn, who has \n     fought in Panama and in the Gulf War. ``I'll go over there, \n     but I'm not willing to die. Maybe it's because I've got kids \n     now.''\n       Bunn could be gone for up to two years. Even if he stays \n     that long, he'll still have over a year left of his term as \n     mayor when he returns.\n       Chambliss, 28, has been the town's police chief since 2001. \n     He's not worried about Bradford, which is about 70 miles \n     northeast of Little Rock. He said he expects the town's other \n     four officers to continue to man the school crossings and \n     attend all the ball games.\n       ``I'm curious to see what the next 18 months hold, not for \n     me but for Bradford,'' Chambliss said. ``I want to come back \n     into town and see the progress.''\n       Chambliss said that he's upset to leave his wife. They were \n     planning to start a family soon.\n       He is spending the rest of his time in Bradford saying \n     goodbye to friends and family. He had lunch at his regular \n     spot, the Front St. Cafe, just down the road from the police \n     station.\n       The cafe's owner and waitress, Marcia Pressler, said she \n     gave him that day's $4.95 plate special of roast beef, \n     potatoes and carrots on the house.\n       ``It's like a part of your family going off,'' she said. \n     ``I felt like I'm feeding him his last supper.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I salute my colleague from Arkansas for \nthe tribute she made to this unit in her home State of Arkansas. Every \none of us in the Senate can tell a similar story. But she tells us so \nwell about the lives that are affected by the activation of Guard and \nReserve men and women who leave important lives and careers and step \naside to serve their Nation.\n  That is why it is so troubling that I come to the floor today to \nreport for those who follow the Senate that yesterday in the conference \ncommittee of the Appropriations Committee where we met to discuss the \n$87 billion request of the President, we stripped out a provision which \nhad been adopted on the Senate floor. I would like to describe it to \nthose who want to stand behind the families of those activated Guard \nand Reserve men and women.\n  We have 1.2 million Guard and Reserve in the United States. Ten \npercent of them work for the Federal Government, when they are not \nserving in the Guard and Reserve. At the present moment, of the 120,000 \nFederal employees with the Guard and Reserve, 23,000 have been \nactivated. They include some people who are in the unit the Senator \nfrom Arkansas just described.\n  I offered an amendment on the floor that said when you activate a \nFederal employee to the Guard and Reserve, the Federal Government \nagency that the person works for will make up any shortfall and any \ndifference in income while that Guard or Reserve person is on active \nduty. That is not a radical suggestion. There are dozens of State \ngovernments and local units of government that already do that, \nincluding my home State of Illinois and the City of Chicago.\n  If you are a Chicago policeman in the Guard and you are activated, \nthe City of Chicago stands behind you and says we will make up the \ndifference in pay if there is a shortfall so that there is no hardship \non your family. That amendment passed the floor of the Senate 96 to 3. \nYesterday it was stripped out of the conference committee report that \nis being considered. It is $87 billion.\n  Every day we hear Senators come to the floor singing the praises, \ndeservedly, of the men and women in uniform to say we stand in \nsolidarity with them and their families as they fight for America. \nThese same Members who come to the floor praising the guardsmen and \nreservists also voted for my amendment, saying let us hold them \nharmless if they go off to serve our Nation for 6 months, or 12 months, \nor 16 months. They all voted for this amendment.\n  Yesterday, on a party-line vote, with every Republican Senator voting \nno, they took this provision out of the bill. Many of the same Senators \nwho just a few days ago had voted on the floor for this provision \nreversed their position and said no, the Federal Government will not \nset an example and will not make up the difference in pay for those \nthousands of Federal employees activated in the Guard and Reserve. That \nis unfair and it is unfortunate. Those who come here to wave the flag \nabout their support for our fighting men and women weren't there \nyesterday on this crucial vote in this conference committee.\n  I hope those across America who follow this debate and who may know \nsome of these families affected by this amendment will contact their \nSenators and tell them it was a grave injustice that we allowed this to \noccur. It was a real disappointment to me. We could have done the right \nthing yesterday, but, sadly, we did not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13430-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13430-S13431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened earlier to the Senator from \nMissouri talking about the State of affairs in Iraq. I would like to \ncomment on that very briefly.\n  If I understood his argument, he said that 6 months after hostilities \nhad ended--at least the military operation as the President described \nit, and after the efforts of different inspectors and the expenditure \nof millions of dollars--he believed the fact that Dr. David Kay \ncouldn't produce any evidence whatsoever of weapons of mass destruction \ndid not reflect on statements made by this administration before we \ninvaded Iraq. I think that is clearly wrong.\n  This has been declassified. We said we knew of 550 sites of weapons \nof mass destruction in Iraq before we invaded--550 of them. Doesn't it \nstand to reason that these inspectors would go to those sites first to \nfind the weapons of mass destruction? Isn't it revealing that they have \ncome up with no evidence whatsoever? What a tremendous breakdown in \nintelligence gathering--that 550 suspected sites have now turned up\n\n[[Page S13431]]\n\nto be virtually empty, with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction. \nHow hard a stretch of the imagination is it to think Saddam Hussein, \nfacing an invasion of forces from America and Great Britain, was very \ncautiously packing into vans all of the weapons of mass destruction and \nspiriting them out of his country? I don't think that stands to reason.\n  That is almost as hard to follow as the President's logic yesterday \nwhich said that the terrorism and carnage going on in Iraq today is \nproof positive of the progress we are making. The progress?\n  Frankly, these sad reports from Iraq evidence the fact that we have \nnot established order in that country to a level where we can assure \nthe people of Iraq, or our troops for that matter, that they are going \nto be in a safe situation. I have not called for us to cut and run. I \ndo not know many who have. We have to stay the course. We are now \nthere.\n  As it has been said, when you go into a gift shop, the sign says ``If \nyou break it, you own it.'' We went into Iraq and took control of that \nsituation. Now we are responsible for creating a stable and secure \nenvironment, and it will be a great cost over a lengthy period of time.\n  Just last week, I joined with my colleagues visiting Walter Reed \nHospital to meet with some of the wounded soldiers.\n  I say to those who are stunned to hear each day that we have lost a \nsoldier, or two or three soldiers, not to take lightly those who are \nwounded. Many of the wounds of these soldiers are grievous. I met one \nsoldier from Ohio who lost the sight in one eye and another soldier \nfrom Illinois who had been the victim of a mortar round and is going to \nstruggle to ever walk again. I think he will, but it will be a \ntremendous struggle and a lot of rehabilitation. To say we have only \nlost one, two, or three soldiers a day--please look at this in the \ncontext of the lives lost and the lives that are seriously injured and \ndiminished by the injuries that are suffered there.\n  We have to stay the course. Frankly, I find it unfathomable that this \nconference committee of appropriations yesterday refused to stand \nbehind 23,000 Federal employees who have been activated in Guard and \nReserve units, refused to say we will stand with their families and \nmake certain they don't go through economic hardship during the \nactivation period when they are risking their lives for America. \nUnfortunately, this conference committee walked away from those \nsoldiers yesterday. That is shameful, and it is something we never \nshould have done. I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about \nthis partisan rollcall, which, frankly, reversed a 96-to-3 vote of just \na few weeks ago.\n  I will close by saying it is unfortunate we cannot finish the Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill today. It is my understanding that the \nDeWine-Durbin amendment for $289 million for the global AIDS epidemic, \nwhich we believe has a sufficient number of votes on the Senate floor \nto pass, has been threatened by one Republican Senator from Oklahoma \nwho has said he will filibuster the bill and stop the bill on the \nSenate floor.\n  We are coming to the close of this session and we need to pass \nappropriations bills. Threatened filibusters from either side--\nparticularly from the majority side--are not appropriate at this time. \nI hope that Senator will reconsider.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13431-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sense of the Senate on declassifying portions of the \n     Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before \n     and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001.\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The President has prevented the release to the American \n     public of 28 pages of the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence \n     Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks \n     of September 2001.\n       (2) The contents of the redacted pages discuss sources of \n     foreign support for some of the September 11th hijackers \n     while they were in the United States.\n       (3) The Administration's decision to classify this \n     information prevents the American people from having access \n     to information about the involvement of certain foreign \n     governments in the terrorist attacks of September 2001.\n       (4) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested that the \n     President release the 28 pages.\n       (5) The Senate respects the need to keep information \n     regarding intelligence sources and methods classified, but \n     the Senate also recognizes that such purposes can be \n     accomplished through careful selective redaction of specific \n     words and passages, rather than effacing the section's \n     contents entirely.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that in light of these findings the President should \n     declassify the 28-page section of the Jointly Inquiry into \n     Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the \n     Terrorist Attacks of September 2001 that deals with foreign \n     sources of support for the 9-11 hijackers, and that only \n     those portions of the report that would directly compromise \n     ongoing investigations or reveal intelligence sources and \n     methods should remain classified.\n       This section shall take effect one day after the date of \n     this bill's enactment.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I also offered \nyesterday. I was not able to get a vote on it yesterday because of a \nruling that it was nongermane. I have filed a notice that I intend to \nmove to suspend Rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate. I will do \nthat at the end of my presentation. That will give us a vote on this \nimportant issue today. Let me describe why I think a vote is necessary \nand what this issue is.\n  This issue deals with 9/11, the day on which our country was attacked \nand thousands of Americans were murdered by terrorists, many of whom \ncame into this country and lived among us and plotted an attack against \nthe World Trade Center; they plotted an attack against the Pentagon and \nperhaps the U.S. Capitol. They hijacked commercial airliners and used \ncommercial airliners, full of both passengers and fuel, as flying bombs \nand missiles.\n  No one in this country will forget the devastation, the loss of life, \nand the horror of the terrorist attacks committed against the United \nStates on September 11.\n  We know a fair amount about September 11: who organized it and how it \nwas organized. We know Osama bin Laden has taken credit for it. We know \nit was planned by Osama bin Laden and a terrorist group called al-\nQaida, and they were supported by the Taliban government in \nAfghanistan. We know a fair amount about the details of that day and \nthe activities of the hijackers. There has been a great deal of \ndiscussion about how did it happen--how did it happen that these \ncoordinated attacks by terrorists occurred in this\n\n[[Page S13432]]\n\ncountry without our intelligence community knowing it was going to \nhappen and taking action to prevent it.\n  As we know as well, from testimony before the Congress and from other \ninformation, we had some warnings. The FBI had some warnings. In fact, \none FBI agent wrote a memorandum inside the FBI saying he worried about \ncertain people of certain nationalities taking flying lessons, \npotentially for the purpose of using an airplane for hijacking and as a \ntool of a terrorist attack. We had other evidence that existed in our \nintelligence community from both the FBI and CIA.\n  So there has been a great deal of discussion about how do we find out \nwhat we knew, what the agencies knew, what we could have done to \nprevent these attacks, and what we now know about those who committed \nthe attacks and how to prevent future attacks. That is all very \nimportant.\n  There are a couple of efforts underway. One was an effort before the \nCongressional Joint Intelligence Committee. They did an inquiry into \nintelligence community activities before and after the terrorist \nattacks of September 2001. That inquiry was done and finished with a \nreport that was released this past summer. The report was authorized \nfor release by the Bush administration. It took 9 months to write, 7 \nmonths to declassify, and when it was released, we discovered there are \n28 pages of that report that are redacted; 28 pages of the report have \nbeen classified, so that the American people cannot know what is in \nthat report.\n  The question is, Why? On behalf of the victims, the victims' \nfamilies, the American people, I ask, Why would 28 pages of that report \nbe classified and unavailable to be seen by the American people? We are \ntold it contains information about other governments, or another \ngovernment and its activity with respect to some of these issues. We \nare told by some that there were areas of support by another \ngovernment, or governments, for the terrorists themselves as they began \nto work and put together the resources and plan these attacks against \nthe United States. If that is the case, the question is, Which \ngovernments? Who was involved? How were they involved? Are those \ngovernments still involved in supporting terrorists who would strike at \nthe heart of this country and kill innocent Americans?\n\n  Why do we not have the right to know if governments supported some of \nthe terrorists who were working and planning and gathering the \nresources to attack this country? If another government provided any \nsupport for that, do we not have a right as an American people to know \nthat? Why has that information been classified?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from North Dakota makes eminent good sense in \nwhat he is saying. I recall at the time this report came out--and we \nall remember the blacked-out pages--the country of Saudi Arabia sent \nover emissaries to say--and I don't know how serious they were about \nthis--would you release this.\n  My question to the Senator is: Insofar as the majority of hijackers \nat the time of September 11 were from Saudi Arabia, and insofar as we \nknow from press accounts--not classified material but press accounts--\nthat a lot of funding of al-Qaida came from Saudi Arabia and may still \nbe coming from Saudi Arabia, don't you think it would be helpful to \nknow if Saudi Arabia is mentioned in this blacked-out part and to what \nextent, considering the fact that they apparently have turned a blind \neye to some of the terrorists who are striking at the United States?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont is \nabsolutely correct. The American people ought to have a right to know \nif a foreign government was involved in helping provide resources for \nand planning for attacks against this country. We have a right to know \nthat.\n\n  The amendment I am offering is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that \nsays to the President: Declassify this material. What is so sensitive \nthat the American people can't know whether a foreign government was \ninvolved in the planning and providing the resources for a terrorist \nattack against this country?\n  Let me tell you what the chairman and the ranking member--a \nRepublican and a Democrat--of the Intelligence Committee said on this \nissue when these 28 pages were withheld from the American people. \nSenator Shelby, the ranking member then on the Intelligence Committee, \na Republican, said:\n\n       I went back and read every one of those pages thoroughly. \n     My judgment is that 95 percent of that information could be \n     declassified and become uncensored so the American people \n     would know.\n\n  Asked why this section was blacked out, Senator Shelby said:\n\n       I think it might be embarrassing to international \n     relations.\n\n  Senator Graham said:\n\n       During the negotiation that was held with the \n     administration prior to the release of the documents, we had \n     submitted a counteroffer indicating what we thought were \n     legitimate areas of national security with the rest of the \n     section dealing with foreign governments to be released to \n     the public. The counteroffer was not accepted. The \n     administration took the position that the totality of this \n     section dealing with the role of foreign governments should \n     remain censored and beyond the view of the American people.\n\n  Question of Senator Graham:\n\n       Can you give us some idea of how big the counteroffer was?\n\n  Senator Graham said:\n\n       It was in the range, which Senator Shelby indicated he \n     thought it was, of 28 pages that represented genuine national \n     security interests which was 95 percent open and 5 percent \n     continued classified.\n\n  I am not trying to embarrass anybody with this amendment. I just feel \nstrongly that when the 9/11 commission--that is the inquiry by our \nIntelligence Committee--was completed and the effort was released, to \nhave 28 pages censored or classified and to be told the American people \ncan't see it leads me to ask the question, Why? Why? If there was \nanother government--and all the indications are there was another \ngovernment--involved in providing support for the terrorists who \nattacked this country, the American people have a right to know it. \nThey have a right to know who it was, what were the circumstances, why, \nhow do they justify that.\n  The Saudi Government has asked that this information be declassified \nand released. The Saudi Government has asked that. Most of the \nspeculation, of course, is the questions about Saudi support of \nterrorism, as my colleague from Vermont just described. But the Saudi \nGovernment has asked this be declassified so they can respond to it in \npublic.\n  There is no basis, no good reason for this to remain censored and \nclassified. My sense-of-the-Senate amendment asks the President to \ndeclassify that portion of the 28 pages. As Senator Shelby and Senator \nGraham have described, 95 percent of it does not deal with national \nsecurity or our national security interests, and would not compromise \nour interests.\n  Senator Schumer is a cosponsor of this amendment, and Senator \nLieberman is a cosponsor as well.\n  My hope is we will certainly have a vote on this amendment this \nmorning. My amendment will require a vote under suspension of the \nrules.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am not a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee. I lead off by saying this has absolutely nothing whatsoever \nto do with the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. We should not be \nhaving this debate at this time.\n  With regard to the issue, there are those on the Intelligence \nCommittee who can speak to it with much more knowledge than I. I am \nhopeful some of them will come over in the course of this debate. Let \nme make the point the war on terrorism is an ongoing operation. The \ndecision to classify this material was reached between the intelligence \nauthorizing committees and the executive branch.\n  Declassifying the information should be carefully considered. For \nexample, would it place in jeopardy the lives of U.S. men and women \nfighting the war on terrorism? Declassifying material without careful \nconsideration could also have a chilling effect on the sources of \ninformation in the war on terrorism, including individuals and foreign \ngovernments. It is conceivable\n\n[[Page S13433]]\n\nboth individuals and foreign governments would be afraid their \nparticipation and cooperation in the war on terrorism would become \npublic.\n  The main point I wish to make is there may be a time and place for \nthis debate, but it is not on this bill. I hope once the debate is \nconcluded we will make a decision not to proceed down this path at this \ntime on this measure.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes 31 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Kentucky, there \nis, in fact, an ongoing war on terrorism, and it is critically \nimportant for this country, it is important that we be successful in \npreventing terrorist attacks against this country. It is important we \nbe successful in hunting down those in the world who are planning \nterrorist attacks against this country and destroying their network of \nsupport. But with respect to the ongoing war against terrorism, it is \ncritically important, in my judgment, for this country to know, Are \nthere foreign governments that have supported terrorists? Are there \nforeign governments that have given active financial support to those \nwho attacked this country on September 11, 2001? If so, who are they? \nHow would it compromise any interest of this country or, for that \nmatter, any other country under any other circumstances to disclose a \ndiscussion in the inquiry that was done, a painstaking inquiry that was \ndone about another government that provided support to terrorists that \nmurdered thousands of Americans. The American people have a right to \nknow that information.\n  I know the easiest way to withhold information is to always claim \nthere is some important sensitive information that would compromise \nsome intelligence operation. The people in the best position to know \nthat would be the chairman and the ranking member of the committee who \ndid the inquiry, Senator Graham and Senator Shelby, a Democrat and a \nRepublican. Both of them have already made a judgment about this. They \nsaid: Nonsense, this won't compromise anything. Ninety-five percent, \nthey said, of these 28 pages of censored, redacted material could and \nshould be made available to the American public without compromising \nanything.\n  If one is wondering whether this compromises anything, I say go to \nthe experts, go to the authorizing committee, go to the Republican and \nDemocrat who were chairman and vice chairman of the committee and ask \nthem and they will tell you they did not support redacting this \nmaterial, censoring this material, and classifying this material. It \ncame from the White House. It wasn't fair to the American people to do \nthat.\n  If there is another government that provided active support--\nfinancial support and comfort and assistance--to those who decided to \ncommit acts of terror against this country and murder thousands of \ninnocent Americans, then, in my judgment, by God, the American people \nhave a right to know that. The American people have a right to know \nthat, and classifying 28 pages that describe the circumstances in which \nanother government may well have provided support to terrorists \nattacking this country is wrongheaded, in my judgment.\n  If, in fact, this inquiry describes that, another important question \nexists: Is the country that provided support--financial assistance and \ncomfort and aid--to the terrorists who attacked this country in 2001 \nstill providing support and aid? Do they still have adjuncts in that \nsociety, in that government, that provide support and comfort to \nterrorists? We have a right to know that as well.\n  In my judgment, withholding information from the American people is, \nin most cases, a bad decision. If it is necessary because it would \ncompromise something that is important with respect to the intelligence \ncommunity, I understand that. But the two experts would be the chairman \nand the vice chairman of the committee who decided to launch the \ninquiry. And those two Senators, Senator Shelby and Senator Graham, \nhave already spoken on this issue.\n  They have said 95 percent of that information ought to be made \navailable.\n  I will make one additional point. Talk to the families of the people \nwho were murdered on 9/11 and ask them, if a foreign government was \ninvolved in supporting acts of terror against this country, whether \nthey think that information ought to be made available to the American \npeople or ought to be censored, classified, and out of the reach of the \nAmerican people.\n  They will say we ought to disinfect this whole area by deciding to \ngive everybody as much information as possible about what happened on \n9/11, not by closing the books and pulling the veil and deciding \nwhether to keep information from the American people. As I indicated, \neven the Saudi Government that has been so much the subject of this \nspeculation wants this information made available, and it ought to be \nmade available.\n  My sense of the Senate is very simple. It says to the President: \nDeclassify this. Now, I also understand that this is a foreign \noperations bill. It is an appropriations bill. There is no good time to \nhave a sense-of-the-Senate resolution come to the Senate floor, I \nsuppose, if one does not support declassifying this information. But \nthis amendment does not interrupt the foreign operations bill. I \nsupport that bill. I am happy to work with the chairman and ranking \nmember who, I think, have done a remarkable job on that bill.\n  It seems to me we have a right to have a vote in the Senate about \nwhether this information ought to be made available to the American \npeople, whether it ought to be declassified, uncensored, and the \nquestion answered: Is there another government or governments that \nparticipated with the terrorists by providing aid, comfort, and \nfinancial support to terrorists who committed acts of terror against \nthis country?\n  That is information, in my judgment, the American people deserve to \nhave.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the time running without \ndebate be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, how much \ntime remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 58 seconds, and 18 minutes \n17 seconds for the majority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have a few additional comments at some \npoint. If the Senator from Kentucky has other speakers--I had expected \na couple of other speakers. I do not know whether that will occur \nbefore the end of the time. I believe we have 40 minutes, 20 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from North Dakota, I had expected \nsome speakers as well. So I think we have the same dilemma. I just do \nnot want to delay the vote, and I assume the Senator from North Dakota \nwould rather not delay it as well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not intend to delay the vote. It is fine to have a \nquorum call and have it equally divided, but let me ask the courtesy of \nthe Senator that if we get to the point where we have 6 or 8 minutes \nremaining, that I would have the opportunity for a couple of those \nminutes so that we could close and have a debate at the end.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the other \nconsent just asked for, Senator Dorgan have 2 minutes before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 54 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be\n\n[[Page S13434]]\n\nadded as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, for a year, a joint committee \nof members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee carried out \ntheir responsibilities to do a comprehensive review of what happened \nbefore September 11 as it related to the role of the intelligence \ncommunity; what happened after September 11, particularly in utilizing \nthe information that was gathered around that tragic event; and then \nwhat recommendations for some fundamental change that would enhance the \ncapacity of the intelligence community to reduce the prospect of \nanother 9/11. That report took over 800 pages. It had some 19 \nrecommendations for action.\n  After the report was completed, it was submitted to the \nadministration--primarily the CIA, the FBI, and the White House--for \nreview as to whether there were any elements of that report that would \nbe categorized as national security and therefore not for general \npublic distribution.\n  The section of the report that received the greatest degree of such \nclassification, in fact, virtually 100 percent, was the section that \nrelated to the role of foreign governments in the events leading up to \n9/11, and then how well our responsible agencies had followed the leads \nand tracked the developments and events before 9/11; after 9/11 for \npurposes of potential criminal prosecution, for purposes of \nunderstanding why we had these gaps; and what the role of foreign \ngovernments would be; for the purpose of diplomatic or other policies \nthat might be instituted vis-a-vis countries that were found to have \nbeen cooperative or even complicitous in the actions of the 9/11 \nterrorists, and then finally to form the recommendations of what \nfundamental change should be made.\n  The consequences of denying to the American people access to that \nsection of the report are many. No. 1, the American people have been \ndenied the opportunity to know fully what, in fact, happened. No. 2, \nthey have been denied the opportunity to hold accountable those \nagencies or individuals who were responsible for that inappropriate \naction by a foreign government. We have been unable to hold the State \nDepartment accountable for its action vis-a-vis the foreign \ngovernments. Finally, we have taken a substantial amount of the impetus \nand sense of urgency out of the recommendations for fundamental reform. \nIn fact, the Senate has yet to hold a first hearing on the 19 \nrecommendations that we made.\n  I think it is of the highest order of concern for the American people \nthat they have access to this information and then they will do with \nthat information what they believe is appropriate. But ignorance and \nsecrecy serves no national purpose. I urge the adoption of this \namendment to urge the President to reevaluate the decision to censure \nthe chapter on the role of foreign governments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 11 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee however many minutes of the 11 that he so \ndesires.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan \namendment. I do not think that rule XVI should be waived. The amendment \nis not germane.\n  More important, speaking as chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I believe this amendment is unwise. I think it will damage \nour Nation's efforts in the ongoing war against terrorism.\n  I, for one, and members of the committee, have read the 28 pages from \nthe Joint Inquiry Report and have been briefed by the FBI and the CIA. \nAs a matter of fact, the distinguished Senator from Florida indicated \nthat we have not even had hearings. That is not correct. We have had \nhearings. We had hearings in mid-September as to whether or not it \nwould be in our national security interest to release the 28 pages.\n  I would also say to all Members, if they have a keen interest in \nthis--and I am aware of the legislation, or I am aware of the letter \nthat went to the President signed by a great many Senators asking for \nthe 28 pages to be made public--as I said at the time, please come to \nthe Intelligence Committee and we will provide you the information on \nthe 28 pages. Some of the very people who are sponsoring amendments \nhave not read the 28 pages.\n  I wish they would do so. It is my firm position--firm position--in \norder to protect our national security, specifically the methods and \nthe sources and ongoing investigations, that this so-called redacted \nmaterial should not be released to the public. I think it would \nendanger lives.\n  I am not in a position to discuss the specifics in regard to the \nurgent pleas and the warnings that were provided to us by the FBI \nduring this hearing. But I think I can speak for a majority of the \nIntelligence Committee who thought this was not a good idea and \ncertainly would be counterproductive to our national interest.\n  I might add that one of the statements I heard as I entered the floor \nwas from the distinguished former chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee. He is somebody I admire, whose advice and counsel and \nfriendship is very important to me. Senator Rockefeller, who is the \ndistinguished vice chairman of the committee, and I have agreed that we \nwill hold hearings in the next session of Congress on the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Some I agree with, some I \ndon't.\n  We were going to make this year the year of modernization and/or \nreform in regard to the intelligence community, but something \ninterrupted that. It was called a war--the war against global \nterrorism. In addition, we were going to make an inquiry as to the \ncredibility and the timeliness of the intelligence prior to going to \nwar in Iraq. It is not that we have not wanted to do these things. It \nis that the schedule of the committee has been taken up almost \nexclusively by those two subjects, plus our weekly threat briefings of \nwhich I know the Senator from Florida is certainly aware.\n  So we will have hearings on the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We \nmade that promise to the families of the victims. But if we disclose \nthe information that compromises the close cooperation we have from our \nallies in the war on terrorism, and much better cooperation today than \nbefore then these same allies may choose not to support us in the \nfuture. That is another concern.\n  Again, from the standpoint of endangering sources, methods, ongoing \ninvestigations, and, yes, lives--and I think I am speaking for a \nmajority of the Intelligence Committee that has had a hearing on this, \nhas taken a hard look at it--I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to make sure I don't have a misunderstanding \nwith the Senator from North Dakota. Did he wish to speak right at the \nend, before the vote, essentially? My understanding is we are ready to \nyield back the time over here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time on this side and ask \nunanimous consent the Senator from North Dakota be given 2 minutes, and \nat the end that we proceed to a vote on or in relation to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from North \nDakota is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his \ncourtesy.\n  Let me say to my colleague on the Intelligence Committee, the \nchairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \nPorter Goss; Senator Shelby of Alabama, the past vice chairman; the \npast chairman of the Intelligence Committee here in the Senate, Senator \nGraham--all have indicated that at least some of this redacted \nclassified material should be\n\n[[Page S13435]]\n\nmade available. But they have taken that position with no success. I \nwould expect the two former chairmen of the committees and the vice \nchairman would not take that position if they believed it would \ncompromise intelligence sources and methods.\n  Let me quote, if I might, Bill Harvey, a member of the Family \nSteering Committee for the 9/11 independent commission. He lost his \nwife on 9/11. She was killed in the Trade Center. He is pretty critical \nof both the White House and Congress.\n\n       The White House's refusal to produce the 28 pages is just \n     one more example of its manipulation of intelligence for \n     political purposes, but the Congress's reluctance to remedy \n     the situation by declassifying the redacted information is \n     equally troubling. The United States of America deserves to \n     know the true nature of its supposed allies, and the families \n     of the victims of the September 11 attacks deserve to know \n     what our Government new about the terrorists that took their \n     lives.\n\n  That is the key. After this commission has completed its work, the \ninquiry is complete, and we have knowledge and information about \nwhether another government provided financial support and other support \nto terrorists who attacked this country, do we have a right to know who \nthat government is, which government it is, and whether that government \nstill provides support to terrorists who still would like to commit an \nact of terrorism against this country and who would like to murder \ninnocent Americans?\n  The American people have a right to know what is in that redacted \nportion of the report. If there is 5 percent of it, as Senator Shelby \nand Senator Graham have suggested, that ought to be withheld, I \nunderstand that. But if the bulk, as they have indicated, ought to be \nmade available to the American people, I believe it ought to be made \navailable now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized to make a point of order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \namendment is not germane under the requirements of rule XVI.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I move to suspend rule XVI of the standing \nrules of the Senate during consideration of H.R. 2800 for the \nconsideration of amendment No. 2000.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) Thousands of communities in the United States, many \n     located near Federal lands, are at risk to wildfire. \n     Approximately 190,000,000 acres of land managed by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior \n     are at risk of catastrophic fire in the near future. The \n     accumulation of heavy forest and rangeland fuel loads \n     continues to increase as a result of disease, insect \n     infestations, and drought, further raising the risk of fire \n     each year.\n       [(2) In addition, more than 70,000,000 acres across all \n     land ownerships are at risk to higher than normal mortality \n     over the next 15 years from insect infestation and disease. \n     High levels of tree mortality from insects and disease result \n     in increased fire risk, loss of old growth, degraded \n     watershed conditions, and changes in species diversity and \n     productivity, as well as diminished fish and wildlife habitat \n     and decreased timber values.\n       [(3) Preventive treatments such as removing fuel loading, \n     ladder fuels, and hazard trees, planting proper species mix \n     and restoring and protecting early successional habitat, and \n     other specific restoration treatments designed to reduce the \n     susceptibility of forest and rangeland to insect outbreaks, \n     disease, and catastrophic fire present the greatest \n     opportunity for long-term forest and rangeland health by \n     creating a mosaic of species-mix and age distribution. Such \n     prevention treatments are widely acknowledged to be more \n     successful and cost effective than suppression treatments in \n     the case of insects, disease, and fire.\n       [(4) The by-products of preventive treatment (wood, brush, \n     thinnings, chips, slash, and other hazardous fuels) removed \n     from forest and rangelands represent an abundant supply of \n     biomass for biomass-to-energy facilities and raw material for \n     business. There are currently few markets for the \n     extraordinary volumes of by-products being generated as a \n     result of the necessary large-scale preventive treatment \n     activities.\n       [(5) The United States should--\n       [(A) promote economic and entrepreneurial opportunities in \n     using by-products removed through preventive treatment \n     activities related to hazardous fuels reduction, disease, and \n     insect infestation; and\n       [(B) develop and expand markets for traditionally underused \n     wood and biomass as an outlet for by-products of preventive \n     treatment activities.\n\n     [SEC. 202.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) high levels of tree mortality resulting from insect \n     infestation (including the interaction between insects and \n     diseases) may result in--\n       (A) increased fire risk;\n       (B) loss of old trees and old growth;\n       (C) loss of threatened and endangered species;\n       (D) loss of species diversity;\n       (E) degraded watershed conditions;\n       (F) increased potential for damage from other agents of \n     disturbance, including exotic, invasive species; and\n       (G) decreased timber values;\n       (2)(A) forest-damaging insects destroy hundreds of \n     thousands of acres of trees each year;\n       (B) in the West, more than 21,000,000 acres are at high \n     risk of forest-damaging insect infestation, and in the South, \n     more than 57,000,000 acres are at risk across all land \n     ownerships; and\n       (C) severe drought conditions in many areas of the South \n     and West will increase the risk of forest-damaging insect \n     infestations;\n       (3) the hemlock woolly adelgid is--\n       (A) destroying streamside forests throughout the mid-\n     Atlantic and Appalachian regions;\n       (B) threatening water quality and sensitive aquatic \n     species; and\n       (C) posing a potential threat to valuable commercial timber \n     land in northern New England;\n       (4)(A) the emerald ash borer is a nonnative, invasive pest \n     that has quickly become a major threat to hardwood forests \n     because an emerald ash borer infestation is almost always \n     fatal to affected trees; and\n       (B) the emerald ash borer pest threatens to destroy more \n     than 692,000,000 ash trees in forests in Michigan and Ohio \n     alone, and between 5 and 10 percent of urban street trees in \n     the Upper Midwest;\n       (5)(A) epidemic populations of Southern pine beetles are \n     ravaging forests in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, \n     Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, \n     Tennessee, and Virginia; and\n       (B) in 2001, Florida and Kentucky experienced 146 percent \n     and 111 percent increases, respectively, in Southern pine \n     beetle populations;\n       (6) those epidemic outbreaks of Southern pine beetles have \n     forced private landowners to harvest dead and dying trees, in \n     rural areas and increasingly urbanized settings;\n       (7) according to the Forest Service, recent outbreaks of \n     the red oak borer in Arkansas and Missouri have been \n     unprecedented, with more than 1,000,000 acres infested at \n     population levels never seen before;\n       (8) much of the damage from the red oak borer has taken \n     place in national forests, and the Federal response has been \n     inadequate to protect forest ecosystems and other ecological \n     and economic resources;\n       (9)(A) previous silvicultural assessments, while useful and \n     informative, have been limited in scale and scope of \n     application; and\n       (B) there have not been sufficient resources available to \n     adequately test a full array of individual and combined \n     applied silvicultural assessments;\n       (10) only through the full funding, development, and \n     assessment of potential applied silvicultural assessments \n     over specific time frames across an array of environmental \n     and climatic conditions can the most innovative and cost \n     effective management applications be determined that will \n     help reduce the susceptibility of forest ecosystems to attack \n     by forest pests;\n       (11)(A) often, there are significant interactions between \n     insects and diseases;\n       (B) many diseases (such as white pine blister rust, beech \n     bark disease, and many other diseases) can weaken trees and \n     forest stands and predispose trees and forest stands to \n     insect attack; and\n       (C) certain diseases are spread using insects as vectors \n     (including Dutch elm disease and pine pitch canker); and\n       (12) funding and implementation of an initiative to combat \n     forest pest infestations and associated diseases should not \n     come at the expense of supporting other programs and \n     initiatives of the Secretary.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to require the Secretary to develop an accelerated \n     basic and applied assessment program to combat infestations \n     by forest-damaging insects and associated diseases;\n       (2) to enlist the assistance of colleges and universities \n     (including forestry schools, land grant colleges and \n     universities, and 1890 Institutions), State agencies, and \n     private landowners to carry out the program; and\n       (3) to carry out applied silvicultural assessments.\n\n     SEC. 402.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ENHANCED COMMUNITY FIRE \n                   PROTECTION.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress to reaffirm the importance of \n     enhanced community fire protection program, as described in \n     section 10A of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n     1978 (16 U.S.C. 2106c) (as added by section 8003(b) of the \n     Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Public Law \n     107-171; 116 Stat. 473)).\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to improve the \n     capacity of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of \n     the Interior to conduct hazardous fuels reduction projects on \n     National Forest System lands and Bureau of Land Management \n     lands aimed at protecting communities, watersheds, and \n     certain other at-risk lands from catastrophic wildfire, to \n     enhance efforts to protect watersheds and address threats to \n     forest and rangeland health, including catastrophic wildfire, \n     across the landscape, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on July 24, the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry reported to the Senate H.R. 1904, the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act. This bill, which is now before the Senate, \nreflects a comprehensive effort to improve forest health on both public \nand private lands. The bill provides Federal land managers the tools to \nimplement scientifically supported management practices on Federal \nforests, in consultation with local communities, while establishing new \nconservation programs to improve water quality and regenerate declining \nforest ecosystem types on private lands.\n  The legislation will reduce the amount of time and expense required \nto conduct hazardous fuels projects, but it also will require rigorous \nenvironmental analysis of those projects.\n  Over the past few years, we have seen many communities destroyed and \nmany firefighters' lives lost due to forest fires that could have been \nprevented. We are all deeply saddened by the tragic events occurring \nnow in California. At least 17 people, we are told, have lost their \nlives; 1,600 homes have been destroyed, and 520,000 acres have burned.\n  The fires continue to wreak havoc in that State. Thousands of \nCalifornians have had to leave their homes, and more communities are \nbeing evacuated at this very moment.\n  On Monday, President Bush declared the region a disaster area. The \ncost resulting from these fires is estimated in the billions of \ndollars. The tools and resources this legislation provides land \nmanagers will assist in preventing the devastation resulting from \nforest fires.\n  In the past, the U.S. Forest Service has been forced to spend great \namounts of time and resources battling lawsuits instead of managing the \nforests. The result has been months and even years of delays in fuel \nreduction projects. Our forests have continued to suffer, and they have \ncontinued to burn.\n  I have filed, along with 13 cosponsors, an amendment to title I of \nthe bill which contains several modifications to the bill the committee \nreported.\n  I offer that amendment to the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1828\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S13450]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself, \n     Mr. Crapo, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Craig, Mr. Wyden, \n     Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \n     Thomas, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1828.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment embodies recommendations \nmade by a bipartisan group of Senators who are committed getting this \nlegislation passed and signed by the President. The amendment \nestablishes a predecisional administrative review process. It allows an \nadditional analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act. It \ndirects the Secretary of Agriculture to give priority to communities \nand watersheds and hazardous fuel reduction projects. It contains new \nlanguage protecting old-growth stands, and it encourages the courts to \nexpedite the judicial review process.\n  The underlying legislation also contains a biomass title authorizing \ngrant programs to encourage utilization of forest waste material. \nAnother title provides financial and technical assistance to private \nforest land owners to encourage better management techniques to protect \nwater quality. The pest and remote sensing titles would authorize \nfunding for the U.S. Forest Service, land grant institutions, and 1890 \ninstitutions to plan, conduct, and promote the gathering of information \nabout insects that have caused severe damage to forest ecosystems.\n  Title V, the Healthy Forest Reserve Program, is a private forest land \nconservation initiative that would support the restoration of declining \nforest ecosystem types that are critical to the recovery of threatened, \nendangered, and other sensitive species.\n  Two additional titles were added to the House-passed bill by our \ncommittee. One would establish a public land corps to provide \nopportunities to young people for employment and, at the same time, \nprovide a cost-effective and efficient means to implement \nrehabilitation and enhancement projects in local communities. The other \nnew title will promote investment in forest resource-dependent \ncommunities.\n  This legislation provides new legal authority to help us manage the \nNation's forests in a safe and effective manner. The bill will help us \ndo a better job of safeguarding these priceless national resources.\n  I urge the Senate to support the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues \nin supporting the bipartisan forest health legislation. Catastrophic \nwildfires raging in California today underscore the urgent need for \naction. We must reduce the risk that other communities and other States \nwill face with regard to the devastation that Californians are \nexperiencing today.\n  In South Dakota we also know from experience how destructive forest \nfires can be. In the Black Hills, we have experienced five major fires \nin the last 3 years. We are committed to finding a solution that will \nenable the Forest Service to reduce the threat of wildfire effectively \nand efficiently and that can become law. We must do more to expedite \nhazardous fuels reduction activities, and I believe this compromise \nwill help the Forest Service to do so.\n  This past August I toured the Black Hills with Dale Bosworth, chief \nof the U.S. Forest Service. It is clear that the Forest Service needs \nadditional tools to address the increasing fire risk to South Dakota \nand other State communities. Today more than 460,000 acres of the Black \nHills National Forest are in moderate to high fire risk. If we do \nnothing, the Forest Service warns the number of acres at risk in the \nBlack Hills will grow dramatically to more than 550,000 acres. That is \nunacceptable.\n  During our visit, Chief Bosworth asked that any reforms we undertake \nallow Forest Service personnel to spend less time in the office \nplanning and more time in the forest actually clearing high fuel load.\n  This bipartisan compromise meets that standard, and it helps in other \nways as well.\n  First, this legislation clarifies how much detail is needed for \nenvironmental analysis of fuel reduction projects.\n  Instead of analyzing anywhere from 5 to 10 alternatives--as is \ncurrent practice--this bill specifies that the Forest Service must \nconsider only three alternatives: The preferred alternative, a ``no-\naction'' alternative, and an ``additional-action alternative.''\n  The Forest Service currently spends over 50 percent of its time and \nmoney planning a given project. This will help reduce the costs of the \nenvironmental analysis and allow the Forest Service to treat more acres \neach year.\n  Second, this legislation streamlines the appeals process within the \nForest Service by mirroring what is already done at the Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n  In talking with Forest Service personnel in the Black Hills, one of \nthe figures that struck me most is that 100 percent of proposed \nprojects are appealed.\n  This legislation will help streamline the appeals process while still \nprotecting the public's right to be heard before final decisions are \nmade.\n  A third strength of this legislation--the pending amendment--is that \nit encourages speedy disposition of any projects that are challenged in \ncourt, without giving undue deference to any party.\n  The bottom line is that this bipartisan compromise will enable the \nForest Service to spend more time conducting on-the-ground fuels-\nreduction projects, which is the key to reducing the risk of fire risk \nin America's forests and the communities that surround them.\n  While this compromise is not exactly the plan I would have crafted, I \nbelieve we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good in this \nsituation.\n  I am committed to working with all of my colleagues to pass a forest \nhealth bill this year. I believe this bipartisan compromise can be \nenacted into law and I am hopeful that the administration will be \nhelpful in convincing the House to join us in making that happen.\n  As we see today in California, the risks of delay are simply too \nhigh.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. I commend \nthe managers and the bipartisan group who worked on this bill. It is \nvitally needed, and I rise in strong support of it.\n  Mr. President, this long overdue piece of legislation will finally \nbring some common sense to forest management in our Nation.\n  Currently, conditions in our Nation's forests are terrible. The poor \nstate of our forests is due in large part to a lack of active forest \nmanagement efforts to reduce undergrowth and remove dead and dying \ntrees to restore forest health. According to the Society of American \nForesters, ``As a result of 80 years of fuels accumulation and several \nyears of drought, the potential for catastrophic wildfire is at an all \ntime high in many regions of the United States.''\n  An estimated 190 million acres of Federal forests and rangelands in \nthe United States, an area twice the size of California, face a high \nrisk of catastrophic wildfire. Decades of an accumulation of dense \nundergrowth and brush, along with drought, insect infestation and \ndisease, and the presence of invasive exotic species have made our \nforests vulnerable to these environmentally destructive wildfires.\n  According to Secretary of Agriculture, Ann Venman, last year was the \nsecond worst fire season in modern history with over 7.2 million acres \nburned--an area larger than Maryland and Rhode Island combined. The \nStates of Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon registered their largest and \nmost destructive wildfires ever. It was also the most expensive fire \nseason ever costing Federal taxpayers $1.6 billion. When the season \nended, 23 firefighters were dead, tens of thousands of people fled \ntheir homes and more than 2,000 buildings were destroyed. This \ndevastation was only eclipsed by the 2000 fire season where more than 8 \nmillion acres of forests burned at a Federal cost of $1.4 billion.\n  This year, as of the first week in October, we have had a total of \n67,500 fires\n\n[[Page S13451]]\n\nthat have burned over 3.2 million acres at a cost of over $550 million. \nWorse than that, over 20 wildland firefighters have lost their lives \nthis year.\n  The time for addressing the problem of our unhealthy forests is long \noverdue. Current efforts to reduce excessive fuel loads, underbrush, \nand dead and dying trees are taking for too long due to senseless \nbureaucratic delay. According to the U.S. Forest Service, it can take \nup to 8 years to plan and execute relatively routine fuels reduction \nprojects--8 years. Does anyone here believe that this is responsible \nforest management?\n  In May of this year, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) released \nthe results of a survey that confirms that the large numbers of appeals \nfiled by environmental interest groups are delaying efforts to restore \nthe health of our Nation's forests through the thinning of overgrown \nand diseased areas. These delays increase the threat of severe forest \nfires which threaten human life, old growth trees, habitat for \nendangered species and private property. These endless and meritless \nappeals result in nothing but inaction and increased bureaucratic \ncosts.\n\n  If we do not address this problem now, we risk losing many of \nAmerica's most pristine forests to wildfire devastation. Congress needs \nto pass legislation to streamline and expedite these forest thinning \nand fuels reduction efforts.\n  I believe the H.R. 1904 will accomplish this goal. The Senate \ncompromise to H.R. 1904 is designed to cut through unnecessary red tape \nand speed up the review and approval process for forest health \nrestoration projects, while at the same time preserving the appropriate \nenvironmental review process.\n  Specifically this bill establishes procedures to expedite forest and \nrangeland restoration projects focusing on lands near communities in \nthe wildland urban interface; that are in condition class 3 (high fire \nrisk) areas located in proximity to a municipal watershed or water \nsupply system; that provide important habitat for endangered species \nwhere the risk of catastrophic wildfire threatens these species; and \nwhere insect infestation, disease and old age are destroying forests \nand increasing the chance of wildfire.\n  The Senate compromise also contains language for the protection of \nold growth or large trees in the implementation of hazardous fuels \nreduction projects. This legislation requires authorized hazardous \nfuels reduction projects to be consistent with the applicable forest \nand resource management plans, along with other administrative policies \nor decisions applicable to Federal land. The amount of acreage eligible \nfor authorized fuels reduction projects under this legislation is \nlimited to 20 million acres.\n  In addition to allowing for an environmental assessment and expedited \nadministrative appeals, this legislation does allow for judicial \nreview. As a part of this review, this bill requires lawsuits to be \nfiled in the district court where the project is located. It limits \ntemporary injunctions to 60-days, subject to renewal. Finally, this \nlegislation directs the courts to balance the short- and long-term \nenvironmental effects of undertaking a project versus those of not \nundertaking a project.\n  The problem of excessive forest fuels build is not just a Western \nproblem. It is a National problem. The expedited reduction of forest \nfuels and the thinning of underbrush would greatly improve the health \nof Missouri's forests. There has been a significant increase in the \nbuildup of these fuels in National and State Forest land in the State \nof Missouri as a result of recent tornadoes, several years of drought, \noak decline and oak mortality.\n  Oak mortality is the most pressing problem in Missouri's forests. As \nof January 2003, oak mortality due to drought, insects, and fungi have \naffected 41 percent of the Mark Twain National Forest's 1.5 million \nacres, and caused an estimated loss of more than 30 million dollars' \nworth of red oak timber. Dead limbs and debris in this area also reduce \nfood for wildlife, and contribute to fuels buildups, which increases \nthe dangers of wildfires. In turn, these wildfires endanger wildlife \nhabitat areas, healthy watersheds and neighboring private lands.\n\n  Missouri also has huge volume of dying forest land throughout \nsouthern Missouri as a result of infestation by an insect known as the \nred oak stem bore.\n  According to Dr. Gene Garrett of the University of Missouri School of \nNatural Resources, who has studied and taught forestry for over 33 \nyears, ``Roughly 33 percent of the 23 million acres of the interior \nhighlands in the scenic Missouri Ozarks are infested by this red oak \nstem bore. Dr. Garrett goes on to say that ``this insect and \nassociative disease complex is by far the greatest threat to the oak \ncomponent of the interior highlands.'' This has resulted in over $1.1 \nbillion worth of timber at risk and an increased threat of wildfire in \nthis area.\n  H.R. 1904 will address most of the forest health issues in Missouri \nand prioritize them for expedited cleanup. Section 102(a)(4) of this \nhealth forest legislation will specifically address this problem of red \noak stem bore and oak decline.\n  The first of Missouri's two fire seasons is now underway. The most \nrecent high wildfire season in Missouri occurred in 2000 when over \n8,700 acres of wooded lands burned--more than 3,000 acres over the 10-\nyear average. By expediting the cleanup or thinning of our forests, \nMissouri and the rest of the Nation can expect to see the risk of these \ncatastrophic wildfires reduced.\n  In closing, I believe that H.R. 1904 represents a commonsense \napproach to forest management based on sound science. I have talked \nwith forest scientists all over the country, including several from my \nown State, and they believe that this legislation takes the right \napproach to restoring the health of our Nation's forests. These are \nactual forest scientists who know what they are talking about--not big \ncity newspaper editorial writers.\n  If we do not act on this problem right now, vast acres of old growth \ntrees and wildlife habitat will remain at a high risk of catastrophic \nwildfire. Once these areas are destroyed by fire, there will be very \nlittle, if anything, that we can do to restore them to health. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1904, the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act of 2003. It is time to put some common sense \nback into forest management.\n  It is long past time that we get this done. I really thank the \nbipartisan group that came together for this extremely important and \nmost needed forest health measure. Again, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it and move it expeditiously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, forestry can often make Middle East \npolitics seem noncontroversial. I think it is fair to say that today it \nwould be hard to find a topic that is more emotionally flammable than \nthe one that has come to the Senate today.\n  I begin by saying that right now, my home State--and I see my good \nfriend, Senator Smith, on the Senate floor as well--is sending \nresources to California to help deal with the horrendous fires. But I \nthink it ought to be noted, as we begin this discussion, that just over \na year ago the State of California was sending resources to my home \nState--the State that Senator Smith and I are proud to represent. Just \nover a year ago, we were on the Senate floor speaking about the huge \nforest fires that raged in our State. At that time, over 500,000 acres \nwere burning. We had a dozen fires raging at any given time. Seventeen \nthousand people in one of our valleys alone were on a 24-hour \nevacuation notice, and 2,500 structures were threatened.\n  So I think we ought to note, as we begin this discussion, that the \nlegislation before us today is critical, not because of last year's \ntragedies, or even the tragedies that we are seeing in California \ntoday; this legislation is critical to address the tragedies and \ndestruction that, as sure as the night follows the day, will be in the \nnews tomorrow if the Senate doesn't start taking reasonable steps to \naddress forest health policy. It seems to me that is the approach \nbefore the Senate today.\n  Mr. President, this is the bill that is going to go to the President \nof the United States. For many months now, a group of us--and Chairman \nCochran has referenced this--have been involved in the negotiations. \nThey are difficult negotiations because passions do run so strong on \nthis issue. But I want to make it clear, for myself and the others who \nhave signed the letter,\n\n[[Page S13452]]\n\nthat we cannot accept an unraveling of this compromise; that this is \nthe bill that is going to go to the President's desk, and we are very \nhopeful the President will sign that legislation into law.\n  It is absolutely critical that the Senate come together on a \nreasonable plan that is going to help our forests become healthy again \nand secure the well-being of the families who call these beautiful \nareas their home.\n  I believe this bill provides an opportunity to remove fire-prone \nmaterials from the forests, boost rural economies, and create family-\nwage jobs, while at the same time protecting the extraordinary \ntreasures--the land and the environment of the West and our Nation--for \nfuture generations.\n  Let me outline for a few minutes why I think this is the approach \nthat needs to be signed into law. First, this is the only bill--unlike \nthe one in the other body--that authorizes a significant increase in \nfunding for the hazardous fuels reduction projects that need to be \nundertaken. The other body doesn't authorize a single dollar--not one--\nfor the projects that need to be pursued. As a result, there is \ntremendous concern across the country that if you were to go the route \nof the other body, the only people that would really be able to afford \nto get into the thinning work would be commercial logging \ncompanies. That would be a huge mistake. Under the bipartisan \ncompromise that has been crafted, that is not going to happen.\n\n  Second, the other body doesn't make an effort to target the dollars \nin a flexible way so that the work gets done in the communities that \nmost need it in our Nation. The Senate compromise goes to bat for our \nrural communities by directing that 50 percent of the funding be spent \ninside the wildland/urban interface where populations are great, but at \nthe same time we can deal with these infernos, these enormous fires \nthat so often start way out in the country and then come into the more \nurbanized areas.\n  The other body is silent on this issue. The Senate, after many hours \nof negotiation--my friend from Idaho and I have literally been talking \nabout this issue for almost 5 years now--strikes a reasonable balance \nwith respect to targeting money for the wildland/urban interface while \nrecognizing that so many of these huge fires start in sparsely \npopulated areas out in the country.\n  Third, this bill is the only one that makes a historic step forward \nto protect our old growth, our treasures of the West about which our \ncitizens feel so strongly. The other body has no language at all to \nprotect old growth or the large trees and doesn't limit how projects \ncan be executed.\n  What the Senate has said is, yes, there are more than 100 definitions \nof what constitutes ``old growth.'' We recognize that, but throughout \nthe bill we reference the priority to focus on the trees that are not \nold growth--the smaller trees, the brush--that contribute to this \nproblem. And then, to ensure that there is actually an incentive to \nprotect our old growth, we offer what I think is a creative approach, \nthe kind of approach Senator Craig and I offered when we broke the \ngridlock on the county payments bill years ago so our communities could \nget revenue for schools and roads. Here, to make sure that the old \ngrowth work is a top priority, that protecting old growth is not an \nafterthought, we say that with respect to the old forest plans, the \nForest Service would have to go back and revise the old forest plans to \nmake sure there is actual old growth protection that is going to go \nforward before the thinning gets put in place.\n  We have an actual incentive, beyond the statutory language, which is \na historic first and would protect old growth. We have a policy that \nwould actually create incentives to prioritize old growth protection \nbecause it has to be done first under the old forest plans for thinning \nwork to go forward.\n  Next, the bipartisan compromise effort keeps the current standard for \njudicial review of projects and ensures that what we have as a result \nof the changes in the judicial area, in the appeals area, sends a \nmessage across this country that citizens have a right of access with \nrespect to their concerns about timber sales, but they don't have a \nconstitutional right to a 5-year delay on every single timber sale.\n  The bipartisan group spent a great deal of time on this effort. In my \nview, the legislation that comes out of the other body would actually \nchange the outcomes of these lawsuits that would rob the judiciary of \nthe independent ability to weigh the evidence put before them. In the \nbipartisan compromise that was crafted, we strike a reasonable balance. \nCitizens are going to have a right that is undiluted with respect to \naccess to the judicial system, but we will not set up a litigation \nderby that goes on for years and years and keeps the essential work \nfrom going forward.\n\n  Next, the Senate legislation ensures that the public will always be \nin the debate, will always be in the process and at the table. The \nSenate compromise allows the public to actually propose alternatives \nunder the National Environmental Policy Act. The bill in the other body \nbasically drives the public out of the process by predetermining these \nNational Environmental Policy Act alternatives.\n  The Senate compromise preserves all current opportunities for public \ninput and appeal while streamlining the process and eliminating some of \nthe most frustrating and exasperating aspects of bureaucracy. But it is \nclear, and I want to make this point early in the debate, that not one \ncurrent opportunity--not one--for public comment would be lost under \nthis compromise.\n  The compromise requires the Forest Service to rewrite their appeals \nprocess using a process that has been used by the Bureau of Land \nManagement since 1984, and the sponsors of this compromise believe this \nwill change a process that is now confrontational to one that is vastly \nmore collaborative.\n  Finally, much of the argument made against this compromise is very \nsimilar to the arguments that were made in 1999 when I and Senator \nCraig and others got together and put before the Senate the Secure \nRural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. They said that was \ngoing to restrict the opportunities for citizens to be heard. There \nwere some, when I offered that legislation, who said I was proposing a \nclear cut for kids program, and we had pickets before our office for \nover a year. We have some of that same sort of activity going on right \nnow.\n  That did not happen in 1999 when the Senate moved forward with its \nfirst substantive forestry bill in more than a decade, and it is not \ngoing to happen again under this legislation if this bill actually \nbecomes law.\n  I say to my colleagues that this legislation is needed. Some have \nasked, Why can't the issue of healthy forests simply be addressed by \ninvesting in the fire plan? They have said the national Governors made \nsome recommendations, so why don't we just go ahead with those \nrecommendations?\n  Their suggestions were very useful, but the Governors even \nacknowledge that simply spending more money, the heart of their \nproposal, was not the entire answer. How that money is spent is as \nimportant as simply offering more dollars.\n  I have made it clear that I think additional funds are critically \nimportant. That is why the Senate bill authorizes an 80-percent \nincrease in funding for these thinning projects, but we also need to \nmake some changes in terms of the endless paperwork and redtape to \nactually get the real work on the ground that is so important in \ncommunities across the West.\n  A number of Senators have said this is as far as they can go in terms \nof forestry policy. I know colleagues in the Senate and certainly in \nthe other body feel strongly about it. But I reemphasize, as the \nSenator who organized that letter, that if there is an effort to \nunravel the compromise that will be voted on in the Senate, that will, \nin my view, kill the effort to pass this critically important \nlegislation. It was an urgent priority before the tragic events in \nCalifornia. I think it is urgent not just because the Senate needs to \nrespond in a heartfelt way to the tragedies in California, but if this \nlegislation is not passed, I think we will see what happened in Oregon \na little over a year ago and what has happened in California in the \nlast week repeated again and again. I am not willing to see these \ncommunities and the people who live in them turned into residents of \nsacrifice zones. It is urgent this legislation be passed.\n  I close by expressing my thanks to those who have been part of this \n5-year\n\n[[Page S13453]]\n\nodyssey and, first, to Senator Craig. I served as chairman of the \nsubcommittee when he was a ranking minority member. It is vice versa \nnow. Suffice it to say there are a lot of people in the country who \nwould say: What in the world can Larry Craig and Ron Wyden find common \nground on? And we have said again and again in this area that if people \nare willing to look at what is practical, what is a priority in terms \nof the thinning work that needs to be done and in protecting our old \ngrowth treasures, we can do it. That was accomplished in the county \npayments bill.\n  It can be accomplished now. Before I wrap up my remarks, I will read \ninto the Record part of a statement today that the administration has \nissued. It states that the administration strongly supports Senate \npassage of H.R. 1904, the bipartisan managers' amendment; it opposes \nany further amendment to assure quick resolution with the House.\n  I ask unanimous consent that statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       The Administration commends the Senate Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry Committee for reporting H.R. 1904, \n     which would provide authorities and authorizations for \n     appropriations that in large part are consistent with the \n     President's Healthy Forests Initiative. The Administration \n     strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 1904 and the \n     bipartisan manager's amendment (SA 1828), but opposes any \n     further amendment, to assure quick resolution with the House. \n     The Healthy Forests Restoration Act will provide the \n     Administration with the needed flexibility to manage public \n     lands wisely, and implement the kind of active forest \n     management that is good for both the environment and our \n     economy. This bill would further equip Federal land managers \n     with the additional tools they need to restore forest health, \n     safeguard habitat and watersheds, combat disease and insects, \n     and protect lives and communities. The Administration is \n     concerned that the authorization level in the Senate bill is \n     well above recently enacted funding levels and above the \n     increased funding levels the Administration requested and \n     continues to support for FY 2004.\n       The Healthy Forests Restoration Act establishes procedures \n     to expeditiously implement hazardous fuels reduction projects \n     on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands: (1) \n     near communities in the wildland urban interface; (2) on high \n     risk lands in the proximity of municipal water sources; (3) \n     on high risk lands that encompass habitat for threatened and \n     endangered species where federal wildlife officials have \n     identified catastrophic wildfire as a threat to the viability \n     of the species; and (4) on high risk landscapes particularly \n     susceptible to disease or insect infestation. Additionally, \n     the bill would: (1) facilitate the utilization of wood, \n     brush, residue, and other biomass removed in conjunction with \n     forest health projects in the production of biomass energy; \n     (2) authorize federal programs to support community-based \n     watershed forestry partnerships that address critical forest \n     stewardship, watershed protection, and restoration needs at \n     the state and local level (3) direct additional research \n     focused on the early detection and containment of insect and \n     disease infestations; and (4) establish a voluntary private \n     forestland easement program focused on recovering forest \n     ecosystem types in decline.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am pleased to see what is the first formal statement of \nthe administration saying that the Senate bill is the way to go. It is \nan acknowledgment of the fact that a number of us said we cannot have \nthis compromise unravel, and it is a constructive statement from the \nadministration today. I commend them for it.\n  In addition to Senator Craig, who has worked with me on this for \nliterally 5 years, Senator Smith and I cannot go anywhere in our home \nState without people asking, when is the Senate going to respond to \nthis? I thank him for his efforts, as well as those of Senator Crapo, \nwho is in the Chamber. I see Senator Bingaman, who has been so helpful \nto me as I have had to wrestle with these issues that come up in my \nhome State day after day.\n  We have not agreed on every single bit of this debate for 5 years, \nbut Senator Bingaman has performed an extraordinarily important \nservice. He has some ideas on a matter that has been documented in our \nhearings with respect to how these funds get moved around, almost \nmanipulated, from one account to another when there is underfunding of \nthe thinning work that needs to be done. I thank him for all of his \nhelp over the last 5 years. We have spent many hours on this.\n  With the statement that I have just put into the Record that the \nadministration wants this legislation and is opposed to efforts to \nalter it, I think we are in a position to show the country the Senate \ncan find common ground on an issue that is about as contentious as any \nimaginable. I look forward to seeing the amendments of our colleagues \nand getting this critically important legislation passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, it is an honor for me to participate in \nthis debate, not only because of the importance of this legislation, \nwhich I will talk about in a minute, but because of the process which \nhas brought us here and what the public is now observing.\n  As for the last little while, they have observed leaders on both \nsides of the aisle talk in support of a highly contentious issue that \nwe have been trying to bring to resolution in this country for years. \nToday, we have before the Senate a bipartisan solution, one that is the \nresult of literally years of effort by a number of Senators who I will \nmention, and the result of a collaborative effort to bring together the \nSenators from various perspectives and negotiate an outcome that would \nhave the common ground to build positive solutions for the future and \nmuch more benefit to all sides than the conflict which has been so much \na part of this issue over the last few years.\n  I hope as this debate proceeds that the public will notice what is \nhappening in the Senate today, as we see strong leadership from both \nsides of the aisle stepping forward, reaching a compromise that \nprobably none of us would have crafted ourselves but which moves the \nissue much more further forward than anything we have seen in the past.\n  I will speak for a minute about how this came about. We have already \nheard several comments today about those who have worked on this from \nthe past. It just so happens that Idaho--Senator Craig was on the floor \nand will be back in a moment--has two Senators who happen, just by \ncircumstance, to be the chairmen of the two forestry committees in the \nSenate. Senator Craig chairs the forestry subcommittee of the Energy \nCommittee. Senator Wyden from Oregon, who just spoke, is his ranking \nmember. I chair the forestry subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee. \nMy ranking member is Blanche Lambert Lincoln, who is a cosponsor of the \nbase legislation, which was initially put forward in the Agriculture \nCommittee and which became the vehicle around which these negotiations \ncentered.\n  Senator Craig, Senator Wyden, Senator Smith from Oregon, myself, \nBlanche Lambert Lincoln, Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Cochran, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nboth of the Senators from Arizona, Mr. Kyl and Mr. McCain, along with \nSenator Feinstein from California, Senator Baucus from Montana, and \nother Senators came together and said: We must find a way to get past \nthe intense battles that always bring this legislation down and find a \nway to build a path forward, one that protects the environment, \nprotects the natural resource-based economy, protects our urban and \nrural communities, and protects the world from the environmental \nimpacts of the devastation of these forest fires. It is that which we \nhave before us today.\n  I thank my chairman, Senator Cochran in particular, for the strong \nleadership he has provided; and Senator Domenici and Senator Craig from \nthe Energy Committee who have provided such strong and consistent \nleadership on this issue.\n  Why is it that I say this is such an important and critical issue to \nAmerica? Everybody in America who is looking at the news right now is \nwatching what is happening in California. In California, fires are \nraging. The death toll is mounting. The devastation to the environment \nis obvious. What is happening there now is an example of what has been \nhappening across America for years, as we have fallen into an inability \nto implement forest management decisions in America on our public \nlands. I do not have the exact statistic in front of me, but I believe \nthe 10-year average is that we have seen something in the neighborhood \nof 4\n\n[[Page S13454]]\n\nmillion acres of forest ground burn a year. For the last 4 years the \nnumbers were approximately 3.3 million acres this year, 7 million acres \nlast year, 3.3 or 3.7 million acres the year before, and then another \n7-plus million acres the year before that.\n\n  These acres burn in devastating ways, destroying wildlife and \nhabitat, destroying our forests, and causing other significant damage \nto rural and urban communities, to natural resource-based economies in \nStates such as Idaho, where we rely on a timber economy.\n  Another aspect that is not often noticed is it is delivering to the \natmosphere immense amounts of carbon dioxide. In fact, I am looking for \nsome of the statistics on this, but the amount of gas that is put into \nthe atmosphere, in terms of the kinds of debates we are having over \ngreenhouse gases and global warming, is phenomenal. To give one \nexample, the Hayman fire in Colorado recently was analyzed and it was \ndetermined that in 1 day of that fire's burning, it put enough \nCO2 in the atmosphere to equal the amount of CO2 that all of \nthe cars in the United States put into the atmosphere on that day.\n  If we multiply that times the number of fires we have been having \nover the years, the load of CO2 or greenhouse gases into the \nenvironment that is caused by the forest fires becomes a monumentally \nlarge issue in relationship to our efforts to control global warming.\n  Forest fires go from the broad issues of global warming to the narrow \nissues of a small community such as the community in Idaho that I \nrecently visited, Elk City, which I at that time said was ground zero \nfor this debate, a little community that is literally at the end of the \nroad, in the middle of a tremendously beautiful forest in which the \nfuel load has been building year after year and now has a higher fuel \nload by several factors than the fuel load in Yellowstone when the \nYellowstone fire started a few years ago.\n  This community has only one road in and one road out. They have been \ncrying for support from the Federal system, to have some kind of \nprotection of their community in terms of just what the threat is to \nloss of life, let alone the threat of the loss to their economy that \nwould be caused by a forest fire. This little city, Elk City, ID, is as \nmuch involved and interested in this issue as are those who are \nbattling over global warming issues. It is for that reason this \nlegislation is so critical to our Nation.\n  I want to go over a little bit about the compromise, because the \ncompromise we have reached today is a very broad-based critical \ncompromise. It brings together a number of important pieces of the \ndebate that have been counterpoints in conflict in the past and have \nnow come together as part of a commonsense solution.\n  First, resources are provided in this bill for forest management at a \nsignificant level and in a significant way. One of the things we know \nis that prevention is critical. Madam President, $760 million in annual \nfunding for fuels reduction on Federal lands has been provided in this \nlegislation and that can be used also in related grants for State and \nprivate forestry programs. Fifty percent of these resources are \nrequired to be used in the wildland/urban interface, one of the \ncritical areas we are now watching as the fires burn in California.\n  This critical wildland/urban interface is defined by local \ncommunities. We implement and follow the recommendations of the Western \nGovernors Association as they talk about the collaborative process that \nneeds to be put into place so citizen involvement can be enhanced in \ndefining and implementing the protection plans for protecting our \nforests and the related communities, both rural and urban.\n  Second, this legislation for the first time in legislation proposes \nspecific protection for old growth in the forests. Where there are old-\ngrowth stands in the forest, this legislation provides those who are \nimplementing fuel reduction programs must protect those old-growth \nstands to the maximum extent they can. Conversely, it also provides \nthat hazardous fuel reduction projects are intended to focus on small-\ndiameter trees, thinning, and strategic fuel breaks, and should retain \nthe large trees as appropriate for resilient stands. The point is the \nfocus on small-diameter timber in these fuel reduction programs is \ngoing to provide opportunities for some of the communities that have \nbeen hit so hard by the reduction of logging and timber activities to \nfind alternative sources for their economy to grow.\n  In Cascade, ID, we have a company that is trying to get started now, \nwhich is providing unique new ways of utilizing small-diameter timber \nto help in restoring and protecting our environment after fires have \ngone through, using the very small-diameter timber we are talking about \nin these forest fire prevention plans.\n  I should make clear, the focus on small-diameter timber is not to \nturn our back on the need to reform and solve the problems with regard \nto timber activity and logging activity. We can and should have a \nstrong, healthy, natural-resource-based environment as well as strong, \nhealthy forests. We can achieve those objectives. This bill is going to \nhelp us implement a number of the important provisions that will \nachieve those objectives.\n  Next, as the Senator from Oregon has already indicated, it protects \npublic involvement. One of the things it does is it limits the number \nof alternatives the Forest Service must consider. Our minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, already indicated the expense and the time delay that \nis caused by the drive, under our current system, to force endless \nanalysis but delaying getting to the implementation part of forest \nmanagement decisions. This bill requires that in addition to the \nproposed fuel reduction program that is adopted by the Forest Service, \nthe Forest Service must also consider the ``no action'' alternative, \nand at least one other alternative, if it becomes appropriate under the \ncollaborative process that is moving forward, allowing for citizens to \npropose alternatives and have the Forest Service consider those \nalternatives as the process moves forward, but providing some relief so \nthe Forest Service can get on with the decisionmaking.\n\n  In addition, what I have called litigation paralysis is addressed. \nOne of the problems we face in forest management decisions today, \npossibly the biggest one, is that under our current system, no matter \nhow much evaluation and study is put in, no matter how many \nalternatives are considered, at the end of the day the proposal that is \nadopted is litigated and we end up in paralysis through continuous \nlitigation that simply stops the process from moving forward.\n  Let me give an example. A couple of years ago I went to a forest in \nIdaho. I was taken there by the Forest Service employees who had \nproposed a thinning project to address an insect infestation problem. \nThey explained to me why this forest, both in terms of forest fire and \nin terms of its health and safety against insect infestation, needed to \nhave this thinning project proceed.\n  I was impressed with what they taught me. I went away thinking this \nforest is going to have some improvement. I went back to the same \nforest several years later. No thinning activity had taken place. I was \nthere with the same people. I asked them what had happened. They \nadvised me they had their decision challenged in court and, although \nthey had ultimately prevailed in the litigation, it was now 2 years \nlater and it was too late. The insect infestation had gone too far; \nthere was no point in doing the thinning project. The forest for that \npurpose had been lost. It is now a fire hazard, not to mention the fact \nthe health of the forest itself has been sacrificed.\n  The Forest Service won the litigation, but the delay of the \nlitigation stopped the ability to implement the management decision. \nThat is just one example of the kind of thing we are talking about.\n  By the way, in that case I said, What was the issue? They explained \nto me the issue that was litigated.\n  I said, Why didn't you just concede that. It was not that big of an \nissue.\n  They said, The way we won the litigation is to basically concede that \npoint and then ask permission from the court to go on because it really \nwasn't central to our efforts.\n  The response they gave me was: This issue was never raised as we were \nputting together the alternatives, going through the NEPA project. We \ndidn't know we were going to get challenged on this or we could have \naccommodated it as we were moving along.\n\n[[Page S13455]]\n\n  My point is that an entity, a group that wanted to stop this thinning \nproject, sat back and let the entire process proceed without ever \nraising their concerns in the citizen involvement process. They waited \nuntil that entire process had come to a conclusion and then filed a \nlawsuit. The first time the Forest Service found out about this issue \nwas then.\n\n  These kinds of issues are addressed in this bill. For example, we are \nrequiring the Forest Service to develop a new appeals process that is \nsimilar to the predecisional appeals process the Department of Interior \nnow uses. This is important, because it gives those who are concerned \nabout good decisionmaking at the Forest Service, and who are already \ninvolved in the public process, the ability to challenge that through \nan appeal before the final decision is made, a predecisional appeal \nprocess. Then if they still do not like the outcome, nothing stops them \nfrom filing a lawsuit at the end of the process. We are expanding and \nenhancing the ability of involvement here by the public.\n  However, we are saying to individuals and groups who want to \nchallenge these decisions you must get involved at the beginning. Those \nwho want to challenge these decisions must show they have been involved \nin the process and participated in the public involvement process from \nthe beginning. They also must show they have exhausted their \nadministrative efforts, their administrative remedies. If they have a \nremedy with the Forest Service, they should go to the Forest Service \nthrough its appeals process, and exhaust that process first before \nsimply filing a lawsuit and moving the whole process into litigation \nparalysis. With the enhanced citizen involvement we have provided, once \na decision gets made, if there are those who are still unhappy, they \nhave a right to file a lawsuit under this legislation.\n  What the courts must do at that point is expeditiously move the \nlitigation. In the legislation the courts are encouraged to expedite \nthese cases.\n  Second, this legislation limits the injunction that the court can \nissue to 60 days and allows continuous unlimited 60-day renewals but \nrequires those who would come into court to simply stop anything from \nhappening to show the court at 60-day intervals updated information \nthat the grounds for stopping the action still exist and they haven't \nbeen resolved in some way.\n  Finally, it requires the court to balance the harms of what would \nhappen if we don't do the thinning project or the proposed fuel \nreduction project, future harms that could come as a result of that \nagainst the current harm of what the injunction is proposed to stop. It \nsimply requires a court to balance those harms as they evaluate whether \nto issue an injunction.\n  There are those who say the injunction should be issued no matter \nwhat because once a tree is thinned or cut it can never be put back. \nThe response to that is, as true as that is, if you look to the future \nand to the future harms, once the insects take the forest, you can't \nbring it back easily, and those trees are dead, too. Once the forest \nburns, you can't then rebuild a healthy forest that you would have been \nable to do had you implemented these decisions.\n  All we are saying in this legislation is that the court must balance \nthe harms from inaction against the harms of the proposed action in \nterms of issuing the injunction.\n  These are important factors that will help us break the litigation \nparalysis but still provide significant public input and significant \npublic support and the rights of the public to challenge the decisions \nmade by the Forest Service.\n  There are a number of other important parts of this legislation. \nThere are critics of this legislation, and I assume that at some point \nthroughout the debate today and tomorrow--as long as it goes--there \nwill be an opportunity and a need to respond to some of the charges \nabout this legislation. I will not go into all of that now.\n  I will simply conclude by saying again what we have before us today \nis a bill that is probably different than any one of the Senators who \ncame together from both sides of the aisle would have drafted if they \nhad drafted it on their own. But it represents a bill that goes to \nevery issue that has been the cause for stalling which has stopped us \nfrom being able to get the legislation through, and it has resulted in \ncompromising to move us forward in every one of those areas. We provide \nthe resources. We provide protection for old growth. We provide \nprotection for public and citizen involvement. We assure that the \nprocess for litigation is streamlined but is still meaningful. And, \nmost importantly, we make it so that once our forest managers--those \nwho have studied, the scientists who know what our forests need--have \ncome up with a plan and have made it through the public process and \nthrough litigation they will actually have a real meaningful \nopportunity to implement forest management decisions.\n  This legislation is critical for Americans. It is unfortunate that we \nhave to be debating it while we are watching California burn. But \nnevertheless the pressure from the forest fires over the last few years \nhas shown us across America that it is time for us to come together as \nwe have on this legislation and take this important step to protect our \nforests, to protect our natural resource base economy, to protect our \ncommunities, and to protect the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nH.R. 1904 title I compromise reached by many of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. I commend them for their work. The issue we take up \ntoday is vital. It is important to our ecology and it is important to \nour economy.\n  When I first entered public life as an Oregon State Senator in 1992, \nthe Pacific Northwest was embroiled in the spotted-owl wars. There was \na great debate--and there has been ever since--about what to do with \nour public resources and how they ought best be managed.\n  In the course of this debate, I have through my public office tried \nto weigh in on the side of those who elected me to public trust. I come \nfrom a part of my State that is rural. I have as my neighbors farmers \nand foresters. I have seen in their eyes the desperation that comes \nfrom watching the slow undoing of their industry and in recent times \nthe destruction of even their homes. I watch with great sadness as we \nview many of our fellow citizens from California view the ashes of \ntheir lives as a result of catastrophic fires that surround their \ncommunities and burn up their homes. Their cries are heart wrenching. I \nexpect because they are heard so clearly in this body that we are now \ntaking up this legislation that has long been overdue for our country's \nsake. But long before I heard the cries of Californians, I heard the \ncries of Oregonians.\n  In the State of Oregon, from the spotted-owl wars we have laid off \ntens of thousands of workers. We have watched their lives be undone in \nrural communities. We have closed our mills, and we have since watched \nour forests burn. Now my State leads this country in both hunger and in \nunemployment, and it has much to do with the forest policy of this \ncountry.\n  Timber is a renewable resource. It is the one natural resource that \ngrows back constantly. It is safe to say--indeed even provable to say--\nthat in the State of Oregon today there is more timber growing than \nwhen Lewis and Clark went there 200 years ago. That is because for a \ncentury while we have harvested trees, we have replanted what has been \nharvested. But if you listen to the great newspapers of this country, \nthe New York Times and the Washington Post, and you actually believe \nwhat they purport to represent about my State, you would come away with \nthe impression that we are about to cut down the last pine tree in the \nPacific Northwest. But, again, the truth is much different.\n  What we see in California--and so often in the Pacific Northwest, \nMontana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington--is that these fires, which are \na normal occurrence in forests, are now on a scale that is truly \nhaunting. We are leaving millions of acres no longer as old-growth \nforest but as literally moonscapes.\n  What I want my colleagues to understand as we go into this debate is \nthat many of the forests which environmental groups have pled that we \nprotect are in large part gone or in serious jeopardy. They are not \ngone because of logging. They are not gone because of\n\n[[Page S13456]]\n\nroad building. They are not gone because of development. They are gone \nbecause of bureaucracy, bugs, and burning. Now we find that so many of \nour forests have carbon dioxide in the air and charcoal match sticks on \nthe ground.\n  Here is a visual which shows a fire this summer around the Bend, OR, \narea. This is a fire the previous summer, the Biscuit Fire in the \nSiskiyou National Forest.\n  What we are finding in places such as this fire is trees aren't \ngrowing back; rather, brush is growing back so that, particularly, new \ntrees can't grow. Yet we are not allowed to go in there and manage the \nsoil. It is growing so thick that it may be a long time before trees \never begin to manifest themselves. The Biscuit fire was the largest in \nOregon recorded history. It is also a monument to the mistaken notion \nthat wrapping redtape around our forests will save them from wildfires. \nWildfires do not stop at lines drawn on a map. This we see clearly in \nCalifornia today.\n\n  Another area is the Rogue, Siskiyou National Forest. So the public \nunderstands the extent of this devastation, this fire was larger than \nthe State of Rhode Island. It was four times the size of the District \nof Columbia. In this forest, 85 percent of the roadless area that was \ndesignated is gone; 77 percent of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness in the same \nfire is gone; 68 percent of the wild and scenic river corridor is gone; \nover 70 percent of the spotted owl habitat in this enormous area is \ngone. Those birds have been burned up.\n  The message from the ground could not be clearer: Catastrophic \nwildfire, not logging, not roadbuilding, not development, is killing \nforests in Oregon. I like the words of Oregon's former Governor, John \nKitzhaber, who, after seeing the fires, said: If we burn down the \nforests, we are not going to have a resource to argue over.\n  He was right. And we are right to pursue this legislation today.\n  I say to my colleagues that there may be some doing the bidding of \nenvironmental organizations that will come to the Senate and will offer \namendments designed to kill this legislation, so that the health of our \nforests cannot be ensured.\n  Many of my colleagues on the Democratic side have shown enormous \ncourage. Chief among them is my colleague, Ron Wyden, in coming up with \na compromise.\n  I plead with all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, that they \nhold to this agreement that the Democratic leader has now endorsed. \nThis has to happen for our country's sake. It is literally a life-and-\ndeath issue. I plead with those who have amendments to think again \nabout it. This legislation truly needs to pass.\n  I was struck by a comment on the Web site of the Sierra Club. I \nunderstand one of the amendments may be a roadless initiative. That may \nbe fine to debate in isolation or as part of a separate piece of \nlegislation, but if presented to frustrate this agreement, it is truly \nunfortunate. The Sierra Club Web site tells us that roadless forests \n``provide sources of clean water to millions of Americans, essential \nhabitat for wildlife, and special places to hike, hunt, camp and \nfish.'' That is true, unless what can be seen in this picture happens \nto the roadless area.\n  We have every reason to pass this moderate legislation. Many on the \nRepublican side would have crafted something that goes even further \nthan this legislation. We would have done something like the House of \nRepresentatives, which I endorsed. We are now holding to this \nagreement. We will be voting against amendments, even ones we may like, \nthat are designed to kill this legislation. I hope everyone will hold \nto the deal. If we hold to the deal here, we will hold to the deal in \nconference, and that will leave America's forests and America's \nforesters the better.\n  For the sake of our ecology and the sake of our economy, I urge the \npassage of this bill and thank all of my colleagues, Republican and \nDemocrat, who have had a hand in crafting this Senate compromise. They \nhave done their work and will leave our Nation better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I will talk about the bill pending and \nshare some thoughts and concerns I have about the bill.\n  This is not a matter of light substance that is before the Senate. \nThis is not a bill that we can take a wink and a nod and let it go \nbecause everyone agrees this is a unanimous consent bill. It is true \nthat it did come out of our committee, the Agriculture Committee, on a \nvoice vote. We reached agreements to go ahead and get it to the floor.\n  There are a lot of things in the bill I can agree with, that I think \nare good and necessary; there are some other things about which I have \nconcerns and a lot of Senators have concerns. This is a bill that is \nopen for amendment. There will be a number of amendments offered to \nthis bill to try to strengthen it and to answer some concerns people \nhave.\n  I am somewhat amazed when we come out with legislation and it deals \nwith sensitive environmental issues and we are told certain \nenvironmental groups have concerns and we will hear about the \nenvironmental issues so that somehow, if you are a member of an \nenvironmental organization, you are opposed to progress, you are \nopposed to jobs, you are opposed to doing things that might make life \nbetter for some people in certain areas. It is almost as if \n``environmentalist'' is a bad word. I don't think it is. I think being \npro-environment and being an environmentalist is a positive attribute.\n  I compliment those in our country, many of whom work for nonprofit \norganizations. I have a number of letters from them that I will have \nprinted in the Record. They toil endlessly, tirelessly, sometimes for \nno pay, sometimes for little pay, to ensure that future generations of \nAmericans have a good, healthy environment, that those who like to hunt \nhave areas in which we can hunt, where we have healthy wildlife areas.\n  I am proud of the fact that in our last farm bill we had the biggest \nincrease ever in conservation, an 80 percent increase. To me, this is \nnot only pro-environment; it is pro-economy; it is pro-jobs; it is pro-\ngrowth but growth in a way that is sustainable, not just for our time \nand our place but for future generations.\n  That is why the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is not \nsomething that can be lightly passed through. We have to look at it and \ntalk about it. I compliment those who have worked hard to reach \nagreements and tried to reach compromises on this legislation. That is \nall well and good. I compliment Members on both sides of the aisle. \nThey have worked very hard to get to a point where we have a bill that \nhas broad support. I don't deny the bill has broad support. That does \nnot mean those who have some concerns about certain aspects of the bill \ncould be stopped from talking about it and offering amendments. That is \nwhat the legislative process is all about.\n  We will proceed in that regard deliberately, not in a way to stop \nanything. This is not a method of slowing down the bill or taking an \nundue amount of time, but it is ensuring that we do look at the bill \ncarefully; that the public is generally aware of what is in the bill; \nthat those who perhaps do not spend a lot of time looking at these \nthings--and I am the first to admit this is not an area of my \nexpertise, but as the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, \ncharged with the responsibility of legislation that impinges upon our \nnational forests that comes under our jurisdiction, I make sure I have \ngood staff who understand the impact of forest legislation. And I have \ntaken the time to study it myself to the extent I have had the time to \ndo so.\n\n  I do not pretend to know all the ins and outs of forest legislation \nas much as my friend from Oregon, for example, who has spent his adult \nlife working on this, or the Senator from Idaho and others who I know \nhave put a great deal of time in this. But that does not lessen my \nconcern about certain aspects of the bill and its impact on our \nenvironment. So we will have a discussion and we will have amendments.\n  Preventing damage and injury to communities is of paramount concern \nto all of us, especially now with the tragic wildfires in California \nthat show clearly the dangers these communities face. Of course, our \nhearts and our thoughts go out to all those families in those \ncommunities that are affected by these wildfires.\n  Now, again I point out that this bill passed by a voice vote to allow \nus more\n\n[[Page S13457]]\n\ntime in order to reach a consensus on this agreement, and that is the \nsubstitute amendment offered by Chairman Cochran. The vote out of the \ncommittee was not--and I wish to state this very clearly--any kind of \nunanimous endorsement of the bill as a whole. It was merely our \nagreement to move the process forward.\n  The legislation before us purports to focus the Federal Government's \nefforts to reduce the dangers of wildfire and improve forest health. \nNow, of course, all of us want to achieve this goal so that our \ncommunities out west can be better protected from catastrophic \nwildfires, so that forest areas around the country can better cope with \nthe onset of disease and insect infestation, and so that we can improve \nthe overall health of our national forests and public lands.\n  I am heartened that several Senators from both sides of the aisle \nhave endorsed a legislative compromise to title I of the bill. This, of \ncourse, is the title that has drawn the most focus because it covers \nhazardous fuel reductions on Federal lands, and, as such, it is also \nthe most controversial portion of the legislation. I believe it is a \nstep in the right direction. I believe it comes up a little short, and \nthat is why we will have some amendments in that area.\n  Again, I will say that much of the bill is worthy of support. In \naddition to title I, there are seven other titles, ranging from \nwatershed forestry assistance to rural community forest enterprise \nprograms, with others, and again the bulk of these provisions are non--\nI will not say not debatable, but they raise no really contentious \nissues. But I would like to take this time to talk a little more about \ntitle I.\n  Simply put, I still continue to have some serious concerns about this \nsection. For one, the bill lacks sufficient targeting to conduct \nhazardous fuel work in the areas that need it the most, which likely \nmight waste limited Government dollars. The Forest Service's own \nresearch has concluded that the areas immediately surrounding homes and \nstructures are where the fuel cleanup should be done, as it is the most \neffective and cost-efficient method for reducing fire risk.\n  The language in the bill requires that only 50 percent of the \nhazardous fuel dollars be spent in what is known as the wildland/urban \ninterface. Again, because of the bill's loose definition of the \ninterface or of the community protection zone, land miles away from \nhomes and other structures could qualify. Ensuring that a higher \npercentage of this work would be done in the areas at risk to human \nlife and property would vastly enhance our community protection \nefforts.\n\n  Again, there is no definition of the size of a community. So one has \nto ask: Just what kind of communities are we talking about? Well, I \nhappen to come from a town of 150 people. I live there. To me, that is \na community. Two or three houses out someplace, to me, is not.\n  As I was saying to my friend from Oregon earlier, if someone wants to \nbuild a house out in an area that is on the ocean, that is subject to \nhurricanes and tidal waves and weather such as that, they take their \nown risk. If they want to do that, they are at risk. If they want to go \nwhere the floods happen and a hurricane comes up and wipes a house \naway, well, it is not primarily the Federal Government's \nresponsibility, it is not primarily the taxpayers' responsibility to go \nout and build seawalls to protect that house. If someone wants to build \na house in an area where there are mud slides all the time, it is not \nour responsibility to come in and build up structures to protect that \nhouse from a mud slide. If they want to build it on the side of a \ncliff, God love them. If they can get the insurance for it, fine, but \nit should not be the taxpayers' responsibility.\n  So if someone wants to build a house out in a wilderness area, fine, \nI have no problem with that. They can do that. But I do not know that \nwe then have the responsibility as taxpayers to come in and say we are \ngoing to spend millions of dollars to protect your house from a \nwildfire. Now, where that cutoff is, I do not know. I am not here to \nsay the cutoff is 150 people or 200, but there has to be some better \ndefinition of structure for communities.\n  The way the bill is right now, we could spend a lot of money going \nout and cleaning out the brush. And, by the way, I will have something \nto say about that. We are not talking about brush. We are talking about \ntrees. It could be miles, tens of hundreds of miles, away from any \ncommunity. So again I question whether that is where we want to put our \nresources.\n  I understand there may be an amendment, or there will be an amendment \noffered to raise that 50 percent threshold to something more akin to 70 \nor 75 percent, which I think is maybe more where we ought to focus our \nresources, with the very few dollars that we have.\n  Secondly, the bill could also be interpreted to allow logging on \nvirtually all Federal lands other than wilderness or wilderness study \nareas. This means national monuments and other areas could be logged in \nthe name of wildfire prevention. The old growth language contains \nnumerous exceptions so large that even ancient trees, trees that were \naround before our country was a country, could be logged.\n  The President traveled around the West this summer arguing that we \nneed to remove small trees and brush from damaged forests. The \nscientific community agrees with him. But these same scientists tell us \nthat cutting bigger and older trees can actually make fire risks worse. \nLogging, after all, is a part of what created the fire conditions that \nthis bill is supposed to address.\n  Now, you might say: Well, how can that be? If you cut down trees, how \ncan you have forest fires? Well, by logging, by taking out certain \ntrees, you leave a lot of brush, you leave a lot of stuff on the \nground; plus, you take out some of the overhang of the ancient trees \nthat tend to keep the risk of brushfires down; plus the fact, when you \ndo logging, of course, you put in roads. Whenever you have a road, then \nyou have people coming in. When you have people coming in, they are \nbuilding campfires and doing things such as that, and that also \nincreases the risk of fire.\n\n  Another problem I have with this legislation is the lack of \nprotection for roadless areas, those areas of our national forests that \nhave wisely been left free from most logging and roadbuilding to ensure \ntheir protection. In fact, this bill does not restrict roadbuilding at \nall--at all. So you could have permanent roads built anywhere under \nthis bill.\n  If we did restrict some of this roadbuilding, we would have less fire \nrisk, and greater ecosystem benefits. This is because the forests in \nthese undeveloped areas have experienced less damage by past management \npractices. They are much less in need of remedial work themselves. And \nthey tend to be the furthest away from homes and communities. Moreover, \nscientists tell us that fires are more common and larger in developed \nforests. As I said earlier, roads bring people. People bring accidents \nthat start fires.\n  While I am a strong believer in access to public lands, it depends on \nwhat kind of access we are talking about. We have to realize building \nroads to reduce fire risks can be very self-defeating. So I am \nconcerned about a lack of protection from the building of roads in \ncurrently roadless areas.\n  Some people say this is a contentious issue. It is an important \nissue. It is one that concerns a number of environmentalists and other \npeople around the country, especially those who have tried to protect \nour natural forests that have been left free from logging.\n  The bill also limits the reach of what may have been called the heart \nof NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act. I know there are some \nwho would like to get rid of NEPA completely, just get it off the \nbooks. There are some who would like to see that happen. But NEPA is \nthe heart of our environmental policy. Simply put, it requires the \nFederal Government to look at a reasonable range of alternatives to any \nproposed course of action. Yet the language in this bill arbitrarily \nrestricts a full and robust environmental analysis to only the agency's \npreferred alternative, a no-action alternative--which is really not an \nalternative because a no-action alternative means you don't do \nanything--and possibly one additional alternative.\n  It boils down to the fact that NEPA would be required to look at two \nalternatives, not a reasonable range of alternatives but two. The one \nalternative doesn't even have to be environmentally preferable. It \ncould be a proposal for more and heavier logging of\n\n[[Page S13458]]\n\nbig trees. Again, this effectively undermines what has been called the \nheart of NEPA; that is, to look at a reasonable range of alternatives \nto a proposed agency course of action.\n  What this bill basically could leave us with is one alternative. That \nis not what NEPA was intended to do. It calls for a reasonable range of \nalternatives. This effectively undermines a landmark law of immense \nvalue--a landmark law that has been in existence for about 30 years.\n  We will hear from some who say that the NEPA analysis takes time; it \ncosts money. What we won't hear is how important this time and money is \nfor realizing better outcomes.\n  NEPA analysis is designed to ensure that more effective or more \nefficient approaches are considered before an agency reaches a final \ndecision on how to proceed with a project. Too little attention has \nbeen paid to date to the fact that thinning may or may not be effective \nin reducing fire risk. The scientists tell us that it needs to be \ndesigned carefully and in light of many site-specific factors, if it is \nlikely to succeed.\n  There is the general perception that if we just go out and clear out \nall that underbrush and take out trees, certain trees, it is going to \nprotect us from forest fires. That may or may not be true, depending \nupon the site and the specificity of what they are doing. That is \nexactly why we need good, solid NEPA--National Environmental Policy \nAct--analysis for this work, particularly the larger the projects and \ntrees involved and the more sensitive the places. Otherwise, if we \ndon't consider alternatives, we will be wasting time and taxpayers' \nmoney that we can't spare on projects that don't help and may even hurt \nin terms of protecting against wildfire.\n  We ought to look more closely at the Forest Service and Bureau of \nLand Management inefficiencies in carrying out their NEPA obligations \nrather than attacking what has been referred to as the Magna Carta of \nenvironmental law. Routine forest health projects can confidently \nproceed without lengthy environmental review, as long as they stick to \nsmall trees and brush, developed forests, and no new roads. Once you \nget into that, that is when we need the environmental review.\n\n  I also want to make clear from the beginning that you will hear a lot \nof talk about small trees and brush. It is my understanding that these \nsmall trees can go up to 12 inches or greater in diameter and that \nthese are the trees that loggers want now. These seem to be what is in \ndemand. I am not a contractor. I don't build houses and stuff like \nthat. But I am to understand that these are the ones most in demand \nright now, trees up to 12 inches and greater in diameter. That is a \npretty good size tree. That is not brush. But that is what we are \ntalking about here, going out and clearing those trees. That is why we \nneed a good, healthy NEPA analysis of what we are talking about, what \nthe alternatives could be.\n  The bill before us also exempts hazardous fuel projects from the \nnormal administrative appeals process for what we are told will be \nsomething similar to the BLM's appeals process. This predecisional \nprocess, it is argued, will help expedite projects toward their \ncompletion by making projects more collaborative and less \nconfrontational.\n  But this new, undefined process threatens to cut out or unfairly \nlimit citizen participation in agency decisions. The bill currently \ndoes not have meaningful standards for the new process to ensure that \nall the talk we hear about preserving public participation is \nfulfilled.\n  Let me repeat that. The bill before us does not have meaningful \nstandards to ensure that we preserve public participation to the \nfullest. This is not good public policy. These national forests belong \nto us all. They belong to you and they belong to me. They belong to you \nand they belong to our kids and our grandkids and future generations. \nThe public ought to be participating and should be heard and should \nhave meaningful participation in agency decisions regarding forest \npolicy. The bill should spell out the Forest Service appeals process. \nIt does not do that. So we don't really know how the public is going to \nbe involved. The language may provide too much discretion and too \nlittle accountability to the public. This needs to be cleared up.\n  Let me say a few words about the judicial review provisions of the \nlegislation. I do not believe they represent a major response to the \nsituation. Among other things, the bill limits preliminary injunctions \nto 60 days. You do have the right to renew, but it limits it to 60 days \nand stipulates that courts balance the short- and long-term effects of \nundertaking and not undertaking a hazardous fuels reduction project.\n  The limit on injunctions will make additional work for judges that \ncould actually slow them down in reaching a final decision. The \nbalance-of-harms language in the bill is unnecessary and intrusive, as \ncourts have always done this. Moreover, the presence in this bill of \nthat language could be read as implying direction to change the current \nprocess in some way. This could tilt the scales to one side or another \nregardless of the facts in a particular case.\n  Again, let me point out something else we hear about: the flood of \nlawsuits. There is no flood of lawsuits clogging up the courts and \npreventing us from moving ahead in hazardous rules reduction projects. \nThe GAO study of hazardous fuel reduction projects found that only 3 \npercent of all fuels cases were litigated in 2000 and 2001, covering \nonly 100,000 acres.\n  I will repeat that. Our GAO--our investigator--found only 3 percent \nof the hazardous fuels cases were litigated in 2000 and 2001, and \nplaintiffs were often not environmental groups but local communities, \noutdoor enthusiasts, and timber interests. Of the 762 cases, only 4 \nwere delayed by court order during the litigation. Again, out of 762 \ncases, only 4 were delayed by court order during the litigation, and \nthat is about five-tenths of a percent of all the cases.\n  Yet we are told we have to do something here to clean up the plugging \nup of our courts by all these environmentalists, that litigate and come \nto court to stop the agency from proceeding. Nonsense.\n  With regard to appeals of agency decisions, the argument that there \nis some sort of crisis holding up these projects simply doesn't hold \nwater. The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management's own \ndatabase lists about 3,500 fuels reduction projects they conducted \nbetween 1998 and 2002. About 250 were appealed. Out of 3,500 projects, \n250 were appealed. This is about 7 percent. There is a 7-percent \nappeals rate for all of their fuels reduction projects nationwide. In \nother words, by the agencies' own count, 93 percent of their projects \nwent through with no appeal whatsoever. Yet we are told there is some \nsort of ``appeal crisis.'' Well, the facts just don't support that.\n  The GAO and similar studies have found the main reasons that projects \ncould not proceed were weather related and the diversion of funds to \nfight wildfires. Now we are getting to the crux of it. Roughly a third \nof the delays were due to a shift in money from preventative projects \nto firefighting, which last year cost more than $1 billion. That is why \nwe need more resources out there--not to shift the resources we have \nnow but to have more resources out there for preventative projects.\n  Again, the main reason the projects could not proceed, according to \nthe GAO, is weather related and the diversion of funds for wildfires. \nOther reasons include public resistance, regulatory demands, \nunpredictable funding, and inadequate staffing within the agencies.\n  Yet the administration and some of my colleagues would have us \nbelieve the agencies cannot get the work done due to appeals and \nlitigation by environmentalists and environmental organizations. This \nsimply is not true.\n  Well, are there some problems getting the work done? Yes, there are. \nDoes this bill have provisions, including new programs, that are \nworthwhile? Yes, I have already stated that to be the case. There are a \nlot of good aspects to this bill. Is this bill the best way to protect \nour at-risk communities and the environment from wildfire, disease, and \npest infestation? Well, I don't think so. I think there could be some \nchanges made to this bill that would make it even better.\n  What is even more troubling about the legislation is that it comes on \nthe heels of some very harmful actions recently taken by the \nadministration and\n\n[[Page S13459]]\n\nthe Forest Service to weaken environmental protections, weaken public \nparticipation or public scrutiny of agency action--the cumulative \neffect of which could be to seriously degrade the health of our \nnational forests and public lands that the bill's proponents seek to \nprotect.\n  The Administration, through regulation, has ``categorically excluded \ntimber'' sales up to 1,000 acres from NEPA analysis as long as trees \nare cut in the name of fire prevention. So you can go in--a \nthousand acres would be pretty substantial in some areas. You can go in \nand cut down 12-inch or greater diameter trees in the name of fire \nprevention. No NEPA analysis is needed. They are shelving \nadministrative appeals for these projects under NEPA; they are \ncurtailing environmental analysis for entire forest management plans \nand ending public appeals of the plans. Proponents of this bill are \neven cutting out endangered or threatened species consultation with the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service, \nand preparing to jettison protections for roadless areas.\n\n  In other words, the administration has taken a largely one-sided view \nof Federal forest management. That is, thin or cut first and minimize \nenvironmental protections and public input through the regulatory and \nlegislative process.\n  The upshot is that, combined with this bill as it now stands, we \ncould see widespread, heavy logging of mature trees, even in pristine \nroadless areas, without the benefit of public environmental review, \npursuant to overarching plans that also lack NEPA compliance, bereft of \ninteragency consultation or meaningful public appeals, and subject only \nto modified judicial review. In this scenario, there could be a major \nincrease in Federal timber sales with little public understanding or \ninput and even less agency accountability. I believe this is bad \ngoverning, bad policy, pure and simple.\n  Now, while I recognize the legislation probably has the votes to \npass, I believe we can and should do better. There will be amendments \nto attempt to do this. We have seen several alternative bills offered \nin the past several months. We should better target funds to have work \ndone in this wildland/urban interface, as it is called, or the \ncommunity protection zones. We should vastly increase funding for \nhazardous fuels work on Federal and non-Federal lands. That is the crux \nof it. We should have more comprehensive protection of old-growth and \nlarge fire-resistance trees. We should avoid unnecessary and largely \nunprecedented attacks to our independent judiciary. And we must \nmaintain full and vigorous public participation in the care of our \nnational forests and public lands, while expediting projects to reduce \nwildfire risks to at-risk communities.\n  As I have said before, these public lands and these national forests \nbelong to us all, not to a timber company, not to someone who builds a \nbeautiful home out in the middle of a wilderness area and wants us to \nspend taxpayer dollars to protect them from a wildfire. These national \nforests belong to all of us, and public participation and agency \ndecisions dealing with public lands and public forests ought to be in \nthe forefront, not in the background.\n  Otherwise, if we move ahead in this manner, we are inviting the waste \nof limited time and resources that it is our responsibility to ensure \nare directed at stated priorities of community protection and removal \nof small trees and brush. As drafted, I am concerned that this bill \nwill not accomplish that urgent goal, will not ensure adequate public \nparticipation, and will not help to end the controversy and gridlock \nthat has plagued this issue for some years.\n  I hope we will have a reasonable debate on this bill. Certainly, \nthere will be amendments to it; I don't know how many and who will \noffer them. Some have come to me saying they had amendments to offer. I \nthink they will take some time to dispense with, which is appropriate \ngiven the significance of the policy changes proposed in H.R. 1904. We \nmust carefully scrutinize what is in the bill and see if there are ways \nto improve it.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides to wait and see how these \namendments proceed before judging the ultimate merit of this \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, in closing, I wish to have printed in the Record \nsome material. First is an editorial that appeared this morning in the \nWashington Post called ``Fire Damage.'' I ask unanimous consent that \nthe editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Fire Damage\n\n       With terrifying intensity, fires are burning across \n     Southern California and Mexico this week, proving once again \n     that natural disasters can be no less devastating than the \n     man-made kind. They have already killed more than a dozen \n     people, destroyed more than 1,500 homes and burned half a \n     million acres. A staggering 50,000 more homes are thought to \n     be under threat, as the fires, fanned by desert winds, move \n     into the Los Angeles and San Diego suburbs. It's a genuine \n     national tragedy--and one that shouldn't be misused for \n     political purposes.\n       Unfortunately, that is a distinct possibility. The fires \n     happen to have arrived just as the Senate is wrestling with a \n     bill, already passed by the House, which is supposedly \n     designed to help prevent catastrophic fires. In theory, the \n     bill would address the environmental imbalance that has \n     developed over the past several decades from the Forest \n     Service's misguided policy of preventing all forest fires, \n     even the low-level fires that once cleared away brush and \n     young trees from old forests. Without these periodic fires, \n     forests have become much denser, and big fires are far more \n     damaging than they used to be.\n       But although foresters and scientists now recognize this \n     problem, brush is still not being cleared away fast enough. \n     Why? The House Republican authors of the forest bill blame \n     overly bureaucratic environmental regulations. Accordingly, \n     their bill attempts to loosen the procedures that the Forest \n     Service must go through before it can carry out ``fuel \n     reduction activity''--a change that would also help the \n     timber industry dodge objections to the cutting down of older \n     forests. This explanation does not stand up to close \n     scrutiny. Last week, the General Accounting Office released \n     the final results of its study on fuel reduction activity and \n     discovered that of the Forest Service's 818 applications to \n     cut brush, only one-quarter were appealed. Of these, 79 \n     percent were processed within 90 days. What is hampering the \n     process is not environmental litigators but finances. To \n     carry out more brush-clearing operations, the Forest Service \n     needs more resources.\n       But the Forest Service is unlikely to get significantly \n     more resources anytime soon. It would therefore make sense \n     for Congress, instead of passing laws that appear to be \n     largely of benefit to the timber industry, to encourage the \n     Forest Service to spend whatever money it does have on brush-\n     clearing projects closer to human communities. Sen. Dianne \n     Feinstein (D-Calif.) has helped write a compromise bill that \n     would instruct the Forest Service to spend at least 50 \n     percent of its fuel reduction resources on precisely that. \n     Although this is the right approach, Ms. Feinstein has \n     received no guarantee that her bill won't be completely \n     rewritten by a Republican conference committee, as has lately \n     become common practice.\n       In the absence of such a guarantee--which would have to \n     come from the White House--it's probably better to pass no \n     bill at all. We retain just the slimmest hope that the \n     California blazes might cause members of Congress to redirect \n     their energy toward saving people and homes, and away from \n     helping loggers cut down mature trees.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the editorial basically states that what \nis happening in California is a genuine national tragedy and one that \nshouldn't be misused for political purposes. But, unfortunately, that \nis a distinct possibility, the editorial says. It says the fires \nhappened to arrive just as the Senate is wrestling with a bill \nsupposedly designed to help prevent catastrophic fires.\n  The editorial goes on to question whether or not the bill before us \nreally does accomplish that goal.\n  Also, I have a series of letters from different environmental groups. \nWhen I say ``environmental groups,'' I do not use it in a pejorative \nsense. I use it in a very supportive sense. First is a letter from \nabout 200 different environmental groups alphabetically from the Alaska \nWilderness League to the Yosemite Area Audubon, California--from A to \nZ--that basically are opposed to this version of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is poised to take up H.R. 1904, \n     the Bush Administration's Healthy Forests Initiative. You may \n     have heard that a bipartisan compromise has been struck, \n     reputedly brokered by the Bush Administration. Even with the \n     new language, the bill still seeks to interfere with our \n     independent judiciary, cuts the heart out of the\n\n[[Page S13460]]\n\n     National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and undermines the \n     public's legal rights to meaningfully participate in \n     decisions affecting our public lands. Not only will this bill \n     set dangerous precedents by weakening environmental laws and \n     judicial independence, it also fails to require agencies to \n     prioritize protection of homes and communities. Furthermore, \n     the Bush Administration and its allies in the House are \n     likely to insist on a much worse, anti-environmental bill in \n     conference committee.\n       Impact on our independent judiciary: H.R. 1904, as passed \n     by the House, undermines a fundamental, century-old legal \n     principle--the rights of Americans to seek fair and equitable \n     redress in the courts for grievances involving the federal \n     government. The Senate substitute also interferes with how \n     judges manage their courtrooms by ordering courts to lift \n     preliminary injunctions and stays after 60 days, unless they \n     are affirmatively renewed by the court. Moreover, the bill \n     could provide agencies a new tool to slam the courthouse door \n     on citizens by requiring all legal issues to be raised during \n     the administrative review process.\n       Public input: The Senate substitute seeks to replace the \n     current statutorily-established appeals process with a new \n     process that does not allow appeals of final agency \n     decisions, making it more difficult for Americans to \n     challenge damaging projects and have a meaningful say in \n     public land management.\n       Environmental protection: The Senate substitute seeks to \n     weaken the most important part of NEPA--the requirement that \n     agencies consider a full range of alternatives to agency \n     proposals with environmental impacts such as logging and road \n     building. The amendment invites gamesmanship by agencies that \n     would effectively nullify the alternatives requirement, which \n     the courts have called the very ``heart of NEPA.'' In \n     addition, Title IV eliminates environmental review for a \n     category of logging projects up to 1,000 acres in size--an \n     area approximately the size of 1,000 football fields--which \n     would exclude all public review, comment and participation.\n       Community protection: The Senate bill does not ensure any \n     increased protections for homes at risk of wildfire and does \n     not ensure any funding for work on local, state or tribal \n     lands for methods proven by the Forest Service Fire Research \n     Lab to protect homes. Furthermore, it is not consistent with \n     the Western Governors Association's Ten-Year Strategy for \n     reducing wildland fire risks. Communities need and deserve \n     real protection, which requires fuel reduction focused close \n     to homes and communities.\n       Old growth and roadless forests: The Senate bill attempts \n     to safeguard our old growth forests, but the language offers \n     an open invitation to abuse. Furthermore, the amendment fails \n     to protect roadless areas.\n       The Bush Administration's ``Healthy Forests Initiative'' \n     fails to deliver on community protection. Please oppose the \n     Senate version of H.R. 1904: uphold our independent judiciary \n     and our environmental protections.\n\n\n                         National Organizations\n\n       20/20 Vision.\n       Alaska Wilderness League.\n       Alaska Coalition.\n       Alaska Rainforest Campaign.\n       Americans for Democratic Action.\n       American Lands Alliance.\n       Conservation Leaders Network.\n       Center for Biological Diversity.\n       Co-op America.\n       Defenders of Wildlife.\n       EARTHJUSTICE.\n       Friends of the Earth.\n       Greenpeace USA.\n       Herpetologists' League.\n       John Muir Project.\n       National Environmental Trust.\n       National Forest Protection Alliance.\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       National Wildlife Federation.\n       Pacific Rivers Council.\n       Sierra Club.\n       Sierra Student Coalition.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n       The Rewilding Institute.\n       The Wilderness Society.\n       Wildlands Project.\n       World Wildlife Fund.\n\n\n                          County Commissioners\n\n       Supervisor David Colfax, Mendocino County, CA.\n       Supervisor M.

Madam President, I have a letter from the Forest Stewards \nGuild urging a vote against the Senate version of the bill, H.R. 1904. \nI ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Forest Stewards Guild,\n\n                                   Santa Fe, NM, October 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Senator,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Forest Stewards Guild, a national \n     organization of over 500 foresters, urges you to vote against \n     the Senate version of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of \n     2003 (H.R. 1904). This is a momentous time for public \n     forestry and we, as professionals, cannot stand by in \n     silence. Despite the negotiation of a bipartisan compromise \n     on H.R. 1904, the end result will set back the course of \n     excellent forestry for years to come.\n       There is no doubt that the frequency and severity of \n     wildfire has increased in the last 10 years. The catastrophic \n     fires result, in part, from a century of narrowly prescribed \n     forest practices applied to a wide variety of forest \n     ecosystems. The composition, function and structure of most \n     forests were simplified by past management, and today's \n     forests are more susceptible to insect epidemics and \n     vulnerable to catastrophic wildfire. The situation calls for \n     action that addresses the root causes, not the symptoms, and \n     that prevents further simplification of forest ecosystems.\n       Members of the Forest Stewards Guild are experienced \n     managers of over 6 million acres of public and private \n     forests in places as diverse as the Pacific Coast, Southeast, \n     Lake States and East. Public forest management in the United \n     States has always benefited from the experience of foresters \n     who work on private lands, starting with Gifford Pinchot as \n     the first Forest Service Chief. By constricting opportunities \n     for forest decisions to be appealed and narrowing the \n     consideration of alternatives, H.R. 1904 will cut experienced \n     private-sector foresters out of decision-making. the \n     exclusion of these experienced voices will make it more \n     difficult to achieve the high standards of forestry that \n     should exemplify public forest management.\n       After deep consideration we find that the Healthy Forests \n     Restoration Act does not address the key problems causing \n     destructive wildfire. H.R. 1904 focuses on removing perceived \n     barriers in administrative and judicial processes, yet offers \n     no vision of public stewardship to restore fire-adapted \n     forests. For example, H.R. 1904 paves the way for harvesting \n     in old growth forests to avert the impacts of natural \n     processes, such as ice storms and insect infestations, \n     despite the important role of these processes in creating old \n     growth structure. H.R. 1904 also falls short in establishing \n     meaningful monitoring requirements to help managers assess \n     the effectiveness of fuel reduction projects at moderating \n     fire behavior. The policies in H.R. 1904 favor intensive \n     harvesting in the short-term without addressing the long-term \n     maintenance of healthy forests that will ensure control of \n     new fuel accumulation.\n       The current structure of forest legislation, including the \n     National Forest Management Act, was specifically designed to \n     address the gridlock that crystallized in the 1960s over \n     clearcutting and type conversion of public forests. Senator \n     Hubert Humphrey championed a program of civic discourse and \n     debate over forest management--policies that will be reversed \n     by the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Legislation \n     that suppresses public debate will only make the gridlock \n     stronger. We urge you to vote against the Senate compormise \n     of H.R. 1904.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have a letter from the League of \nConservation Voters urging opposition to H.R. 1904. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                                 October 15, 2003,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the political voice of the national environmental community. \n     Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and \n     the press.\n       LCV urges you to oppose H.R. 1904, the Bush \n     Administration's Healthy Forests initiative, when it comes to \n     the Senate floor. Although the Senate bill differs in some \n     respects from the bill that passed the House earlier this \n     year, it still fails to require agencies to prioritize \n     protection of homes and communities. The bill would also \n     interfere with our independent judiciary, weaken the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and undermine the public's \n     legal rights to meaningfully participate in decisions \n     affecting our public lands.\n       The Senate bill fails to ensure any increased protections \n     for homes at risk of wildfire or funding for work on local, \n     state or tribal lands to use home protection methods proven \n     by the Forest Service Fire Research Lab. Furthermore, the \n     bill is not consistent with the Western Governors \n     Association's Ten-Year Strategy for reducing wildland fire \n     risks. Communities need and deserve real protection, which \n     requires fuel reduction focused close to homes and \n     communities.\n       The Senate bill would weaken the NEPA requirement that \n     agencies consider a full range of alternatives to agency \n     proposals with environmental impacts, such as logging and \n     road building, and would effectively nullify the alternatives \n     requirement, which the courts have called the very ``heart of \n     NEPA.'' In addition, the bill would eliminate environmental \n     review for a category of logging projects up to 1,000 acres \n     in size, excluding all public review, comment and \n     participation for these projects.\n       The Senate bill would interfere with how judges manage \n     their courtrooms by ordering courts to lift preliminary \n     injunctions and stays after 60 days, unless the court \n     affirmatively renews them. Moreover, the bill could provide \n     agencies a new tool to restrict citizen access to the courts \n     by requiring all legal issues to be raised during the \n     administrative review process. Moreover, it would replace the \n     current appeals process with a new process that does not \n     allow appeals of final agency decisions, making it more \n     difficult for Americans to challenge damaging projects and \n     have a meaningful say in public land management.\n       Finally, although the Senate bill attempts to safeguard our \n     old growth forests, the language offers an open invitation to \n     abuse, and the bill fails to protect roadless areas.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to oppose H.R. 1904. LCV's \n     Political Advisory Committee will consider including votes on \n     these issues in compiling LCV's 2003 Scorecard. If you need \n     more information, please call Betsy\n\n[[Page S13462]]\n\n     Loyless or Mary Minette in my office at (202) 785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have another letter from the American \nSportfishing Association, the American Fisheries Society, the Izaak \nWalton League of America, Orion: The Hunter's Institute, Trout \nUnlimited, Wildlife Forever, and the Wildlife Society. The letter is \ndated July 16, 2003. I will be clear to point out they did not say they \nwere opposed to the bill, but they have serious concerns about some \nareas of the bill. I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The American Sportfishing Association, The American \n           Fisheries Society, The Izaak Walton League of America, \n           Orion: The Hunter's Institute, Trout Unlimited, \n           Wildlife Forever, The Wildlife Society,\n                                                    July 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators Domenici, Bingaman, Cochran, and Harkin: We \n     write to express our concerns regarding restoring healthy \n     forests on public land (Healthy Forest Restoration Act of \n     2003, HR 1904). While we support the expeditious treatment of \n     hazardous fuels on public land, the rush to implement an \n     aggressive hazardous fuel management program may preclude \n     considerations for other resources, particularly fish and \n     wildlife habitat conservation. We believe that hazardous fuel \n     management decisions should be based on deliberative and \n     science-based protocols. By setting forth an open and \n     collaborative process for such decisions, broader \n     participation will be achieved and better decisions made.\n       Treatment of hazardous fuels where significant threats \n     exist to human health or safety should be of paramount \n     importance to the Forest Service. These treatments may \n     include thinning, brush removal, or use of prescribed fire. \n     It is important to note, however, that the Forest Service has \n     only recently begun using timber harvest as a tool to reduce \n     hazardous fuel. The paucity of research and evaluation as to \n     treatment efficacy is a cause for concern. Congressional \n     direction to focus on the wildland urban interface will \n     enable us to keep our communities safer, while we learn \n     through experience what types of hazardous fuels reduction \n     projects work best, those that do not, and why.\n       Careful planning, analysis, and field-testing of various \n     hazardous fuels treatments would allow the agencies to build \n     support for hazardous fuels reduction, make communities safer \n     and forests healthier, and provide a more stable and \n     predictable supply of wood fiber from the National Forests.\n       Given that an estimated 75 percent of Forest Service timber \n     sales currently are classified as hazardous fuels reduction \n     projects, we would hope that Congress keep the public and \n     environmental analyses processes for these sales as open as \n     possible to ensure that interested citizens, scientists, \n     sportsmen, and state agencies have significant involvement in \n     their planning and implementation.\n       We endorse the prohibition of constructing new permanent \n     roads in conducting fuel management projects. It is equally \n     important that Congress recognize the possible deleterious \n     effects of temporary roads on fish, wildlife, and water \n     resources, especially if they become permanent travel-ways \n     for unauthorized or unregulated off-road vehicle travel.\n       We are concerned that under congressionally proposed and \n     agency-offered fuel treatment authorities, private citizens, \n     sportsmen, and biologists will no longer be provided a \n     reasonable opportunity to comment on or appeal decisions \n     concerning fuel management activities. The 10-Year \n     Conservation Strategy for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to \n     Communities and the Environment, for example, prescribes \n     vague public involvement procedures and requirements on the \n     agencies at the state, regional and national levels.\n       Legislation should make clear the purpose of emergency \n     hazardous fuels treatments is to enhance forest health \n     through activities that reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, \n     insect infestations and disease, invasive plants, enhance \n     fish and wildlife habitat, and protect watersheds. We \n     recommend that project proposals be developed through an \n     interdisciplinary planning process. The sale of marketable \n     forest and rangeland products should be allowed only when \n     such sale is incidental to emergency treatments. Wood fiber \n     derived from fuels treatments should be sold separately as a \n     byproduct of the restoration activity.\n       Finally, we note that a recently released General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) analysis found that three-fourths of \n     the 762 Forest Service projects to diminish wildfire risk in \n     the past two years proceeded without appeals, litigation, or \n     other challenge. Hazardous fuels treatments, such as \n     mechanical thinning or prescribed fire, proceeded on 3.8 \n     million acres of National Forests. Projects that were \n     appealed or challenged moved forward generally within the 90-\n     day period prescribed by agency regulations.\n       The GAO analysis demonstrates what is most needed by \n     federal fire legislation is funding and a clear assignation \n     of agency priorities to protect human communities. We hope \n     this is where you will focus your efforts as a first \n     priority. Thank you for considering our views.

We are available to discuss our concerns \n     and recommendations at your convenience.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have another letter from a number of \nindividuals who basically represent firefighters, smokejumpers--12 \nindividuals who have written urging opposition to H.R. 1904 which they \nsay is misnamed the Healthy Forests Restoration Act and instead support \nS. 1453, the Forestry and Community Assistance Act. I ask unanimous \nconsent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Member of Congress: As current and former wildland \n     firefighters, we urge you to oppose H.R. 1904, the misnamed \n     ``Healthy Forests Restoration Act,'' and instead, support S. \n     1453, the ``Forestry and Community Assistance Act'' as the \n     best available legislative plan for the interconnected goals \n     of improving the health, safety and working conditions of \n     wildland firefighters, protecting communities, and restoring \n     forests.\n       Protecting homes and structures is one of the most \n     dangerous assignments for wildland firefighters. We are \n     basically forced to make a stand between the often \n     unstoppable force of wildfire burning under extreme \n     conditions, and the immovable objects of homes and \n     structures. Added to the dangers is the fact that the area \n     adjacent to homes and communities often have the highest fire \n     risks and fuel hazards. And yet we must still protect these \n     homes.\n       In wildland areas, firefighters face a number of \n     unacceptable safety risks and health hazards due to the \n     legacy of past management, such as: 1) high hazardous fuel \n     loads in logged and roaded areas from untreated or \n     ineffectively treated logging slash; 2) flammable brush, \n     moisture deprived vegetation, and invasive weeds that rapidly \n     grow in the wake of logging and grazing; 3) densely-stocked \n     young timber plantations that can cause wildfires to blow-up \n     and burn severely even from low-intensity fires; 4) a maze of \n     abandoned or neglected logging roads that pose hazardous \n     driving conditions for firefighters, or provide access for \n     human-caused wildfires.\n       These degraded forests health conditions resulting from \n     past management activities on public lands are part and \n     parcel of the degraded working conditions and elevated safety \n     risks and health hazards affecting wildland firefighters. The \n     interests of wildland firefighters in a safer, healthier \n     working environment, the interests of homeowners and \n     communities in protection from wildfires, and the interests \n     of the public in the protection and restoration of forest \n     ecosystems, can be one and the same. Unfortunately, H.R. \n     1904, is heading down the wrong path.\n       First, H.R. 1904 fails to target fuels treatments to the \n     areas that need it most: the community protection zone and \n     low-elevation dry forest types. The wildlands/urban interface \n     zone has some of the highest fire risks and fuel hazards, yet \n     is neglected by H.R. 1904 because the majority of rural \n     communities are surrounded by private, State, or Tribal owned \n     lands, not federal lands. Hazardous fuels treatments need to \n     be prioritized and targeted in the front country community \n     protection zone in dry forest ecosystems. Instead, H.R. 1904 \n     would authorize logging projects in remote backcountry areas \n     including roadless areas, high-elevation moist forests, and \n     other areas where fires may be natural or beneficial for the \n     ecosystem.\n       Second, H.R. 1904 fails to target treatments to the kinds \n     of fuels that pose the highest hazards. Hazardous fuels \n     treatments need to target the surface layers of dead needles \n     and limbs, small-diameter understory trees and brush, \n     densely-stocked young timber plantations, old untreated \n     logging slash. These surface and ladder fuels pose the \n     highest risk of ignition and rapid fire spread. Instead H.R. \n     1904 would authorize logging of commercially-valuable mature \n     and old-growth overstory trees, which are naturally resistant \n     to fires and help moderate fire behavior by shading the \n     ground surface from the sun and wind. Some of the most \n     hazardous sites for wildland firefighters are hot, dry, windy \n     logged units full of slash.\n       Third, H.R. 1904 fails to allocate necessary funds to pay \n     for hazardous fuels treatments. In general, hazardous fuel \n     loads have little or no commercial value. It will require \n     appropriated money from Congress to pay for treatment of \n     these kinds of fuels. H.R. 1904\n\n[[Page S13463]]\n\n     fails to allocate any funds for hazardous fuels \n     treatments, essentially forcing forest managers to sell \n     large-diameter trees in order to pay for reducing fuels.\n       Fourth, H.R. 1904 fails to foster agency-community \n     collaboration and social consensus around fire and fuels \n     management projects. The enormous task of protecting fire-\n     prone communities and restoring fire-adapted ecosystems will \n     require an unprecedented level of collaboration among land \n     managers and the public they serve. It is a matter of common \n     sense to begin this task where we have common ground: \n     prioritize fuels treatments around communities. This way we \n     can increase public and firefighter safety in suppressing \n     unwanted wildfires, and increase the opportunities for safely \n     implementing prescribed fires. Instead, H.R. 1904 is \n     guaranteed to generate increased public controversy and \n     conflict, as the voices of citizens in public land management \n     decisions are diminished, and legal accountability is eroded \n     or eliminated.\n       We don't want to have our ability to comment on or \n     challenge projects taken away--firefighters are citizens, \n     too! In fact, citizens who work as wildland firefighters have \n     the most at stake when fuels projects are planned and \n     implemented. We want to be a complete part of the projects \n     that will reduce the fuel hazard around at-risk communities, \n     from planning through implementation, monitoring, and \n     protection.\n       We want our working conditions, health and safety improved, \n     but not at the expense of degrading the forests that we are \n     dedicated to protecting. We believe that it is only through \n     genuine restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems that \n     firefighter and public safety will be improved, but H.R. 1904 \n     is about forest restoration in name only, and is a recipe for \n     further ecosystem degradation and public conflict and \n     controversy.\n       In contrast, S. 1453, expedites projects to be done around \n     communities most at risk of wildfire, regardless of whether \n     or not they are bordered by Federal lands, appropriates \n     funding for hazardous fuels treatments and watershed \n     restoration projects, protects old-growth and roadless areas \n     and currently healthy forests from inappropriate logging, and \n     protects existing environmental laws and full citizens rights \n     to engage in decisions affecting our own public lands.\n       As wildland fire fighters, we believe the protection of \n     forests, communities and our health and safety are \n     interconnected. We support efforts to make the working \n     environment for wildland firefighters safer. But this does \n     not have to imperil the very forests we seek to protect. Nor \n     should it imperil the democratic rights of citizens to \n     participate in land management decisions. Most of all, \n     Congress should not use the issue of firefighter safety as an \n     excuse to sanction inappropriate or illegal logging projects \n     to proceed under the guise of fuels reduction or forest \n     restoration.\n           Sincerely,\n       Joseph Fox, 25 years wildland firefighting experience; \n     positions: smokejumper, Interagency Hotshot (crewboss \n     certified).\n       Patrick Withen, 24 years wildland firefighting experience; \n     positions: smokejumper, Interagency Hotshot, helitack.\n       David Calahan, 23 years municipal firefighting experience; \n     positions: engineer on wildland/urban interface zone fires.\n       Michael Beasley, 16 years wildland firefighting \n     experience; positions: Interagency Hotshot, Fire \n     Management Officer, Prescribed Fire Specialist.\n       Rich Fairbanks, 14 years wildland firefighting experience; \n     positions: Interagency Hotshot (foreman and squad leader), \n     Division Supervisor.\n       Erin Ely, 10 years wildland firefighting experience; \n     positions: Interagency Hotshot (crewboss certified), 20-\n     person Type II fire crew, fire salvage timber sale planner.\n       Timothy Ingalsbee, 8 years wildland firefighting \n     experience; positions: helitack, engine, 20 person Type II \n     fire crew (squad boss), Interagency Hotshot resource advisor.\n       Mei Lin Lantz, 5 years wildland firefighting experience; \n     positions: Interagency Hotshot (squad boss), helirappeller, \n     engine crew, fire/fuels management planner.\n       Ric Bailey, 3 years wildland firefighting experience; \n     positions: helitack, engine crew (foreman).\n       Shawnti Johnson, 3 years wildland firefighting experience; \n     positions: Interagency Hotshot.\n       Nalita Kendall Baumback, 2 years wildland firefighting \n     experience; positions: initial attack engine crew.\n       Colby Whitenack, 2 years wildland firefighting experience; \n     positions: Interagency Hotshot.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, the Forest Roads Working Group, which includes \nWildlife Forever, Trout Unlimited, Wildlife Management Institute, Izaak \nWalton League of America, Outdoor Industry Association, the Wildlife \nSociety, and International Paper, also wrote a letter dated October 28, \n2003. It is not in total opposition, but it expresses their concerns \nabout certain parts of the bill saying the ``fire legislation should \nendorse the prohibition of new roads into inventoried roadless areas.'' \nI ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Forest Roads Working Group,\n\n                                                 October 28, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Domenici, Bingaman, Cochran, and Harkin: We \n     write to express our concerns regarding restoring healthy \n     forests on public land (Healthy Forest Restoration Act of \n     2003, H.R. 1904). The Forest Roads Working Group was \n     established to bring together a wide range of organizations \n     with a strong interest in ensuring that roadless area \n     protections are crafted and implemented in a workable and \n     effective manner.\n       The FRWG supports the expeditious treatment of hazardous \n     fuels on public lands. The need to implement an aggressive \n     hazardous fuel management program should not, however, \n     preclude considerations for other resources, particularly \n     fish and wildlife habitat conservation, outdoor recreation \n     opportunities, and the protection of inventoried roadless \n     areas.\n       In light of scarce resources, treatment of hazardous fuels \n     should be of paramount importance to the Forest Service where \n     significant threats exist to human health or safety and \n     adjacent private lands. Given that an estimated 75 percent of \n     Forest Service timber sales currently are classified as \n     hazardous fuels reduction projects, we hope that Congress \n     will keep the public and environmental analyses processes for \n     these sales as open as possible to ensure that interested \n     citizens, scientists, sportsmen, recreationists and state \n     agencies have significant involvement in their planning and \n     implementation.\n       Fire legislation should endorse the prohibition of new \n     roads into inventoried roadless areas. Given the now $10 \n     billion maintenance and reconstruction backlog of existing \n     Forest Service roads, it is important that Congress recognize \n     the potentially deleterious effects of roads on fish, \n     wildlife, and water resources, especially if they become \n     travelways for unauthorized or unregulated off-road vehicle \n     travel.\n       Thank you for considering our views. If you have any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 202/508-\n     3400. We are available to discuss our concerns and \n     recommendations at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        J.T. Banks\n                                             (For James D. Range).\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, these are the concerns that I and many \nothers have with the legislation before us, and I hope those who have \namendments will come to the floor and offer them. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HAGEL). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before the ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee sits down, I would be more than happy to include \nthe protection of all the old growth in the Federal forests of Iowa in \nthis bill, if it existed. Or maybe we could put a prohibition against \nwildfires in Iowa on public lands in this bill. And that is something \nwe could accomplish because those two issues--the old growth, which I \nam sure the State of Iowa wished it had, and wildfires, which I know \nthey would not want--do not exist in Iowa because no Federal forest \nlands exist there.\n  In my State of Idaho, in the great State of Oregon, and in the Great \nBasin, West, as much as 60 and 70 percent of our lands within our State \nborders are public lands and are subject to this legislation. That is \nwhy I am on the Senate floor. That is why my colleague from Missouri is \non the Senate floor. That is why my colleague from California is on the \nSenate floor because it is the heart and soul of our States. Be it our \nwater quality or our wildlife habitat or our environment in general, \nour forested lands make up that dynamic symphony of lands of which our \nStates are proud, and we want to protect them.\n  To suggest this bill does not is not a fact. Let me give a point the \nSenator from Iowa just made. He said you could log in 1,000-acre \nincrements across the landscape. Not true. Nowhere in the bill does it \nexist. Let's go back to California today where fires are burning.\n  Let's go to Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino forest where there \nis a complex of dead and dying trees of about 400,000 acres. You could \nlog 1,000 acres there, and then if you chose to do another 1,000 acres \nnear it, you get into the cumulative effect beyond the categorical \nexclusion and you have to do a NEPA process. That is what this \nlegislation says. That is what the Senator\n\n[[Page S13464]]\n\nfrom Iowa did not suggest. He cannot suggest something that does not \nexist. Yes, it is true you do 1,000-acre logging increments, but when \nyou get to a cumulative effect beyond the categorical exclusion, NEPA \ntakes over. Therefore, you do the full public process that he admires \nand I admire because we believe the public ought to have a right to \nparticipate, but not ad nauseam through lawsuit after lawsuit for the \npurpose of delaying activity on the ground when there is bug kill and \nfuel loading and the public is at risk and the resources are at risk. \nThat is what this debate must be about.\n  He implied that you could road on forever because this bill does not \nprohibit roading. You can't road today unless you go through a full \nNEPA process. It is not to suggest if you prohibit roading here or you \ndo not prohibit it, therefore, roading will exist. That is not true. It \ndoes not exist today in current law. So do not imply that it does. That \nis a false accusation, in my opinion.\n  There are a good many other areas we will debate at length, I am \nsure, as the amendments come up. I am going to step out of my State of \nIdaho, which I know best, and step into California for a moment because \nCalifornia is at issue and it is in play.\n  My colleague from Oregon, who his other colleague from Oregon said \nwas brave in taking the stand he is taking, is a brave soul, but he is \nalso a person who recognizes the balance of good management on our \npublic lands that protects water quality and wildlife habitat. He is \nthe one who argued staunchly that we protect old growth. I didn't think \nit was necessary, but I agreed with him.\n  He and I have worked together very closely on what we believe to be \nbalanced public forest policies for a good number of years, but what is \nnot in balance is a policy that allows forests to burn at will simply \nbecause we deny the right of limited management to reduce fuel loading, \nto stop bug kill, and to slow the dead and dying trees.\n  So let us go to San Bernardino National Forest in southern California \nwhere fires are raging as we speak. We know that forest, because of \nenvironmental interests and because of the increase of the public \nliving in that forest, in the 1970s stopped any form of logging. In the \nmid 1970s, it stopped. That became an inactively managed forest.\n  About 2 years ago, it was recognized as a forest that was in critical \ncondition. The fuel loading was so great, the bug kill was so great, \nthat the intermittent State lands within the San Bernardino forests \nwere declared a state of emergency by the Governor of California, but \nit is almost impossible to save them if they are surrounded by lands \nwhere nothing is going on, where the bug kill is great, and where a \nfire is clearly a situation that creates a high risk.\n  We have known, and I have said on this floor for over 2 years, that \nthe San Bernardino National Forest was the perfect firestorm waiting to \nhappen, and yet we talked on and on in a formally inactive way not to \ndo anything about it. It is now burning. That is a phenomenal tragedy \nthat we could have done at least something about, but we chose inactive \nmanagement on the San Bernardino nearly three decades ago.\n  Let me speak for a few moments about why and what is different in \nCalifornia today than 50 years ago. If one listens today to news \ncommentators covering the fires in California, they will say that that \narea burned about 50 years ago, and it probably did. It is a \nMediterranean-type climate. It is largely a scrub oak climate except \nwhen one gets up in the San Bernardinos where one begins to get \nconifers and it did probably burn. Maybe it has burned every 50 or 60 \nyears for the last thousands of years, but what was different today \nthan 50 years ago is that there are now people living in the canyons, \nin the valleys, and in the suburbs that did not exist 50 years ago in \nthat area. So the landscape is dramatically different and the risk is \nsubstantially higher, but we have done little about it.\n  We have not insisted that there be firebreaks, that there be \nthinning, that there be a way to protect the urban/wildland interface. \nH.R. 1904 begins to address that, at least on the Federal forested \nlands. If those firebreaks had been present, if that scrub oak had been \npulled back 100 or 200 yards from those homes, grass had been planted, \nfoliage had been kept down, it would not have been 1,500 homes burned \nnow; it would have been considerably fewer. We all know that. That is a \nfact.\n  The world of the forest has changed dramatically in the last 50 \nyears. The Senator from Iowa is right. Wherever there was a piece of \nprivate property within a Federal forested area, a home was built. Why? \nBecause it is a very desirable place to live. We all love to live \nwithin the forested landscapes of our country, but if we do not treat \nthem properly, it is like living inside a kindling box. It is like \nliving near a fire that is ready to burn. All one has to do is drop a \nmatch, because the fuel loading that has gone on in these forested \nlandscapes over the last 30 years is dramatic. Why? Because we put fire \nout. We got awfully good at eliminating fire and we did not replace the \nnatural ecosystem's activities of fire with manmade activity. It is \nquite simple.\n  Along came the environmental movement in the 1960s. Along came the \nNational Environmental Policy Act and the National Forest Act in the \nmid-1970s, and we began progressively to slow our activities on the \npublic lands that were offsetting nature's activities in some instances \nand the fuel load began to build.\n\n  In the mid 1980s, a group of forest scientists from all over the \nUnited States met in Sun Valley, ID, to explore the health of our \nnational forests. They concluded that our forests in the Great Basin \nWest were sick, dead, and dying, and that if we did not develop some \nform of activity to emulate fire, to thin and clean, we would someday \nin the near future begin to experience dramatic wildfires that would \nchange the character of the landscape of the West. They were right. We \ndid not listen. We could not listen. Why? Because there was a louder \nvoice out there saying: Do nothing, do nothing, stay away; the only way \nto treat the public lands is to withdraw man from the lands, unless he \nor she tramples lightly upon them.\n  We did just that, and all of our policies have driven us in that \ndirection. During the Clinton years, we reduced logging on public lands \nby nearly 80 percent. We did not change any laws, just reused the \nregulations, headed in another direction with a different philosophy.\n  Aside from that, there is another interesting statistic. Instead of \nthe average of 1\\1/2\\ million to 2 million acres a year in wildfires on \nour forested public land, we began to see 3, then 3\\1/2\\, then 4, then \n5, then 6, and last year 7 million acres, and that graph is going \nstraight up as more of these lands burn because the fuel load that \nbuilds on them is so great that all of our forested public lands have \nbecome like a kindling box, ready to burn with the touch of a match.\n  It started in California last Saturday. It could have been manmade in \nthis instance--it probably was--and, of course, we know the end result. \nIt is not over yet. It has destroyed millions of acres of property and \nhuman life.\n  Now, this is dramatic. Guess what is about to start in California. \nThe Senator from California is in the Chamber and she can tell us \nbetter than anybody else. But when the Santa Ana winds quit, when those \ngreat air patterns that sweep down out of the West shift and change the \ncycling of the wind and it reverses the sweep down off the mountains, \nit starts coming in off the ocean, and rains begin. This 500,000 acres \nof now denuded land, with no vegetation on it, will be subject to the \nwinter rains.\n  What we are going to be hearing, almost as dramatic as the fires \nwere, will be the mud slides and the erosion and the land movements \nthat are going to occur in California simply within the next month or \ntwo or three. Can we not understand that? Cannot environmental \norganizations understand that there has to be a little bit of a \nbalance, that somehow there is a way to ebb and flow, for us to exist, \nto protect our environment and at the same time balance it in a way \nthat does not in the end destroy it?\n  In the year 2000, in Idaho, we lost 1 million acres to wildfire. That \nwinter and the next spring, great slides of mud, rock, and debris \nflowed down out of the canyons and some of them into the beautiful \npristine Salmon River that is a great fish habitat, a great\n\n[[Page S13465]]\n\nsalmon habitat. In some instances, it probably damaged it. In one \ninstance, there was a great alluvial flow of debris out into the river \nthat was not swept away, and this last year when the waters hit it, the \nwater diverted across the river and knocked out a highway and knocked \nout a road and put more silt into the river, all a product of the fire \nof the year 2000.\n  So fires have lots of consequences. We ought to try to manage our \nforests in a way that somehow diminishes the overall ability of those \nforests to burn, to protect our wildlife habitat, our water quality, \nour scenic beauty, and our recreational opportunities. That, in part, \nis what this bill is about. This is no major dramatic step forward. \nThis is no assault on the environment. This is a positive but \nrelatively small step in the areas we have so designated to suggest we \nadjust the appeals process ever so slightly, that we adjust the NEPA \nprocess ever so slightly, that we establish funding priorities in the \nwildland/urban interface, that we recognize and protect old-growth, and \nthat we create a judicial review process that is streamlined so those \nwho would chose no action cannot lock up reasonable, responsible action \nin the courts of our country.\n\n  That is what H.R. 1904 is all about. My colleague from Oregon is \nstill on the floor. He, I, and a good many others, my colleague from \nIdaho, Mike Crapo, who chairs the forestry subcommittee in \nAgriculture--I chair the subcommittee in Energy and Natural Resources, \nthe Senator from Oregon is the ranking member of that forestry \nsubcommittee--have spent years and years on this issue, try to find a \nbalance, working with environmental groups--outreach.\n  Let me thank the Senator from California, who is on the floor, who \nhas demonstrated phenomenal leadership in this area. She has taken the \ntime to understand the ecosystems and the health of the Sierras and she \nknows some form of limited action has to occur to save this beautiful \nlandscape. That is what this legislation is all about. Yet some would \npaint it as dramatic and sweeping and destructive. It is simply not \nthat at all. It is a small step forward in our effort to bring \nreasonable balance and management only in those areas designated as \nfire prone, as loaded with fuel, and the urban/wildland interface \ndominantly, and in sick and dying areas where the bugs have ravaged it \nand it is simply standing there dead, waiting for Mother Nature to take \nher course.\n  That is what H.R. 1904 is all about. Don't let anyone paint this in \nany other dramatic fashion or form, for if they were to do so, it would \nsimply be untrue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \ncomments and for his support. I have worked with him on this issue now \nfor a long, long time.\n  As you know, California has great and challenging forests. As I \ndelved into the issue and became more and more involved and traveled \nover forests on helicopters and walked through forests, I realized how \nmuch they had changed from the time I was a child in California.\n  I also thank the bipartisan group of Senators who have tirelessly \nnegotiated this legislation, particularly the Senator from Oregon, Ron \nWyden. He and I, on our side, have worked with a group of Republicans, \nknowing that both of us face States that are deeply challenged by \nforest fire. The need to develop a piece of legislation was crystal \nclear to both of us.\n  This is very difficult, I think, for both of us because the \nprevailing environmental view has always been not to touch our forests, \nand that is what fire suppression was all about. Senator Wyden has been \nstalwart. It has been a great pleasure for me to work with him and his \nstaff. I know my staff has also very much appreciated the collegiality \nand also the exchange of ideas. I thank him very much.\n  Also, Senators Baucus, Craig, Crapo, Cochran, Domenici, Kyl, Lincoln, \nand McCain--we were all partners in forging this compromise consensus \nbill.\n  With what is happening in California, I don't think I need to tell \nanybody that there has been an alarming increase in catastrophic \nwildfires that have raged through our forests and neighboring \ncommunities all across this great land, because nearly 27 million acres \nhave burned nationally in the past 5 years alone, and 2.1 million of \nthose acres are in California. There are 57 million acres of Federal \nland at the highest risk of catastrophic fire, including 8.5 million in \nmy State alone.\n  People in California don't realize that much of our forest is in what \nis called the highest risk of catastrophic fire--for many, many \ndifferent reasons. But that is where they are today. This is far from \nthe natural condition of our forests. It is because this century-old \npolicy of suppressing ground fires has allowed so much flammable brush \nto accumulate so dangerously in many of our forests, especially in dry \nareas at low to moderate elevations.\n  This legislation is not a logging bill, as some would typify it--I \nthink falsely. This legislation would allow the brush to be cleaned out \nand it would also provide the first statutory protection for old-growth \nstands and large trees ever in the history of this Nation. I have heard \npeople fault it, saying it is not this and it is not that--but it is, \nand no one has submitted legislation prior to our doing so in this \nparticular area.\n  I want to be very clear. This is pro-environment legislation and it \nseeks to reverse some of the damage we have done to our forests and \nrestore their healthy condition.\n  Pictures show the story, I think more powerfully than words. Like the \nold adage, a photo is worth a thousand words. That is really true. Let \nme show you this first picture. This picture goes back to 1909, and it \nreminds me a little bit of the conditions of the Sierras when I used to \nride through them as a child. You didn't have to go on trails; you used \nto ride through the forest.\n\n  This is a picture of Grandview Point at Grand Canyon National Park in \nArizona in 1909. You see the buggy and horses, and you see the open \nnature of the forest. You don't see much ground fuel. You don't see \nbrush.\n  Let me show you the next photo. It shows the forest closing in, due \nto fire suppression. From 1909, in the top picture, you will see it \nopen. This is all the same identical forest. You will see the openness \nall throughout this forest as far back as you can see. Then you will \nsee the next one, 1942. Look at these little juniors, look at them \npopping up all over the forest. Then you will see in the last picture \nin 1992, following a fire.\n  This is the problem increasingly with these forests. This picture is \nfrom the Pearson Natural Area in the Coconino National Forest in \nArizona.\n  Now, look at another picture. This is the crowded, unthinned area, \nPonderosa Pine in California. You will see one of these problems. This \npicture is not following a forest fire. This is the natural condition \nof this forest. It is just awaiting a catastrophic fire.\n  Now, let me show you where fire suppression doesn't just exist in \npines. I would like to show you a photo of some of California's most \nmagnificent trees. This is the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias in the \nsouthern Sierra Mountains. It is interesting to look at it. This is a \nman right here. This will show you how big those giant sequoias are. \nThis was taken in 1890. Look at the clear space around those sequoias.\n  Now go to 1970. This is the same tree and look at what has happened. \nThis is a catastrophic fire waiting to happen.\n  What will happen if there were fire back here, let's say, involving \nthese two trees? It would not necessarily be catastrophic, because it \nwould not burn hot enough on the fuel to take out the canopy. The \nsequoias are basically fire resistant and it would resist it. Fires \ntoday run the risk--because of the underbrush, because of the nonnative \nspecies, and because of the fuel ladder--of really taking out the \ncanopy of old majestic and great trees.\n\n  We had a fire in the Sequoias, and we were just lucky that where the \nfire took place, it didn't reach these trees.\n  I would like to show you a picture of a fire in a Ponderosa pine \nforest that has been altered by decades of fire suppression. Look how \nthis fire is burning. It is not confined to the ground. It is rising up \ninto the trees and doing substantial damage.\n  Look at this photo of fire in a stand where the brush and smaller \ntrees have been cleared out. Note that the fire,\n\n[[Page S13466]]\n\nunlike this fire, is confined to the ground.\n  That is what we are trying to achieve in this bill so that when a \nfire does occur it is confined to the ground and does not do damage to \nold-growth trees, to other trees in the area, and to property and life.\n  Finally, this is a picture showing how thinning can protect the \nforests. This is the 2000 Clear Creek Fire in the State of Idaho. The \nupper area in the photo was unmanaged, and it burned severely. You can \nsee that right through here where the fire burned. Now you can see \nwhere the fire stopped. The lower area survived the fire and remained \ngreen and healthy because of one reason: It had been thinned.\n  This is elegant testimony to what happens when it isn't managed. \nWhere fuel is not removed, it burns fiercely. It stops where it is \nmanaged and there are fuel breaks, and the forest is cleared of fuel.\n  I want to emphasize that not all of our forests have been affected by \nfire suppression. Many of our forests--particularly those in the wetter \nareas and higher mountain elevations--have changed little, if at all, \nfrom fire suppression. Fires in these forests occur only rarely. In \nsome cases, hundreds of years can pass between fires. But fire \nsuppression has changed these forests little.\n  We can largely leave them alone under the legislation. The only \nexception is forest areas near communities where we want to reduce the \nhazardous fuel to ensure public safety.\n  This is how our amendment would work. The bipartisan amendment \ndirectly addresses these threats to our forest health and our \ncommunities.\n  We established an expedited hazardous fuels reduction program for 20 \nmillion acres at the highest risk of catastrophic fire.\n  Some opponents of this bill are saying everything is up for this \nproject--wrong.\n  This project is confined to 20 million acres of the highest risk of \ncatastrophic fire among the 54 million acres which the Forest Service \nhas identified at highest risk of catastrophic fire.\n  It would authorize $760 million annually for the removal of fuel. \nThat is a $340 million increase over current funding.\n  The House bill has no money for title I to do this in that bill. It \nleaves 50 percent of the funds to be used for fuel reduction near \ncommunities.\n  This is a compromise that Senator Wyden and I made to be able to \nprovide incentives for others who may not have as many populated areas \nas some of us do to also have an opportunity to have fires thinned near \nurban watersheds, municipal watersheds, areas of infestation, and other \ncritical areas that are in need of thinning to prevent catastrophic \nfire. And the remainder of funding is for municipal watersheds or \nendangered species habitat or areas that have suffered just as I have \nsaid.\n  The legislation also requires that large fire-resistant old-growth \ntrees be protected from logging immediately. Most people do not know \nthat. But there is immediate protection for large fire-resistant old-\ngrowth trees. It mandates that forest plans that are more than 10 years \nold and most in need of updating must be updated with old growth \nprotection consistent with the national standard within 2 to 3 years. \nWithin that 20 million acres there is a real effort to say that old \nforest plans must be brought to the fore and dealt with quickly within \n2 or 3 years.\n  While forest-specific old growth is being developed, large and fire-\nresilient trees would be immediately protected in the new project \nauthorized by this legislation.\n  The bill prevents logging of the largest most fire-resistant trees in \nthe guise of fuel reduction. Where old-growth forests have not been \naltered by fire suppression, existing old-growth conditions must be \nmaintained. And in other old-growth stands where brush and other highly \nflammable fuels have accumulated through this century-old policy of \nsuppressing ground fires, brush will be cleared out to protect the \nstands from catastrophic fire.\n  And local forest managers will write specific prescriptions for their \nforests. All of these prescriptions will be consistent with the more \ngeneral national old-growth protection standards in the bill.\n  Additionally, the agreement improves and shortens the administrative \nreview process.\n  I want to talk about this. There has been a lot of things said. A lot \nof things were just plain wrong. We have been trying to correct them \nwherever we can. Where we tried to shorten the process, we tried to \nmake it more collaborative and less confrontational.\n  It is critical that the Forest Service be able to spend scarce \ndollars as it is doing vital work on the ground rather than being mired \nin endless paperwork.\n  The legislation we have submitted fully preserves multiple \nopportunities for meaningful public involvement. People can attend a \npublic meeting on every single project. They can submit comments during \nboth the preparation of the environmental impact statement and during \nthe administrative review process. I guarantee that the public will \nhave a meaningful say in these projects.\n  The legislation changes the environmental review process in this way. \nIt does this so that the Forest Service still considers the effect of \nthe proposed project. But it does it in a way so that the Forest \nService can focus its analysis on the project proposal.\n  One reasonable alternative is required--I want to explain this--that \nmeets the project goals and the alternative of not doing the project, \ninstead of the five to nine alternatives now required.\n  We are not talking about a freeway or a highway being located where \nyou might want to look at five to nine different alternatives. We are \ntalking about one specific project that has been designated for \nhazardous fuels reduction and how you carry out that hazardous fuel \nreduction.\n  There might be debate on whether it should be mechanical thinning, or \nburning, or a combination of the two. There might be a debate on \nexactly which trees people want to remain inviolate. All of that is \npossible. But the requirement, in addition to the alternative of doing \nnothing, is reduce one alternative--one sound alternative--that can be \nconsidered.\n  This legislation replaces the current Forest Service administrative \nappeal with an administration review process that will occur after the \nForest Service finishes its environmental review of the project but \nbefore it reaches its decision.\n  This new approach is similar to the process adopted by the Clinton \nadministration in 2000 for review of forest lands and amendments to \nthose plans. The process will be speedier and less confrontational than \nthe current administrative appeal process and have more information \navailable to those who want to know more about the project.\n  Perhaps the most controversial area is the area of judicial review. I \nwill turn to that. I emphasize that cases will be heard more quickly \nunder the legislation, abuses of the process will be checked, but \nnothing alters the citizen's opportunity for a fair and thorough court \nreview. Parties can sue in Federal court only on issues raised in the \nenvironmental review process. We believe this is a commonsense \nprovision that allows agencies the opportunity to correct their own \nmistakes before everything gets litigated. Lawsuits must be filed in \nthe same jurisdiction as the proposed project. This was in-house \nlanguage. This has been supported. It is a good idea. We go to the \nFederal court in the area where the hazardous fuels project is \nproposed, not to a Federal court in New York City or somewhere else.\n  Courts are encouraged to resolve the case as soon as possible. This \nis not mandatory language, it is suggested language. It means that any \njudge reading the bill will understand how seriously we take this. We \nurge them to conclude their deliberations expeditiously.\n  A preliminary injunction would be limited to 60 days, not going on \nand on and on. An individual who gets a preliminary injunction can come \nback before the court and make an argument as to why the injunction \nshould be continued, and the judge has the ability and the prerogative \nto continue that injunction if he or she sees fit.\n  This provision, we believe, sends a signal to the courts not to delay \nimportant brush-clearing projects indefinitely unless there is a good \nreason to do so.\n\n[[Page S13467]]\n\n  Then there is what is called balance-of-harm language in the bill \nthat says the court must weigh the environmental benefit of doing a \ngiven project against its environmental risk as it reviews the case.\n  I deeply believe this amendment is balanced, that it is a significant \nimprovement from the House-passed bill. I cannot support the House-\npassed bill. Senator Wyden cannot support the House-passed bill. The \nDemocrats who are on this bill cannot support and will not support the \nHouse-passed bill. Ergo, in this Chamber, the House-passed bill will \nnot have the 60 votes required to move it along.\n  There are many ways in which this amendment improves on the House-\npassed bill. I know Senator Wyden went into that in great detail. I \nwill mention three of them.\n  First, this bill is focused on the highest priority language where we \nneed to undertake brush-clearing projects to restore forest health. As \nI said, it is limited to 20 million of the 54 million acres at highest \nrisk of catastrophic fire. These lands include the wildland/urban \ninterface as defined by the communities needing protection, lands where \nfires would significantly threaten municipal water supply, lands \nsignificantly harmed by insect, disease, or wind throw and endangered \nspecies habitat.\n  Second, we have protected both old-growth stands and large trees \nacross the landscape. The projects expedited by this act, I believe, \nwill truly restore forest health.\n\n  Finally, the Senate agreement removed a provision of the House-passed \nbill that could have threatened the fair and impartial judicial review \nof Forest Service actions. This provision would have tilted the playing \nfield in forestry litigation by requiring a court to defer to the \nFederal agency's views in deciding whether to issue an injunction.\n  So for these three reasons alone, I believe our bipartisan amendment \nto title I significantly improves the bill which I otherwise could not \nsupport.\n  Now, many people have said this bill would not do anything in \nCalifornia. That is just not right. I will speak to that for a minute \nbecause we have terrible fires burning, 10 huge fires, 3 huge major \nfires: Every day, burning homes; every day, the victim of excess \nvegetation and hazardous fuel that has built up over many years and has \nnot been removed.\n  The fires in southern California are burning in two basic vegetation \ntypes: chaparral and the pine forests in the San Bernardino Mountains. \nThe exclusion to that is the fire burning up north, east of Redding. In \nboth of these vegetation types, treatments of fuels will reduce the \nrisk.\n  The first area where the southern California fires are burning is the \npine forests of the San Bernardino Mountains. I want you to take a look \nat these forests and look at the homes in the middle of this forest: \nHouse, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, \nhouse, house, house.\n  Do you notice the yellow forest? That is all dead and dying and \ninfested bark beetle forest. There are 44,000 homes located in the Big \nBear/Arrowhead area where this fire is now on two sides, moving. Look \nat these homes. Look at the dead and dying trees. Does anyone believe \nthey have a chance of surviving if this forest is not cleaned?\n  We have tried in appropriations bills to get more money--and we have \nbeen able to get some money in this year and last year for more removal \nof bark beetle-infected forests--but clearly this is an exact area of \nurban interface that is in catastrophic, highest risk of fire. No one \ncould tell me that if a hazardous fuels mitigation project had been \ncarried out around this area, these homes and tens of thousands like \nthem would not have been saved in this fire.\n  Everyone, look at this. That is what this bill means. If you are \ngoing to vote against this bill, just know that. This is correct and \nelegant testimony. About 474,000 acres in this forest. The San \nBernardino/San Jacinto, often both private and public lands, were \nexperiencing severe tree loss ranging from 10 percent of all the trees \nin a given area to 100 percent. That has been known for quite some \ntime. It has had years of drought. It has bark beetles. It has root \ndisease. It has dwarf mistletoe. They have all reached epidemic \nproportions. The cost assessment by the County Assessor's Office of \nthese homes and those surrounding them is $8 billion.\n  A century ago, this forest was fairly open, with mostly larger trees. \nExperts estimate there were likely 40 to 50 trees per acre back then. \nThe difference today is staggering. The Forest Service estimates there \nare now 500 trees per acre in much of the San Bernardino Mountains--40 \ntrees before fire suppression; 500 trees today.\n\n  That is also eloquent testimony to what happens with the fuel ladders \nthat are generated by the overcrowded forests. This is more than 10 \ntimes the density of trees that existed a century ago. It is startling, \nit is dramatic, and it is a huge difference. So this is what we have \ncreated with a century of ``do not cut a tree'' fire suppression: \nextremely dense, unhealthy forests.\n  The Senate agreement would get projects moving quickly to thin these \nforests and restore them to health. The San Bernardino Forest would be \namong the highest priority areas to receive hazardous fuel treatments \nunder the legislation. All the insect-infested areas would fall within \nthe priority areas for treatment.\n  With the expedited administrative review process, we could treat \nthese acres more quickly. Environmental analysis would focus on the \nwork that needs to be done, not multiple theoretical alternatives. We \nknow we need to thin these forests. We do not need to study 6 or 12 \ndifferent ways to do it.\n  The expedited administrative review process would also help us past \nthe confrontational delays caused in the current appeals process, and \nthe additional funding the bill authorizes would also help.\n  Finally, we have spoken to Republican colleagues who have agreed to \nadd a $50 million authorization for emergency grants to States and \nlocalities for dealing with situations exactly like those in the San \nBernardino Mountains today. So there is money to help communities do \ntheir wildfire plans to help them move to develop areas they believe \nneed this thinning, and these grants help additionally.\n  Communities could clear evacuation routes from mountain areas, like \nthe Lake Arrowhead region, to ensure that people have a chance to \nescape in the event of a catastrophic fire. One family trying to escape \nwith two children in their car was burned to death because the car \ncould not move faster than the fire.\n  Brush would be cleared around shelter-in-place locations like schools \nin case people do not have the opportunity to escape in time. \nCommunities would obtain funding for evacuation drills and other \nadvanced planning. I am very grateful the other side agreed to add this \n$50 million segment.\n  The Senate bill will also help prevent chaparral fires. Some have \nsaid: Oh, no, it won't. Here is Scripps Ranch. This is a large \nsubdivision outside San Diego. You see the fire--miles of fire line \napproaching the ranch.\n  The legislation authorizes significantly more money for hazardous \nfuel reduction efforts. We authorize a total of $760 million. That is \n$340 million above current funding. Again, the House bill has no \ndollars for this kind of public land mitigation. Our bill does.\n  Moreover, there is an understanding that the bill's sponsors will \nwork to continue to increase funding substantially. Let there be no \nmisunderstanding on this point, these funds are available to be used in \nbrush areas like chaparral as well as in forested areas.\n  Second, the legislation requires at least 50 percent of the funding \ngoes to community protection. This is a significant improvement over \ncurrent law which does not require any set amount of hazardous fuel \nreduction go for community protection.\n\n  Perhaps most importantly, the legislation calls for communities to \nplan their own defense through community wildlife protection plans. \nThat is a problem. People who live in dry Southern California areas \nwant the trees, want the bushes, want the fuels on the ground. \nHistorically they have resisted putting together community fire \nprotection plans. That is folly. They have to do it. In chaparral, it \nis important to get community support behind prescribed fires to clear \nout the brush. So far, as I said, many communities have been reluctant \nto support prescribed fires because of the perceived risks of these \nfires. But community wildfire\n\n[[Page S13468]]\n\nplans will give the community the ability to choose whether it wants \nthe risks of prescribed fire--or some cutting or thinning--or the much \ngreater risks of wildfire.\n  Community wildfire plans will play an important role in gaining \npopular support for a workable way to defend these dry communities.\n  Another key issue--I am just about through--in chaparral is reducing \nthe risk of homes burning on private land. The community wildfire plans \nprovided for in this bill will help in this area, too, because they are \nrequired to include recommendations to reduce homes igniting throughout \nthe community.\n  We owe it to our communities to do the best we can to protect them \nfrom catastrophic fire. I wish--I truly do, from the bottom of my \nheart--the California wildfires would be quickly extinguished and \ncontrolled. We need to do everything we possibly can.\n  I might report the regional forester called this morning. We have \nbeen pushing the White House and the Defense Department to lend every \npiece of available equipment--C-130s, Sea Stallion helicopters with \nbuckets, tankers--everything they have. For the first time, I got the \nreport that they have everything they need now to fight these big \nfires. I am very grateful for that and express my gratitude.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief.\n  I have one question for the Senator from California, but first I want \nto thank her for the exceptional work she and her staff have done on \nthis issue for over 4 years.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have chaired the subcommittee. I have been the ranking \nminority member. I do not think my knowledge on this subject compares \nto that of the knowledge of the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is very kind.\n  Mr. WYDEN. She has thrown herself into this, and we thank her for all \nher efforts. We all empathize with what your constituents are going \nthrough. The people of California, a year ago, helped my constituents. \nWe are trying to help yours. We thank you for it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I just say, thank you for the help that has come \nfrom Oregon. It is a long way away. But we are very grateful. New \nMexico is sending help. Nevada--the Senator from Nevada is on the \nfloor--sent help. Arizona has sent help. We are very grateful for that.\n\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n  One very brief question. I have sensed from the beginning of the \ndebate that probably the most contentious issue coming up is this \nquestion of making sure the public is still involved in the process, \nthe whole question of what is called NEPA, the National Environmental \nPolicy Act.\n  The Senator is so correct in saying we have made it clear that the \nSenate bill is not something we are going to allow to be unraveled. But \nI think one of the reasons for it is because the Senate bill differs \nvery dramatically with what the other body is talking about with \nrespect to keeping the public in the process.\n  The other body, in effect, takes the public out of the process by \npredetermining these NEPA alternatives. What we have said in our \ncompromise would be to say the public can actually offer an \nalternative. The public has a right to go into this process, known as \nscoping, and actually come to the table and offer an alternative.\n  The Senator has made the point that not one current opportunity for \npublic comment would be lost under this compromise.\n  I would be interested in the Senator's analysis of how the public \nstays involved, because I think this is probably the most contentious \nquestion we may be faced with as we try to wrap up this bill, hopefully \ntoday.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is correct, through the Chair, if I may. \nWe have discussed this and both of us wanted to protect the \ncollaborative process. We wanted to protect the ability of individuals \nto go to meetings, to state their issues, to have those issues \nconsidered.\n  The only change I see in this is twofold. The first is that they will \nhave the environmental review to look at, which is important in \nunderstanding what you differ with in the environmental review and then \nbeing able to make the case.\n  Secondly, the number of alternatives is reduced from five to nine to \none. There is a good reason for that. As I pointed out earlier, if we \nwere talking about a network of highways or something like that, you \nmay want five to nine alternatives to be considered. We are talking \nabout an area which has been designated in the highest risk of \ncatastrophic fire. Therefore, the alternative would be one. For \nexample, do you believe there is too much thinning? Do you believe \nthere is too much burning? Would you do mechanical in what proportion \nto burning to thin this area out? There would be the ability to come in \nwith one precise alternative.\n  Of course, the other alternative that some might argue for is to do \nnothing. They would have that ability as well.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague and again tell her how much I have \nappreciated a chance to be her partner.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. You have been a great ranking member and I have \nenjoyed every minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have listened to the statements here \ntoday. They are all very good. People have worked hard on their \nstatements. But I want to simply say this: We have a bill to complete, \nand we want everyone who has any interest in it to come and give their \nstatements. When that time has come, we will start the amendment \nprocess.\n  We have worked on this bill now 3 hours, and the only amendment \noffered is the one by the chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran. \nWhat I wanted to do is ask unanimous consent--he already has the floor, \nthe chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--that \nfollowing the statement of Senator Domenici, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Bingaman, would be recognized to give a statement. \nIt is my understanding the Senator from Alaska wishes to give a \nstatement. Following Senator Bingaman, the Senator from Alaska be \nrecognized to give a statement on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking consent for that \nsequence?\n  Mr. REID. I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senate for allowing a \nlengthy debate this morning about a very serious issue. I am looking \nacross the Senate to the distinguished junior Senator from Alaska, a \nnew Member of the Senate. She has behind her a very big picture. She \nwill explain it in more detail. But might I ask, that is a picture of a \ntotally infested forest in your State; correct?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would you mind answering a couple of questions? We have \nbeen hearing about fires in California moving in the direction now, if \nthey have not already, of an area that is highly infested.\n  Last night on television we heard various announcers talk about it. \nThey described it from the field, for those who were there. They said: \nThis forest is like Christmas trees many months after Christmas, just \nstanding there like dried pieces of wood. And they said that we know \nwhat happens to those after Christmas when you put a match to them.\n  That is what we are talking about in this forest you have there.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. That is correct. It is not just a small patch we are \ntalking about. We have over 5 million acres of infested and dead timber \nstanding there just waiting, as the Senator indicated, to crumble and \nact as fuel for any fire. It is as the Senator described. It is like \nthat Christmas tree. There is absolutely no life to it with the needles \njust crumbling in your hands. It is that dry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before Senator Feinstein leaves on her way out, I will \nnot ask you anything; I am just going to speak about you.\n\n[[Page S13469]]\n\n  First, I thank you for your leadership in this regard. Some people \nthink that it is only New Mexico and Utah and Wyoming that have forest \nfire problems and that have forests that are clogged to the gills \nbecause we have not maintained and cleaned them. Some think the only \ninfested forests are in Alaska.\n  As I understand it, you have all of those and probably in larger \nquantities than most of us combined. I say, for those of us who have \nbeen trying desperately to get a bill that treated these situations in \na way that could be solved, it was truly a Godsend that we got some \npowerful and thinking Democrats who decided to join us. You are one of \nthem.\n  Senator Wyden, I thank you. There are more than the two of you. But \nevery time we needed a voice, you were there. I don't know what they \nsaid about you at home. I don't know what those people who don't want \nto do anything said about you. But I assumed they didn't say all nice \nthings because every time you try to modify the law, there is somebody \nback home who runs an ad that you are trying to log all the forests in \nthe State or that you don't care about preserving the beauty of your \nState, that you have just turned yours over to the logging industry.\n  I see the Senator nodding. You must have had some of that already. \nAnd Senator Wyden, you must have, although you have already felt the \nwrath of not being able to log anything in your State, and you have \nseen what happened to thousands of workers.\n  I just wanted to, as part of my opening remarks, thank you.\n  We will also have to take up, as part of the Iraq bill, the Domenici-\nFeinstein bill on proper notice and opening up all the decisions that \nare going to be made over there to the public and in a regular order \nmanner. We will do that later in the day and maybe have another \nvictory.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair, if I may, I would like to thank \nyou, Senator. I appreciate the chairmanship of this committee, your \nworking with Senator Wyden and I. I am delighted to hear what you have \nsaid about the emergency supplemental and getting the report language \nback in. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have an array of Senators, not just Republicans--not \nthe few who have been fighting for years about this issue of the \nfailure to maintain our forests--we have a lot of Senators who have \ncome around to our way of thinking, Democrat and Republican. It almost \nis unbelievable to see that forest in Alaska, which is no longer a \nforest other than by name, to see what is happening in California as \nbrush fires move quickly toward an entire forest that is dried, dead \ntrees, and then to ask the question: Why is that so? Wouldn't it be \nrational that we cut them down? Wouldn't it be rational that rather \nthan leave them there as natural incendiaries, ready to literally blow \nup, just poof, and they go right up in the sky as these kind of trees \nburn, wouldn't it be logical to do something about it?\n  Well, the truth is, we have not been able to do anything about it for \none of the most ridiculous reasons anybody could have in mind, but it \nhas worked until today. That is, anything you try to do is logging \nforests. Anything you try to do is turning the forests over to the \nloggers. Would you believe year after year after year that has \nprevailed? I don't know what we could have done when we passed \nlegislation, when we begged these same groups, let's write in something \nabout logging, let's talk about the size of the trees, let's do \nanything reasonable, as we talked about what has happened to American \nforests.\n  I don't know if the distinguished occupant of the chair knows what \nforests looked like 20 years ago in our public forests, and what they \nlook like today; but I can tell you they don't look like the same \nforests. They used to be cleaned: there used to be spacing; it used to \nbe that the trees--I nicknamed what we were trying to do one time on \nthe Senate floor--what we are trying to do is make the forests \n``happy'' again. I meant that they could see the sun, and they would \nprobably smile, instead of being clogged up together where they grow \nstraight up. But nobody dare touch that forest and clean it up and make \nit a forest like it used to be because they will be sued and things \nwill be delayed, a judge will take over, and the judge will say: Every \n``t'' has not been crossed, every ``i'' has not been dotted. You cannot \ndo it.\n  One day in 1998, after we had our share of fires, after a huge fire \nin my State--I think it was the second most serious fire to the \nCalifornia fires in terms of burning down homes--450 houses at Los \nAlamos. Incidentally, if you are looking at what things might cost, \nthat was done by the Federal Government that messed up and burned it by \nmistake and we had to pay. That one cost over a half billion dollars to \nthe town and the people for what they lost, including houses and \nstreets that were broken and torn up. I would not even want to guess \nwhat the California fire will cost. I hope that the houses are insured.\n  Nonetheless, if you add it all up, it is costs. I don't see how it is \ngoing to be less than $5 billion or $6 billion, based on the little bit \nI know that I am sharing with you. The truth is that there is no reason \nunder the Sun to delay moving ahead with that forest in Alaska, and \nmoving ahead quickly, get it cut down; and whatever utility there is in \nthe trees, use it. If there is none, have planned burns so you can give \nway to some growth that will be healthy again. That is why we have \ncalled this now the Healthy Forests Act.\n  Might I quickly say that while we weren't able to expedite everything \nthe way some of us wanted, although everything is expedited in this \nbill, at least cleaning up forests such as the one in Alaska, huge \nacres of infested trees, in this bill that will move quickly in the \nfuture. It can be delayed and go to court once. But the overall thrust \nof the bill is that it won't be delayed for years as in the past. So \nthe distinguished Senator from Alaska hopes to see some of that removed \nsoon, during her first elected term in the Senate.\n  Now, I began by thanking Senator Cochran and his staff for moving \nahead with this legislation. It was determined that it was their \njurisdiction because of the way it was written, not the jurisdiction of \nmy committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. They did a \ngreat job. I am not going to bother the Senate with a lot of statistics \nabout the health of our national forests, but there are some facts of \nimportance.\n  Our Federal agencies tell us that 190 million acres are at risk to \ncatastrophic fires or attack from insects and disease--190 million \nacres. This is an area equal to the size of Maine, Vermont, New \nHampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New \nJersey, Pennsylvania, and most of Maryland. It means that much land \ncovered by forests is no longer real forest, it is insect-riddled \nforest like that in the photo of Alaska, most of which should be \nremoved so good trees can grow, and so we can eliminate catastrophic \nfires that can occur quickly, simply, and easily and go through and \nscourge the area--worse than Attila the Hun--leaving nothing.\n\n  In the last 5 years, we have burned--including what we have burned \nthis year--24 million acres; 24 million acres have been scorched. That \nis an area as large as Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. I am \nnot here saying we will never have forest fires and we should never \nhave them. What I am saying is they should not be occurring where \nimprovements exist, homes exist, National Laboratories exist, where \nbusinesses exist because we already know we ought to clean around them \nso they will not burn.\n  As a matter of fact, the principal reason for the bill I introduced, \nwhich I said we called ``happy forests,'' was to get at this issue we \ncalled urban interface. We still have not done a great deal. In fact, I \nam just learning that of the $250 million that we put in that bill back \nthen, there is still over $100 million in both the BLM and Forest \nService that has not been spent on happy forests. So maybe when we get \nthis bill finished, we can finally get an organized plan for funding \nthat will see us making some headway. We have seen insects destroy the \nforests in a dozen Western States, severely impacting forests in \nEastern States.\n  One such outbreak in southeastern California has destroyed 450,000 \nacres, half the national forest that it is located on, in an area \nalmost as large as the State of Rhode Island.\n  Let me put the forest health disaster in context. During that same \nperiod,\n\n[[Page S13470]]\n\nthe Forest Service has only thinned or harvested 1.4 million acres, \nwhich is slightly larger than Delaware. We have burned 17 times more \nrangeland in the last 5 years than we have attempted to manage--land \nthat we know should be managed, cleaned up, unclogged, and we should \nget rid of the waste on the ground that is a fire trap. We have burned \n17 times more than we have attempted to clean up and manage.\n  So this bill is going to improve forest health, if we can ever get it \npassed. I hope those who have delayed it in the Senate will let us get \non with it. I have been amazed to hear the reason some have said--that \nthey are holding this bill up because they could not understand it. \nWell, I don't know how all these Senators, from the ones I mentioned on \nthe other side of the aisle to the ones on this side, could all say it \nis a meaningful bill, and then we can have one or two Senators, or \ntheir staffs, saying they are against it because they don't know what \nit means. Maybe they should ask or let us bring it up, and if they \nthink it is not clear, offer an amendment.\n  I think it is clear, and I think it is a good bill. I don't think in \nsome areas it goes far enough, but you have to do what you can. Now we \nhave a great bipartisan coalition and we will have to work with the \nHouse, which wants to go more in the direction of expediting matters. \nBut this is going to result in improving the health of our forests over \ntime. It will result in a more public expedited process for moving \nhazardous fuels projects through the NEPA process. I didn't say \n``without'' the NEPA process, as we are being accused of out in the \nhinterland. It is going to provide that that would be expedited. There \nis nothing in the NEPA law that says you cannot do that. It prioritizes \nthe treatment of 20 million acres in the wildland/urban interface. I \ndescribed that.\n  Twenty million acres are supposed to receive high-priority treatment \nto clean this stuff that is around urbaness, and make it less volatile \nfrom the standpoint of burning. When we had our Los Alamos fire, which \nI alluded to, it came perilously close to burning some very important \nlaboratory buildings. Suffice it to say that most of them were saved \nbecause the laboratory had cleaned up 200 or 300 feet around each one \nand left no trees, so they had to jump all the way over that to get \nsome buildings.\n  On the other hand, the fire got a few buildings that were not so \nimportant and where there had been no cleaning and burned them. We \nspent a lot of money replacing a few of the buildings.\n  This bill says 20 million of this wildland/urban interface, as well \nas outside the wildland/urban interface is at highest risk, and they \nare called that: high-risk areas.\n  This bill calls for court cases on hazardous fuels projects to be \nheard within the district in which they are located, encouraging the \ncourts to deal with these cases in a timely manner, and directs that \nall preliminary injunctions be reviewed every 60 days, with an \nopportunity for the parties to update the judges on the conditions \nabout which courts should know.\n  Finally, the bill reminds the courts that when weighing the equities, \nthey should balance the impacts to the ecosystem of the short- and \nlong-term effects of undertaking a project against the short- and long-\nterm effects of not undertaking a project. That is very important. It \ncannot be one-sided. There is always somebody who can say there is a \nbad side to it, but the judges now will have to look at and balance the \nshort- and long-term effects of not doing the project with undertaking \nthe project. They are going to find that a lot more than in the past, \nit will not be subject to the court holding them up.\n  What is the difference in the House bill and this bill?\n  First, we have restricted the use of this authority under this act to \nonly the highest risk areas.\n  We have emphasized the importance of working within the wildland \nurban interface by requiring 50 percent of the funds nationally be \nspent within the wildland urban interface.\n  We have emphasized the importance of quickly dealing with insect and \ndisease epidemics and the salvage of wind-thrown or ice-damaged timber \ndue to their suseptability to insects and disease.\n  We have increased the amount of up-front public input to project \ndevelopment and NEPA by adding a process for communities to develop a \ncommunity fire protection plan to help inform the Federal land managers \nof a community's priorities and by requiring all projects to be \ndeveloped through the collaborative process developed by the western \nGovernors group.\n  We have added the authority for the agencies, in cooperation with \nState and local government, to treat community escape routes as part of \nthe wildland urban interface. This is a major improvement over the \nHouse-passed bill.\n  Until the community fire protection plans are completed, we have laid \nout criteria for how far from the wildland urban interface the \ncommunity protection projects may be undertaken. These criteria are \nflexible enough to take advantage of geographic features, such as \nridge-tops, rivers, or roads, but restrictive enough to ensure projects \nundertaken in the wildland urban interface will really protect the \ncommunity.\n  We clarified what Congress wants in terms of a new pre-decisional \nprotest process by requiring the Secretary to establish such a process \nwhile ensuring the public will play a part in the development of the \nnew appeals process.\n  Unlike the House version, we have limited the use of this new appeals \nprocess to just projects authorized by this act, rather than having it \napply to all Forest Service activities.\n  We have, for the first time, included language designed to protect \nold growth and fire resistant large trees. This protection is based on \nforest plans.\n  Where those forest plans are old, or outdated, we require the \nSecretary to complete a plan revision or amendment to address old \ngrowth and large fire resilient trees, while at the same time including \nenough flexibility to ensure work need to improve fire resiliency can \nbe carried out.\n  We have narrowed the scope of changes under judicial review to just \nthose projects undertaken under the authority of this act.\n  We have also included all of the judicial review provisions from the \nWyden-Feinstein proposal, S. 1352.\n  Finally, we have authorized $760 million annually for hazardous fuel \nreduction work, including the projects authorized under this act, which \nis more than double what is currently being requested.\n  I thank the Senate for listening. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, is to be recognized at this \ntime.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, even if we were not having the catastrophic fires we \nare seeing every day in southern California right now, the forest \nhealth issue is of vital importance to us in the West, and many of the \nspeeches that have been given here underscore that.\n  I am glad the Senate is considering a forest health bill with the \nopportunity for us to offer amendments. I will not go through all of my \nstatement because I know we want to get to those amendments. There has \nbeen a lot of time used already in discussing the bill in general \nterms. We need to get down to some of the specific amendments.\n  Let me make a few general statements about the bill because I do \nthink it is good to at least give our perspective on the situation.\n  Some have tried to portray the issue as one of support for the \nconcept of active management of our national forests on the one hand as \nopposed to simply allowing nature to take its course. Let me be clear \nthat I do not agree with that portrayal of the debate taking place in \nthe Congress. I have always viewed active forest management as not only \na desirable policy but one that is absolutely necessary. In my opinion, \nsupport for active and responsible forest management does not equate \nwith support necessarily for all the provisions in this substitute \namendment that will be coming before us.\n  I want to be sure that whatever legislative language we pass provides \nmeaningful new authority to Federal land managers, that it is focused \non the communities that are most threatened by wildfire, and that it \ndoes not unduly restrict the public's ability to participate in the \noversight of public lands management.\n  In addition, I believe commercial timber operations are an important\n\n[[Page S13471]]\n\npart of our national forest policy. It is important that legislation \ndealing with forest health not be a pretext for accomplishing that \npurpose as well.\n  I wish to discuss some of the concerns with the forest health issue \nbased on the initial reading I have done of the amendment we are going \nto be debating and amending.\n  Let me begin by stating the obvious. That is, the health of our \nNation's forests is absolutely critical at this point due to \ngenerations of misguided forest management policies. Many forests are \novercrowded with unhealthy buildup of underbrush and tree overcrowding. \nI think all the experts in this field recognize that. We see evidence \nof that not only with the California fires, but we see evidence of it \nthroughout the country.\n  The effect of these large wildfires can be catastrophic, as we all \ncan see. We have, as Senator Domenici indicated, seen some of this \ncatastrophe in my home State of New Mexico. He made reference to the \nCerro Grande fire at Los Alamos where a substantial number of homes \nwere destroyed and a great amount of the forest was also destroyed.\n  Clearly, we need to take proactive steps to improve forest health. In \nmy view, the proposed forest health amendment does some things right \nbut, in some respects, I think it misses that opportunity. It does not \nprovide any meaningful new authority for funding to help Federal land \nmanagers, but it does add new restrictions on the public's ability to \nparticipate and restrictions on the Federal courts' ability to review \nwhat is done.\n  There is a basic disagreement among some of us in Congress and among \nthose who are most ardently supporting this amendment, and that is a \ndisagreement about what is the most significant public policy issue we \nare faced with in trying to come to grips with these catastrophic \nfires.\n\n  The amendment we are going to be debating seems to be based on the \npremise that the underlying and essential problem that needs fixing is \nthat we have too much public participation in the decisionmaking \nprocess, in management decisions, administrative appeals, and lawsuits.\n  One of the speakers earlier today talked about a litigation \nparalysis, saying that is the problem, that is why these forests are \nburning up. That is what we need to change most quickly. I say this \nbecause the major new authorities provided in the amendment are ones \nthat limit appeals of agency decisions, limit judicial review, and \nrequire courts to follow new standards. I don't really think the facts \nsupport this assumption that litigation is the major and most \nsignificant problem we face.\n  I recently asked the General Accounting Office to study whether the \nNational Environmental Policy Act compliance requirements, the agency \nappeals, and the litigation that has occurred were causing significant \ndelays in hazardous fuel reduction projects.\n  The GAO issued a preliminary report in May. They just completed a \nfinal report last Friday. The GAO in that report reviewed 818 Forest \nService management decisions over a 2-year period, fiscal years 2001 \nand 2002, and these 818 forest management decisions involving fuel \nreduction activities on 4.8 million acres of land. These were the first \n2 years of the so-called national fire plan which we have all been \ntrying to see implemented.\n  It is worthwhile to take just a minute to summarize what the GAO \nfound. The GAO found that the vast majority of acres treated were \ncategorically excluded by the Forest Service from NEPA review. That is \na term of art, ``categorically excluded.'' That means this is authority \nin the law for the Forest Service to say: We are going to exclude \ncertain areas from NEPA review, and we have the authority to do that.\n  The GAO found the vast majority of acres that were treated were, in \nfact, categorically excluded. None of these projects were appealed, \nnone were litigated, none were subject to appeal, and none were subject \nto litigation.\n  Only 25 of the 818 were litigated. That represents about 3 percent of \nall projects. That involved about 100,000 acres. Again, this is out of \nthe 4.8 million acres that was studied by the GAO for those 2 years.\n\n  Significantly, the GAO found of those 25 cases that were litigated, \n23 involved commercial timber sales. Of the 25 cases that were \nlitigated, the courts found the Forest Service lost on all but one of \nthose cases. So to the extent litigation was involved, the vast \nmajority of the time the Forest Service was found to have been in \nviolation of the law.\n  In my opinion, litigation is not the major problem. I am not saying \nwe cannot do some things to streamline the appeals process and to be \nsure any frivolous litigation is eliminated, but I do think we need to \nrecognize the GAO made a study that shed some light on what we are \ndoing.\n  The majority of forest-thinning projects were categorically excluded \nfrom NEPA. In my State, in region 3 of the Forest Service, which \nincluded Arizona and New Mexico, the GAO found 78 percent of the \nprojects were excluded, and that covered 91 percent of the affected \nacreage. So 91 percent of the affected acreage was never subject to \nappeal, never subject to litigation.\n  This is a useful report. There is a one-page summary of it. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The only other report we have analyzing empirical data \nof the Forest Service appeals involved a 2003 study by a political \nscience professor at Northern Arizona University. Contrary to the \nassertions of the Bush administration, the Northern Arizona University \nstudy found the number of appeals had been decreasing since 1998.\n  I will speak a little bit about what I do see as a major issue as \npart of this legislation. Based on our experience with forest health \nissues in my State, the real issue has not been judicial appeals, \njudicial review, but instead has been providing adequate funding for \nforest health projects and stopping the Forest Service's harmful \npractice of borrowing funds from fire prevention accounts in order to \npay for the cost of fighting forest fires. I will offer an amendment on \nthat in a few minutes. I wanted to flag that as an essential problem I \nthink needs to be dealt with. It is not dealt with in the amendment \ncoming to the floor now, but I will give the Senate the opportunity to \ndeal with it. I hope the Senate will agree with me this is something we \nneed to fix.\n  I commend Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, for their efforts \nto secure $400 million last month to repay the accounts the agencies \nborrowed in order to fight fires. I also appreciate Senator Burns's \ncomment that the $400 million is not the final word, especially since \nthe estimates those agencies have given is they actually had to borrow \nover $600 million from other programs so far this year.\n  However, the year-to-year approach we have followed of borrowing \nfunds from other accounts in order to deal with forest fires is just \nnot adequate. Even when our Senate Appropriations colleagues were able \nto obtain supplemental funding to repay these other Forest Service \naccounts, every year on-the-ground restoration work is substantially \ndelayed while the Forest Service waits for a supplemental \nappropriations bill to be enacted into law.\n\n  In New Mexico, there are some very critical Forest Service fire \nprevention projects that were postponed for up to a year as a result of \nborrowing from these accounts. These include wildland/urban interface \nfuels projects in the Carson National Forest, the Gila National Forest, \nthe Lincoln National Forest, and the Santa Fe National Forest.\n  In addition, a contract for construction of a fuel break around a \ncommunity at risk in the Cibola National Forest was postponed for 6 \nmonths because of the agency borrowing to cover firefighting costs.\n  This is not criticism of the agency. The agency has no alternative \nbut to do this borrowing, the way we have set it up. What happens is \nvery simple. The President asks for too little money for firefighting. \nHe does that every year--at least he has for the last several years. I \nhave some charts I will show in a few minutes on that.\n  The President asks for too little money. We in the Congress agree \nwith\n\n[[Page S13472]]\n\nthe President and appropriate too little money. Then when the fires \nstart happening, of course, the Forest Service has to find ways to \nfight those fires. The only option they have is to shut down their \nactivities in other areas and use that money instead to fight fires.\n  One of the other areas they shut down activity in is in this forest-\nthinning work, so that we put it off, say, OK, we cannot get it done \nthis year; we are too busy fighting fires; we will try to get it done \nnext year. Then next year comes and once again they may have to use the \nmoney they had hoped to use for the forest-thinning activities and the \nforest health activities to, in fact, fight fires. That has happened \nyear in and year out. It is a classic case of being so busy killing \nalligators that there is not time to drain the swamp. That is exactly \nthe position we have put the Forest Service in and we need to try to \ncorrect that. I will offer an amendment with the hope the Senate will \nagree with me and make that correction.\n  The lack of funding for forest health projects continues to constrain \nour efforts to actively manage our forests to deal with these disease \nand drought conditions which have been discussed at length. Three years \nago, Congress found funding was the main obstacle to improving forest \nhealth and reducing a threat of unnaturally intense catastrophic \nwildfire. Specifically, we have created the National Fire Plan, with \n$1.6 billion in new funding for existing programs, to improve forest \nhealth conditions. At that time, we all agreed on the need to sustain a \ncommitment to the National Fire Plan over a long enough period so we \ncould make a difference. We were talking about 15 years. That meant at \na minimum sustaining the fiscal year 2001 funding levels for all \ncomponents of the National Fire Plan.\n  Unfortunately, as I stated just a few minutes ago, the administration \nhas systematically and continually proposed major cuts and, in some \ncases, zeroing out critical programs within that National Fire Plan, \nincluding the burned area restoration program, rehabilitation projects, \neconomic action programs, community and private land fire assistance. \nSo the proposed cuts we have received in the budgets each year have \neliminated funding for these programs, notwithstanding the clearly \nidentified demand for these programs. For example, New Mexico and other \nStates have suffered unnaturally intense, catastrophic fires, and there \nis a desperate need for funds to restore and rehabilitate the burned \nareas.\n  Finally, the 2002 report and conclusion by the National Academy of \nPublic Administration confirmed the main obstacle constraining the \nForest Service from substantially increasing its proactive efforts to \nreduce fire risk is the lack of adequate funding. The proposed \namendment to H.R. 1904 authorizes $760 million. I appreciate the fact \nthat funding level is in there, but it does not ensure the real funding \nwill be provided. The problem is, when we get into the actual \nappropriating of funds, we do not get the job done.\n  In earlier debates, I have repeatedly stated the Forest Service needs \nto focus its hazardous fuels reduction effort more directly on the \nthreats communities face. We will have an amendment to that effect. I \nknow Senator Boxer from California has an amendment to try to do a \nbetter job in that regard. I think that will be an important issue for \nus to try to deal with as well.\n  In sum, Congress required a sufficient proportion of all hazardous \nfuels reduction funds be spent on projects near \ncommunities. Nevertheless, the General Accounting Office recently found \nthat more than two-thirds of the Forest Service decisions involving \nfuel reduction activities were targeted exclusively at lands outside \nthis wildland/urban interface area. The amendment that has been brought \nto the floor here goes on to state that this requirement is based on a \nnational average, this 50 percent requirement. They are saying we \nshould have 50 percent going for projects near communities, in this \nwildland/urban interface. If you have a requirement such as that based \non national average, obviously individual forests or even entire \nregions can significantly ignore this direction we were giving them.\n\n  In addition, the provisions of the amendment only apply to funds \nallocated for projects pursuant to title I of H.R. 1904 rather than to \nthe entire hazardous fuels reduction program.\n  There are many questions about the specific language of the amendment \nat which we need to look. Let me talk for just a minute about the new \nadministrative appeals process.\n  Apart from what the amendment does not do, I am very concerned with \nsome of the things the new authority does try to do. The provision that \nseems the least developed in the amendment, the one that causes me \nsignificant concern, is section 105. This section directs the Secretary \nof Agriculture to establish a predecisional administrative review \nprocess that will serve as the:\n\n     sole means by which a person can seek administrative review \n     of a hazardous fuel reduction project. . . .\n\n  This predecisional process is described as covering the period \nfollowing the completion of the appropriate NEPA document up to the \ndate a final agency decision is issued.\n  I understand the desire to ensure that interested members of the \npublic are involved during the development of the proposed agency \nproject, and to avoid lawsuits by those who have not been involved in \nthe process, and I certainly agree with that.\n  However, I think the language is somewhat troubling. As I understand \nit, the language would limit the right to administratively appeal an \nagency decision, as well as the ability to challenge it in Federal \ncourt, to those who have exhausted the predecisional review process. So \nwe are going to significantly limit the right to appeal or challenge a \ndecision based on a process that has not been established yet and that \nwe are not really clear on what it will permit.\n  There are other questions about that. As I understand it, there will \nlikely be an amendment offered on that issue as well.\n  Let me say a word about the Federal courts because many of the others \nwho have spoken have done that. The amendment that has been offered \nhere limits the court's ability to issue a preliminary injunction to no \nmore than 60 days, although a court can renew an injunction \nindefinitely.\n  In order to issue a preliminary injunction, a court needs to find \nseveral things: No. 1, that the plaintiff is likely to prevail on the \nmerits. That is the first thing the court needs to find. No. 2, that \nthere will be irreparable harm if the injunction is not issued. No. 3, \nthe harm to the plaintiff in not issuing the injunction is not \noutweighed by the harm to the defendant of issuing the injunction. And, \nNo. 4, that issuing the injunction is in the public interest.\n  So a Federal court has to find quite a few things to issue a \npreliminary injunction. Having made this determination, I wonder why we \nthen are saying to the court, unless you come back and renew that \ninjunction every 60 days, we in Congress are going to assume the agency \nwas right and you were wrong. The court has already determined that \nmost likely the agency is in error. So I have concerns about that.\n\n  I understand there is a great desire here to limit the Federal \ncourt's ability to issue injunctions, preliminary injunctions. My \nunderstanding is, also, that this not only limits preliminary \ninjunctions, it limits the Federal court's rights to issue permanent \ninjunctions in some questionable ways.\n  Let me say just briefly, I do think we need to be sure the bill has \nadequate protections for national monuments and for roadless areas. \nThere are provisions to exclude designated wilderness and wilderness \nstudy areas from the bill. I think we should have that same provision \napply to national monuments. I hope we can persuade our colleagues that \nthat makes good sense. I have been told by some that is certainly their \nintent.\n  Turning to my home State, 3 years ago we created the Valles Caldera \nNational Preserve in northern New Mexico. I think it would be good to \nknow how the provisions in this amendment would be used there, in that \ntype of arrangement. Perhaps we can clarify that. I hope we can.\n  There are several other questions about how this relates to other \nforest initiatives: How does it interact with recent legislative and \nadministrative actions regarding forest health?\n  There is a stewardship contracting program that includes exemptions \nfrom\n\n[[Page S13473]]\n\nthe National Forest Management Act and provides new authority for the \nForest Service and for the BLM to trade the value of big trees removed \nby a contractor for restoration services completed by that same \ncontractor. We need to see how this new legislation would impact upon \nthat.\n  In addition, the administration has taken several regulatory actions \nrecently under its Healthy Forests initiative. It has promulgated new \nrules establishing a categorical exclusion from NEPA, which would apply \nto projects, including timber sales, that cover up to 1,000 acres each. \nThe administration has published new rules overhauling the Forest \nService appeals process. Those new rules exempt all ``categorically \nexcluded projects from appeal.''\n  In other words, the administration has taken significant action to \ndeal with several of these issues. We need to know how this legislation \naffects the actions that have already been taken.\n  Slash treatments is another issue that I think deserves some \nattention. We have a serious issue here in that in my home State they \ngo through, they cut down the diseased small trees, they put them into \npiles, and then they have to come back and do a sequential treatment, \ncome back and remove that slash and be sure it does not become bug \ninfested and become an even greater problem. The GAO analysis found \nthat in my State the Forest Service and BLM completed only 19 of the 34 \nfollowup slash treatments that they had committed to do in a timely \nmanner. Again, it is probably a lack of funding that has caused that \nshortfall.\n  I have some additional concerns and questions about the provisions in \nthe amendment. I will raise those at the appropriate time as we get \ninto the amendments.\n  In closing, let me reiterate I am very glad we are proceeding to \nconsideration of the bill. Since some of us were not involved in the \nnegotiations, I do think it is appropriate we offer some amendments. \nEspecially it is important for Senators from States that are directly \naffected by this threat to have that opportunity. I commend the people \nwho did work hard in getting this legislation to this point. I do think \nthere has been a genuine effort to find some compromise and to make \nsome improvements. Clearly, this bill as it stands is substantially \nbetter than what the House has sent us. But it can be substantially \nimproved from where it is. I hope the amendment we offer can be \nseriously considered, and hopefully adopted, and we make those \nimprovements.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   United States General Accounting Office--Report to Congressional \n                               Requesters\n\n\n forest service--information on appeals and litigation involving fuels \n                          reduction activities\n\n                         Why GAO did this study\n\n       The federal fire community's decades old policy of \n     suppressing wildland fires as soon as possible has caused a \n     dangerous increase in vegetation density in our nation's \n     forests. This density increase combined with severe drought \n     over much of the United States has created a significant \n     threat of catastrophic wildfires. In response to this threat, \n     the Forest Service performs activities to reduce the buildup \n     of brush, small trees, and other vegetation on national \n     forest land. With the increased threat of catastrophic \n     wildland fires, there have been concerns about delays in \n     implementing activities to reduce these ``forest fuels.'' \n     Essentially, these concerns focus on the extent to which \n     public appeals and litigation of Forest Service decisions to \n     implement forest fuels reduction activities unnecessarily \n     delay efforts to reduce fuels.\n       The Forest Service does not keep a national database on the \n     number of forest fuels reduction activities that are appealed \n     or litigated. Accordingly, GAO was asked to develop this \n     information for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Among other \n     things, GAO was asked to determine (1) the number of \n     decisions involving fuels reduction activities and the number \n     of acres affected, (2) the number of decisions that were \n     appealed and/or litigated and the number of acres affected, \n     (3) the outcomes of appealed and/or litigated decisions, and \n     (4) the number of appeals that were processed within \n     prescribed time frames.\n\n                             What GAO found\n\n       In a GAO survey of all national forests, forest managers \n     reported the following:\n       In fiscal years 2001 and 2002, 818 decisions involved fuels \n     reduction activities covering 4.8 million acres.\n       Of the 818 decisions involving fuels reduction activities, \n     about 24 percent were appealed--affecting 954,000 acres. \n     However, of the 818 decisions, more than half, 486 decisions, \n     could not be appealed because they involved activities with \n     little or no environmental impact. Of the 332 appealable \n     decisions, 194 (about 58 percent) were appealed. There can \n     multiple appeals per decision. In addition, 25 decisions (3 \n     percent) affecting about 111,000 acres were litigated.\n       For 73 percent of the appealed decisions, the Forest \n     Service allowed the fuels reduction activities to be \n     implemented without changes; 8 percent required some changes \n     before being implemented; and about 19 percent could not be \n     implemented. Of the 25 litigated decisions, 19 have been \n     resolved.\n       About 79 percent of appeals were processed within the \n     prescribed 90-day time frame. Of the remaining 21 percent, \n     the processing times ranged from 91 days to 240 days.\n       The Forest Service, in commenting on a draft of this \n     report, generally agreed with the report's contents. Their \n     specific comments and our evaluation of them are provided in \n     the report.\n\n SUMMARY OF FOREST SERVICE DECISIONS AND APPEALS INFORMATION FOR FISCAL\n                           YEARS 2001 and 2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Impacts\n                                   Little or     initially    Total for\n        Decisions/appeals          no impact/  uncertain or      all\n                                      not      significant/   decisions\n                                   appealable   appealable\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNumber of decisions.............          486           332          818\nNumber of appealed decisions....            3           194          197\nPercentage of decisions appealed           \n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13483-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13483-S13484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding Senator Frist and \nSenator Daschle have agreed there would be 3 hours of debate on that \nmatter tonight and 2 hours tomorrow, so I would ask the leader to \nmodify his request accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, first of all, let me make a couple \ncomments about tonight's and tomorrow's schedule to make it clear.\n  First of all, the understanding is 3 hours tonight on the climate \nchange bill and then 2 hours in the morning. To put everything in \nperspective, because we are dealing with about four different issues \nnow on the floor of the Senate--it has worked very well, and I \nappreciate the consideration and cooperation of everybody, because to \nsome it might look confusing in terms of the order and the sequencing \nof what we are doing. We made huge progress today on the Healthy \nForests legislation we have been working on now for the last 6 hours. \nThe managers have done a superb job. We have traction. We have had a \nnumber of amendments, and we will continue on that later tomorrow.\n  We will have no more votes tonight. We will move, as I just \nmentioned, to the climate change bill, with the 3 hours tonight, 2 \nhours tomorrow.\n  Tomorrow we will have debate and then an early cloture vote on the \nPickering nomination at about 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n  We will then resume the climate change bill for 2 hours.\n  Then we will return to the Healthy Forests legislation. Once we \nreturn to the Healthy Forests bill, I expect we will be able to finish \nthat bill.\n  Following that--Members can refer to the unanimous consent request by \nmy colleague--the plan will be to return at that point in time to \nforeign operations that we will be able to complete at that juncture. \nThat is the general layout of tonight and tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S13484]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the majority leader goes to the next item, it is \ngoing to be extremely difficult to finish this most important bill \ntomorrow. Senator Wyden has worked so hard on this with others. Senator \nBoxer, Senator Feinstein, a number of other people on our side of the \naisle have worked very hard. We are going to send out a hotline in the \nmorning to find out what amendments are around. We already have some \nknowledge of the amendments, but it is going to take a lot of \ncooperation and a lot of people cutting down speeches tomorrow if we \nare going to finish this bill tomorrow night, which is the desire of \nthe two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to announce to our \ncolleagues and obviously the leader that we have reached an agreement \nthat will allow us to wrap up the foreign operations bill in relatively \nshort order in the next day or two. I am about to propound a unanimous \nconsent agreement that has been agreed to by the other side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the only first-degree amendments \nremaining in order to the Foreign Operations bill be the following, and \nthat they be subject to second-degrees which are relevant to the first: \nDeWine No. 1966; Feinstein No. 1977; McConnell No. 1970; one McConnell \ntechnical, and two McConnell relevants; a Frist relevant; Allard-\nFeingold-Leahy, Indonesia; Durbin on AIDS; Bingaman on AIDS; two Leahy \nrelevant; Daschle relevant; McConnell-Leahy cleared managers' \namendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove listed amendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or \ndebate.

Under the previous order, the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works is discharged from further consideration \nof S. 139, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 139) to provide for a program of scientific \n     research on abrupt bankrupt climate change, to accelerate the \n     reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by \n     establishing a market-driven system of greenhouse gas \n     tradeable allowances that could be used interchangeably with \n     passenger vehicle fuel economy standard credits, to limit \n     greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and reduce \n     dependence upon foreign oil, and ensure benefits to consumers \n     from the trading in such allowances.\n\n  Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding there are 3 hours \ntonight equally divided, which would be an hour and a half for each \nside. Because of something that happened today in Colorado, I yield up \nto 7 minutes of our time to the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Fires in Colorado\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding.\n  Today in Colorado we had two fires erupt in the State. One was a \ngrassland fire that probably won't amount to much. The other is a very \nserious fire that happened north and west of Boulder and Jamestown. We \nhave a school that has been evacuated; 300 people have been evacuated. \nThere is an educational camp in the area that has been evacuated. The \nreason I bring this to the attention of the Senate at this particular \npoint in time is because Colorado is one of those areas in the western \npart of the United States where we have a forest/urban interface. That \nis what the Forest Health Restoration Act is all about, trying to \nprovide a program where we can begin to apply the principles of forest \nhealth.\n  Along the Front Range of Colorado, running all the way from Colorado \nSprings all the way up into Fort Collins, including Boulder, where this \nfire has broken out, there are a lot of homes being built into the \nforest. Of course, if you don't practice good forest health, then they \nbecome vulnerable to fires that could erupt.\n  The significant thing about what is happening today is this is not \nthe fire season for Colorado. The fire season occurs in September, \nperhaps the first part of September, August, and July. Here we are, \njust 3 days from the first of November, and we have a fire that is \nbreaking out with serious consequences in Colorado.\n  This again points out the need for us to move forward with this \nparticular piece of legislation. We need to be addressing this problem \nimmediately in areas such as what we are seeing here in the State of \nColorado.\n  Last year during the peak of the Hayman Fire, the Front Range of the \nRocky Mountains was covered in a thick blanket of smoke and ash that \nblocked visibility and dropped ash on surrounding towns and cities, \ncreating a winter-like scene in the midst of a Colorado June. The \nHayman Fire was the largest in Colorado history and cost $40 million \nand counting. It burned a little over 137,000 acres, destroyed 133 \nhomes, and 466 outbuildings. The fire burned for 30 days. The Colorado \nState Forest Service has advised that it will take up to 150 years for \nthe forest itself to be reestablished.\n  Some people ask, Why does it take so long? We are in a semi-arid \narea. Vegetation does not grow back rapidly. During the Hayman Fire, \n142 subdivisions were evacuated along with 85,000 people.\n  Wildfires present a major cause of pollution, triggering severe \nasthma-related breathing problems and commonly causing death. Wildfires \nare also a major source of pollution. If we take 1 day out of the \nHayman Fire, on June 10, 2002, the CO2 gas emissions from \nthe Hayman Fire surpassed the CO2 emissions from all \npassenger cars operating in the United States on that same day. So this \nproblem with a lot of undergrowth in the forests and trees being \ninfested with beetles and a lot of dead and dying timber has made our \nforests extremely vulnerable in the forest/urban interface area.\n  Federal land management procedures are very complex. They should not \nbe so complex that they prevent timely action to address ecological \ncrises on public lands. Forest Service officials have estimated that \nplanning an assessment consumes 40 percent of their time at the \nnational forest level, costing more than $250 million per year. \nAlthough much of this work is important, the officials estimate that \nimproving administrative procedures may allow agencies to redirect up \nto $100 million a year from unnecessary planning to actual forest \nhealth restoration where it will improve the ecosystem and protect \nlocal communities from catastrophic fires which we see erupting today \nin Boulder County.\n\n  The Front Range in Colorado also depends on the mountains to provide \ndrinking water and water for gardens and children. But devastating \nfires threaten and destroy watersheds that yield this water. \nCatastrophic blazes consume organic matter in the littler layer of the \nsoil and create a hard pan surface that impedes water penetration.\n  When water flows over this hydrophobic layer, it carries debris, mud, \nand causes soil loss, clogging municipal water treatment facilities, \naffecting water quality, flavoring water with ash, and costing millions \nto rehabilitate. This is the problem we face today from the Hayman Fire \nwhich occurred just a year ago.\n  In 2002, there were over 88,000 fires that burned 7 million acres. \nThousands of structures were burned: 835 primary residences, 46 \ncommercial buildings, and 1,500 outbuildings. The 2002 estimated \nsuppression costs hover somewhere around $1.6 billion. These \nunnaturally extreme fires are just one consequence of deteriorating \nforests and range health that now affects more\n\n[[Page S13485]]\n\nthan 190 million acres of public land, an area twice the size of \nCalifornia.\n  Wildfires destroyed wildlife and crippled watersheds. The Hayman fire \noccurred in the Cheesman Reservoir area, a primary source of drinking \nwater for the city of Denver. Costs of the Cheesman reclamation have \ntotaled nearly $5.5 million, with the U.S. Natural Resources \nConservation Service and the EPA reimbursing Denver Water approximately \n$2.8 million of that amount.\n  During the Buffalo Creek fire, 600,000 cubic yards of sediment went \ninto Denver Water's Strontia Springs Reservoir.\n  The fact is, there is too much paperwork and analysis and it is \nkilling our forests. The Forest Service recently testified that it had \nto go through an 800-step decisionmaking process to complete the Upper \nSouth Platte restoration project, which took nearly 3 years to \ncomplete, and the fire that we see erupting today in northwest Boulder \nis in the Platte River drainage basin. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic \nprocess wasn't complete until a large wildfire ravaged the landscape \nset to be treated, plundering homes and an important watershed and \nforcing a number of endangered species to the edge of regional \nextinction.\n  The Healthy Forest Restoration Act is a comprehensive plan focused on \ngiving Federal land managers and their stakeholders and partners the \ntools to respond to this growing forest health crisis. The legislation \ndirects the timely implementation of scientifically supported \nmanagement activities to protect the health and vibrancy of Federal \nforest ecosystems, as well as the communities and private lands that \nsurround them.\n  This is why I ask Members of the Senate to join me in supporting the \nForest Health Restoration Act.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2028\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment on behalf of the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, myself, and several other Senators, \nwhich I send to the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Edwards, \n     Mr. Biden, Mr. Carper, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Corzine, \n     and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 2028.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am very proud to speak on behalf of \nthis amendment, which I am delighted to cosponsor with my good friend \nand colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. We have worked on this for \na long time. We have worked on it with environmentalists, leaders in \nthe business community, thinkers about this problem, and public health \nofficials, and with just plain citizens who are worried about global \nwarming.\n  Global warming is one of the great challenges of our time. It \nchallenges us in many ways. Greenhouse gas emissions from the burning \nof fossil fuels threaten our environment, of course, but they also \nthreaten our economy and our public health. They also represent a \nchallenge to political leadership, which is whether we are going to be \nprepared to look at the science, to face the facts, and to do something \nabout a problem that is appearing but its most difficult, and \npotentially devastating, consequences are yet over the horizon. Should \nwe continue to allow unabated our current rate of greenhouse gas \npollution, we threaten to disrupt the delicate ecological balance on \nwhich our lives and our livelihoods depend.\n  Global warming is not just a global challenge; it is also a very \nlocal one, impacting lives of Americans in critical and potentially \ndisastrous ways. Every family has reason to fear the effects of global \nwarming. Scientists predict that rising temperatures and rising sea \nlevels through global warming will lead to damaged water supplies, \nincreased flooding, depleted fisheries, sunken wetlands, devastating \ndroughts, intensified forest fires.\n  The parched conditions that are contributing to the ravaging fires \nraging now in southern California could become more widespread if the \nEarth's temperature increases. Over the long term, in a much more \npersonal way, global warming will spell higher energy bills, increased \ninsurance premiums, and lost jobs.\n  I know that over the course of the debate this evening and tomorrow \nseveral of our colleagues will speak to the local physical and \nbiological impacts of global warming. I want to tell one story that I \nheard about a year ago, which made this all real to me. It comes from \nthe Native American population of Alaska and northern Canada.\n  In the past few years, a robin appeared in one of the Native American \nvillages in Alaska. The elders there, despite a very intimate awareness \nof their 10,000-year-old language, did not know what to call the bird. \nThere is no word for robin in their language. Robins, by virtue of the \nclimate of that area, for thousands of years preceding, felt--if I can \nput it this way--unwelcome there.\n  The second example comes from Tanana in Alaska, which has an annual \nlottery to determine when a tripod placed on the frozen Tanana River \nwould break through the ice. Over the past 50 years, the breakthrough \nhas continued to occur earlier and earlier.\n  So it is not only in the language of science and statistics that \nclimate change and global warming is occurring, it is in the language \nof everyday life.\n  The American public clearly understands this and, in fact, there is a \ngap between the public and our political leadership that Senator McCain \nand I hope we can close with this amendment. According to a recent \nZogby poll, 75 percent of Americans support this legislation, this \namendment, we are debating this evening.\n  My colleagues now have to choose between meeting the public's support \nfor action, demand for action, or siding with the minority who would \nignore the scientific consensus and delay action on this critical \nproblem.\n  Meeting this monumental challenge and addressing this growing \nenvironmental threat demands strong leadership. I am afraid that, to \ndate, such leadership has been lacking in the current administration. \nToday's Senate debate represents the first of its kind since 1998, \nwhich testifies, I am afraid, to a lack of leadership here. This debate \nprovides us with an excellent opportunity to take action before it \ncosts us so much more to deal with the consequences of inaction.\n  I must say that even more dramatic has been the Bush administration's \nfailure of responsible leadership on global warming. President Bush and \nhis Environmental Protection Agency have not only offered no meaningful \nproposals to deal with global warming, they have tried to deny the very \nexistence of the problem.\n  Last summer the White House called for yet another study. This time \nit focused on whether global warming is caused by human behavior. Let \nme speak directly. That call is a shameless stalling tactic. As the New \nOrleans Times-Picayune described, ``It calls for further investigation \nof what the scientific community already widely accepts.'' In fact, as \nDon Kennedy, chief editor of the International Journal of Science, \nargued:\n\n       Consensus as strong as the one that has developed around \n     this topic [climate change] is rare in science. . . . There \n     is little room for doubt about the seriousness of the problem \n     the world faces, and other nations, including most of our \n     trading partners in the Organization for Economic Cooperation \n     and Development, understand that.\n\n  Yet in the face of these facts, President Bush has given us only a \ncall to action, a call for more study and not action on global warming. \nI cannot resist saying this President has fiddled while the globe \ncontinues to warm.\n  The plan the administration has put out would allow emissions of \nglobal warming pollutants to continue to grow at exactly the same \nalarming rate as they have grown over the past decade. Earlier this \nmonth, the General Accounting Office found that the plan of the \nadministration would do nothing to reduce our emissions growth. In \nfact, the GAO was even unable to discern the extent to which the \nadministration's identified methods and tools\n\n[[Page S13486]]\n\nwould contribute to reducing emissions. They found that the \nadministration was not going to evaluate whether they had made progress \ntoward their goals until 2012. Too late.\n  This deny-and-delay approach to meeting the real threat of global \nwarming is no longer acceptable. It is an abdication of leadership--\nenvironmental leadership, public health leadership, economic \nleadership, international diplomatic leadership.\n  Senator McCain and I offer our bill, the Climate Stewardship Act, to \nconfront this growing threat in a systematic and serious way. It is \npatterned after the highly successful market-based acid rain program of \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  The amendment was crafted in close consultation with industry leaders \nand, I am so pleased to say, enjoys strong support of many of them and \nleaders within the environmental community. It represents the most \nserious and balanced attempt at solving the crisis before us, and it \ndoes so by harnessing market forces and directing them to new economic \nopportunities in the future.\n  Our bill limits emissions of global warming pollutants by electric \nutilities, major industrial and commercial entities, and refiners of \ntransportation fuels. Those sectors represent about 85 percent of U.S. \nemissions of global warming pollutants.\n  The amendment does not apply to farmers, individual residences, or to \nautomobile manufacturers for the cars they sell. Because our current \nemissions are now at 2000 levels from a practical standpoint, our \nlegislation simply holds them at those current levels in some ways, a \nmodest goal--but a very significant step forward in American \nresponsibility for the global problem of global warming.\n  That is the full extent of national action that our amendment would \nrequire. More modest, yes, than the cuts envisioned by the Kyoto \nprotocol, but a significant step forward, one that I think will not \nonly get us on the road to protecting the public's health and the great \nenvironmental treasures of the United States of America but will \nreestablish our credibility and responsibility in the world. As the \nlargest emitter of greenhouse gases, we will show that we are accepting \nour responsibility to be part of the global solution to this global \nproblem.\n  Our amendment achieves these significant reductions while embracing \nfree market principles. By setting reasonable caps on emissions and \npermitting industry to trade in pollution allowance, we create a new \nmarket for reducing greenhouse gases. In this way, we hope and believe \nour amendment will change the fundamental terms of the debate because \nfor too long the national dialog on global warming has seemed to be \ndeadlocked, pitting business leaders on one side \nagainst environmentalists on the other in a zero sum struggle. It ought \nnot to be. We ought to find common ground, and that is what this \namendment attempts to do.\n\n  The debate for too long has itself been overheated with acrimony and \npolluted with misinformation. Our hope is that this amendment will \nbreak through both of those obstacles. Environmental protection and \neconomic growth are not mutually exclusive; they are mutually \nreinforcing over the long run.\n  Measured steps to curb global warming in a business-friendly way \npromise to not only save us from environmental degradation but to open \nnew opportunities and to spur innovative new technologies for American \nbusiness to seize.\n  In a July 25 letter this year, the Business Council for Sustainable \nEnergy endorsed the concept that market-based climate policies can \nreduce gas emissions while promoting technology-based solutions, reduce \nenergy dependence, and bolster the competitiveness of U.S. industry.\n  In a July 18 letter to my office, a group called Environmental \nEntrepreneurs, which represents over $20 billion in investment capital, \nwrote that the bill will stimulate economic growth and give the United \nStates a competitive edge in bringing these products to market.\n  Finally, a letter of July 24 of this year from several of our \nNation's most prominent investors encouraging the efforts Senator \nMcCain, the other cosponsors, and I are making says:\n\n       By employing strict goals and flexible means, we expect \n     your proposal will unleash the power of competition and spur \n     innovation to protect the environment. A healthy economy and \n     a healthy environment are not mutually exclusive; they go \n     hand in hand.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that all three of those letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The Business Council for\n\n\n                                           Sustainable Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate prepares to consider several \n     global warming amendments that may be offered to the Energy \n     Policy Act (S. 14), the Business Council for Sustainable \n     Energy would like to offer another industry perspective.\n       Some information has been circulated recently claiming that \n     any substantive program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in \n     the U.S. would cause widespread harm to our economy. The \n     analysis that is being circulated does not reflect any of the \n     proposals that are pending before Congress. Instead, it is \n     based on a widely criticized analysis by the Wharton \n     Econometrics Forecasting Associates (WEFA) that was conducted \n     five years ago.\n       The WEFA analysis is a disservice not only to Senators who \n     need relevant information to make policy decisions, but also \n     to industry coalitions like ours that recognize the value of \n     responsible and responsive policy design.\n       Senators McCain and Lieberman have developed legislation \n     (S. 139) that underscores the value of flexible emissions \n     trading programs that maximize innovation and minimize costs.\n       The analysis being circulated in no way reflects the \n     approach proposed by S. 139. Key differences include:\n       Moderate emission reduction targets with greater lead time \n     to industry. S. 139 reduces U.S. emissions to 1990 levels by \n     2016, which equates to about a one percent emissions \n     reduction annually over the next 13 years--a more modest \n     reduction occurring over a longer period of time.\n       Flexible emissions trading. The McCain-Lieberman bill \n     utilizes market-based mechanisms within a cap-and-trade \n     program that encourages innovation through the use of \n     efficient, cost-effective emissions reduction strategies. The \n     WEFA analysis assumes that a carbon tax is imposed on \n     industry.\n       Trading of non-CO2 gases. The McCain-Lieberman \n     bill incorporates reductions in other greenhouse gas (beyond \n     CO2) in the trading program, a design feature that \n     has been shown to significantly reduce the cost of \n     compliance. The WEFA analysis was limited to carbon dioxide.\n       Credits to farmers for carbon sequestration. The McCain-\n     Lieberman bill allows emitters to offset their emissions by \n     sequestering carbon through land use practices. The WEFA \n     analysis fails to account for these inexpensive offsets.\n       Credits for international projects. The McCain-Lieberman \n     bill allows companies to meet a portion of their obligation \n     through global emission reduction projects. The WEFA analysis \n     once again ignores this opportunity.\n       The model used by WEFA five years ago was based on \n     assumptions that U.S. industry would fail to deliver more \n     efficient and cleaner technologies over time in response to \n     policy incentives. A market-based program such as that \n     envisioned in S. 139 would provide incentives for industry to \n     innovate, just as with the Clean Air Act's acid rain program, \n     which pioneered the emissions trading approach and delivered \n     environmental results as much as 90 percent less than \n     economists had projected.\n       The Council does not stand alone in our belief that market-\n     based climate policies such as emissions trading can benefit \n     the economy. More than 2,500 economists, including eight \n     Nobel laureates, issued a statement in 1997 that read in \n     part:\n       ``Economic studies have found that there are many potential \n     policies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions for which the \n     total benefits outweigh the total costs. For the United \n     States in particular, sound economic analysis shows that \n     there are policy options that would slow climate change \n     without harming American living standards, and these measures \n     may in fact improve U.S. productivity in the longer run.''\n       While the economists' statement is not an endorsement of \n     any policy before Congress today, it speaks to the importance \n     of a more thoughtful dialogue about what the nation should be \n     doing.\n       Properly constructed, global warming policies that \n     incorporate market mechanisms can reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions while promoting technology-based solutions, reduce \n     energy dependence and bolster the competitiveness of U.S. \n     industry.\n           With best wishes,\n                                                Michael L. Marvin,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S13487]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                  Environmental Entrepreneurs,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, July 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n        Dear Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain: We are writing \n     as members and supporters of Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) \n     in support of your proposal to create a binding, market-based \n     program to limit global warming emission from U.S. industry. \n     E2 is an organization of business and professional leaders \n     who promote good environmental policy that supports economic \n     growth. The economic risks that climate change poses to the \n     U.S. economy are enormous, and E2 believes we must address \n     this issue without further delay.\n       The first President Bush signed and the Senate ratified the \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change (the ``Rio Climate \n     treaty'') over a decade ago to provide for a worldwide \n     program to manage the manmade emissions that contribute to \n     global warming. Yet, in the time since we ratified the Rio \n     Treaty, the United States, which produces more global warming \n     emissions than any other nation, has not developed a serious \n     program to respond to the threat that global climate change \n     poses to the planet's environmental and economic health. As a \n     result, U.S. emissions of global warming gases have grown \n     steadily and now exceed 7 billion metric tons of \n     CO2 equivalent gases--a growth of 14% from 1990 \n     levels.\n       Every year that passes increases the difficulty and cost of \n     averting the threats of environmental and economic disruption \n     posed by climate change. Without a national framework for \n     addressing the issue of global warming, American businesses \n     continue to make long-term capital investments that commit us \n     to ever increasing greenhouse gas emissions. New buildings, \n     transportation systems, and power and industrial plants are \n     being designed and built today without regard for the need to \n     reduce global warming emissions. The large capital outlays \n     are committing us to a future of unacceptable risks to the \n     American economy from global warming.\n       The threats to our economy from climate change may well \n     include, in some areas, the vitality of American agriculture, \n     the availability of water for consumption and irrigation, and \n     the destruction of recreational resources such as ski \n     resorts, coastal areas and wetlands. E2 considered these \n     risks serious enough in California that we actively \n     campaigned for the passage of the California Clean Cars Bill, \n     or AB1493, which was signed into law last summer and is the \n     first legislation in the country to regulate the amount of \n     CO2 emissions from passenger vehicles. We want to \n     acknowledge your leadership in supporting this bill and \n     helping Governor Davis to recognize the national, if not \n     global, implication of this kind of policy. We are promoting \n     similar legislation in the state of New York and hope that a \n     groundswell for carbon emissions policy at the state level \n     will convince the federal government of the need to provide \n     national standards.\n       Your proposal, the ``Climate Stewardship Act of 2003,'' \n     recognizes what we, as business leaders, already know: the \n     engine of American innovation depends on market-based \n     incentives to guide capital investment. Your legislation \n     would: create manageable targets to control the growth in \n     global warming emissions from America's principal emitters \n     and put us on a path to reducing emissions over time; ensure \n     that the reductions occur in an efficient manner by letting \n     businesses decide where to best achieve them; and spawn new \n     business sectors to create the enabling technologies to meet \n     these goals.\n       The economic benefits inherent in addressing global warming \n     reach far beyond avoiding the risks associated with inaction. \n     The deployment of existing ``climate friendly'' technologies \n     and the development of new ones will result in new markets \n     and create new jobs. Buildings and appliances that waste less \n     energy, transportation systems that meet our needs with \n     reduced global warming emissions, and energy systems that \n     make expanded renewable resources economically viable and \n     offer ways to use fossil energy without releasing carbon \n     dioxide--all these are key to our economic and environmental \n     future. These advances will stimulate economic growth and \n     give the U.S. the competitive edge in bringing these products \n     to market.\n       The United States should be in the vanguard of this new \n     global market for climate friendly technologies. Our \n     businesses are second to none in developing advanced products \n     when the market conditions reward these investments. A market \n     in limiting global warming emissions is the policy step \n     needed to promote innovation and growth in this sector. We \n     look forward to working with you to implement this program at \n     the earliest possible date.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Epstein,\n       Co-Founder, E2.\n     Nicole Lederer,\n       Co-Founder, E2.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lieberman and McCain: As business leaders we \n     recognize that the risks and complexities of climate change \n     are so important that we must work together to meet this \n     challenge. We understand that any response that is sufficient \n     to avert dangerous climate change will be long term, but that \n     the nature of the problem requires that action begin now. We \n     understand that a constructive global or domestic response \n     must be equitable and support economic growth based on free \n     market principles. As business leaders, we know how \n     government policies can help--or hurt--business and the \n     economy. Good policies set clear goals and leave businesses \n     free to decide how to meet those goals at lowest cost. The \n     policies you have suggested be included in the Energy bill \n     seem to be both serious in their environmental goals and \n     prudent in using market forces to achieve them.\n       By employing strict goals and flexible means, we expect \n     your proposal will unleash the power of competition and spur \n     innovation to protect the environment. A healthy economy and \n     a healthy environment are not mutually exclusive; they go \n     hand in hand. American business has the ingenuity and know-\n     how to solve the problem of global warming while continuing \n     to prosper. Indeed, many of our colleagues already have \n     stepped forward to pledge to reduce their companies' \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n       We recognize that there is still debate about the levels of \n     greenhouse gas reductions necessary to stabilize the climate \n     and protect the U.S. economy. Several things are clear. \n     Reductions must begin promptly. Voluntary efforts abone won't \n     do the job. And finally, any mandatory restrictions must \n     employ market incentives. We congratulate you for recognizing \n     these needs and for your efforts to see that the Senate \n     addresses them.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Doerr; Jon Lovelace; Lewis S. Ranieri; Julian H. \n           Robertson, Jr.; John H.T. Wilson.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, corporate America, fortunately, has \nalready given us some models of companies that are dealing with global \nwarming and, I believe, profiting from doing so. Companies such as \nAlcoa, British Petroleum, DuPont, Eastman Kodak, IBM, Intel, Johnson & \nJohnson, and Nike have all accepted targets for greenhouse gas \npollution reduction that meet or exceed this amendment's requirements. \nThese and other companies have cut their emissions of greenhouse gases \nnot just because they sought to be good environmental citizens, which \nthey are, but because their boards of directors and their senior \nmanagement are convinced that a proactive stance on climate change \nmakes good business sense.\n  Perhaps the most compelling examples of that new corporate mindset on \nglobal warming come from American Electric Power and Cinergy, the \nbiggest burners of coal by tonnage and percentage in our country. Both \ncompanies have now announced enforceable obligations to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions to levels that are below what our proposal \nrequires. And Cinergy has said it can make these reductions for no \nincreased cost and with no additional fuel switching.\n  It is quite remarkable that they say they can make the reductions at \nno increased cost. But for every BP and DuPont, IBM and Cinergy, there \nare scores of other enterprises that I fear are inefficient, that are \nrefusing to rise to new environmental standards and curb their \ngreenhouse gas emissions. That is why we must pass this amendment. We \nmust set standards. We must exercise responsible leadership.\n  I understand that taking action to combat global warming is not \nwithout cost, but it is worth the cost. The sacrifice of the Climate \nStewardship Act is a minimal sacrifice. The cost of our amendment is \nreasonable and affordable by any measure and under any economic model \nemployed to date. A recent MIT study estimated that our amendment would \nannually cost less than $20 per household. That is not a lot to ask for \nstemming the warming of the planet and all the devastating consequences \nit could bring.\n  A second independent study released this summer by the Tellus \nInstitute reaffirms that same conclusion. Tellus, in fact, found that \nnet savings to consumers of $48 billion would be realized by 2020 and \nhousehold electricity bills would decrease because of reduced energy \ndemand.\n  Finally, the recent study of the Bush administration's Department of \nEnergy of our entire proposal found similar minimal economic impacts \noverall, but did find some spikes in natural gas usage at the expense \nof the coal industry.\n\n  We feel very strongly that was a flawed study. Its assumptions only \nallowed compliance with the program through fuel switching. So the \noutcome\n\n[[Page S13488]]\n\nwas preordained. In fact, the Pew Center for Global Climate Change has \nexamined this analysis and believes the study's structure, combined \nwith unrealistic input assumptions, results in unrealistically high \ncost projections.\n  Senator McCain and I have worked very hard on this proposal. We have \nworked hard to achieve common ground on it, both among businesses and \nindustries that are involved in emitting greenhouse gases, \nenvironmentalists, citizens, and among Members of the Senate. We are \nseeking a consensus position that will allow our Nation to move forward \nto take action on this critical challenge. As a result, we have \nmodified our original bill to drop the second phase of its \nrequirements.\n  As time goes on, we will look forward to bringing that back up and \nconvincing the Senate to adopt the entire program, but let's deal with \nthe first phase amendment. It does not require or create a significant \nfuel switching, even according to the administration's own Energy \nInformation Agency, and has a very low economic impact. It is a \nbeginning in dealing with this problem.\n  The true cost comparison is not between the cost of doing business \nnow versus the cost of new regulations. It is between the cost of \naction now and the cost of inaction in the future, because the fact is \nthe carbon we emit to the atmosphere today will remain there for a \ncentury. Every extra ton of emissions means we are going to need \ntighter controls. It will be more costly and more difficult to protect \nthe environment and public health later on.\n  A recent study calculated every ton of pollutants needlessly emitted \ninto our atmosphere costs Americans $160, and we are currently emitting \nbillions of tons each year. Property lost to rising sea levels, \ncropland lost to drought, revenue lost to dwindling fishing stocks \ncaused by global warming, all represent real costs, not to mention the \nultimately immeasurable damage to our health and quality of life.\n  It is very interesting to follow the judgments of the insurance \nindustry on this question if we want to gauge the cost of inaction. \nUncertain about the potential increased liability from severe weather \nevents and other costly side effects of global warming, insurers are \nnow charging higher premiums to businesses and homeowners to cover \nhigher expected costs. SwissRe, North America's leading reinsurer, says \nthat ``global warming is a fact'' which ``has the potential to affect \nthe number and severity of these natural disasters and result in a very \nsignificant impact on our business.''\n  This reinsurance company projects that climate-change-driven natural \ndisasters could cost global financial centers more than $150 billion \nper year within the next 10 years. Just think of that. We are making a \nproposal that the MIT study says will cost every American family $20 a \nyear, compared to $150 billion a year within 10 years globally.\n  Wall Street is also concerned about the future if we fail to act. A \nnumber of institutional investors recently joined with several \nutilities to call for the kind of market-based approach to global \nwarming that is part of our amendment. There is also an opportunity for \nour American enterprise and innovation to produce the products that \nwill respond to the global warming challenge, and in that sense to be \nready to meet the global demand for such products.\n\n  According to one reputable estimate I have seen, over the next 20 \nyears, $10 trillion to $20 trillion will be spent globally on new \nenergy technologies. Our Asian and European competitors see this \npotential and, by complying with Kyoto protocol standards, are adapting \ntheir practices to seize that enormous international market.\n  I want to say a special word about farmers and ranchers under our \nplan. They will be able to make money by adopting pro-environment \npractices. That would include increasing carbon levels in their land \nand selling emission credits to polluters. Rough estimates show that \nnew, more sustainable management practices will sequester approximately \none-half ton of carbon per acre for a farmer with a 5,000-acre farm. \nThis would represent thousands of additional dollars a year. Many of \nthose practices are better for the long-term health of our farms but, \nof course, can be of great benefit to cash-strapped farmers.\n  Global warming is, of course, about more than the numbers about which \nI have talked. It is about our values. Do we take action to protect our \nchildren and grandchildren from having to bear the full cost and health \nrisks and life changes from the pollution we are generating today or do \nwe, as leaders of the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, duck \nour responsibility and let the next generation take it?\n  I am particularly pleased by the strong support Senator McCain and I \nhave received from a broad and diverse coalition of religious \norganizations that affirms the moral imperative for action now on \nglobal warming. I cite the National Religious Partnership for the \nEnvironment, representing an alliance of faith groups, including the \nUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Council of \nChurches of Christ, the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, \nand the Evangelical Environmental Network.\n  I am reminded of the words from Scripture that the Earth is the \nLord's and the fullness thereof, which is surely the truth and reminds \nus we are only visitors. We do not own the Earth. We are blessed to \nlive on it for some period of time. With that time comes a \nresponsibility to be good stewards of the Earth. I always remember the \nwords from the story of creation, Adam and Eve, where it says in the \nBible they were put there to work and guard the garden. In a very \ndirect sense, that responsibility to work, enjoy, and develop is \ncombined with a responsibility that we have to guard the garden, guard \nthe Earth.\n  We have failed in that responsibility. This amendment is an attempt \nto accept that responsibility and do something about it.\n  This is an historic debate. It is a debate I believe our children and \ngrandchildren and perhaps historians will look back on and ask, as the \nvotes are counted, did the Senate of the United States rise to a \nchallenge almost everyone sees is coming or did we wait until the \nconsequences, the effects of global warming, were so serious that it \nwas too late? It was certainly too late to deal with those consequences \nwithout drastic effects on our environment, on our health, on our \neconomy, and on the way we live.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware the major attack on this legislation \nwill be related to the validity of the entire issue of climate change?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I expect that will be true.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is he aware there is widespread agreement on the \noccurrence of global warming and the human source of the observed and \npredicted changes? To make a long story short, there was a study \nconducted in 2001 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A \nthird assessment report represented a collaborative, scientific \nendeavor involving 700 scientists worldwide, peer-reviewed by another \n700 scientists. The Bush administration requested an independent review \nof the IPCC report by the National Academy of Sciences. Now everybody \ncan shop around for their expert. This is the National Academy of \nSciences. The resulting 2001 national research report, which is \ndelegated by the National Academy of Sciences, said the following in \ntheir summary, and I will ask my colleague just to comment on this. We \nneed to keep coming back to this and coming back to this and coming \nback to this during this debate. Again, the National Research Council, \nan arm of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of \nAmerica, says greenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth's \natmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air \ntemperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.\n  Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last \nseveral decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we \ncannot rule out that a significant part of these changes is also a \nreflection of natural variability.\n  The point is we are going to hear--in fact, in the course of debate \nwe will hear of a couple of scientists whose views were misinterpreted \nby the Senator from Oklahoma and by the Republican Policy Committee. We \nhave their\n\n[[Page S13489]]\n\nrebuttals and we will be going into those. They state--not I state--\nthat their views were completely distorted. The fact is, the \noverwhelming body of scientific opinion in America and the world \nbelieves that human activity is causing climate change in the world, \nand that is an irrefutable fact.\n\n  The opponents of this can shop around for the scientists of their \nchoice, but the overwhelming majority of scientists say this and every \nyear that evidence becomes more compelling and every year it becomes \nmore of a compelling problem because of the manifestations of it. The \nmanifestations of climate change are occurring, as we see on the west \ncoast of the United States of America.\n  I ask my friend, won't you hear that the emperor has some beautiful \nclothes on during this debate; that there are some scientists who will \nrefuse to admit this, who will say that pigs fly and up is down and \nblack is white, but the majority opinion is that of the most respected \nbody in America, the National Academy of Sciences, and they are the \nones who come forward with the views that are corroborated by thousands \nof scientists all over America and the world?\n  I ask my colleague to comment on that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. He is \nknown globally, I might say, as a straight talker. He is basing that \nstraight talk in this debate on scientific fact that is widely \naccepted--he is absolutely right--by international panels of \nscientists, by the independent National Academy of Sciences, and the \nNational Research Panel.\n  I want to quote again from Don Kennedy, chief editor of the \ninternational, very reputable journal, Science. He says:\n\n       Consensus strong as the one that has developed around the \n     topic of climate change is rare in science. There is little \n     room for doubt about the seriousness of the problem the world \n     faces.\n\n  I expect, unfortunately, that we will debate the science here. You \nand I, I know, are prepared to debate the science. But the fact is, we \nought to be debating what we are going to do about it. We might argue, \nand some presumably will argue, that our proposal costs more than the \nAmerican people are willing to spend. I don't think so. The polls don't \nshow that to be true. People I talk to are ready to be part of solving \na problem before it gets out of hand.\n  Some may say our methods are wrong, although a market-based system, \nsuch as the one that worked to deal with acid rain in the Clean Air Act \namendments, proposed and signed by the first President Bush, has a \npretty good track record.\n  But let's have that debate. It really takes us back way beyond where \nthe science is to have a debate whether this is a real problem. I say \nagain, to have a debate about what we should do about it, that might \nget our blood going, but that is a reasonable debate. But to see the \nadministration ask for yet another study, I just can't see that as \nanything more than a stalling tactic.\n\n  That is why I regret to say that this President really is fiddling \nwhile the globe is warming. We better do something about it before it \ngets so serious that we are going to look back and say: Why didn't we \nact?\n  This is a chance to have debate, the first debate in 5 years in the \nSenate Chamber on this critical problem. Let's have a healthy debate. \nLet's try to find common ground.\n  Senator McCain and I have worked very hard to reach a consensus. This \nis not a sharp-edged bill. It is a bill that is progressive and builds \ntoward common ground. And then let's move forward together so we can \nsay to our children and grandchildren: We saved you from a result that \nwe saw coming that many were not willing to do anything about, but we \nfinally got together and did something about it.\n  I thank my friend from Arizona for his very good questions. I thank \nhim for his principled partnership in this effort, and I look forward \nto the remainder of the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just make a couple of \ncomments, and then I will yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  I know it is so easy to stand up here and talk about ``the science is \nirrefutable,'' talk about how different groups are supporting S. 139. I \nknow neither the distinguished Senator from Arizona nor the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut would intentionally say \nsomething that is not true. However, some of the things they are saying \nare not true. They are not factual.\n  A little bit later I am going to be going into detail on this science \nquestion. The science that has been reviewed since 1999 is \noverwhelmingly on the side that global warming, in fact, is not \noccurring and, if it is occurring, is not a result of manmade \nanthropogenic gases.\n  I would also like to say, I will be talking about some of these \ngroups that supposedly are supporting this bill who, in fact, are not \nsupporting this bill. But I am going to save that for a few minutes \nbecause we have several Members who will be coming in on our side who \nwill be wanting to address this issue. For that reason, I now yield to \nthe Senator from Missouri 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, the committee I believe properly has \njurisdiction over this issue, a committee on which I serve and which \nhas debated these issues many times. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor his leadership, his guidance, and his wisdom on these matters.\n  Interestingly enough, today I was reading a couple of news articles \nand it seems the Soviet Union is backing out on the Kyoto Treaty. \nRussia is now finding that they cannot live up to the commitments that \nwere made in Kyoto, so Russia is bailing out on them. I just read \nanother article that the European Union finds they really can't come up \nwith all of these carbon dioxide reductions that they had promised. \nWhy? Even in a Communist country they begin to realize that government \nactions have consequences. There are some impacts. These impacts are \npretty stark.\n  Let me address for just a few minutes, for the benefit of my \ncolleagues and those who may happen to listen, some of the practical \nimpacts the passage of the McCain-Lieberman bill would have on our \ncommunities and on our families.\n  I strongly believe this bill will cripple our economy, cripple our \ncommunities, and financially cripple many of our struggling families. \nWe can debate the science of climate change here on the floor until we \nare all blue in the face--and I think we may be headed in that \ndirection. We have heartfelt experts, scientists, and data on both \nsides of the issue. I happen to believe the causal effect of CO2 \nemissions and recent changes to our climate is not yet fully proven.\n  But the real impact, the real point of the McCain-Lieberman bill is, \nWhat will it do? That is kind of a practical test. I am from Missouri, \nthe ``show me'' State. What would this bill do? Show me what this bill \nwould do. How much will the McCain-Lieberman bill hurt our economy?\n  How much will the McCain-Lieberman bill drive up electricity bills \nfor my constituents to pay? How much will the McCain-Lieberman bill \nraise the price of natural gas which is already going through the \nceiling thanks to unwise governmental increases in demand and \nrestrictions on production? How much more will the McCain-Lieberman \nbill force our families to pay for gasoline? It would be nice if we \nstopped once before we rushed into a major thing such as this and found \nout whether the medicine we prescribe was going to make the patient \nsicker or make the patient well.\n  I think we all recognize that our economy is just now starting to \nrecover from the doldrums. We are just now starting to turn the corner \non job growth. We are heading into a winter when we expect the cost to \nheat our homes will increase significantly because of previous \noverreaching congressional actions in the past. Now is not the time to \nplace more burdens on our families and our communities.\n  As I said, I sit on the Environment and Public Works Committee where \nwe\n\n[[Page S13490]]\n\nconsidered legislation to cut carbon dioxide as part of a \nmultipollutant strategy to cut emissions from electric powerplants. \nBefore that committee, supporters urged caps on carbon dioxide from \nelectric powerplants as a way to fight global climate change. What they \ndidn't want to talk about was the negative impact this measure would \nhave on the everyday lives of our constituents--those who use electric \npower.\n  Experts conclude that the legislation under consideration to cut \ncarbon dioxide in electric powerplants would cost the economy over $100 \nbillion. That is one-zero-zero billion dollars.\n  Experts also estimated that the electricity bills would go up by \nabout 40 percent.\n  If you are sitting at home and you happen to have an electric bill \nhandy, take it and multiply it by 1.4, see what that number is, and see \nwhat impact that would have on your family budget.\n  I have read heartbreaking stories from families in Kansas City who \nhave to decide between buying food and paying their utility bills. \nOther families could not buy school clothes because they had to pay \nhigher heating bills. Seniors on fixed incomes often have no way to \nmeet higher utility bills.\n  I voted against that bill. And Democratic leaders when they \ncontrolled the Senate refused to even bring that measure to the floor \nbecause they knew what an impact it would have on senior citizens, what \nan impact it would have on the poor, and why union members who realize \nit can cost them their jobs object to it. We now have many of the same \nissues involved in this climate change bill.\n  The McCain-Lieberman bill would establish mandatory caps for carbon \ndioxide emissions. Economists and energy experts at the Department of \nEnergy's Energy Information Agency--or EIA--recently concluded that the \nenactment of the McCain-Lieberman bill would result in a 46-percent \nincrease in electricity prices, a 27-percent increase in the cost of \ngasoline, and a 54-percent increase in the cost of home heating oil.\n  Again, if you are at home and happen to have any of your last \nwinter's bills handy, apply those percentages--a 50-percent increase in \nelectricity and heating oil, a 27-percent increase in the cost of \ngasoline.\n  The EIA--the Government agency with the experts and the expertise--\nconcluded that McCain-Lieberman would cost millions of Americans jobs. \nExcuse me. Did I say that right? Yes, I said that right--millions of \nAmerican jobs. We are having slow job growth in our economy. We are \nworking hard to get jobs back. This bill would cost millions of \nAmerican jobs. Even if the sponsors dropped the second phase of this \nbill, it would still cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\n  Do we really want to be raising costs on senior citizens, on poor \npeople, and be throwing people out of work?\n  The EIA further concluded that McCain-Lieberman would cause a \ncumulative decrease in the gross domestic product of $1.4 trillion. \nTalk about sucking the wind out of the economic recovery; that baby \nwould be flatter than a flounder.\n  The effect of this bill would be, first, to send our economy back \ninto recession, then strip the Nation of hundreds of thousands of jobs, \nand then increase the cost of heating our homes. I, frankly, cannot \nthink of a better combination of ills. That is a trifecta that we \nobviously cannot afford to undertake.\n  The most troubling part is that all of this pain would come without \nany real dent in the worldwide amount of carbon dioxide released into \nthe atmosphere.\n  McCain-Lieberman suffers from the same inherent flaw of the failed \nKyoto Treaty. It imposes absolutely no restrictions on two of the \nworld's worst largest and fastest growing polluters in the world. In \ncase you can't guess who those are, those would be China and India.\n  Not only do we unfairly punish U.S. communities but we let other \ncountries off the hook and, therefore, have practically no real \nworldwide impact on carbon dioxide levels.\n  The Kyoto Treaty was rightfully rejected in advance by a unanimous \nvote in this body of 95 to zero for a very good reason. On top of all \nthe unfairness of the Kyoto Treaty, we now know the crippling effects \nMcCain-Lieberman would have on the economy, on our communities, on our \nfamilies, and on job creation in our country.\n  For me, I cannot see voting to strip American families of hundreds of \nthousands or millions of jobs. I cannot see why we would be voting to \nincrease electricity prices by 46 percent. I cannot see why we would be \nvoting to increase the cost of home heating oil by 54 percent. That is \nwhy I cannot vote for this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about the practical impact before we \nvote on this bill. This is a disaster waiting to happen. This would be \nanother congressionally inflicted disaster.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to defeat McCain-Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  That was a well-written presentation by my colleague from Missouri. \nUnfortunately, his analysis of the bill is not the bill that is before \nthe Senate. But other than that, it was a pretty convincing case.\n  Our bill is different from the analysis he provided. In fact, it is \nsignificantly different. But even those facts on which we had the \nprevious analysis were incorrect as well. But it was certainly an \ninteresting presentation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have talked to our good friend, my \nbrother, the Senator from Hawaii, and he has graciously agreed to let \none of our Members go first before he is recognized.\n  At this time, I yield to the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  Before yielding to Senator Voinovich, I was honored to chair the \nClean Air Subcommittee prior to the time I chaired the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. During that time, Senator Voinovich was \nGovernor Voinovich. He was the chairman of the Governors Clean Air \nCommittee. I don't believe there is anyone in this Senate who has a \nbetter knowledge of air problems or who has higher credentials than the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  At this time, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis kind words. The two of us will try to explain to our colleagues the \nreal meaning of this legislation proposed by Senator Lieberman and \nSenator McCain.\n  I rise in opposition to the legislation offered by Senator McCain and \nSenator Lieberman. This legislation will place a cap on carbon dioxide \nemissions by requiring all segments of the economy to reduce emissions \nto 2000 levels by 2010 despite the fact that such a cap would have \ndevastating impacts on our economy, on our manufacturing sector, and on \naverage Americans, and especially on our brothers and sisters, the \nelderly and the poor.\n  I have stated time and time again here on the floor that we must \nrecognize that the energy policy and our environmental policies are two \nsides to the same coin and that the Senate has responsibility to \nharmonize those policies. We have an obligation in the Senate to ensure \nthat any legislation we consider takes into account its potential \nimpact on our economy, which is in intensive care, particularly in \nStates such as mine. And we have a moral obligation to ensure that we \nconsider a bill's potential impact on the poor and the elderly who must \nsurvive on a fixed income and who pay an inordinate amount of their \nincome for energy. They are the forgotten people in this country. We \nmust ensure that we do not pass climate change legislation that will \nsignificantly drive up the cost of electricity for those who can least \nafford it.\n\n  Although some science has attributed changes in the climate to \natmospheric concentration of carbon, it is clear the science of climate \nchange is far from settled. We need significantly more research on the \nissue. To accept the statements of supporters of S. 139 at face value \nis to accept one side of the debate, a very serious debate, among \nrespected scientists and policy experts on both sides of the issue.\n  I recall the hearings Senator Lieberman had when he was chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee and two hearings I had. It was \ninteresting to see the difference of opinion among very respected \nscientists in this country.\n\n[[Page S13491]]\n\n  My distinguished colleague Senator Inhofe has discussed at length \nboth in the Environment and Public Works Committee and in the Senate \nthe newest information on the issue which is contrary to the views \nexpressed by Senators McCain and Lieberman.\n  In a recent column, former Secretary of Energy James Schlesinger \ncommented:\n\n       . . . despite the certainty many seem to feel about the \n     causes, effects and extent of climate change, we are in fact \n     making only slow progress in our understanding of the \n     underlying science.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the column by Mr. Schlesinger be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 7, 2003]\n\n               Climate Change: The Science Isn't Settled\n\n                         (By James Schlesinger)\n\n       Despite the certainty many seem to feel about the causes, \n     effects and extent of climate change, we are in fact making \n     only slow progress in our understanding of the underlying \n     science. My old professor at Harvard, the great economist \n     Joseph Schumpeter, used to insist that a principal tool of \n     economic science was history--which served to temper the \n     enthusiasms of the here and now. This must be even more so in \n     climatological science. In recent years the inclination has \n     been to attribute the warming we have lately experienced to a \n     single dominant cause--the increase in greenhouse gases. Yet \n     climate has always been changing--and sometimes the swings \n     have been rapid.\n       At the time the U.S. Department of Energy was created in \n     1977, there was widespread concern about the cooling trend \n     that had been observed for the previous quarter-century. \n     After 1940 the temperature, at least in the Northern \n     Hemisphere, had dropped about one-half degree Fahrenheit--and \n     more in the higher latitudes. In 1974 the National Science \n     Board, the governing body of the National Science Foundation, \n     stated: ``During the last 20 to 30 years, world temperature \n     has fallen, irregularly at first but more sharply over the \n     last decade.'' Two years earlier, the board had observed: \n     ``Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the \n     present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end \n     . . . leading into the next glacial age.'' And in 1975 the \n     National Academy of Sciences stated: ``The climates of the \n     earth have always been changing, and they will doubtless \n     continue to do so in the future. How large these future \n     changes will be, and where and how rapidly they will occur, \n     we do not know.''\n       These statements--just a quarter-century old--should \n     provide us with a dose of humility as we look into the more \n     distant future. A touch of that humility might help temper \n     the current raging controversies over global warming. What \n     has concerned me in recent years is that belief in the \n     greenhouse effect, persuasive as it is, has been transmuted \n     into the dominant forcing mechanism affecting climate \n     change--more or less to the exclusion of other forcing \n     mechanisms. The CO2/climate-change relationship \n     has hardened into orthodoxy--always a worrisome sign--an \n     orthodoxy that searches out heretics and seeks to punish \n     them.\n       We are in command of certain essential facts. First, since \n     the start of the 20th century, the mean temperature at the \n     earth's surface has risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit. Second, \n     the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has been \n     increasing for more than 150 years. Third, CO2 is \n     a greenhouse gas--and increases in it, other things being \n     equal, are likely to lead to further warming. Beyond these \n     few facts, science remains unable either to attribute past \n     climate changes to changes in CO2 or to forecast \n     with any degree of precision how climate will change in the \n     future.\n       Of the rise in temperature during the 20th century, the \n     bulk occurred from 1900 to 1940. It was followed by the \n     aforementioned cooling trend from 1940 to around 1975. Yet \n     the concentration of greenhouse gases was measurably higher \n     in that later period than in the former. That drop in \n     temperature came after what was described in the National \n     Geographic as ``six decades of abnormal warmth.''\n       In recent years much attention has been paid in the press \n     to longer growing seasons and shrinking glaciers. Yet in the \n     earlier period up to 1975, the annual growing season in \n     England had shrunk by some nine or 10 days, summer frosts in \n     the upper Midwest occasionally damaged crops, the glaciers \n     in Switzerland had begun to advance again, and sea ice had \n     returned to Iceland's coasts after more than 40 years of \n     its near absence.\n       When we look back over the past millennium, the questions \n     that arise are even more perplexing. The so-called Climatic \n     Optimum of the early Middle Ages, when the earth temperatures \n     were 1 to 2 degrees warmer than today and the Vikings \n     established their flourishing colonies in Greenland, was \n     succeeded by the Little Ice Age, lasting down to the early \n     19th century. Neither can be explained by concentrations of \n     greenhouse gases. Moreover, through much of the earth's \n     history, increases in CO2 have followed global \n     warming, rather than the other way around.\n       We cannot tell how much of the recent warming trend can be \n     attributed to the greenhouse effect and how much to other \n     factors. In climate change, we have only a limited grasp of \n     the overall forces at work. Uncertainties have continued to \n     abound--and must be reduced. Any approach to policy formation \n     under conditions of such uncertainty should be taken only on \n     an exploratory and sequential basis. A premature commitment \n     to a fixed policy can only proceed with fear and trembling.\n       In the Third Assessment by the International Panel on \n     Climate Change, recent climate change is attributed primarily \n     to human causes, with the usual caveats regarding \n     uncertainties. The record of the past 150 years is scanned, \n     and three forcing mechanisms are highlighted: anthropogenic \n     (human-caused) greenhouse gases, volcanoes and the 11-year \n     sunspot cycle. Other phenomena are represented poorly, if at \n     all, and generally are ignored in these models. Because only \n     the past 150 years are captured, the vast swings of the \n     previous thousand years are not analyzed. The upshot is that \n     any natural variations, other than volcanic eruptions, are \n     overshadowed by anthropogenic greenhouse gases.\n       Most significant: The possibility of long-term cycles in \n     solar activity is neglected because there is a scarcity of \n     direct measurement. Nonetheless, solar irradiance and its \n     variation seem highly likely to be a principal cause of long-\n     term climatic change. Their role in longer-term weather \n     cycles needs to be better understood.\n       There is an idea among the public that ``the science is \n     settled.'' Aside from the limited facts I cited earlier, that \n     remains far from the truth. Today we have far better \n     instruments, better measurements and better time series than \n     we have ever had. Still, we are in danger of prematurely \n     embracing certitudes and losing open-mindedness. We need to \n     be more modest.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Schlesinger points out that ``science remains unable \nto either attribute past climate changes to changes in CO2 \nor to forecast with any degree of precision how [the] climate will \nchange in the future,'' and warns that:\n\n       We cannot tell how much of the recent warming trend can be \n     attributed to the greenhouse gas effect and how much to other \n     factors. In climate change, we have only a limited grasp of \n     the overall forces at work. Uncertainties have continued to \n     abound--and must be reduced. Any approach to policy formation \n     under conditions of such uncertainty should be taken only on \n     an exploratory and sequential basis. A premature commitment \n     to a fixed policy can only proceed with fear and trembling.\n\n  Several Members of this body have introduced pieces of legislation \nthis year and a couple last year to address the issue of climate change \nby capping carbon--such as the Jeffords-Lieberman 4-P bill, the Carper \n4-P bill, and, of course, the subject of our debate today, the McCain-\nLieberman climate change bill.\n  Passage of any of these bills will force our utilities which are now \nusing coal to generate over half of our Nation's electricity--by the \nway, 85 percent of electricity generated in my State--to fuel-switch \nand to rely solely on natural gas for generation despite the fact we \nhave a 250-year supply of domestic coal and are currently in the grips \nof a natural gas crisis.\n  Senator Lieberman, in his opening statement, mentioned two companies \nfrom Ohio I am very familiar with, ADP and Synergy. There was some \nindication there was possibly--from his words--support for S. 139. I \nmake it clear for the record that ADP and Synergy--ADP is the company \nthat burns more coal than any other utility in the country--are both \nopposed to S. 139.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Certainly.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am glad you brought that up. That was the information I \nhad on who is opposed to it, naming Synergy. The Senator from \nConnecticut said they are now supporting S. 139. You have information \nto the contrary, is that correct?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes, I do.\n  Over the last decade, use of natural gas electricity generation has \nrisen significantly while domestic supplies of natural gas have fallen. \nThe result is predictable: tightening supplies of natural gas, higher \nnatural gas prices, and higher electricity prices.\n  Home heating prices are up dramatically, forcing folks on low and \nfixed income to choose between heating their home and paying for other \nnecessities such as food or medicine.\n  Donald Mason, a commissioner on the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, \ntestified earlier this year in the House Energy and Commerce Committee:\n\n       In real terms, the home heating cost this winter will \n     increase by at least $220 per household. That might sound not \n     significant,\n\n[[Page S13492]]\n\n     but during the winter season of 2000-2001, one gas company in \n     Ohio saw nonpayment jump from $10 million a year to $26 \n     million.\n\n  One of the amendments I supported in the Senate to the Labor-HHS bill \nwould have provided more money for LIHEAP, the low-income help in \nheating costs. We will have a crisis this winter in natural gas costs.\n  As a result of these heating cost increases, 50 percent more \nresidential customers were disconnected from gas service last year than \nin 2001. I personally have seen natural gas go from $4 an MCF to $8 an \nMCF in heating bills in northeast Ohio and projections indicate this \nwinter will be devastating on the elderly and low-income families who \nare already struggling to survive.\n\n  In an Environment and Public Works Committee hearing last year, \nThomas Mullen, of Catholic Charities and Health and Human Services of \nCleveland, described the direct impact of significant increases of \nenergy prices on those who are less fortunate. Here is what he had to \nsay:\n\n       In Cleveland, over one-fourth of all children live in \n     poverty and are in a family of a single female head of \n     household. These children will suffer from further loss of \n     basic needs as their moms are forced to make choices of \n     whether to pay the rent or live in a shelter; pay the heating \n     bill or see their child freeze; buy food or risk availability \n     of a hunger center. These are not choices that any senior \n     citizen, child, or for that matter, person in America should \n     make.\n\n  What really gets to me was after he made that statement the Clean Air \nTrust, the O'Donnell person who is always speaking out on these issues, \nnamed Tom Mullen, the head of Catholic Charities, as the villain of the \nmonth because he dared talk about energy costs impacting the poor and \nelderly in this country.\n  Manufacturers that use natural gas as feedstock are getting hammered \nbecause of the doubling and tripling of natural gas costs and are \nleaving the country or closing their doors. It is happening. Lubrizol, \na chemical company, has moved production to France as a result of a \nthreefold increase in natural gas prices from $3 per million Btu in \n2002 to $10 per Btu in 2003. The president of Zaclon, a chemical \nmanufacturer based in Cleveland, testified this year that increased \nnatural gas costs resulted in lost sales revenue and increased total \nenergy cost. The president of one major international pharmaceutical \ncompany, a company that has 22,000 employees in the United States, \nrecently told me unless we do something about our natural gas crisis, \nhis company will be forced to pull many of its operations out of the \nUnited States. Due to high natural gas prices, the Dow Chemical \nCompany, headquartered in Michigan, will be forced to shut down several \nplants and eliminate 3,000 to 4,000 jobs this year. The American Iron \nand Steel Institute reported that an integrated steel mill--we have \nsome in Ohio still--could pay as much as $73 million for natural gas \nthis year, up $37 million from last year. An east Texas poultry \nproducer reported his poultry house heating bill jumped from $3,900 to \n$12,000 in one month, forcing him to decide between paying the bank or \nthe gas company.\n  High natural gas prices have resulted in the permanent closure of \nalmost 20 percent of the United States nitrogen fertilizer production \ncapacity and the idling of an additional 25 percent. That is why the \ncorn growers and other agriculture groups are opposed to McCain-\nLieberman.\n  The Potash Corporation, one of the world's largest fertilizer \nproducers, has announced layoffs at the Louisiana and Tennessee plants \ndue to high natural gas prices. The company spends $2 million per day \non natural gas.\n  A farmer in Belleville, MO, who paid $295 per ton for nitrogen \nfertilizer last fall expects to pay between $400 and $600 this year. It \nis impacting the entire segment of our economy.\n  Utilities are already facing tremendous increases in their fuels \ncosts, which force them to either take losses or pass these increases \non to their customers. And the carbon caps proposed by Senators McCain \nand Lieberman will only exacerbate this situation.\n  The end result is a drag on the economy. But don't take my word for \nit. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has testified before the \nSenate Energy Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and \nthe Congressional Joint Economic Committee on the supply and price of \nnatural gas this year, stating:\n\n       I'm quite surprised at how little attention the natural gas \n     problem has been getting because it is a very serious \n     problem.\n\n  Among his comments, Chairman Greenspan noted:\n\n       The price of gas for delivery in July closed at $6.31 per \n     billion Btu's. That contract sold for as low as $2.55 in July \n     2000 and for $3.65 a year ago.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the testimony of Dr. \nGreenspan be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors of the \n   Federal Reserve System Before the Committee on Energy and Natural \n         Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, July 10, 2003\n\n       Today's tight natural gas markets have been a long time in \n     coming, and distant futures prices suggest that we are not \n     apt to return to earlier periods of relative abundance and \n     low prices anytime soon. It was little more than a half-\n     century ago that drillers seeking valuable crude oil bemoaned \n     the discovery of natural gas. Given the lack of adequate \n     transportation, wells had to be capped or the gas flared. As \n     the economy expanded after World War II, the development of a \n     vast interstate transmission system facilitated widespread \n     consumption of natural gas in our homes and business \n     establishments. On a heat-equivalent basis, natural gas \n     consumption by 1970 had risen to three-fourths of that of \n     oil. But consumption lagged in the following decade because \n     of competitive incursions from coal and nuclear power. Since \n     1985, natural gas has gradually increased its share of total \n     energy use and is projected by the Energy Information \n     Administration to gain share over the next quarter century, \n     owing to its status as a clean-burning fuel.\n       Recent years' dramatic changes in technology are making \n     existing energy reserves stretch further while keeping long-\n     term energy costs lower than they otherwise would have been. \n     Seismic techniques and satellite imaging, which are \n     facilitating the discovery of promising new natural gas \n     reservoirs, have nearly doubled the success rate of new-field \n     wildcat wells in the United States during the past decade. \n     New techniques allow far deeper drilling of promising fields, \n     especially offshore. The newer recovery innovations \n     reportedly have significantly raised the average proportion \n     of gas reserves eventually brought to the surface. \n     Technologies are facilitating Rocky Mountain production of \n     tight sands gas and coalbed methane. Marketed production in \n     Wyoming, for example, has risen from 3.4 percent of total \n     U.S. output in 1996 to 7.1 percent last year.\n       Moreover, improving technologies have also increased the \n     depletion rate of newly discovered gas reservoirs, placing a \n     strain on supply that has required increasingly larger gross \n     additions from drilling to maintain any given level of dry \n     gas production. Depletion rates are estimated to have reached \n     27 percent last year, compared with 21 percent as recently as \n     five years ago. The rise has been even more pronounced for \n     conventionally produced gas because tight sands gas, which \n     comprises an increasing share of new gas finds, exhibits a \n     slower depletion rate than conventional wells.\n       Improved technologies, however, have been unable to prevent \n     the underlying long-term price of natural gas in the United \n     States from rising. This is most readily observed in markets \n     for natural gas where contract delivery is sufficiently \n     distant to allow new supply to be developed and brought to \n     market. That price has risen gradually from $2 per million \n     Btu in 1997 for delivery in 2000, and presumably well beyond, \n     to more than $4.50 for delivery in 2009, the crude oil \n     heating equivalent of rising from less than $12 per barrel to \n     $26 per barrel. Over the same period, the distant futures \n     price of light sweet crude oil has edged up only $4 per \n     barrel and is selling at a historically rare discount to \n     comparably dated natural gas.\n       Because gas is particularly challenging to transport in its \n     cryogenic form as a liquid, imports of liquefied natural gas \n     (LNG) have been negligible. Environmental and safety concerns \n     and cost have limited the number of LNG terminals and imports \n     of LNG. In 2002, such imports accounted for only 1 percent of \n     U.S. gas supply. Canada, which has recently supplied a sixth \n     of our consumption, has little capacity to significantly \n     expand its exports, in part because of the role that Canadian \n     gas plays in supporting growing oil production from tar \n     sands.\n       Given notable cost reductions for both liquefaction and \n     transportation of LNG, significant global trade is \n     developing. And high gas prices projected in the American \n     distant futures market have made us a potential very large \n     importer. Worldwide imports of natural gas in 2002 were only \n     23 percent of world consumption, compared to 57 percent for \n     oil.\n       Even with markedly less geopolitical instability \n     confronting world gas than world oil in recent years, spot \n     gas prices have been far more volatile than those for oil, \n     doubtless reflecting, in part, less-developed, price \n     dampening global trade. The updrift and volatility of the \n     spot price for gas have put significant segments of the North \n     American gas-using industry in a weakened competitive \n     position. Unless this competitive weakness is addressed, new \n     investment in these technologies will flag.\n\n[[Page S13493]]\n\n       Increased marginal supplies from abroad, while likely to \n     notably damp the levels and volatility of American natural \n     gas prices, would expose us to possibly insecure sources of \n     foreign supply, as it has for oil. But natural gas reserves \n     are somewhat more widely dispersed than those of oil, for \n     which three-fifths of proved world reserves reside in the \n     Middle East. Nearly two-fifths of world natural gas reserves \n     are in Russia and its former satellites, and one-third are in \n     the Middle East.\n       Creating a price-pressure safety valve through larger \n     import capacity of LNG need not unduly expose us to \n     potentially unstable sources of imports. There are still \n     numerous unexploited sources of gas production in the United \n     States. We have been struggling to reach an agreeable \n     tradeoff between environmental and energy concerns for \n     decades. I do not doubt we will continue to fine-tune our \n     areas of consensus. But it is essential that our policies be \n     consistent. For example, we cannot, on the one hand, \n     encourage the use of environmentally desirable natural gas in \n     this country while being conflicted on larger imports of LNG. \n     Such contradictions are resolved only by debilitating spikes \n     in price.\n       In summary, the long-term equilibrium price for natural gas \n     in the United States has risen persistently during the past \n     six years from approximately $2 per million Btu to more than \n     $4.50. Although futures markets project a near-term modest \n     price decline from current highly elevated levels, contracts \n     written for delivery in 2009 are more than double the levels \n     that had been contemplated when much of our existing gas-\n     using capital stock was put in place. The perceived \n     tightening of long-term demand-supply balances is beginning \n     to price some industrial demand out of the market. It is not \n     clear whether these losses are temporary, pending a fall in \n     price, or permanent.\n       Such pressures do not arise in the U.S. market for crude \n     oil. American refiners have unlimited access to world \n     supplies, as was demonstrated most recently when Venezuelan \n     oil production shut down. Refiners were able to replace lost \n     oil with supplies from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. If \n     North American natural gas markets are to function with the \n     flexibility exhibited by oil, unlimited access to the vast \n     world reserves of gas is required. Markets need to be able to \n     effectively adjust to unexpected shortfalls in domestic \n     supply. Access to world natural gas supplies will require a \n     major expansion of LNG terminal import capacity and \n     development of the newer offshore regasification \n     technologies. Without the flexibility such facilities will \n     impart, imbalances in supply and demand must inevitably \n     engender price volatility.\n       As the technology of LNG liquefaction and shipping has \n     improved, and as safety considerations have lessened, a major \n     expansion of U.S. import capability appears to be under way. \n     These movements bode well for widespread natural gas \n     availability in North America in the years ahead.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Natural Gas Supply and Demand Issues, Full Committee on Energy and \n         Commerce, June 10, 2003, Rayburn House Office Building\n\n     Hon. Alan Greenspan,\n     Chairman, The Federal Reserve Board, Washington, DC.\n       In recent months, in response to very tight supplies, \n     prices of natural gas have increased sharply. Working gas in \n     storage is currently at very low levels relative to its \n     seasonal norm because of a colder-than-average winter and a \n     seeming inability of increased gas well drilling to \n     significantly augment net marketed production. Canada, our \n     major source of imported natural gas, has had little room to \n     expand shipments to the United States, and our limited \n     capacity to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) effectively \n     restricts our access to the world's abundant supplies of gas.\n       Our inability to increase imports to close a modest gap \n     between North American demand and production (a gap we can \n     almost always close in oil) is largely responsible for the \n     marked rise in natural gas prices over the past year. Such \n     price pressures are not evident elsewhere. Competitive crude \n     oil prices, after wide gyrations related to the war in Iraq, \n     are now only slightly elevated from a year ago, and where \n     spot markets for natural gas exist, such as in Great Britain, \n     prices exhibit little change from a year ago. In the United \n     States, rising demand for natural gas, especially as a clean-\n     burning source of electric power, is pressing against a \n     supply essentially restricted to North American production.\n       Given the current infrastructure, the U.S. market for \n     natural gas is mainly regional, is characterized by \n     relatively longer term contracts, and is still regulated, but \n     less so than in the past. As a result, residential and \n     commercial prices of natural gas respond sluggishly to \n     movements in the spot price. Thus, to the extent that natural \n     gas consumption must adjust to limited supplies, most of the \n     reduction must come from the industrial sector and, to a \n     lesser extent, utilities.\n       Yesterday the price of gas for delivery in July closed at \n     $6.31 per million Btu. That contract sold for as low as $2.55 \n     in July 2000 and for $3.65 a year ago. Futures markets \n     project further price increases through the summer cooling \n     season to the peak of the heating season next January. \n     Indeed, market expectations reflected in option prices imply \n     a 25 percent probability that the peak price will exceed \n     $7.50 per million Btu.\n       Today's tight natural gas markets have been a long time in \n     coming, and futures prices suggest that we are not apt to \n     return to earlier periods of relative abundance and low \n     prices anytime soon. It was little more than a half-century \n     ago that drillers seeking valuable crude oil bemoaned the \n     discovery of natural gas. Given the lack of adequate \n     transportation, wells had to be capped or the gas flared. As \n     the economy expanded after World War II, the development of a \n     vast interstate transmission system facilitated widespread \n     consumption of natural gas in our homes and business \n     establishments. On a heat-equivalent basis, natural gas \n     consumption by 1980 had risen to three-fourths of that of \n     oil. But natural gas consumption lagged in the following \n     decade because of competitive incursions from coal and \n     nuclear power. Since 1985, natural gas has gradually \n     increased its share of total energy use and is projected by \n     the Energy Information Administration to gain share over the \n     next quarter century, owing to its status as a clean-burning \n     fuel.\n       Recent years' dramatic changes in technology are making \n     existing energy reserves stretch further while keeping long-\n     term energy costs lower than they otherwise would have been. \n     Seismic techniques and satellite imaging, which are \n     facilitating the discovery of promising new natural gas \n     reservoirs, have nearly doubled the success rate of new-field \n     wildcat wells in the United States during the past decade. \n     New techniques allow far deeper drilling of promising fields, \n     especially offshore. The newer recovery innovations \n     reportedly have raised the average proportion of gas reserves \n     eventually brought to the surface. Technologies are \n     facilitating Rocky Mountain production of tight sands gas and \n     coalbed methane. Marketed production in Wyoming, for example, \n     has risen from 3.4 percent of total U.S. output in 1996 to \n     7.1 percent last year.\n       One might expect that the dramatic shift away from hit-or-\n     miss methods toward more advanced technologies would have \n     lowered the cost of developing new fields and, hence, the \n     long-term marginal costs of new gas. Indeed, those costs have \n     declined, but by less than might have been the case because \n     much of the innovation in oil and gas development outside of \n     OPEC has been directed at overcoming an increasingly \n     inhospitable and costly exploratory physical environment.\n       Moreover, improving technologies have also increased the \n     depletion rate of newly discovered gas reservoirs, placing a \n     strain on supply that has required increasingly larger gross \n     additions from drilling to maintain any given level of dry \n     gas production. Depletion rates are estimated to have reached \n     27 percent last year, compared with 21 percent as recently as \n     five years ago. The rise has been even more pronounced for \n     conventionally produced gas because tight sands gas, which \n     comprises an increasing share of new gas finds, exhibits a \n     slower depletion rate than conventional wells.\n       Improved technologies, however, have been unable to prevent \n     the underlying long-term price of natural gas in the United \n     States from rising. This is most readily observed in markets \n     for natural gas where contract delivery is sufficiently \n     distant to allow new supply to be developed and brought to \n     market. That price has risen gradually from $2 per million \n     Btu in 1997 for delivery in 2000, and presumably well beyond, \n     to more than $4.50 for delivery in 2009, the crude oil \n     heating equivalent of rising from less than $12 per barrel to \n     $26 per barrel. Over the same period, the distant futures \n     price of light sweet crude oil has edged up only $4 per \n     barrel and is selling at a historically rare discount to \n     comparably dated natural gas.\n       Because gas is particularly challenging to transport in its \n     cryogenic form as a liquid, imports of LNG have been \n     negligible. Environmental and safety concerns and cost have \n     limited the number of LNG terminals and imports of LNG. In \n     2001, LNG imports accounted for only 1 percent of U.S. gas \n     supply. Canada, which has recently supplied a sixth of our \n     consumption, has little capacity to significantly expand its \n     exports, in part because of the role that Canadian gas plays \n     in supporting growing oil production from tar sands.\n       Given notable cost reductions for both liquefaction and \n     transportation of LNG, significant global trade is \n     developing. And high gas prices projected in the American \n     distant futures market have made us a potential very large \n     importer. Worldwide imports of natural gas in 2000 were only \n     26 percent of world consumption, compared to 50 percent for \n     oil.\n       Even with markedly less geopolitical instability \n     confronting world gas than world oil in recent years, spot \n     gas prices have been far more volatile than those for oil, \n     doubtless reflecting, in part, less-developed global trade. \n     The updrift and volatility of the spot price for gas have put \n     significant segments of the North American gas-using industry \n     in a weakened competitive position. Unless this competitive \n     weakness is addressed, new investment in these \n     technologies will flag.\n       Increased marginal supplies from abroad, while likely to \n     notably damp the levels and volatility of American natural \n     gas prices, would expose us to possibly insecure sources of \n     foreign supply, as it has for oil. But natural gas reserves \n     are somewhat more widely dispersed than those of oil, for \n     which three-fifths of proved world reserves reside in the \n     Middle East. Nearly two-fifths of world natural gas reserves \n     are in Russia and its former satellites, and one-third are in \n     the Middle East.\n       Creating a price-pressure safety valve through larger \n     import capacity of LNG need\n\n[[Page S13494]]\n\n     not unduly expose us to potentially unstable sources of \n     imports. There are still numerous unexploited sources of gas \n     production in the United States. We have been struggling to \n     reach an agreeable tradeoff between environmental and energy \n     concerns for decades. I do not doubt we will continue to \n     fine-tune our areas of consensus. But it is essential that \n     our policies be consistent. For example, we cannot, on the \n     one hand, encourage the use of environmentally desirable \n     natural gas in this country while being conflicted on larger \n     imports of LNG. Such contradictions are resolved only by \n     debilitating spikes in price.\n       In summary, the long-term equilibrium price for natural gas \n     in the United States has risen persistently during the past \n     six years from approximately $2 per million Btu to more than \n     $4.50. The perceived tightening of long-term demand-supply \n     balances is beginning to price some industrial demand out of \n     the market. It is not clear whether these losses are \n     temporary, pending a fall in price, or permanent.\n       Such pressures do not arise in the U.S. market for crude \n     oil. American refiners have unlimited access to world \n     supplies, as was demonstrated most recently when Venezuelan \n     oil production shut down.

Access to world natural gas supplies will require a \n     major expansion of LNG terminal import capacity. Without the \n     flexibility such facilities will impart, imbalances in supply \n     and demand must inevitably engender price volatility.\n       As the technology of LNG liquefaction and shipping has \n     improved, and as safety considerations have lessened, a major \n     expansion of U.S. import capability appears to be under way. \n     These movements bode well for widespread natural gas \n     availability in North America in the years ahead.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement of Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors of the \n  Federal Reserve System Before the Joint Economic Committee, May 21, \n                                  2003\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to testify \n     before the Joint Economic Committee. As you will recall, when \n     I appeared here last November, I emphasized the extraordinary \n     resilience manifested by the United States economy in recent \n     years--the cumulative result of increased flexibility over \n     the past quarter century. Since the middle of 2000, our \n     economy has withstood serious blows: a significant decline in \n     equity prices, a substantial fall in capital spending, the \n     terrorist attacks of September 11, confidence-debilitating \n     revelations of corporate malfeasance, and wars in Afghanistan \n     and Iraq. Any combination of these shocks would arguably have \n     induced a severe economic contraction two or three decades \n     ago. Yet remarkably, over the past three years, activity has \n     expanded, on balance--an outcome offering clear evidence of a \n     flexible, more resilient, economic system.\n       Once again this year, our economy has struggled to surmount \n     new obstacles. As the tensions with Iraq increased early in \n     2003, uncertainties surrounding a possible war contributed to \n     a softening in economic activity. Oil prices moved up close \n     to $40 a barrel in February, stock prices tested their lows \n     of last fall, and consumer and business confidence ebbed. \n     Although in January there were some signs of a post-holiday \n     pickup in retail sales other than motor vehicles, spending \n     was little changed, on balance, over the following three \n     months as a gasoline price surge drained consumer purchasing \n     power and severe winter weather kept many shoppers at home.\n       Businesses, too, were reluctant to initiate new projects in \n     such a highly uncertain environment. Hiring slumped, capital \n     spending plans were put on hold, and inventories were held to \n     very lean levels. Collectively, households and businesses \n     hesitated to make decisions, pending news about the timing, \n     success, and cost of military action--factors that could \n     significantly alter the outcomes of those decisions.\n       The start of the war and its early successes, especially \n     the safeguarding of the Iraqi oilfields, were greeted \n     positively by financial and commodities markets. Stock prices \n     rallied, risk spreads narrowed, oil prices dropped sharply, \n     and the dour mood that had gripped consumers started to lift, \n     precursors that historically have led to improved economic \n     activity. The quick conclusion of the conflict subsequently \n     added to financial gains.\n       We do not yet have sufficient information on economic \n     activity following the end of hostilities to make a firm \n     judgment about the current underlying strength of the real \n     economy. Incoming data on labor markets and production have \n     been disappointing. Payrolls fell further in April, and \n     industrial production declined as well. Because of the normal \n     lags in scheduling production and in making employment \n     decisions, these movements likely reflect business decisions \n     that, for the most part, were made prior to the start of the \n     war, and many more weeks of data will be needed to \n     confidently discern the underlying trends in these areas.\n       One reassuring development that has been sustained through \n     this extended period of economic weakness has been the \n     performance of productivity. To the surprise of most \n     analysts, labor productivity has continued to post solid \n     gains. Businesses are apparently continuing to discover \n     unexploited areas of cost reduction that had accumulated \n     during the boom years of 1995 to 2000 when the projected huge \n     returns from market expansion dulled incentives for seemingly \n     mundane cost savings. The ability of business managers to \n     reduce costs, especially labor costs, through investment or \n     restructuring is, of course, one reason that labor markets \n     markets have been so weak.\n       Looking ahead, the consensus expectation for a pickup in \n     economic activity is not unreasonable, though the timing and \n     extent of that improvement continue to be uncertain. The \n     stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, and \n     conditions in financial markets appear supportive of an \n     increased pace of activity. Interest rates remain low, and \n     funds seem to be readily available to creditworthy borrowers. \n     These factors, along with the ability of households to tap \n     equity accrued in residential properties, should continue to \n     bolster consumer spending and the purchase of new homes.\n       The recent declines in energy prices are another positive \n     factor in the economic outlook. The price of West Texas \n     intermediate crude oil dropped back to below $26 per barrel \n     by the end of April, but as indications of a delay in the \n     restoration of Iraqi oil exports became evident and \n     geopolitical risks crept back in, prices have risen to near \n     $30 a barrel--a worrisome trend if continued. Nonetheless, \n     the price of crude oil is still about $10 per barrel below \n     its peak in February. This decline has already shown through \n     to the price of gasoline in May. Some modest further declines \n     in gas prices are likely in coming weeks, as marketers' \n     profit margins continue to back off from their elevated \n     levels of March and April to more normal levels.\n       In contrast, prices for natural gas have increased sharply \n     in response by very tight supplies. Working gas in storage is \n     presently at extremely low levels, and the normal seasonal \n     rebuilding of these inventories seems to be behind the \n     typical schedule. The colder-than-average winter played a \n     role in producing today's tight supply situation as did the \n     inability of heightened gas well drilling to significantly \n     augment net marketed production. Canada, our major source of \n     gas imports, has little room to expand shipments to the \n     United States. Our limited capacity to import liquified \n     natural gas effectively restricts our access to the world's \n     abundant supplies of natural gas. The current tight domestic \n     natural gas market reflects the increases in demand over \n     the past two decades. The demand has been spurred by \n     myriad new uses for natural gas in industry and by the \n     increased use of natural gas as a clean-burning source of \n     electric power.\n       On balance, recent movements in energy prices seem likely \n     to be a favorable influence on the overall economy. In the \n     short run, lower energy bills should give a boost to the real \n     incomes of households and to business profits. To be sure, \n     world energy markets obviously remain susceptible to \n     politically driven supply disruptions, as has been evident \n     recently from the events in Venezuela and Nigeria. But, even \n     taking account of these risks, futures markets project crude \n     oil prices to fall over the longer run, consistent with the \n     notion that current prices are above the long-term supply \n     price of oil.\n       As has been the case for some time, the central question \n     about the outlook remains whether business firms will quicken \n     the pace of investment now that some, but by no means all, of \n     the geopolitical uncertainties have been resolved. A modestly \n     encouraging sign is the backlog of orders for nondefense \n     capital goods excluding aircraft, which has been moving up in \n     recent months. Moreover, recent earnings reports suggest that \n     the profitability of many businesses is on the mend. That \n     said, firms still appear hesitant to spend and hire, and we \n     need to remain mindful of the possibility that lingering \n     business caution could be an impediment to improved economic \n     performance.\n       One new uncertainty in the global economic outlook has been \n     the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in \n     Southeast Asia and elsewhere. This epidemic has hit the \n     economies of Hong Kong and China particularly hard, as \n     tourism and business travel has been severely curtailed and \n     as measures to contain the spread of the virus have held down \n     retail sales.\n       To date, the effects of SARS on the U.S. economy have been \n     minimal. Airlines have obviously suffered another seriously \n     blow, and some U.S. multinational corporations are reporting \n     reduced foreign sales. But the effects on other industries \n     have been small. Initially, there had been some concern that \n     SARS would disrupt the just-in-time inventory systems of U.S. \n     manufacturers. Many of those systems rely on components from \n     Asia, and any disruption in the flow of these goods has the \n     potential to affect production in the United States. So far, \n     however, U.S. manufacturing output has not been noticeably \n     affected.\n       In recent months, inflation has dropped to very low levels. \n     As I noted earlier, energy prices already are reacting to the \n     decline in crude oil prices, and core consumer price \n     inflation has been minimal. Inflation is now sufficiently low \n     that it no longer appears to be much of a factor in the \n     economic calculations of households and businesses. Indeed, \n     we have reached a point at which, in the judgment of the \n     Federal Open Market Committee, the probability of an \n     unwelcome substantial fall in inflation over the next few\n\n[[Page S13495]]\n\n     quarters, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in \n     inflation.\n       Mr. Chairman, the economic information received in recent \n     weeks has not, in my judgment, materially altered the \n     outlook. Nonetheless, the economy continues to be buffeted by \n     strong cross currents. Recent readings on production and \n     employment have been on the weak side, but the economic \n     fundamental--including the improved conditions in financial \n     markets and the continued growth in productivity--augur well \n     for the future.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Senate has passed a comprehensive \nenergy bill that is currently stuck in conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. The energy bill passed by the Senate includes several \nprovisions to increase domestic production of natural gas and to ensure \nthat we have a healthy, vital fuel mix for electric generation.\n  It is vitally important for the conference committee to wrap up its \nwork and report a bill that will increase our supplies of natural gas \nand promote alternatives to natural gas.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation that has been offered by Senators \nMcCain and Lieberman goes in exactly the opposite direction. We are \ntrying to free up more natural gas. We are trying to take the heat off \nthe demand for natural gas. It will force our utilities to fuel switch \nto natural gas. It will significantly raise energy prices. It will \ncause additional thousands of jobs to be lost. And I agree with the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, that is what is going to happen.\n  The Energy Information Administration estimates that passage of S. \n139--I think this is really important, and our colleagues should listen \nto this--will raise petroleum products prices by 31 percent, raise \nnatural gas prices by 79 percent, raise electricity prices by 46 \npercent, and reduce GDP by up to $93 billion by 2025.\n  I just received a letter today from Commerce Secretary Evans, Labor \nSecretary Chao, and Acting EPA Administrator Horinko. Here is what they \nsaid in the letter:\n\n       According to an analysis conducted by the Independent \n     Information Administration (EIA), S. 139 would cause an \n     estimated average loss of 460,000 American jobs through 2025, \n     with estimated job losses reaching 600,000 by 2012. Instead \n     of improving our economic security through economic growth \n     and job creation, the job losses resulting from S. 139 would \n     place an unacceptable burden on American workers and the \n     American people.\n       EIA's analysis further reveals the higher energy costs the \n     legislation would impose on American energy consumers: once \n     fully implemented, S. 139 would require a 40 cent per gallon \n     increase in gasoline prices and cause a nearly 50% increase \n     in natural gas and electricity bills.\n       As a result of these higher energy costs, EIA projects a \n     net loss of $507 billion (1996 dollars) in Gross Domestic \n     Production over the next two decades. These higher energy \n     costs and reduced economic growth would likely lead American \n     businesses to move overseas, taking jobs with them.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from \nSecretary Evans, Secretary Chao, and Acting EPA Administrator Horinko \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 28, 2003.\n     Hon. George Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: We are writing to state our serious \n     concerns about S. 139, ``The Climate Stewardship Act of \n     2003,'' and to strongly urge that you vote against this bill \n     to avoid the significant job losses and economic harm that it \n     would inflict on our economy, without necessarily achieving \n     any reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.\n       According to an analysis conducted by the independent \n     Energy Information Administration (EIA), S. 139 would cause \n     an estimated average of 460,000 American jobs through 2025, \n     with estimated job losses reaching 600,000 by 2012. Instead \n     of improving our economic security through economic growth \n     and job creation, the job losses resulting from S. 139 would \n     place an unacceptable burden on American workers and the \n     American people. EIA's analysis further reveals the higher \n     energy costs the legislation would impose on American energy \n     consumers: once fully implemented, S. 139 would require a 40 \n     percent per gallon increase in gasoline prices and cause \n     nearly a 50% increase in natural gas and electricity bills.\n       As a result of these higher energy costs, EIA projects a \n     net loss of $507 billion (1996 dollars) in Gross Domestic \n     Product over the next two decades. These higher energy costs \n     and reduced economic growth would likely lead American \n     businesses to move overseas, taking jobs with them. As a \n     result, S. 139 may actually lead to an increase in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions as companies formerly in the U.S. \n     move their operations (and emissions) overseas to countries \n     that do not require similar emissions reductions. To \n     compensate for the economic dislocation that S. 139 would \n     cause, the legislation establishes a ``Climate Change Credit \n     Corporation'' for ``transaction assistance to dislocated \n     workers and communities.'' However, we believe that the \n     Senate should instead reject this legislation and avoid \n     inflicting the harm that would create the need for such \n     ``transition assistance'' in the first place.\n       President Bush has committed the U.S. to an ambitious and \n     comprehensive strategy to address the issue of global climate \n     change. It is based on the recognition that only a growing \n     American economy can make possible the sustained investments \n     in energy and carbon sequestration technologies needed to \n     reduce the projected long-term growth in global greenhouse \n     gas emissions. Because of its negative impacts on jobs and \n     economic growth, we call upon the Senate to reject \n     S. 139 as a misguided means of achieving our international \n     environmental goals.\n     Donald L. Evans,\n       Secretary of Commerce.\n     Elaine L. Chao,\n       Secretary of Labor.\n     Marianne L. Horinko,\n       Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Three?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield an additional 3 minutes from our \nside to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. As I said, Mr. President, carbon caps mean fuel \nswitching. Carbon caps mean the end of manufacturing in my State. They \nmean enormous burdens on the least of our brethren. And they mean \nmoving jobs and production overseas.\n  What we need to do is move forward in a responsible manner, and move \naway from harshly ideological positions that advance nothing other than \nthe agenda of environmental groups that have made support for carbon \ncaps a political litmus test.\n  We must move forward in a manner that includes sound science and \nconcrete reductions in carbon without seriously harming our economy.\n  In response to the need for better understanding of the underlying \nscience of climate change, President Bush has moved forward \naggressively to focus administration science and climate programs on a \ncomprehensive approach to this issue.\n  Earlier this year, Secretary Veneman announced a new series of \ninitiatives to increase agricultural sequestration of carbon, which is \na major problem. The Department of Energy is implementing President \nBush's $2 billion Clean Coal Technology Initiative. And the DOE and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency have worked with the State Department \non several international carbon control and sequestration projects, \nincluding the exportation of clean coal technologies to underdeveloped \nnations.\n  I appreciate the steps the administration is taking on climate \nchange. I would like to make clear today that, as a State legislator, \ncounty official, mayor, and Governor of Ohio, I have been able to work \nacross the aisle with environmental groups to accomplish many things. \nEfforts were successful because reasonable minds were able to sit at \nthe table together, work together in good faith, and get things done.\n  It is unfortunate in this debate that we have not been able to sit \ndown with folks and work through this issue in good faith. Our friends \nin the environmental community and their allies in Congress have \nhardened their positions on climate change to the point that voting for \ncarbon caps--despite the tremendous negative impact such caps have on \njobs, the poor, and our economy--has become a litmus test.\n  In a word, this position is unreasonable. It is unreasonable that \nnothing other than capping carbon is acceptable. It is unreasonable \nthat nothing other than forcing utilities to rely solely on natural gas \nto generate electricity and devastating our economy is acceptable. And, \nfinally, it is unreasonable that nothing other than sending\n\n[[Page S13496]]\n\nAmerican jobs overseas and driving up energy costs for the poor and \nelderly on fixed income is acceptable.\n  Mr. President, I have been fortunate to serve the State of Ohio for \nmany years. I take my responsibility to serve my State's interests very \nseriously. And I will work all day, every day, to block legislation \nsuch as this legislation that will devastate my State.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on S. 139, a bill that will shut down \nour manufacturers, send thousands of American jobs overseas--to \ncountries that do not have the environmental laws that we have in \nAmerica--significantly raise energy prices for those who can least \nafford them, and do little or nothing to solve the global warming \nproblem.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I just want to, very briefly, respond \nto a few of the remarks of my friend from Ohio.\n  My friend from Ohio is talking about a bill that is not the one \nbefore us. The EIA estimate was of the original McCain-Lieberman bill. \nIn an attempt to achieve consensus, we took off the second set of \nrequirements. So now the bill says, to put it simply, that the Nation \nhas to reach the 2000 level by 2010 of greenhouse gas emissions. No EIA \nstudy has been done on this bill.\n  We have a study from the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy \nof Global Change. Just to put the minds of viewers at ease about what \nthe impact of this will be on the cost of energy, MIT estimates that \nthe bill before us will have a positive effect on coal prices, in fact, \ndropping them by 5 percent, natural gas prices by 5 percent, and crude \noil prices by 2 percent.\n  Secondly, there has been some reference to Cinergy and American \nElectric Power. I want to make clear, I did not say--I certainly did \nnot intend to say; I do not believe I did say--that those companies \nendorsed our proposal. But the fact is, Cinergy did testify that they \ncould live by the amendment without additional cost. And that is the \nrelevant part of it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have a letter entitled ``The State of Climate Science: \nOctober 2003, A Letter from U.S. Scientists''--1,010 scientists from \nacross America. I want to go into it later on, but they say, in \nsummary: The main conclusions of the IPCC and the NRC--that is the \nNational Academy of Sciences--reports remain robust consensus \npositions, supported by the vast majority of researchers in the fields \nof climate change and its impacts.\n  The body of research carried out since the reports were issued tends \nto strengthen their conclusion, 1,010 scientists.\n  We will probably hear it again, but they are relying on an analysis \nof a bill, because it is what was handed out, that is not even before \nthe Senate. I argue to my friends, it is a waste of the Senate's time \nto argue statistics, as the Senator from Ohio just did, about a bill \nthat is not before us.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I will yield the \nfloor, but I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this MIT study of \nthe bill before us and its cost impacts be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nEnergy Price Impacts of Phase I of S. 139, the McCain/Lieberman Climate \n Stewardship Act According to the June, 2003, Economic Analysis of S. \n   139--By the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global \n                                 Change\n\n       I.

This is how the \n     ``upstream allowance'' system works to affect gasoline \n     consumption--through the gasoline price. Coal, oil, and \n     natural gas prices, in contrast, do not include the carbon \n     charge because in S. 139 emissions of CO2 are \n     controlled at the point of combustion, and so this charge \n     will not be seen in the price.\n       Note 4: The reason for the natural gas price decline is \n     that, while a bigger share of electricity is produced using \n     gas, overall gas use does go down. (Electricity use goes down \n     due to conservation because of higher electricity prices, so \n     there is less overall need to generate as much electricity as \n     in the reference case.) There are also some modest \n     improvements in efficiency of gas in the electric power \n     sector, and conservation and efficiency in other uses, as \n     well.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I believe the Senator from Maine is next on our side. \nI yield to her at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I commend Chairman McCain for his \nextraordinary leadership on this issue, and Senator Lieberman for being \nable at this point for the first time to debate global climate change \nhere in the Senate. Chairman McCain has held many Commerce Committee \nhearings. As a member of that committee, I can tell you that he is \nfocused singularly on this issue in terms of trying to address one of \nthe most significant environmental issues facing this country in this \ncentury. It is long overdue, and this is the first real debate the \nSenate has had.\n  I am glad that Senator Lieberman raised this issue on domestic \nreductions because that is what this legislation is addressing, \ndomestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon \ndioxide, thought by the vast majority of international scientists to be \nthe cause of global warming.\n  The legislation before us today, the McCain-Lieberman amendment to \nthe Climate Stewardship Act of 2003, sets out to do just that in an \nenvironmentally and economically friendly way. I believe any future \ndelay in acting on climate change will lead the U.S. down a path to \neven greater environmental damage and greater economic harm. As we \nreview more and more the scientific evidence, it is clear to me that we \nhave to address this issue in a very vigorous and aggressive way.\n  The main finding of the 2001 National Academy of Science report \ncalled ``Climate Change Science: Analysis of Some Key Questions,'' was \nthis:\n\n       Greenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere \n     as a result of human activities, causing surface air \n     temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.\n\n  While this report did not rule out natural variability, it stated \nthat:\n\n     . . . the changes observed over the last several decades are \n     likely mostly due to human activities . . .\n\n  This first chart that I have from the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change should give us all great pause. The red line on this \nchart shows the extreme jump in increases in temperatures in the last \ndecade alone when compared to the last 1,000 years, according to tree \nrings, corals, historical records, and from thermometers. Notice how \nthe red line dramatically shoots up at the far right corner of this \nchart.\n  Since carbon dioxide emitted today will linger in the atmosphere on \naverage of at least a century, this should be more of a red flag waving \nbefore our eyes than just a red line spiraling upwards as to why we \nshould be attempting to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions now.\n  What is there not to get when you see the variations of the Earth's \nsurface temperature for the past 1,000 years and see the dramatic \nincline in just the last few years alone?\n  Addressing global climate change is an issue that cuts across State \nand national boundaries as well as across interest groups. The majority \nof religious groups see it as a moral issue, and 75\n\n[[Page S13497]]\n\npercent of the general public, according to a new Zogby poll, supports \nactions under the McCain-Lieberman amendment. Some of the largest \ncompanies see it as a business issue. Dupont and BP, realizing climate \nchange's effect on their bottom line, have already achieved larger \nreductions than our amendment calls for with no net cost.\n  As a matter of fact, the companies have posted an annual savings of \n$365 million, and this amendment before us today will give them credits \nfor these early actions.\n\n  One might wonder why a Senator from a cold State such as Maine would \nworry about a little more warmth, unless you consider the implications \nof climate change on a number of ecosystems that could be thrown out of \nbalance and truly affect life as we know it.\n  As an example, predictions are that the range of the sugar maple, of \nsignificant economic importance to my State during the fall foliage \nseason, will move northward over the next 50 years. The range of \nsoftwood and hardwood tree species that grow in Maine are also expected \nto shift, interfering with the long-term growth plans of the timber \nindustry. In addition, at a recent ``Climate Change and Horticulture'' \nsymposium at Cornell University, scientists stated that crops such as \npotatoes could be pushed north into Canada. This news doesn't bode well \nfor Maine's crop or those of other potato States such as Idaho, \nWashington, North Dakota, and Oregon.\n  As you can see from this next chart, States across the country, as \nindicated in green, are urging the EPA to consider carbon dioxide a \npollutant under the Clean Air Act, and have put carbon caps on \npowerplants, or are calling on Congress to address the need for \nreductions in manmade greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The green States with the stripes are currently investigating \npotential legislative positions the States can take for carbon \nsequestration through agriculture and forestry initiatives, a move that \ncould be very important in capturing and storing carbon dioxide that \nwill help with domestic emissions reductions.\n  As a matter of fact, the New York Times reported in this morning's a \nedition:\n\n       In the last three years, state legislators have passed at \n     least 29 bills, usually with bipartisan support [that address \n     global warming.]\n\n  But it is not just the States that are taking action on this key \nissue, as mayors from large metropolitan areas and small rural towns, \nindicated on this chart by the yellow dots, have written Congress in \nsupport of the McCain-Lieberman legislation that we are considering \ntonight.\n  This past June, my State of Maine passed a bill mandating reductions \nin carbon dioxide emissions to below 1990 levels by the year 2020. The \nlaw requires Maine to develop a climate change action plan by next July \nto guide State agencies, businesses, and others with a goal of reducing \nemissions. This bill grew out of a 2001 regional emissions agreement \nsigned by six New England Governors and five eastern Canadian premiers.\n  New Hampshire has passed a law curbing carbon dioxide pollution from \npowerplants. On July 9, Northeast States, led by New York Governor \nGeorge Pataki, called for a Maryland-to-Maine cap on global warming \npollution from powerplants and announced a formal agreement for a \nregional strategy in the Northeast to reduce emissions through a \nmarket-based emissions trading system.\n  Over a year ago, the State of California passed legislation making it \nthe first State to regulate tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. And \njust last month, the Governors of California, Washington, and Oregon \nannounced plans to develop a coordinated strategy to reduce global \nwarming.\n  In the Midwest, 10 years ago, Wisconsin implemented mandatory \nreporting requirements for large generators of carbon dioxide and is \ndeveloping a registry that will enable firms to report carbon dioxide \nreductions that will allow them to obtain credits for these reductions \nin any future Federal and State greenhouse gas programs.\n  These grassroots efforts are sending Congress a clear and unequivocal \nmessage, and one that we should certainly listen to because our \natmosphere knows no boundaries. We need to develop a national approach \nas a first step to emissions reductions for solutions that are \nenvironmentally and economically sound. The McCain-Lieberman amendment \nis a first step in that process.\n  Looking beyond the continental United States at the effects of \nclimate change, scientists tell us that the snows of Kilimanjaro could \nvanish in 15 years.\n  The glaciers in the Bolivian Andes that once appeared indestructible \nmay disappear in another 10 years.\n  In Alaska, where the average temperature has risen almost 5\\1/2\\ \ndegrees over the past 30 years, there is evidence of melting \npermafrost, sagging roads, and dying forests.\n  There is also a 150-square mile, 100-foot thick mass of ice that has \nexisted on the coast of Canada for 3,000 years that is disintegrating \nfrom a century-long warming trend, and the melting has been \naccelerating over the past 2 years.\n  Coral reefs, a large and integral part of the coastal oceans around \nthe world, are under huge stresses as coral bleaching is induced by \nhigh water temperatures. Nature magazine reported there is a massive \nregion-wide decline of coral which supports a huge variety of sea life \nacross the entire Caribbean Basin.\n  Experts at a July 2003 NOAA workshop on coral reefs concluded that \nclimate change will continue to render coral reefs even more vulnerable \nto human-related stresses, such as pollution, diseases, habitat \ndestruction, and overfishing. Prevailing theory has generally held that \nthe climate will respond to rising carbon dioxide and other greenhouse \nemissions by gradually growing warmer.\n  However, according to a December 2001 National Academy of Sciences \nreport, a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that the climate \ndoes not respond to change gradually but in sudden jumps that such \nabrupt changes--and I quote from the report--``are not only possible \nbut likely in the future.''\n  If such a shift were to happen, it would have immense societal \nconsequences. The report urged that a new research program be initiated \nto identify the likelihood of the potential impact of a sudden change \nin climate in response to global warming.\n  I am pleased the Senate Commerce appropriations legislation included \n$1.6 million for abrupt climate change research that I and Senator \nCollins requested to establish a NOAA joint institute at the University \nof Maine for the study of abrupt climate change.\n  There is no doubt we will continue to need fossil fuel as an energy \nsource. Yet at the same time we should be actively supporting increased \nuse of renewable energy as well. Energy produced from wind, solar, \ngeothermal, and hydropower do not emit carbon dioxide. We must have the \nwill to change, and Congress must take actions to supply the incentives \nto promote these clean energies and for energy efficiencies so \ncompanies can make investments that extend over a period of time.\n  The amendment before us creates a cap in the trade system that gives \nbusinesses more certainty in their business planning, allowing them to \nreceive credits for emissions reduction actions that they can then \ntrade in the marketplace to others who may require credits to meet \ntheir obligations. Our proposal even allows the forestry industry to \nvoluntarily enter this program and receive credits for sequestering \ncarbon dioxide through the trees they plant.\n  We also need more accurate data of just how much carbon dioxide the \nUnited States is emitting into the atmosphere every year, and I am \nconvinced we can obtain these numbers voluntarily from some of the \nworst offenders. So a mandatory registry and reporting system for \nemissions should be put in place as proposed under this amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt the McCain-Lieberman \namendment to the Climate Stewardship Act. This is going to be \nabsolutely critical for the future of this Nation and for future \ngenerations. Through our ingenuity and technology, we need to begin to \ntake the actions to mitigate and to adapt to changes in the global \nclimate\n\n[[Page S13498]]\n\nsystem rather than just deferring through benign neglect the problems \nfor other generations to address.\n  Working together, as this legislation is purporting to do, on a \nbipartisan basis, we have the ability to bequeath future generations a \nworld better and more beautiful than was transmitted to us.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have agreed to go back and forth. I \nknow Senator Akaka has been waiting for a while. Certainly it is all \nright to go to him. I wish to make one point first.\n  It is a little unfair and unrealistic--and I want to make sure \neveryone interested in this issue understands, we have had the McCain-\nLieberman bill for months now, and we have all had a chance to study \nit. The fact they changed this bill and they are saying you are not \ntalking about the bill before you now, that did not happen until 11:53 \nthis morning. We have not had a chance to see it.\n  The bottom line is this: As was stated by the Senator from \nConnecticut, this is just a start. So if their bill is just a start, \nwhat it does is recognize CO2 as a pollutant, and that \nchanges the policy for America. I think the debate from this point \nforward should go on as if we are talking about the original McCain-\nLieberman bill. That is what we will be doing.\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma. With \nall respect, I say the Senator and others opposing our amendment may \ncontinue to talk about the original McCain-Lieberman bill, but that is \nnot the one before us. We announced at a Commerce Committee hearing on \nOctober 1 that in an attempt to achieve consensus and find common \nground, we were pulling back the second part of our proposal. The first \npart sets a goal of achieving the standards of emission of 2000 by \n2010. The second part would have taken us back to 1990 standards by \n2016. We pulled that back.\n  This is an attempt to try to see if we can move forward together. It \nhas been out there for some period of time now, and the estimate we \nhave seen of its effects comes from MIT, which I submitted for the \nRecord earlier.\n  We will continue to debate whether the facts being presented are \nrelevant to our amendment. I say respectfully they are not.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had yielded to the Senator from \nConnecticut, so let me respond. There are other provisions that arose \nthis morning that no one has seen. It is a new bill. It is a different \nbill. The Senator may have talked about it in the Commerce Committee. I \nam not on the Commerce Committee.\n  I will say this: To receive a bill after months and months of having \nthis bill to look at, preparing our case, only to find out at the last \nminute, since they obviously didn't have the votes, it was changed, and \nwe received it at 11:53, is not realistic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, we did distribute a \ndraft of this amendment last week, according to staff. I suppose in \nsome sense we are progressing in this disagreement. I would rather \ndisagree about the impact of the bill than disagree about the science \nthat I think says so clearly the world has a problem. The globe is \nwarming. It is the result of human activity, and we ought to figure out \nwhat to do about it.\n  We will continue this debate. I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nvery eloquent statement on behalf of the amendment. I am very proud of \nthe bipartisan support for the amendment. The truth is, this is a \nnonpartisan amendment, as the public support for doing something about \nglobal warming is truly nonpartisan.\n  Mr. President, I also thank my friend and colleague, the very \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, for his patience and support of the \nbill. His experience as a Senator from Hawaii with the evidence of \nglobal warming is real. It goes beyond statistics and arguments. They \nhave begun to see it with their own eyes. It is, therefore, with a real \nsense of gratitude I yield whatever time the Senator from Hawaii needs \nto make his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Climate \nStewardship Act of 2003. As a cosponsor of S. 139, I commend Senators \nLieberman and McCain for their bipartisan efforts to craft an important \nfirst step in addressing the serious issue of climate change. As was \nmentioned by Senator Lieberman, Hawaii, a State in the Pacific, is \ncertainly subject to climate change. I also support the proposed \namendment which establishes an emissions reporting database, provides \nclimate change research grants, and requires a freeze on current levels \nof greenhouse gas emissions using a cap and trade system. I compliment \nSenators Lieberman and McCain for their continued leadership on this \nissue.\n  The United States makes up less than 5 percent of the world's \npopulation, but releases the largest amount of greenhouse gases of any \ncountry. The U.S. accounts for roughly 25 percent of the world's global \nemissions. In 2001, the National Research Council conducted a study on \ngreenhouse gases at the request of the Bush administration. The council \nreported that concentrations of greenhouse gases are increasing as a \nresult of human activities. In other words, elevated levels of carbon \ndioxide are not due solely to natural climate variations. One example \nis the increase in energy production from the burning of fossil fuels.\n  The council concluded that increased concentrations of greenhouse \ngases are causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean \ntemperatures to rise. As you can see in the first chart, the World \nMeteorological Organization, WMO, shows an increase in combined land \nand ocean temperatures during the past 120 years. We can see clearly \nthe trend that has occurred and where it is at this time. If we look \nfarther back in the historical record, the second chart shows a \ndramatic spike in air temperature just after the Industrial Revolution. \nWe can see that spike and rapid rise on the chart.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, a premier \ninternational working group, predicts an increase in air surface \ntemperature. The IPCC estimates the increase would be between 2.5 to \n10.4 degrees Fahrenheit from the year 1990 to 2100. The Panel also \npredicts that climate change will likely affect the distribution and \navailability of regional water resources. My colleagues should \nrecognize that all the varied climate models and scenarios used by the \nIPCC show a continued increase in air surface temperature.\n  Strong evidence of increased atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases \nand climate change is obvious in my home State. The global warming \ndebate began in Hawaii. Over 30 years ago, the Mauna Loa Climate \nObservatory documented evidence of increased carbon dioxide levels. \nThis graph clearly shows an undeniable upward trend of carbon dioxide \nin the atmosphere around the world.\n  It is interesting to note, however, that island communities account \nfor less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Major \npopulation centers and infrastructure are located along or near coastal \nareas. As a result, Pacific island nations are highly vulnerable to \nincreased impacts of climate change. Scientists predict an increase of \nextreme climate change events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. \nThe impacts of these events on business and agriculture in Hawaii and \nPacific islands could be particularly severe and devastate our tourist-\ndependent economies.\n  In just the past 100 years, Honolulu's average temperature has \nincreased 4.4 degrees Fahrenheit while precipitation has decreased by \n20 percent. In Hawaii we have seen that ``El Nino'' events can have \nstrong influences on our climate, causing prolonged periods of drought \nthat hurt Hawaii's agricultural industry. Some climate projections show \nthat the Pacific may actually transition into a more persistent ``El-\nNino''-like state, causing dramatic changes to the ecosystem around the \nworld. This change would not only affect farmers, but perhaps even \npermanently destroy many coral reefs and their associated fisheries \nthroughout the Pacific. In the mid-1990s, El Nino events destroyed at \nleast one-third of Palau's coral reefs. The costs of inaction on \nclimate change far outweigh the costs of this bill.\n\n[[Page S13499]]\n\n  Sea level rise is also a tremendous concern for Pacific island \ncommunities. It can greatly accelerate coastal erosion and saltwater \nintrusion into groundwater supplies. For many Pacific island nations \nfacing severe shortages of drinking water, sea level rise is a \ndevastating prospect. In Hawaii, sea level has risen six inches in \nHonolulu and nine inches in Hilo, the big island. The IPCC predicts \nthat sea level will rise another one to two feet in the Pacific by the \nyear 2100. The impacts of even a relatively small sea level rise on \nPacific nations and atolls, some with maximum elevations which are less \nthan ten feet above sea level, can be severe. As recently as 2001, \nrising sea levels caused the loss of land areas in Kiribati and Tuvalu, \nPacific nations with low-lying atolls. In the Pacific, cultural \nactivities were interwoven with the conservation of the environment. \nThese traditions allowed the survival of dense populations on small \nland areas. Today, the global issue of climate change extends beyond \nour borders and threatens the livelihoods of these nations. Climate \nchange is an important challenge and high priority for immediate action \nin the Pacific.\n  The U.S. has tried initiatives such as the Voluntary Reporting of \nGreenhouse Gases Program. These voluntary programs have not succeeded \nin reducing or even stabilizing total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. \nAlthough program participants committed to reduce certain portions of \ntheir carbon dioxide emissions, many entities had substantial increases \nin their overall emission levels. This rise in emissions was due to \nincreasing demands for their products and services. According to the \nPew Center on Global Climate Change, total greenhouse gas emissions \nhave increased approximately 12 percent between the years 1990 and \n2001. Emissions are projected to increase another 42 percent by 2020. \nThe United States needs to address climate change in a significant way. \nWe must implement a responsible and reasonable policy to stop \ngreenhouse gas emissions from rising.\n  Under the Lieberman-McCain amendment, the United States would adopt a \nuniform, Federal program to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions. The \namendment would require all major electric power, industrial, or \ncommercial facilities that emit over 10,000 metric tons of greenhouse \ngas per year to take action. A program that uses emissions trading \nwould provide these sectors with the flexibility needed to determine \nthe most cost-effective and practical approaches to stop greenhouse gas \nemissions from rising. The U.S. has already demonstrated that a cap-\nand-trade system can be both environmentally and economically \neffective. The primary example is the Acid Rain Program which was \nestablished in 1990 to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide.\n  Four U.S. corporations are already taking the lead in reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. BP, British Petroleum, the largest oil and \ngas producer in the U.S., and DuPont, a $24 billion/year corporation \nthat produces chemicals, materials, and energy, have already taken on \nemission reduction strategies. Both BP and DuPont have claimed to save \nmillions of dollars in the process. Cinergy, the largest burner of coal \nin the U.S., has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 5 \npercent with the belief that they can meet this target at no additional \ncost to the company or ratepayers. American Electric Power, the largest \nemitter of carbon dioxide in the U.S., has joined the Chicago Climate \nExchange. This marketplace trades greenhouse gas emissions with a \ntarget of reducing emissions. The Governors of ten northeastern States \ndeveloped a regional greenhouse gas trading program because of the lack \nof national leadership on climate change. Their program requires a \nmandatory cap on power plants in July of this year. In total, carbon \nreduction initiatives are already underway in 27 States.\n  We must take this first, critical step to stabilize greenhouse gas \nemissions in the United States. If we fail to address the issue of \nclimate change now, the U.S. may have to face catastrophic and \nexpensive consequences. A relatively small investment today is far \nwiser than spending vast amounts in the future to replace destroyed \nhomes and infrastructure, restore altered ecosystems, and reinvest in \ncollapsed agricultural economies. Scientists at MIT, the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, conducted a study that analyzed the proposed \ncosts of the Lieberman-McCain amendment to S. 139. They estimated the \ncost to be less than $20 per household per year.\n  The United States has the technological capabilities and intellectual \nresources to lead the world in an effort to reduce future greenhouse \ngas emissions. The Lieberman-McCain amendment demonstrates to the \ninternational community our serious commitment. The European Union, EU, \nhas recently adopted a mandatory cap and trade program with a carbon \ndioxide reduction target of 8 percent by the year 2012. The proposed \namendment only calls for a stabilization of U.S. greenhouse gas \nemissions. The compliance costs of the EU greenhouse gas reduction \nprogram are expected to total less than 0.1 percent of their GDP, Gross \nDomestic Product. Therefore, the EU predicts a minimal effect on their \neconomic growth even under a rigorous approach.\n  I thank Senators Lieberman and McCain for recognizing the importance \nof climate change and taking the lead on legislation to stabilize \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Research shows that our climate is changing \ndue to human activities. It is clear that piecemeal, voluntary \napproaches have failed to reduce the total amount of greenhouse gas \nemissions in the United States. Now is the time to send a strong \nmessage that the U.S. is serious about the impacts of climate change. A \npolicy of inaction on climate change is not acceptable and will cost \nthe United States more than preventive policies. I firmly believe that \nwe can have economic growth while protecting the global environment. I \nurge my colleagues in the Senate to support the Lieberman-McCain \namendment to S. 139.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inhofe for his \nleadership on this issue. I recall several years ago, as a member of \nthe EPW Committee, we served on the Clean Air Subcommittee and had \nfield hearings and took testimony from a number of the scientists who \nare still speaking out and discussing the issue of global warming. I \nremember Dr. Lindzen from Harvard sat back in one of our hearings, kind \nof relaxed, and he said: We can debate this global warming, but even if \nwe do, the things people are proposing are not going to have any \nsignificant impact on the global climate situation in which we are \ninvolved.\n  I do think, as Senator Inhofe has ably pointed out, a lot of the \nscientific data is being disputed. One of the issues that I know about \npersonally and have heard this witness, Dr. Christy, testify about, is \nthe satellite data. Dr. John Christy at the University of Alabama at \nHuntsville studies NASA scientist space data, temperature readings in \nthe upper atmosphere. According to the models that were supposed to \npredict global warming, those models called for the increase in \ntemperature to show up first in the upper atmosphere.\n  According to his rigorous analysis of the upper atmosphere \ntemperatures, they have not increased in the last 15 or 20 years--maybe \njust the most minute fraction, but probably not any.\n  So this contradicts some of the things we are hearing. I don't know \nwhat changes are out there in the environment. We know a lot of factors \nare involved.\n  Professor Sallie Baliunas from Harvard, an astrophysicist, has \nrecently discussed sunspots and Sun activity, and charts that show that \ntend to correspond with increasing or falling temperatures.\n  I don't know. It could be increasing carbon dioxide, increasing soot, \nincreasing other materials that have some impact on the environment, \nalthough it does appear--our best science shows in the early middle \nages temperatures were hotter than they are today, before we had a lot \nof the things that people are complaining about.\n  What I want to get around to saying is I believe there are legitimate \ndisputes about the validity and extent of global warming. There is \nlittle or no dispute that what the United States\n\n[[Page S13500]]\n\ndoes unilaterally is not going to have any impact on the situation that \nis happening in our global environment. We have countries, like India \nwith a billion people and China with a billion people, that are growing \ndramatically and have almost no environmental controls and are not \ngoing to participate in environmental controls. What we do here, \nwhether or not we can spend billions and billions of dollars, what \nimpact will we have here? Not much, I submit.\n  I remember all these world gurus that met in Kyoto and they passed \nthe Kyoto resolution and they wanted us to adopt the Kyoto accords. \nThat was wonderful, to be at this conference and everybody got excited, \napparently, and passed this resolution and asked all the nations to \nsign.\n  We studied that here in the United States. What they wanted to do, \nand this was in the late 1990s, I believe 1997-1998, they wanted the \nUnited States and the other countries to commit to reducing greenhouse \ngases 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.\n  Far from beginning to show a reduction, by the late 1990s we were 10 \nor more percent above the 1990 level. Projections of increased energy \ndemands and other projections raised a clear indication that we were \ngoing to continue to show increases and not declines.\n  What I would say is that was ludicrous. It was totally unrealistic, \ncould not be accomplished. Yet these so-called scientists were saying \nyou are not a good person, you are not politically correct if you \ndidn't agree to the Kyoto Treaty. So we had a big debate about it. We \ntalked about it, and it became so apparent that it was so bogus and so \nunrealistic that when we voted, it was 97 to nothing, as I recall, to \nreject the Kyoto Treaty.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman have come back with a more \nmodest proposal. One thing I would have to say about it is that the \nKyoto accord at least proposed to bring other countries on board, to \nhave them agree to these reductions. This one is a unilateral economic \naction, I suggest. It says that by 2010 we ought to be at 2000 levels. \nThe projections for growth indicate that would be very costly to meet. \nThe Department of Energy research group suggests that by 2010 it would \ncreate, that year alone, a $45 billion cost on this economy. Make no \nmistake, $45 billion is real money, and it comes right out of this \neconomy. It is sucked right out of the growth of this economy. It adds \nto the bill of every business, every homeowner, and if it drives up the \ncost of natural gas as people say, it is going to take money out of the \npockets of fixed-income Americans all over this country.\n  We cannot expect that there will be no cost for this.\n  The question is, Will the cost be worth the benefit? I suggest that \nPresident Bush has it right. Let us not focus on CO2. Carbon \ndioxide does not hurt you. We have to have it in the atmosphere. It is \nwhat plants breathe. In fact, the more carbon dioxide that exists, the \nfaster plants grow. Plants will grow in desert environments much better \nwith higher levels of carbon dioxide. It does not hurt our lungs. It \ndoesn't hurt our health. It does not injure. Sulfur dioxide, mercury, \nother particulate pollutants are harmful to us. Also, we need to focus \non those issues. As we focus on those issues, we will reduce \nCO2 at the same time and perhaps that will play a role in \nour meeting some of the goals we are facing today.\n  But to commit ourselves to a political goal of reducing a gas that is \nnot harmful, and reducing it by amounts suggested here that will have \nno impact on global warming but a significant adverse impact on our \neconomy--which means jobs, jobs, jobs--is a mistake.\n  We have people in this body who say: Oh, we have too much \nunemployment; we have too many people who can't find work; we are \nseeing too many jobs go over to China. Do you think China is going to \nbe meeting these requirements? Do we think they will be spending $45 \nbillion or more to get some minor increase that we were talking about \nhere? I don't think so.\n  This reduces our competitiveness in the world marketplace. It hurts \nus as we seek to maintain our manufacturing. It hurts our people on \nfixed incomes. It increases their cost of heating and cooling their \nhomes. It is a big-time mistake. We do not need to make this mistake.\n  I don't believe anybody will stand on the floor of this Senate and \nsuggest that meeting CO2 emission goals will help this \neconomy. It can only hurt this economy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I will stand on \nthe floor of the Senate and ask what climate change is doing to future \ngenerations of Americans--the fishing industry and the farming and the \nclimate and the forest fires that are taking place in California as we \nspeak. If the Senator will yield for a question, I will stand up--\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will not yield for a question. I have accepted the \nspeech of the Senator while I held the floor. I am pleased to do so. He \nis a great advocate.\n  But I repeat: It is going to hurt this economy. And everyone knows \nit. It is going to drive up the cost of energy. When you do that, it \ndrives out jobs. It will be a unilateral economic disarmament--a \nunilateral act by this country in which other nations will not be \nparticipating. It will not help us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for my time. I \nappreciate the commitment of the Senator from Arizona, and I thank the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, for his leadership and support him \non this side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Alabama \nfor smiling his way through that intensive interrogation by the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New York whose support for \nour amendment I greatly appreciate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I am proud to rise in support of the bipartisan climate change \nlegislation offered by Senators Lieberman and McCain. I will be brief \nin my remarks, because I believe that the sponsors of the amendment \nhave eloquently made the full case for the legislation. But this is a \nvery important issue, and I did not want to miss the opportunity to \nvoice my support.\n  Climate change is greatest environmental challenge that we face. Its \neffects will unfold over decades and will touch every corner of the \nglobe. I think the time to act is now.\n  First, I want to briefly touch on the science. Many of the details \nremain to be filled in, and I support further climate research so we \ncan refine our understanding of how human activities are affecting the \nclimate system. But there is already a strong scientific consensus that \nsupports action now. The most definitive recent reports were issued by \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Research \nCouncil in 2001. In brief, the findings of those reports include the \nfollowing:\n  No. 1, anthropogenic climate change, driven by emissions of \ngreenhouse gases, is already underway and likely responsible for most \nof the observed warming over the last 50 years--the largest warming \nthat has occurred in the Northern Hemisphere during at least the past \n1,000 years;\n  No. 2, over the course of this century the Earth is expected to warm \nan additional 2.5 to 10.5  deg.F, depending on future emissions levels \nand on the climate sensitivity--a sustained global rate of change \nexceeding any in the last 10,000 years;\n  No. 3, temperature increases in most areas of the United States are \nexpected to be considerably higher than these global means because of \nour Nation's northerly location and large average distance from the \noceans;\n  No. 4, even under mid-range emissions assumptions, the projected \nwarming could cause substantial impacts in different regions of the \nUnited States, including an increased likelihood of heavy and extreme \nprecipitation events, exacerbated drought, and sea level rise;\n  No. 5, almost all plausible emissions scenarios result in projected \ntemperatures that continue to increase well beyond the end of this \ncentury; and\n  No. 6, due to the long lifetimes of greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere,\n\n[[Page S13501]]\n\nthe longer emissions increase, the faster they will ultimately have to \nbe decreased in order to avoid dangerous interference with the climate \nsystem.\n  These are disturbing findings from the most authoritative scientific \nsources we have. And the findings are further bolstered by an October \n1, 2003, letter to the U.S. Senate signed by over 1,000 leading \nscientists.\n  So opponents who argue that we need more study before we act are \nsimply wrong. We need to know more, but we already know enough to take \ninitial steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing \nclimate change.\n  I would add that we are already seeing the effects of climate change. \nGlaciers are retreating all over the world. In March 2002 the Larsen \nIce Shelf on the Antarctic peninsula completely broke off and broke up. \nThe glaciers in the mountains in the tropics are rapidly melting; e.g., \nthe snows of Kilimanjaro will be gone by 2015. One of my staff members \ntook a photo of himself on the summit in 1970 next to a 20 foot high \nglacier at Uhuru Point; 29 years later his daughter was at the same \nUhuru Point and only a trace of ice was left.\n  We are already feeling the effects of climate change. And the \nscientific consensus is that unless we act to reduce emissions, the \nplanet will continue to warm over the next century, with widespread and \npotentially devastating effects. These potential effects include more \nfrequent extreme weather events, the wider spread of diseases such as \nWest Nile, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, and malaria.\n  As a Senator from New York, I am concerned about coastal flooding if \nsea levels were to rise, and how that would affect communities on Long \nIsland. I am concerned about how warming will affect the Adirondacks, \nwhere tourism and a way of life depend on cold and snow in the winter. \nI am concerned about impacts on New York farmers. But I am also \nconcerned about impacts in other parts of the country and around the \nworld.\n  I am in wholehearted support of the effort undertaken by Senators \nLieberman and McCain to address this issue of climate change. I have to \nsay I find it somewhat bewildering, this note of fatalism, this sense \nof pessimism, this defeatism I am hearing from the other side of the \naisle.\n  No. 1, it is a real problem. You can say that it isn't. You can say \nit over and over again. It is a real problem, and it is a problem that \nis getting worse because we failed to attend to it.\n  But what bothers me is this idea that somehow America--the most \ninnovative, creative nation the world has ever seen--cannot cope with \nthis problem. This defeatism, this pessimism, this fatalism that I hear \nfrom the opponents is fundamentally un-American.\n  We have a problem. We should get about the business of addressing the \nproblem.\n  What Senators McCain and Lieberman have done is to give us a roadmap \nto doing that. It may not be everything that many advocates would wish \nfor, but it lays out a marker, and, more than that, it fulfills for me \nthe traditional sense of how Americans respond in the face of a \ndifficulty.\n  This legislation is not only necessary but I think it provides an \nopportunity. Yes, in the short run there may be some adjustments that \nare needed, just as there always are when we have to face inevitable or \nnecessary change.\n  We are confronting the greatest environmental challenge when we talk \nabout global climate change. There can only be one conclusion: Because \nof human activity, we are warming the Earth.\n  Some might say, ``Well, it doesn't seem that bad to me,'' or, ``The \nconsequences don't seem that dire.'' But I believe we have disturbing \nfindings from the most authoritative scientific sources that argue \notherwise. The most definitive recent reports were issued by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and by the National Research \nCouncil in 2001.\n  I remind my colleagues that the National Research Council study was \nrequested by the Bush administration. And it fundamentally confirms the \nresults of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n  What was the response of the administration? Kill the messenger. Hide \nthe findings. Order EPA to take the information about global climate \nchange out of its review of the status of the environment.\n  You can deny a problem, you can ignore it, and you can delude \nyourself that it is not an issue. But I don't think that any longer is \nsustainable. It is not intellectually honest, and it is not politically \ndefensible.\n  Opponents who argue that we need more study before we act are simply \nwrong. Yes, we need to know more, but we already know enough to take \ninitial steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing \nclimate change. That is what this legislation proposes to do.\n  There are so many facts that support the evidence of climate change--\nwhether we talk about the Larsen Ice Shelf on the Antarctic peninsula \nbreaking off and breaking up or whether we talk about the snow at \nKilimanjaro.\n  I want to show this one picture because it is so telling. It comes \nfrom the personal experience of one of my fellows who is working with \nme on my staff. He took a photo of himself on the summit of Kilimanjaro \nin 1970 next to a 20-foot-high glacier at Uhuru Point. And 29 years \nlater, his daughter was at the same point and there was only a trace of \nice left. Maybe people climbed up there and carted the ice off. I don't \nknow. Maybe that became some kind of economic activity that the folks \nin Tanzania decided to pursue.\n\n  That is not what happened. I think what happened is we have evidence \nin the most dramatic way possible of the effects of 29 years of global \nwarming. The scientific consensus is clear: That unless we act to \nreduce emissions, the planet will continue to warm over the next \ncentury, with widespread and potentially devastating effects. We have \nheard some of those mentioned already.\n  I listened carefully to the Senator from Maine talking about the \nchange in everything from sugar maple to the potato crop in her State. \nI listened to my colleague from Hawaii, where we really began to \nacquire the evidence and understanding of global climate change.\n  I worry about disease. I think it is indisputable that we are seeing \ndisease move up in latitude. Diseases such as West Nile, eastern equine \nencephalitis, and malaria are now found at latitudes that they have \nnever been before.\n  As a Senator from New York, I am concerned about coastal flooding, if \nsea levels were to rise, and how it would affect the communities I \nrepresent and that my colleague from Connecticut represents at Long \nIsland Sound and along the ocean.\n  I am concerned about the warming effects on the Adirondacks; I am \nconcerned about the effects on New York farmers; I am concerned about \nthe economy, if we do not act.\n  What is clear to me is that we have extraordinary economic \nopportunity. Since when did Americans say in the face of a challenge, \nOh, my goodness, we can't admit it, we can't confront it, because we \ndon't know how to deal with it economically?\n  We could be making money and creating jobs if we took seriously the \nopportunities for alternative energy and conservation. The fact that we \ndo not is because of the stranglehold special interests who are \ncommitted to always producing energy have on this body and on the \nadministration.\n  Let's be clear, we put out most of the greenhouse gasses from our \ncountry and we have the technological know-how, we have the \nunderstanding that would enable us to be the leaders in addressing this \nissue. That is why the bill offered by Senators McCain and Lieberman is \nso timely. Simply put, we would stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at \n2000 levels by 2010.\n  Think of the energy we would unleash among our entrepreneurs if they \ngot the go-ahead to deal with this challenge. A market-driven system of \ngreenhouse gas tradable allowances would exempt farmers, residences, \nand auto manufacturers, and that would give us a chance to go forward \nto try to find solutions to the challenge of addressing greenhouse \nemissions. We know this cap-and-trade approach can enable cost-\neffective reductions in emissions. We have seen it in the \nimplementation of the acid rain provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act. \nWe know that has worked. Why do we turn our backs on what we know \nworks?\n  It is amazing to me how often the Congress, Capitol Hill, and \nWashington\n\n[[Page S13502]]\n\nend up becoming evidence-free zones because people do not want to deal \nwith what the evidence demonstrates. We know the cost for this would be \nminimal.\n  Let's be honest. The science is clear. The opportunities are clear. \nThis bill represents a modest and flexible first step. Despite the \nassertions of opponents, compliance costs will be minimal. The United \nStates needs to regain leadership. We need to take responsibility. It \ngives a chance, then, to go to the rest of the world to try to build an \ninternational consensus. In the absence of some kind of protocol or \ntreaty, we will be choking to death on the emissions from countries \nsuch as China and India as their standard of living rises. Now is the \ntime to act. We owe it to our children and our grandchildren and \ngenerations beyond.\n  I thank the two sponsors for giving us the opportunity to go on \nrecord on the right side of history.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the goal \nof reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by the year 2010.\n  The scientific evidence that people are causing the Earth to warm \ngrows more robust each year. According to the National Academy of \nSciences, ``Greenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere \nas a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and \nsubsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are, in fact, \nrising. . . .'' Indeed, a new scientific analysis shows that the Earth \nis warmer now than it has been in the last 1,000 years.\n  Perhaps most alarming is the rapid warming that is occurring in the \nArctic. According to data released last week by the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, Arctic temperatures are currently \nincreasing at a rate of two degrees per decade, and Arctic ice is \nmelting at a rate of 9 percent per decade. Scientists are now \nprojecting that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in the summer by \nmid-century. Due to the importance of the Arctic Ocean to the world's \nclimate as a whole, this prediction is truly alarming.\n  To be sure, there are still numerous uncertainties. Researchers at \nthe University of Maine have pointed out that past changes in the \nclimate have tended to occur very abruptly, but we do not know if \nfuture changes in the climate will also occur in abrupt shifts. Nor do \nwe know how quickly future warming will occur. Due to these \nuncertainties, I believe we should not only direct more attention to \nbetter understanding the climate, but also take prudent actions to \nreduce the risk of disruptive climatic changes.\n  The McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship proposal would reduce U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by the year 2010. In light of \nthe climate changes observed to date and the potential risks of even \ngreater and more abrupt changes, I support this goal. It is a prudent \nstep in the right direction, and I intend to vote in favor of the \nMcCain-Lieberman amendment.\n  Although I am in favor of the Climate Stewardship Act, I think more \nthought needs to go into the exact actions by which we reach the goal \nof reducing emissions to 2000 levels by 2010. These are important \ndecisions, and Congress should not allow such important decisions to \nrest in the hands of the agencies. I support concrete, certifiable \nreductions, and these reductions should come primarily by increasing \nthe efficiency of our economy and further developing our renewable \nenergy resources. Increasing CAFE standards for automobiles, efficiency \nstandards for air conditioners and other appliances, and reducing power \nplant emissions are just a few examples of concrete steps that we can \ntake to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The United States has made tremendous strides in increasing the \nenergy efficiency of the economy. In doing so, we have averted millions \nof tons of greenhouse gas emissions. With further steps in improving \nour energy efficiency, the McCain-Lieberman target is imminently \nattainable. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have enjoyed listening to this debate \neither in person or over the television. I will not try to add to it \nwith a plethora of statistics, forecasts, or predictions. Rather, I \nwant to deal with some of the statements that have been made including \nsome we have just heard from the Senator from New York and try to do a \nlittle math of a very simple and direct kind and ask a few questions.\n  First, the Senator from New York said the United States produces most \nof the greenhouse gasses. My understanding is the correct number is 25 \npercent of the greenhouse gasses produced in the world as a whole. That \nis the largest of any single country. It does not constitute most. But \nit is a plurality and pluralities win elections so that puts us in \nfirst place.\n  Now let us assume for the sake of following this through that we \nachieve a savings of 10 percent. I am not sure we will. No one is \nreally sure in all of the predictions, dire and rosy, that are made \nwith respect to this legislation how much the savings will be, but we \nwill pick a number easy to calculate, 10 percent. That means, if the \nlaws of mathematics have not changed, we would reduce the world \nemissions by 2.5 percent because 10 percent of 25 percent is 2.5 \npercent.\n  The question then arises, will the rest of the world stay static \nwhile we reduce the total by 2.5 percent or will a combination of \nChina, India, Russia, Australia, what have you, increase the total by \n2.5 percent so that the net effect in the atmosphere of America doing \nthis is zero. That is a very likely scenario. The net effect of the \nUnited States doing this as far as manmade emissions are concerned \nwould be zero. Yes, we could reduce theoretically ours by 10 percent. \nThat would be made up by the rest of the world.\n  The question arises, how much benefit is there to see to it that the \noverall world situation is as it is now with the United States \nproducing no significant impact on the total?\n  The next question, what do we do if we reduce it by 10 percent? How \ndo we do that? Obviously, we will need the power. Indeed, we will need \nsubstantially more power between now and the year 2010 if we are going \nto reduce the emissions that come from fossil fuel to generate the \npower we will have to go someplace else. There are a variety of places \nwe can go.\n  One we hear often is we should use natural gas. We should replace \ncoal with natural gas. That is a good idea. But let us understand \nsomething right now. We have in the United States currently a shortage \nof natural gas. As Alan Greenspan pointed out, that is one of our major \neconomic challenges. He also has pointed out, natural gas is the one \nfossil fuel we cannot import. In order to import natural gas we have to \nhave a pipeline, unless you liquefy it, and that is tremendously \nexpensive, and we do not have the ports available to receive natural \ngas in liquefied form. The only places we can import natural gas are \nMexico and Canada, and we are doing that.\n  If you look at a geological chart of the United States you find there \nis plenty of natural gas in the United States, but a very large \npercentage of that is on public land. Now the people who are telling us \nwe must reduce greenhouse gas, namely the environmental groups, are the \nsame people who are telling us we cannot drill for natural gas in the \nUnited States because that somehow will desecrate the public lands. I \nam not sure the land cares whether there is a drilling rig on it or \nwhether there is a pipeline running across it, but certainly the Sierra \nClub cares. They say absolutely no drilling for natural gas on public \nlands.\n  If we cannot get to the natural gas, we will continue to use coal. \nLet's use clean coal. We have enough clean coal in the State of Utah to \nheat, light, drive the city of San Francisco for the next 300 years. We \nproposed mining that. Clean coal, low-sulfur coal would significantly \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. Who got very upset at the idea we \nmight start to use clean coal? The Sierra Club. They got President \nClinton to declare a national monument right on top of the potential \nclean coal to make sure there would never be any coal mined from that \nplace because environmentally they do not want any coal mines.\n  Well, we cannot use natural gas because we cannot get it off our \npublic lands. We cannot use the clean coal in the West because we \ncannot get it off\n\n[[Page S13503]]\n\nour public lands. What is our alternative? Nuclear. That will do it. \nThat is what they do in Europe. That is why Europe is in favor of Kyoto \nbecause they do not use fossil fuel to generate electricity; they use \nnuclear power.\n  So let's have nuclear plants all over the United States in order to \nproduce the 10 percent reduction called for in this bill. Is the Sierra \nClub ready to endorse and embrace nuclear? They will not let us drill \nfor natural gas. They do not want us to use the clean coal and they \nabsolutely do not want us to build nuclear plants.\n  All right. Where else do we go? Well, in the West, we get a portion \nof our power from hydroplants. Dams have been built to store water. And \nas the water tumbles down the front of the dam, why, we get power. And \nit is the goal of the Sierra Club, and other groups that are supporting \nthis bill, to dynamite these dams. They want to drain Lake Powell and \ndynamite the dam.\n  It is very interesting, if I could make a quick historic aside, when \nmy father was in the Senate, and they were talking about building the \nGlen Canyon Dam that would produce this power, the Sierra Club opposed \nit and said: We will never, ever need that much power. But, they said, \nif for some reason we are wrong, and we should need that power, there \nis no point in building the dam to provide the power because look at \nall the coal that is there. The coal is the coal that they moved to \nmake sure would never get mined.\n  I could embrace the idea of reducing the emissions in a test fashion \nto see if it did indeed have any impact on global warming if I could \nsee the way clear to produce the power some other way than the way we \nare doing it now.\n  I would say to the Senator from Connecticut, who has excellent \ncontacts in the environmental world, if he would go back to those who \nare supporting this bill and say to them, ``In return for support of \nthis bill, will you agree to drill for natural gas on public lands, to \nexploit low-sulfur coal where it exists on public lands, and to explore \nthe possibility of more nuclear plants so that we don't become \ndependent on fossil fuel?'' I might very well be interested in \ncosponsoring and voting for this bill.\n  But until those who are driving the debate publicly are willing to \naddress the question of how you replace the sources of power that would \nhave to be eliminated if this bill should pass, I intend to vote \nagainst the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in 1997, the Senate unanimously passed the \nByrd-Hagel resolution that stated that the Senate would reject any \nclimate agreement that did not mandate ``new specific scheduled \ncommitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing \nCountry Parties within the same compliance period'' as the United \nStates or that ``would result in serious harm to the economy of the \nUnited States.'' The Kyoto Protocol failed to meet these conditions, \nand consequently, President Clinton never submitted the protocol for \nSenate ratification, nor has President Bush.\n  The initiative before us, The Climate Stewardship Act of 2003, also \nfails to comply with the Byrd-Hagel resolution. First, it unilaterally \ncommits the United States to carbon emissions restrictions, and second, \nit puts into place the regulatory structure for future carbon dioxide \nemissions reductions. This initiative represents the first phase in a \nlong-term effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that would \nultimately inflict serious harm on the U.S. economy. There is no need \nat this time to go down that path.\n  There are many reasons why the U.S. should avoid committing itself to \ncarbon dioxide reductions. First, carbon dioxide is the unavoidable \nconsequence of burning carbon-based fuels such as coal, oil and natural \ngas. The only way to get energy from a carbon-based fuel is to force \nthe carbon to combine with oxygen through burning it. The result of \nthat process is carbon dioxide, an odorless, colorless, non-toxic gas \nthat sustains life. Reducing carbon dioxide to levels that would be \nclimatically meaningful would mean using something other than coal, oil \nor natural gas to fuel our economy. Unfortunately, there are no \neconomically viable alternatives to replace these fuels at this time.\n  This was made clear in a review of available energy technologies \npublished in Science magazine in November 2002. In that review, a team \nof scientists many of whom are climate alarmists--concluded that our \nfossil fuel-dominated energy system ``cannot be regulated away'' and \nthat we must instead rely on ``the development within the coming \ndecades of primary energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide to \nthe atmosphere.''\n  The review notes that the United Nations' Framework Convention on \nClimate Change calls for a stabilization of greenhouse gases at levels \nthat avoid ``dangerous anthropogenic [man-made] interference with the \nclimate system.'' Nobody really knows what that level is, but the \nauthors of the study argue that stabilization at levels as low as 450 \nparts per million may be necessary to do this. The review states that, \n``[t]argets of cutting to 450 parts per million . . . could require a \nHerculean effort.'' And, ``[e]ven holding at 550 parts per million is a \nmajor challenge.'' Incidentally, we are currently at 370 parts per \nmillion, so the Herculean effort would still result in carbon dioxide \nlevels significantly higher than we have now.\n  Now I realize that the initiative before us falls well short of \nstabilizing atmospheric emissions at 450 or 550 parts per million. But \nlet me be clear that if the Senate passes this initiative it would set \na precedent that would lead to future, more costly reduction \nrequirements. Currently, the executive branch has no authority to \nregulate carbon dioxide emissions. Indeed, the Clean Air Act expressly \nforbids the executive to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. This \ninitiative would create the architecture for a series of increasingly \nstringent controls on energy use. It is widely acknowledged that if \nindeed global warming is a serious problem, that even the Kyoto \nProtocol is woefully inadequate to meet the challenge. As noted by the \nEU, and elsewhere, ``avoiding dangerous interference with the climate \nsystem . . . would require substantial (50 to 70%) global reductions in \ntotal greenhouse gas emissions.'' So this precedent-setting initiative \nwould be the first stage of what appears to be a monumental and \nextravagantly expensive undertaking, and the levels of carbon dioxide \nin the atmosphere would still be higher than they are now after all our \nefforts and all the cost.\n\n  The Science review notes that the world's power consumption is about \n12 trillion watts, 85 percent of which is supplied with fossil fuels. \nBy 2050, total energy consumption will be as much as three times the \namount currently produced by fossil fuels. The review states: ``Energy \nsources that can produce 100 to 300 percent of present world power \nconsumption without greenhouse emissions do not exist operationally or \nas pilot plants.''\n  The authors conclude that the ability to stabilize greenhouse gas \nemissions without seriously damaging the economy is not possible at \nthis time: ``CO2 is a combustion product vital to how \ncivilization is powered.'' All of the possible alternative fuels ``have \nserious deficiencies that limit their ability to stabilize global \nclimate.'' The authors simply hope that we can ``develop revolutionary \nchanges in the technology of energy production, distribution, storage, \nand conversion.''\n  In other words, the means to meaningfully reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions are not available, suggesting that the economy would suffer \nfrom a premature attempt to reduce emissions.\n  How would this initiative affect the U.S. economy? The Department of \nEnergy's Energy Information Administration makes it quite clear that \npolicies that regulate carbon dioxide emissions would most heavily \nimpact coal, which is the United States' most plentiful and affordable \ndomestic energy source, and is the most important fuel in electricity \ngeneration. Currently, 52 percent of America's electricity needs are \ngenerated from coal. And while that share is projected to decrease \nsomewhat over the next 20 years, total coal use may well go up to keep \nup with growing electricity demand. It doesn't make a lot of sense to \ntarget our most important and plentiful domestic energy resource.\n  Incidentally, my State's only significant coal reserves are located \non Black Mesa and the mine there is a major employer of Native \nAmericans from the Hopi Tribe and Navajo Nation. This\n\n[[Page S13504]]\n\nmine also supplies secure, affordable energy for millions of Southwest \nfamilies.\n  There is also a lot of concern up here about the decline in \nmanufacturing jobs nationally. But the Energy Information \nAdministration also makes it clear that energy intensive manufacturing \nindustries would also be harmed by policies that regulate carbon \ndioxide.\n  Finally, we are not the only nation to come to the realization that \nKyoto-style policies carry a hefty price tag. Russia made it quite \nclear at a recent United Nations' World Climate Conference that the \nKyoto Protocol does not serve the economic interests of her people, and \ntherefore will not be pursuing greenhouse emissions reductions. Andrei \nIllarionov, President Putin's chief economic advisor has stated that \nKyoto is incompatible economic growth, noting that 40 years of data \nfrom 150 countries shows that GDP growth is highly correlated with \nincreased carbon dioxide emissions. Thus Kyoto is incompatible with \nPutin's goal of doubling Russia's economic growth over the next 10 \nyears, which would put the country slightly above its Kyoto target. \nMoreover, Illarionov stated: ``But Russia isn't going to stop at this \nlevel, so the carbon dioxide level will be much higher.'' He concludes \nthat supporting Kyoto would mean ``dooming the country to poverty, \nbackwardness and weakness.''\n  And that is the message I want to leave with my colleagues. Engaging \nin Kyoto-style emission reduction programs are incompatible with \neconomic growth at our current levels of technology, and to act now \nwithout sound scientific justification would be foolish. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on S. 139.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to inquire as to the amount \nof time we have left on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. Mr. President, I was telling my good friend \nfrom Connecticut a few minutes ago, if we keep hearing it repeated that \n``the science is real, the science is real, the science is real,'' \nsooner or later they are going to start believing it. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  Let me just say, first of all, reference was made by one of the \nspeakers to the Byrd-Hagel resolution that was passed 95 to 0. What did \nthat resolution say? The resolution said, if there is economic damage \nor if the developing countries do not have to do the same thing the \ndeveloped nations do, then we are not going to ratify the treaty. That \nis exactly what they came back with.\n  So here we have a situation now that is even worse because we are \ntalking about passing a bill that would put the United States of \nAmerica in a position where they have to do something that not only the \ndeveloping nations do not have to do, but even the developed nations do \nnot have to do.\n  So I can tell you right now, there are a lot of people in China who \nare rejoicing, thinking: Boy, all those American jobs are going to come \nto us if they pass this. In India, they are rejoicing; in Brazil, the \nsame thing. In South Korea, President Roh, and President Vincente Fox \nof Mexico would be delighted to think about the great jobs that would \ngo there--many of which have already gone there because of some of our \noverregulation in this country.\n  Like Kyoto, this is an extreme approach. I am not going to try to \nfigure out which bill we are talking about. The McCain-Lieberman bill \nhas been around now for months. And now, at 11:53 this morning, they \nchanged it. I don't know what was changed.\n  But I would say this: This is a cartoon that appeared that I think \nyou will enjoy, I say to Senator Lieberman. It is the camel's nose \nunder the tent, the fact that if you get just a little bit here, then \nall of a sudden the rest of it will come in. And the rest of it is the \nbody of Kyoto.\n  Now, why do I say that? I say that because they are actually saying \none thing. I don't care how they change their bill, they are changing \nthe policy of America to make us believe and have, as a new policy, \nthat CO2 is a pollutant. CO2 is not a pollutant. \nOther things are pollutants.\n  In fact, we have the Clear Skies Act which the President of the \nUnited States, President Bush, is promoting. It has the largest \nreduction in emissions that any President has ever promoted, with a 70-\npercent reduction. And those are in sulfur dioxide and mercury.\n  But in this case here, just to show you that nothing really has \nchanged by the last minute change, these features--the covered gases, \nemission caps, timetables, emissions trading, wealth transfer, \nemissions reporting, sequestration and sinks, verification, and future \nracheting--those are the same things that are in the current bill that \nappeared in the bill mysteriously at 11:53.\n  Now, I would like to suggest we have heard a lot of hysteria tonight. \nWe are going to hear it tomorrow for 2 more hours--no, 1 more hour. \nThat time is going to be equally divided, and they are going to be \ntalking about the horrible things that are going to happen, the ice \ncaps are going to be breaking, all these things.\n\n  I would suggest to you, Mr. President, we heard the same thing a few \nyears ago. Looking at a couple magazines--this is Science Digest. They \ncame out, and they said: ``Brace Yourself for Another Ice Age.'' The \nsame people who are talking about warming today were talking about \nbracing yourself for another ice age. If there were time, I would read \nthe script. It is really enlightening to do so. I would encourage my \nfellow Senators to do that.\n  Then, Time magazine came out, and they have ``Another Ice Age?'' They \ntalked about these horrible things that are going to happen: We are not \ngoing to be able to grow anything anymore. We are going to have to shut \ndown businesses because we are no longer going to be able to function \nbecause we have another ice age--not global warming, global cooling.\n  Then along came Newsweek, and it says: ``The Cooling World.'' They \ntalk about the horrible things that are going to happen.\n  So it seems to me it is the strategy of those individuals who are \ncatering to the extreme environmental left to try to scare people. And \nthere is no reason to do that.\n  Now, I think probably the most significant thing I am going to be \ntalking about tonight is to try to make people realize that if you say \nsomething enough times, as we keep hearing--as I mentioned a minute \nago, about the science being real, about it is proven, and all that--\nsooner or later people believe it. One reason is we do have a liberal \nnational media, and they would like to have people believe that.\n  Now, we heard a lot of discussion about the National Academy of \nSciences. I would like to quote Dr. Frederick Seitz, who is the former \npresident of the National Academy of Sciences, and 17,800 other \nindependently verified signers.\n  Now, the Senator from Arizona talked about the 1,010 scientists. We \nare talking about 17,800. This is what the Oregon petition said. This \nis a petition that was put together by the lead, Dr. Frederick Seitz, \nthe former president of the National Academy of Sciences, along with \n17,800 other signatures:\n\n       We urge the U.S. government to reject the global warming \n     agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan, in December, \n     1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed limits on \n     greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the \n     advance of science and technology, and damage the health and \n     welfare of mankind.\n\n  This is the former president of the National Academy of Sciences. He \ngoes on to say:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases \n     is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause \n     catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption \n     of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial \n     scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon \n     dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural \n     plant and animal environments of the Earth.\n\n  Now, this is significant. We are talking about not only is \nCO2 not a pollutant--which it is not a pollutant--but it is \na fertilizer. It is something that helps us and something that would be \nto the benefit to have more of, not less.\n  Now, in addition, there are over 4,000 scientists, 70 of whom are \nNobel prize winners, who have signed the Heidelberg appeal.\n  The Heidelberg appeal says: No compelling evidence exists to justify \ncontrols of anthropogenic greenhouse gas\n\n[[Page S13505]]\n\nemissions. Anthropogenic is the term meaning ``man-made.'' We keep \nhearing the Senator from New York talking about the man-made gases. It \ndoes not exist. These are 4,000 scientists. Look at some of the \nscientists we are talking about. They are on this list. It is too many \nto delineate at this time. The bottom line is that the science just \nflat is not there.\n  Ninety percent of the science--in fact, 100 percent of the science I \nhave heard the other side talk about tonight is all science that they \nallege happened, but it was all before 1999. What we are talking about \nare things that have happened since then. There has been a turnaround.\n  Last July 8, James Schlesinger--we all remember him; he certainly is \nno Republican--the Energy Secretary to former President Carter, said:\n\n       There is an idea among the public that the science is \n     settled. That remains far from the truth.\n\n  He goes on to talk about the fact that the science is not sound \nbehind the myth, the hoax of global warming.\n  It is important to realize that the IPCC, which is the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, came from the United Nations \nwith the idea that they are making the recommendations. The lead \nscientist behind that was a scientist named Dr. Michael Mann.\n  What we have done here is talk about what has happened in terms of \nthe science that has come from this recent 2003 science, as opposed to \nwhat came under Michael Mann or the the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change. One is the detail, less hemispheric, and the \ninformation that they used, the age of the data. Under Michael Mann it \nwas older, 1999 or before. The newer is after the IPCC. This is all new \nstuff. I will submit this for the Record because it is all very self-\nexplanatory.\n  Several times reference was made by the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut to MIT and what MIT is saying to us. I would like to quote \nDr. Richard Lindzen, an MIT scientist and a member of the National \nAcademy of Sciences. Both of these--MIT and National Academy of \nSciences--were used to fortify the case that this hoax called \ngreenhouse gas is a reality. This is what Dr. Rich Lindzen said. He has \nspecialized in the climate issue for over 30 years. He told the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, the committee I chair:\n\n       There is a definite disconnect between Kyoto and science. \n     Should a catastrophic scenario prove correct, Kyoto would not \n     prevent it.\n\n  These are new discussions that are coming from scientists whose \ncredentials cannot be questioned. Again, it is MIT science--we heard \nthat a few minutes ago--and the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Dr. David Legates is director of the Center for Climatic Research at \nthe University of Delaware. This is going back to Michael Mann, the guy \nwho is the scientist behind the IPCC, all this stuff that we have been \nhearing. Dr. Legates said:\n\n       Although [Mann's work] is now widely used as proof of \n     anthropogenic global warming, we've become concerned that \n     such an analysis is in direct contradiction to most of the \n     research and written histories available. Our paper shows \n     this contradiction and argues that the results of Mann . . . \n     are out of step with the preponderance of the evidence.\n\n  Preponderance of the evidence, we keep hearing the other side say the \nscience there. No one is going to question it. We are all questioning \nit.\n  This is from a publication called ``Energy and Environment,'' and \nthis was November 15, last week. It starts talking about the flaws in \nthe logic that were used by the Mann study. The flaws all come out. I \nwill show the greatest flaw of all.\n  Let me hold this piece of paper up to this side. This is what Dr. \nMann has been talking about. He referred to the famous hockey stick. \nHere is the hockey stick. The shaft goes along here and all of a sudden \nthat is the hockey stick part. That is supposed to be where it is \ngetting so warm. What he failed to do was to go back to the 1400s. If \nyou look at this, the Earth was much warmer, the temperatures were much \nwarmer back then than they are today by a long ways. So it is just \nleaving out these little convenient things that causes the truth to be \ndistorted.\n  I think this is probably the most important chart. It shows you what \nthe other side does. They will cover up the part that disclaims \neverything they are saying and come out and use it as evidence to \npromote it. I am saying that the temperatures on the Earth's surface \nwere higher in the 1400s than they are today.\n  One of the most recent things that came out just in March was the \nHarvard Smithsonian study. This was the most far-reaching study ever \nmade on climate change. It examined the results of more than 240 peer-\nreviewed papers published by thousands of researchers over the past \nfour decades. The study covers a multitude of geophysical and \nbiological climate indicators. They came to the conclusion that climate \nchange is not real, that the science is not accurate. We will be coming \nback to that from time to time, probably tomorrow also.\n  This is the range of climate proxies that were used to come up with \nthe conclusions of the Harvard Smithsonian study. If you read them all, \nit starts with borehole data, cultural data, glacier advance and \nretreats, geomorphology, all these things were used. Primarily what was \nused by Dr. Mann were the tree rings. And this covers every known type \nof a proxy that could be used. All of this was in the Harvard \nSmithsonian study.\n  So I think if you go back one more time to the chart that we had up \nhere that shows how they are misrepresenting the data, if you stop and \nthink about it, just use logic on things that we know. What is \nincontrovertible? What do we know right now that no one can question? \nWhat we know is that there was a medieval warming period. That period \nwas around from 800 A.D. to about 1300. Then there was the little ice \nage that came along. The little ice age went from 1300 to 1900. Then we \nwent into another warming period that endured from 1900 until 1940.\n  Something significant happened in 1940. In 1940, we started going \ninto another cooling period. But wait a minute. The 1940s was the \ndecade when the surge came in CO2 emissions. That was during \nthe time when more people were driving, and it happened right after the \nwar. So we had the greatest increase in releases of CO2 \nduring that time, an 80-percent increase.\n  What did that do? Did that cause warming? It did not. It precipitated \na cooling period that endured through the 1970s. I think if you look at \nthat, I don't know how anyone can say that the science is at all \nfavoring--and certainly not recent science--the concept, I call it a \nhoax, of global warming.\n  Since I gave a speech on the floor when I used these charts, which I \nmay not have time to do tonight, there have been a lot of things that \nhave come out. The University of Colorado researched the Arctic Circle \ninformation. To do that, they actually went down beneath the snowpack \nin the Colorado Rockies, and the scientists discovered fungi emitting \nlarge quantities of carbon dioxide in methane. Of course, this is \ntotally unrelated to manmade emissions. That is not man-made. They are \ntalking about man-made emissions. That is something that was there that \nwas never considered until it was discovered about a month ago. They \nsaid in an article in the Washington Post, quoting the scientist:\n\n       Indeed, scientists said, if other regions of the world have \n     similar fungal communities thriving under the winter snows, \n     as seems likely, climatologists will have to revise their \n     models of global warming to accommodate fungi surprisingly \n     massive role in the winter production of greenhouse gases, \n     such as carbon dioxide.\n\n  It went on to say--these are the scientists now, after this discovery \njust a month ago:\n\n       The global warming models can no longer ignore fungi in \n     snowy regions and seasons as they had, scientists said, \n     especially because about 40 percent of the landmass is \n     covered with snow for at least part of the year.\n\n  We will revisit this issue, but there is no question that the science \nrefutes everything the alarmists we have heard about have been trying \nto promote. I think something that would be more meaningful to the \nMembers of this body would be, so what, there is. There is a preacher \nnamed Lon Solomon. On the rare occasions I am here on Sunday, I will go \nout to the McLean Bible Church. Right in the middle of his sermon he \nsays: So what.\n  We have gone through all this, the science is flawed, it doesn't \nexist. So what. What is the big deal? The big deal is the economic harm \nthat would\n\n[[Page S13506]]\n\ncome to this country. Let's examine it for a moment.\n  Later on I will go over all of the letters, but here is what the \nteamsters, boilermakers, electrical workers, and others wrote me in a \nletter on September 9--this past September 9. This is not in 1999. They \nwrite:\n\n       Mandatory reduction requirements for carbon dioxide and \n     other greenhouse gases would create much higher energy prices \n     for consumers and put the economic recovery at risk, while \n     providing little or no tangible benefit for the global \n     environment. We, therefore, urge you to vote against S. 139, \n     the Climate Stewardship Act.\n\n  CBO, the Congressional Budget Office--we depend on them for scoring, \nfor coming up with numbers we use to make economic decisions in this \nbody. They said it best:\n\n       The price increases resulting from a carbon cap would be \n     regressive. That is, they would place a relatively greater \n     burden on lower income households than on higher income \n     households.\n\n  A minute ago we heard Senator Voinovich from Ohio. During one of our \ncommittee hearings, a guy named Tom Mullen, who is the president of \nCatholic Charities, testified before our committee and said:\n\n       The overall impact on the economy in northeast Ohio would \n     be overwhelming, and the needs that we address at Catholic \n     Charities in Ohio with the elderly and poor would be well \n     beyond our capacity and that of our current partners in \n     government and the private sector.\n\n  You heard about the harassment he has been subjected to because he \ncares--sincerely, genuinely cares--about these older people.\n  What about minorities? According to a study by the National Black \nChamber of Commerce and the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, \nif the United States ratifies Kyoto or passes domestic climate \npolicies--that is what we are talking about, effectively implementing \nthe treaty; that is their goal--the result would ``disproportionately \nharm America's minority communities, and place the economic advancement \nof millions of U.S. Blacks and Hispanics at risk.''\n\n  That was the Center for Energy and Economic Development doing a study \nfor the Black Chamber of Commerce and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n  It gets down to being more specific. We find out from this study that \nthe Kyoto issue we are talking about right now would cost 511,000 jobs \nby Hispanic workers and 864,000 jobs held by black workers. Poverty \nrates for minority families will increase dramatically, and because \nKyoto will bring about higher energy prices, many minority businesses \nwould be lost.\n  Here is a chart that shows the unemployment rate this study revealed. \nThis study was sanctioned by the Black and Hispanic Chambers of \nCommerce because of their concern. Keep in mind all these things will \nhappen to them, and yet there is no science or logic behind those \ndecisions.\n  This information came from Pennsylvania State University. They did a \nstudy. In this study, they break it down by State as to how many jobs \nare going to be lost. I will point out a couple of States.\n  Illinois would lose, if we were to pass S. 139, 159,000 jobs. I hope \nthe Senators from Illinois are watching right now because 159,000 jobs \nis not what they would want. Ironically, in Indiana, they would lose \n194,000 jobs. In Michigan--and that is a big auto State--they would \nlose 133,000 jobs. They tell you we are going to carve out a special \ndeal for the autos. Look, this is the nose-under-the-tent concept. They \nnow say if we adopt this, our policy is the science is real and global \nwarming, in fact, exists.\n  In Pennsylvania--and I am sure the Pennsylvania Senators are very \nsensitive to this--they would lose, if we pass this bill, 178,000 jobs. \nIn the State of West Virginia, it will be 126,000 jobs; in Wisconsin, \n113,000 jobs; for the interest of the Senator presiding, over 100,000 \njobs in the State of Minnesota.\n  Something was stated by the Senator from Connecticut concerning \nfarms. He said we are going to carve out farmers and agriculture, that \nnothing is going to happen there. Standard & Poor's Data Resource \nInternational did a study--again, a very recent study. They talked \nabout what is going to happen.\n  Let me share with my colleagues what will happen to the agricultural \nfamilies in America, according to Standard & Poor's. You can discredit \nStandard & Poor's, but I don't think you will get by with it. They are \nlegitimate.\n  Fewer small family farms: Higher energy costs, together with the \nreduced domestic and export demand, would lead to a severe decline in \nagricultural investment and a sharp increase in farm consolidations. \nThe number of small farms likely would decline much more rapidly than \nunder business-as-usual conditions.\n  Higher production costs: Production costs would increase by up to $16 \nbillion, an increase of almost 9 percent, and would be difficult for \nagriculture to pass on to the consumers. These higher production costs \ninclude a $13 billion increase in manufactured input--that is fuel, \nfertilizer, and chemicals--expenditures, and $1.6 billion increase in \nfarm origin.\n  Lower demand for agricultural products: Weaker demand for \nagricultural products results both from the 1.6 percent decline in GDP \nand 2.4 percent decrease in consumers' disposable income. It goes on \nand on.\n  Higher food program costs: If you are not sensitive to the farmer, \nyou ought to be sensitive to the people who have to eat in this \ncountry. For example, USDA spends more than $39 billion for six food \nassistance programs, including the Food Stamp Program--there are a lot \nof people interested in that program--and child nutrition programs. We \ntalk about that every day.\n  For these programs alone, emission controls from the protocol would \nadd 500,000 persons to the food stamp rolls and increase program costs \nup to 5 percent annually.\n  Again, this is not Senator Jim Inhofe talking. I am not qualified to \nmake these assessments. This is a study made by a Standard & Poor's \nresearch group.\n  Getting back to the MIT joint program, since they have been used \nquite a bit, the MIT Joint Program on Science and Policy of Global \nChange, the average crop yield is 30 percent higher in a \nCO2-enhanced world.\n  That is what the Senator from Utah was talking about.\n  I inquire from the Chair as to our remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes and thirty seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I reserve the remainder of my time. I am anxious to hear \nfrom the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, devastating fires across California fueled \nby unusual drought conditions have already claimed the lives of 18 \npeople, destroyed nearly 2,000 homes, consumed nearly 600,000 acres \nroughly the size of Rhode Island, and caused over $2 billion in \ndamages. Glaciers in Glacier National Park have dwindled from 150 more \nthan a century ago to about 35 today. Some scientists estimate that the \npark will have no glaciers in 30 years. An ice-dammed lake drained \nrecently when the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, which a century ago rimmed the \nentire northern coast of Ellesmere Island, broke up along the coast of \nnortheast Canada. NASA has confirmed that part of the Arctic Ocean that \nremains frozen year-round has been shrinking at a rate of 10 percent \nper decade since 1980.\n  We can talk about the impact of the Kyoto Treaty, as Senator Inhofe \njust did. I call the attention of my colleagues to this picture. Here \nis the Arctic Sea ice boundary in 1979. There it is today. I am sure \nthat that will be natural causes and have nothing to do with man-made \nactivity, human activities, but the fact is, as the Senator from New \nYork showed, Kilimanjaro is now without snow.\n  At a conference in Iceland in August, scientists told senior \ngovernment officials that the Arctic is heating up fast, disclosing \ndisturbing findings from a massive study of polar climate change. Dr. \nRobert Corell, who heads the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment team, \nsaid: If you want to see what will be happening in the rest of the \nworld 25 years from now, just look at what is happening in the Arctic.\n  Look at what is happening in the Arctic. The destruction of 70 \npercent of heat-sensitive coral reefs due to increases in water \ntemperatures places reef fisheries in jeopardy, increases coastal \ndamages from hurricanes, and hurts local economies supported by \ntourism.\n\n[[Page S13507]]\n\n  Researchers at the University of Texas, Wesleyan University and \nStanford University earlier this year reported in the journal Nature \nthat global warming is forcing species around the world, from \nCalifornia starfish to Alpine herbs, to move into new ranges or alter \nhabits that could disrupt ecosystems.\n  The end result of these changes could be substantial ecological \ndisruption, local losses in wildlife, and even extinction of certain \nspecies.\n  From an article in the July 2003 Journal of Hydrology: The winters in \nNew England are getting shorter. According to U.S. Geological Survey \nscientists, northern New England winters have receded by 1 or 2 weeks \nin length over the last 30 years.\n  The list of what is happening goes on and on.\n  The chair of the Climate Research Committee of the National Academy \nof Sciences stated very clearly during an October 1, 2003, hearing \nbefore the Commerce Committee: The planet has a fever, and it is time \nto be taking action.\n  I caution my colleague from Oklahoma about statements that he \nattributes to certain members of the scientific community. \nSpecifically, I am referring to two scientists that he referred to \nbefore, Dr. Wigley and Dr. Schneider. Dr. Wigley has written to \nSenators Frist and Daschle about the misrepresentation of his work by \nSenator Inhofe. He writes a long letter: Senator Inhofe urges that \nCongress should put stock in scientists who rely on the most objective \nscientific data. He characterizes me as someone whose credentials \ncannot be trusted.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. May I interrupt for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, but not to take my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do not believe I mentioned Dr. Wigley in my remarks. It \nmust have been somebody else.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Pardon me?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do not believe I mentioned Dr. Wigley in my remarks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Dr. Wigley was mentioned by the Senator in his statement \non the floor.\n  He goes through several misrepresentations. Perhaps the most serious \none, and this is a quote from his letter: the third representation made \nby Senator Inhofe concerns the observed record of global mean \ntemperature changes over the past 100 years. This data show a warming \nto about 1940, little change from 1940 to the mid-1970s, and then \nfurther warming. Senator Inhofe implies that these changes are \ninconsistent with the global warming hypothesis and with climate \nmodels. This is categorically incorrect. In order to understand these \nobserved changes, it is necessary to consider all likely causal \nfactors, both human-induced and natural. Human-induced factors include \nthe warming effects of greenhouse gases and the cooling effects of \nsulfate aerosols. Natural factors include changes in the output of the \nsun, effects of explosive volcanic eruptions like Mount Pinatubo in \n1991. When all these factors are considered, models give an expected \npattern of 20th century temperature changes that is in remarkable \nagreement with the observations, and the models clearly show the three \nphases as noted above, in particular the leveling off, the warming \ntrend over 1940 to 1975, turns out to be explained largely by the \ncooling effects of sulfate aerosols, temporarily offsetting the warming \ndue to increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, something which \nwas first pointed out in the paper of mine published in Nature in 1989, \nwhich has been clearly stated in a subsequent IPCC report. This \nremarkable agreement shows quite clearly that human factors have been \nthe dominant cause of global scale climate change over the past 50 \nyears, contrary to the assertion by Senator Inhofe that all observed \nchanges are merely manifestations of natural viability.\n  For his part, Dr. Schneider had the following to say about Senator \nInhofe's statement: It is misrepresenting my views to characterize them \nas even implying that IPCC is exaggerated or failed to describe the \nstate of the science fairly at the time the assessment reports were \ncompleted in the year 2000.\n  So Dr. Wigley and Dr. Schneider take some exception to how their \nviews were characterized on the floor of the Senate.\n  I want to point out again that the 17,000, or whoever they were, \nscientists or those who claimed to be scientists--and there are some \ninteresting signatures to that--were in opposition to the United States \nsigning the Kyoto Treaty.\n  I know that my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, would like to \nsay a few words, but I again want to read a letter from 1,010 \npreeminent scientists who write:\n\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: Two years have elapsed \n     since the publication of the reports by the Intergovernmental \n     Panel on Climate Change and the National Research Council on \n     the state of the science of climate change and its impacts on \n     the United States and the rest of the world. As scientists \n     engaged in research on these subjects, we are writing to \n     confirm that the main findings of these documents continue to \n     represent the consensus opinion of the scientific community. \n     Indeed, these findings have been reinforced rather than \n     weakened by research reported since the documents were \n     released. In brief--\n\n  And he goes through a number of aspects of it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The State of Climate Science: July 2003--A Letter From U.S. Scientists\n\n                                                    July 29, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: Two years have elapsed \n     since the publication of the most recent reports by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the \n     National Research Council (NRC) on the state of the science \n     of climate change and its impacts on the United States and \n     the rest of the world. As scientists engaged in research on \n     these subjects, we are writing to confirm that the main \n     findings of these documents continue to represent the \n     consensus opinion of the scientific community. Indeed, these \n     findings have been reinforced rather than weakened by \n     research reported since the documents were released.\n       In brief, the findings are that:\n       (1) Anthropogenic climate change, driven by emissions of \n     greenhouse gases, is already underway and likely responsible \n     for most of the observed warming over the last 50 years--the \n     largest warming that has occurred in the Northern Hemisphere \n     during at least the past 1,000 years;\n       (2) Over the course of this century the Earth is expected \n     to warm an additional 2.5 to 10.5 deg.F, depending on future \n     emissions levels and on the climate sensitivity--a sustained \n     global rate of change exceeding any in the last 10,000 years;\n       (3) Temperature increases in most areas of the United \n     States are expected to be considerably higher than these \n     global means because of our nation's northerly location and \n     large average distance from the oceans;\n       (4) Even under mid-range emissions assumptions, the \n     projected warming could cause substantial impacts in \n     different regions of the U.S., including an increased \n     likelihood of heavy and extreme precipitation events, \n     exacerbated drought, and sea level rise;\n       (5) Almost all plausible emissions scenarios result in \n     projected temperatures that continue to increase well beyond \n     the end of this century; and,\n       (6) Due to the long lifetimes of greenhouse gases in the \n     atmosphere, the longer emissions increase, the faster they \n     will ultimately have to be decreased in order to avoid \n     dangerous interference with the climate system.\n       Evidence that climate change is already underway includes \n     the instrumental record, which shows a surface temperature \n     rise of approximately 1 deg.F over the 20th century, the \n     accelerated sea level rise during that century relative to \n     the last few thousand years, global retreat of mountain \n     glaciers, reduction in snow cover extent, earlier thawing of \n     lake and river ice, the increase in upper air water vapor \n     over most regions in the past several decades, and the \n     0.09 deg.F warming of the world's deep oceans since the \n     1950's.\n       Evidence that the warmth of the Northern Hemisphere during \n     the second half of the last century was unprecedented in the \n     last 1000 years comes from three major reconstructions of \n     past surface temperatures, which used indicators such as tree \n     rings, corals, ice cores, and lake sediments for years prior \n     to 1860, and instrumental records for the interval between \n     1865 and the present.\n       On the subject of human causation of this warmth, the NRC \n     report stated that, ``The IPCC's conclusion that most of the \n     observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been \n     due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations \n     accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific \n     community on this issue.'' Indeed, computer simulations do \n     not reproduce the late 20th century warmth if they include \n     only natural climate forcing such as emissions from volcanoes \n     and solar activity. The warmth is only captured when the \n     simulations include forcings from human-emitted greenhouse \n     gases present in the atmosphere.\n       In summary, the main conclusions of the IPCC and NRC \n     reports remain robust consensus positions supported by the \n     vast majority of researchers in the fields of climate\n\n[[Page S13508]]\n\n     change and its impacts. The body of research carried out \n     since the reports were issued tends to strengthen their \n     conclusions.\n           Sincerely,\n       Richard J.

The letter further states:\n\n       Over the course of this century, the Earth is expected to \n     warm an additional 2.5 to 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit, depending \n     on future emissions levels and on the climate sensitivity--a \n     sustained global rate of change exceeding any in the last \n     10,000 years.\n       Temperature increases in most areas of the United States \n     are expected to be considerably higher than these global \n     means because of our nation's northerly location and large \n     average distance from the oceans.\n       Almost all plausible emissions scenarios result in \n     projected temperatures that continue to increase well beyond \n     the end of this century, and\n       Due to the long lifetimes of greenhouse gases in the \n     atmosphere--\n\n  Those are the ones that cause no harm in the view of the opponents of \nthis legislation.\n\n       the longer emissions increase, the faster they will \n     ultimately have to be decreased in order to avoid dangerous \n     interference with the climate system.\n       Evidence that climate change is already underway includes \n     the instrumental record, which shows a surface temperature \n     rise of approximately 1 degree Fahrenheit over the 20th \n     century, the accelerated sea level rise during that century \n     relative to the last few thousand years, global retreat of \n     mountain glaciers, reduction in snow cover extent, earlier \n     thawing of lake and river ice, the increase in upper air \n     water vapor over most regions in the past several decades, \n     and the 0.09 Fahrenheit warming of the world's deep oceans \n     since the 1950s.\n       Evidence that the warmth of the Northern Hemisphere during \n     the second half of the last century was unprecedented in the \n     last 1,000 years comes from three major reconstructions of \n     past surface temperatures, which used indicators such as tree \n     rings, corals, ice cores, and lake sediments for years prior \n     to 1860, and instrumental records for the interval between \n     1865 and the present.\n       On the subject of human causation of this warmth, the NRC \n     report stated that the IPCC's conclusion that most of the \n     observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been \n     due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations \n     accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific \n     community on this issue.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut and I are doing is an incredibly \nmodest proposal to try to at least stop the increase of greenhouse \ngases. The overwhelming majority of the scientific community in the \nUnited States of America agrees that climate change is taking place. \nHow serious that is, how significant it is, and how longlasting its \neffect could be the subject of significant debate and discussion.\n  But the fact is that the loss of jobs, which I do not believe is \naccurate, is an issue that needs to be addressed. But what about the \nloss of our environment? What happens if the coral reefs die? What \nhappens if the Arctic icecap melts? What happens if we continue to see \nincreased temperatures?\n  I don't know all the answers as to what happens. I leave that in the \nhands of people who are smarter than I am. But if this picture doesn't \nconcern you, then nothing will. I hope we will be able to pass this \nlegislation as a very modest and a very humble beginning to addressing \nthe issue of climate change.\n  I assure my colleagues of one thing. I will talk about this again \ntomorrow. We will be back on this issue, just as we were back on the \nissue of campaign finance reform. We will be back on it because this is \nnot stopping. This is not stopping. More and more evidence will be \naccumulated and more and more people will become concerned because we \nlove this great country of ours and we love this world and we do not \nwant to see it destroyed.\n  The overwhelming body of scientific evidence indicates we are placing \nour globe in jeopardy and the lives and futures of our children and our \ngrandchildren. We may have lived in a very nice time in the history of \nthe world. Our children and grandchildren may be condemned to a much \nless happy world.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As sponsors of the amendment, traditionally, we speak \nlast.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Would the Chair advise us how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 23 seconds for the proponents of \nthe measure and 3 minutes 23 seconds for the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Since it was called to our attention that tradition would \nhave it you wrap up, you may have the last 23 seconds. Let me say to my \ngood friend from Arizona--and he is a good friend--you can talk about \nthese people. He talked about 1,010 scientists. I talked about over \n20,000 scientists who have agreed with this, looked at this, and said \nit doesn't really exist. I have talked about sources that cannot be \nimpugned by anyone. I am talking about the Smithsonian, Harvard, \nStandard & Poor's, and others.\n  Let me just mention I have saved, I think, the best for last because, \nyes, we are concerned about jobs. That is the biggest concern we have \nin America now. Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates came out \nwith something that delineated exactly the damage that would be done to \nAmerica and that it would cost 2.4 million U.S. jobs. That is why the \nlabor unions are involved in this. It would reduce GDP by 3.2 percent, \nor about $300 billion, which is more than we spend on primary and \nsecondary education combined.\n  They said because of Kyoto, American consumers would face higher \nmedical, food, and housing costs. Tomorrow I will delineate exactly how \nmuch that is. At the same time, an average household of four would see \nits real income drop by $2,700 by 2010, and each year thereafter.\n\n  They go on to say--this is the Wharton School of Economics:\n\n       Under Kyoto, energy and electricity prices would nearly \n     double and gasoline prices would go up an additional 65 cents \n     a gallon.\n\n  I know I am almost out of time. Since it was brought up by the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut about the farmers, let me tell \nyou who is frantically trying to stop us from destroying the American \nfarmer: the International Dairy Foods Association, the National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, National Cattle and Beef Association, \nNational Food Processors Association, National Grange, the National \nOilseed Producers, the American Farm Bureau, the National Corn Growers \nAssociation. The list goes on and on, because these people are very \nmuch concerned about the competitive disadvantage in which they would \nfind themselves.\n  I would also have to say I invite my very good friend from Arizona to \ngo back and search the record of my remarks, the 40-minute talk I made \na few minutes ago. Nowhere in that talk are the two names--what were \nthey, Wigley and Schneider?--who were mentioned during that time. \nTomorrow there will be ample opportunity to address that issue.\n  We are talking about a big deal. You wonder what the motivation is? I \nwill quote a couple of people. If the science is not real, if it \ninflicts all this damage on America, then what could possibly be the \nmotivation? I think maybe Jacques Chirac, the President of France, the \nother day was correct when he said, ``Kyoto is not about climate. It is \nthe first component of an authentic global governance.''\n  Do we really want to have France dictating policies to us?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Oklahoma \nhave an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me just say I will yield the remainder of my time. I \nthink it would be only fair if I get an additional 3 minutes, that they \nget an additional 3 minutes, too, and I don't want that to happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to all \nwho\n\n[[Page S13509]]\n\nhave engaged in this debate tonight. I wish we had more time. This \npress of end-of-year business prevents us from doing so. We will be \nrevisiting this issue. I congratulate the Senator from Oklahoma for an \narticulate presentation of his views. I look forward to our additional \n2 hours together tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new categories \nto current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind \nis unacceptable in our society.\n  I describe a sad and reprehensible display of intimidation that took \nplace in Peoria, IL, on July 6, 2001. That day, Forest Hatley and \nCharles Lambert decided to burn a cross at a home in Macomb, IL, where \nan interracial couple lived. The two men constructed a 7-foot by 3-foot \ncross and doused it with gasoline. Shortly after midnight, the two men \ntransported the cross to the victims' yard, planted it in front of the \nhome, and ignited it. Lambert and Hatley each admitted this action was \ntaken to intimidate the couple because of the male's race and because \nhe was living with a person of another race.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13509-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NOMINATION FOR THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, today the House passed \nimportant legislation that has already unanimously passed the Senate \nand authorizes the construction of six new national veterans \ncemeteries. By passing this bill, we ensure that America's veterans and \ntheir families have access to the burial honors they have earned.\n  The brave men and women who fought for our nation are a population \nthat is aging rapidly. In 2002, America lost 646,264 veterans. \nProjections show that this rate will continue to climb through the year \n2008, when we are expected to lose over 700,000 veterans.\n  By the end of 2004, only 64 of the 124 veterans national cemeteries \nwill be available for both casketed and cremated remains. As cemetery \nservice capabilities decrease, veterans in areas near cemeteries that \nare at capacity will lose access to burial options within a reasonable \ndistance of their homes. In order to ensure that burial options are \nprovided for veterans and their family members, we must develop new \ncemeteries and expand existing cemeteries. This process must start as \nsoon as possible because the construction of a new cemetery takes an \naverage of seven years.\n  In anticipation of veterans' future needs, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs conducted a study that identifies veteran population centers \nnot served by an open national or state veterans cemetery. The report, \n``Future Burial Needs,'' was initially released in May 2002 and has \nbeen recently revised using veteran population estimates from the 2000 \ncensus. The report identified 31 locations as areas where cemeteries \nwould need to be established.\n  Recognizing that it would not be practicable to establish national \ncemeteries in all 31 locations, especially in areas where state \ncemeteries could meet the needs of smaller veterans' populations, VA \nestablished guidelines to determine the neediest areas. In locations \nthat had more than 170,000 veterans residing more than 75 miles from an \nopen state or national cemetery, VA would establish or expand national \ncemeteries. Based on revised population estimates and the new \nguidelines, VA identified 11 locations that required either a new \nnational cemetery or an expansion of an existing national cemetery. Of \nthese locations, five will be served by an already-planned state \ncemetery funded through VA's State Cemetery Grants Program or by \nexpanding existing national cemeteries. This bill directs the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to construct veterans cemeteries six \ncities: Jacksonville, Florida; Sarasota, Florida; Birmingham, Alabama; \nBakersfield, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Columbia, \nSouth Carolina.\n  We cannot afford to wait any longer to fulfill this commitment to our \nnation's veterans. Mr. President, I am\n\n[[Page S13510]]\n\nproud to have sponsored legislation to help provide peace of mind to \nveterans and their families at that difficult time. Now, I look forward \nto working with my colleagues on securing the necessary resources to \nbegin construction of these cemeteries expeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13510-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONFIRMATION OF THOMAS HARDIMAN\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in this sadly historic era of \nunprecedented filibusters of judicial nominees, the truth is an \nunwelcome visitor to those in the minority who seek to deprive \nPresident Bush of his constitutional duty to nominate Article III \njudges. The latest salvo in this increasingly disappointing game is the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee's written statement regarding \nThomas M. Hardiman, who was confirmed by the Senate by unanimous \nconsent on October 22, 2003.\n  The ranking member claims that Mr. Hardiman has ``no judicial \nexperience,'' which is of course not unusual for district court \nnominees. Although Mr. Hardiman has not stood for election as a State \ntrial court judge in Allegheny County, a county where Democrats \noutnumber Republicans by a margin of more than 2-1, Mr. Hardiman is not \nwithout significant adjudicatory experience. In 1995 the Disciplinary \nBoard of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed Mr. Hardiman as a \nHearing Officer to adjudicate cases involving alleged violations of the \nRules of Professional Conduct brought by clients against their lawyers. \nMr. Hardiman served with distinction in this capacity, on a pro bono \nbasis, until his recent confirmation. In addition, Mr. Hardiman has \nadjudicated securities cases as an arbitrator under the auspices of the \nNational Association of Securities Dealers. His work for the \nDisciplinary Board and the NASD has provided Mr. Hardiman with valuable \nexperience ruling on motions, reviewing evidence, assessing the \ncredibility of witnesses, deciding cases, and researching and writing \nopinions. Without doubt, Mr. Hardiman's experiences adjudicating these \ncases has increased his preparedness for the Federal bench.\n  In addition to his quasi-judicial experience, Mr. Hardiman has \nimpeccable academic credentials. As Senator Specter has noted, Mr. \nHardiman graduated with honors from both the University of Notre Dame \nand Georgetown University Law Center. He was appointed to the \nprestigious position of Notes and Comments Editor of the Georgetown Law \nJournal, was a semifinalist in the first-year moot court competition \nand participated on the Criminal Law moot court team. Mr. Hardiman's \nacademic credentials are especially impressive considering the fact \nthat he is the first in his family to attend college and he worked \npart-time during most of is law school career.\n  Consistent with his academic achievements, Thomas Hardiman has had a \ndistinguished career as a litigator and trial lawyer. After working for \nthe prestigious law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Mr. \nHardiman and his wife moved to Pittsburgh in 1992 where he has been a \nrising star in the Pittsburgh legal community. Mr. Hardiman is admitted \nto practice law in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and the District of \nColumbia. He has been a member of the bar of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the \nU.S. Tax Court, as well as the court he now joins. He has handled well \nover 60 trials. For the record--and to address the ranking member's \nsemantic game regarding the number of trials Mr. Hardiman has \nconducted--a ``trial'' is defined as ``A judicial examination and \ndetermination of issues between parties to action . . . whether they be \nissues of law or fact.'' Black's Laws Dictionary, 5th ed. 1979. Among \nthese 60-plus cases are: four cases before the Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit, two cases before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and 11 \ncases before the intermediate appellate courts of Pennsylvania. Mr. \nHardiman has been lead counsel on several jury and non-jury trials in \nFederal and State court, and has tried cases to judgment on a variety \nof dispositive motions at all levels of the Pennsylvania judiciary. Mr. \nHardiman has been lead and associate counsel on several equity matters \nin Federal and State court as well. Finally, he has handled matters \ninvolving real estate, contracts, securities, taxation, Medicare fraud, \ncivil rights, and cases arising under the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, \nseventh, eighth, tenth, eleventh, and fourteenth amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution. In sum, Thomas Hardiman has deep and broad experience as \na trial lawyer which is particularly extraordinary for a man his age.\n  In a letter dated June 18, 2003, Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania \nSupreme Court and lifelong Democrat Ralph J. Cappy wrote of Mr. \nHardiman: ``As a professional, he is outstanding. His competence and \nethics are beyond reproach. It is rare that we see a person of his age \nand experience argue before our Court, often successfully, with a \ncourtesy and depth of knowledge which could serve as a benchmark for \nany who appear before us.'' The Chief Justice continued: ``As an \nindividual, Tom is exemplary. He is extremely bright and knowledgeable \nin the law.'' Another prominent Democrat and Professor of Law at \nDuquesne Law School, Kenneth Gormley, wrote on June 19, 2003: ``Tom is \na first-rate litigator, who is conscientious about every aspect of his \nwork; he is a perfectionist when it comes to representing clients in a \nprofessional manner. As an appellate lawyer, Tom possesses an extremely \nhigh level of sophistication when it comes to analytical reasoning and \nwriting. His written work product is first-rate. An an oral advocate, \nhe is as good as any appellate lawyer I have seen in action in twenty \nyears.'' Professor Gromley said of Mr. Hardiman: ``He is a lawyer of \nsuperior intellect, good judgment, and boundless energy. It is my \nopinion that he will constitute an excellent addition to the federal \nbench here in the Western District of Pennsylvania.''\n\n  Finally, the dean of the Democratic bar in Allegheny County, David \nArmstrong, wrote of Mr. Hardiman on June 17, 2003: ``I have come to \nknow Mr. Hardiman as an excellent lawyer and a person of great \nintellectual curiosity and ability, as well as personal integrity. Mr. \nHardiman's temperament, intellect, character and experience in my \nopinion, would make him an excellent member of the federal bench.'' \nSignificantly, attorney Armstrong came to know Mr. Hardiman through \ntrials they litigated against one another.\n  As the aforementioned facts demonstrate, the ranking member's unfair \ncriticism and inappropriate reliance on the comments of a disgruntled \nlawyer in Pittsburgh who was the chief contributor to the local bar's \nrating of Mr. Hardiman demonstrate beyond doubt that the only \npartisanship involved with Mr. Hardiman's nomination and confirmation \nemanated from those who slandered him in an effort to defeat the \nnomination of a good and able man. It is always more appropriate to \nraise allegations about a nominee at his hearing rather than after his \nconfirmation by the Senate. I am pleased to have the opportunity to set \nthe record straight and I commend the Senate for its confirmation of \nThomas Hardiman who will serve the people of Pennsylvania well as a \nFederal judge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13510-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13510-S13511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO THE LATE EARL GOODWIN, FORMER ALABAMA STATE SENATOR\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to a dear friend and \nAlabama icon, Mr. Earl Goodwin. Earl passed away on Friday, October 24, \n2003 at the age of 93. He and I and our families have been close \nfriends for nearly 40 years, and his death is a great loss for the \nState of Alabama.\n  Earl was a soldier in the United States Armed Forces, fighting on the \nbeaches of Normandy. He made multiple trips back to England to pick up \nmore groups of troops bringing them over to France. He completed these \nmissions in aircraft that were unsafe because of their frequent crash \nlandings. Earl was a true war hero, who put love of country before \neverything else.\n  After the war, he returned to Alabama and eventually created Bush Hog \nwhich became one of the world's foremost manufacturer of farm \nimplements. Bush Hog employs hundreds of Dallas County residents, and \nhas made great contributions in economic development to the region. \nEarl was a visionary with a smart mind for business. He will certainly \nbe remembered for the tremendous difference he made in Dallas County.\n\n[[Page S13511]]\n\n  Throughout his time in business, Earl was active in the community and \npolitically astute. A lifelong Democrat, he became a prominent member \nof the Alabama State Senate, worked for Governor George Wallace, worked \nto elect Governor Don Siegelman, and served as a National Democratic \nCommitteeman.\n  Senator Goodwin is an example of the American success story. Born \ninto poverty, Earl took adversity and challenged it in every way \npossible. He was a war hero, a successful businessman, a husband of 61 \nyears, and a father and grandfather.\n  Earl Goodwin will be missed by all those who knew him, and I hope \nthis tribute exemplifies, in a small way, the kind of man that he was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13511-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          JOSEPH W. McCRACKEN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Madame President, I rise today to acknowledge the \npassing of Joseph W. McCracken on October 26, 2003.\n  For over four decades Mr. McCracken represented the forest products \nindustry in Oregon and other western States, as the executive vice \nPresident of The Western Forest Industries Association. Mr. McCracken \nrepresented a sector of the industry that I hold in particularly high \nesteem--a sector comprised of small, family owned sawmills and plywood \nplants.\n  These are the mills that traditionally depended on our Federal forest \nlands for their supply of timber. These are the mills that are located \nin small rural communities where they provide the backbone of the local \neconomy.\n  During his years of service to his industry, Joe McCracken was a \nfixture in his town and served as an advisor and mentor to many of our \npredecessors in this body. Warren Magnusen, Scoop Jackson, Mark \nHatfield, Bob Packwood, Frank Church, Jim McClure, Jim Melcher, and \nother stalwarts of our western Senate delegation looked to Joe for \ncounsel and advice on public land issues affecting his constituents.\n  He represented them with a passion and commitment that was exemplary. \nJoe McCracken was a visionary and was responsible for creating and \ninfluencing countless pieces of legislation and regulations that \nbenefitted his industry, the people that work in it and the communities \nthat depend on it.\n  The Small Business Set Aside Program, as just one example, assured \nsmall, family-owned mills a fair share of the Federal timber sold from \nour national forests and lands managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n  Joe McCracken was a pioneer in crafting the policies and regulations \naffecting the Oregon and California Railroad lands in western Oregon, \ntoday known as the ``O'' lands. He did this both as a professional \nstaff person for the Department of the Interior and as an advocate for \nhis trade association.\n  Under Joe McCracken's representation, the small, family owned mills \nthroughout the west prospered. Many of them are under second and even \nthird generation management. Unfortunately, many of them no longer \nexist.\n  After Joe's retirement in the early 90's, a sea change in Federal \npolicies regulating the management of public forests unfolded to the \npoint that very little timber is being provided from these forest lands \nand many of the mills have closed.\n  Unfortunately, these were the mills Mr. McCracken fought so hard to \npreserve. Those that have survived owe their existence largely to Joe \nMcCracken.\n  Joe was born in Dillon, MT in 1924. He served his country as a \nLieutenant in the United States Marines. He attended Princeton \nUniversity where he earned a masters degree in political science.\n  He had a distinguished career with the Department of Interior and, \nspecifically, the Bureau of Land Management prior to taking the \nleadership position with the Western Forest Industries Association.\n  Joe McCracken was a unique individual who left a profound imprint on \nthe growth and evolution of public forest policy and the industry that \nis so closely dependent on public forest lands. His contributions to \nthis body in assisting us in the thoughtful debate and deliberation of \nthese important matters are worthy of our formal recognition.\n  I extend my heartfelt sympathy to Joe McCracken's wife Janet and his \ntwo children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13511-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORKPLACE LEARNING CONNECTION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the middle of the last decade, a \ngroup of business and education leaders in Cedar Rapids, IA convened a \nstakeholder group to discuss community concerns. This group identified \nthe need for a highly skilled and well-educated workforce as a top \npriority.\n  The fact that this group identified the need to improve workforce \ndevelopment is not news. Nor is the problem they identified unique or \nisolated to eastern Iowa. What is news and what is unique is the \nresponse.\n  In 1998, area employers, educational institutions and community \norganizations partnered with Kirkwood Community College and Grant Wood \nArea Education Agency to create the Workplace Learning Connection to \nfacilitate work-based learning for area students. This project is a \nwinner for everyone involved. Teachers and students get more \ninformation about local career opportunities and the skills needed for \nthose careers. Students get experience in relevant, work-based learning \nactivities. Employers get workers with the skills that match the jobs \nthey have.\n  The Workplace Learning Connection has been recognized as one of the \n11 best Tech Prep programs in the Nation, is one of the top 25 school-\nto-work programs in the country and has been cited in national \npublications as an exemplary program. Over the past 5 years, TWLC has \nworked with over 700 employers to organize over 8,000 job shadow \nexperiences and 750 internships; provided professional development \nactivities for teachers impacting thousands of students in 35 area \nschool districts in 7 counties; and facilitated hundreds of business \ntours and classroom speakers.\n  The Workplace Learning Connection has been an unqualified success and \nthe community is celebrating the fifth anniversary of this project on \nOctober 30, 2003. In commemoration of this event, I wanted to bring \nthis organization to the attention of the Senate and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13511-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MARY ALICE ZETTEL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

It \nhas been said when entering Holy Trinity Parish School you will hear \nMs. Zettel's laughter and happiness throughout its hallways. Ms. Zettel \nsets an example of excellence for the rest of the faculty, and the \nfaculty follows that example, and she inspires her students to achieve \nacademically and contribute to the community.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in thanking Mary Alice \nZettel for her dedication and commitment to the education of America's \nfuture. In order for our society to continue to advance in the right \ndirection, we must have principals like Mary Alice Zettel in our \nschools and communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13511-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13511-S13512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RONALD W. BARTON\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to note before the \nSenate a great professional honor bestowed recently on my constituent, \nRonald W. Barton of Arlington: the Chairman's Medal of the Defense \nNuclear Facilities Safety Board.\n\n[[Page S13512]]\n\n  The Safety Board, the Senators will recall, was established by \nstatute in 1988 for the purpose of providing the highest quality of \ntechnical oversight of the safe operations of the Nation's nuclear \nweapons complex--dozens of plants with very high risk radioactive \nmaterial. To accomplish this very difficult task, the Safety Board has \nto attract and train the very best technical talent in the nuclear \narea. Chairman Conway's citation accompanying the award to Mr. Barton \nsays in part:\n\n       Mr. Barton joined the Board in 1994, bringing with him more \n     than 25 years of project management and engineering \n     experience in the design, construction, and operation of \n     nuclear reactors for commercial facilities. He became an \n     indispensable leader for the Board's technical staff, and was \n     key to the development of more than half a dozen technical \n     reports, which continue to have an impact on operations in \n     the defense nuclear complex today.\n\n  I have examined Mr. Barton's career, and I certainly agree with \nChairman Conway. Mr. Barton not only brought his own expertise to the \nboard, but he trained and developed a generation of young engineers to \ncontribute to the admirable technical performance of the safety board, \nwhere a technical staff of about 60 oversees the safe operation of a \ncomplex of over 100,000 workers with a budget of over $16 billion. This \ntechnical staff is superb, and Ron Barton helped build it, and then led \nit by example.\n  Now Ron must retire, much too early, because of his leukemia. We wish \nhe were able to continue to serve, but we are grateful for the \ncontributions he made to safety in the nuclear complex. For instance, \nRon was the expert lead on at least six very complex and thorough \ntechnical studies, on such diverse areas as: DOE emergency management \ncapabilities, confinement ventilation systems, fire protection, \ncriticality safety, and documented safety analysis. This is an \nextraordinary list of achievements; these reports still guide the \nDepartment of Energy operations of these complex, hazardous facilities. \nWe should be grateful to Ron for these contributions.\n  Ron Barton is the best of the best, and the Nation will miss his \ncontributions. We wish him good health and a happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13512-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NETDAY STUDENT VOICES' SPEAK UP DAY ON OCTOBER 29\n\n Ms. STABENOW.

NetDay will \nsummarize the student ``Speak Up Day'' comments into a written report \nthat will be submitted for the National Education Technology Plan and \nwill be available online for public discussion. This report will also \nbe a call to action for national, State, and local education leaders to \nrecognize the importance of student input in discussions about how \nschools and instruction impact their educational experiences.\n  I think we can all agree that using technology in schools has become \na necessity. With the expansion and prevalence of the Internet in our \nsociety, it is critical that we teach our children how to use \ncomputers, the Internet, and the various other forms of interactive \ntechnology that exist today. Yet beyond the necessity of `learning' \ntechnology, it is important that educators and communities understand \nthat so many of our youth today are already `one' with technology. The \nchallenge lies in understanding how to connect this technological know-\nhow with classroom instruction so that all our children have the best \neducational experience possible to prepare them for the future. ``Speak \nUp Day'' is a real life lesson on the impact of technology in the \nclassroom, a forum for students to be civically engaged, and an outlet \nfor our Nation's youth to express their empowerment when technology is \npaired with education.\n  Since October 1, over 1,000 schools from all 50 States, the District \nof Columbia, and over 25 Department of Defense schools have \npreregistered for NetDay's ``Speak Up Day'' initiative, with over \n170,000 students planning to participate. I am pleased that schools \nacross the State of Michigan have registered to take part in this \nevent. Over 5,000 students from small rural schools in Middleville, MI, \nto suburban schools in West Bloomfield and high schools in Detroit will \nhave the opportunity to express their thoughts on technology in \nschools. I highly commend NetDay for sponsoring this progressive event, \nand I look forward to hearing the outcome of the discussion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13512-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GARRY NEIL DRUMMOND, SR.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a dear friend, \nGarry Drummond, of Birmingham, AL. Garry Drummond was recently named to \nthe Alabama Business Hall of Fame.\n  Garry is the chairman and chief executive officer of Drummond \nCompany, Inc., one of Alabama's largest coal producers and a major \nnational producer of foundry coke. The company was founded in 1935 by \nMr. Heman Drummond, father of five brothers who are still associated \nwith the company today. The company's executive and administrative \noffices are in Birmingham, with operational headquarters in Jasper, AL.\n  Garry was born in Sipsey, AL, on June 8, 1938. He earned his \nAssociate degree from Walker College in 1959. He received his bachelor \nof science degree in civil engineering from the University of Alabama \nin 1961. He also holds an honorary doctorate of science from the \nUniversity of Alabama, awarded in May 1983, and served on the \nUniversity's board of trustees from 1983 to 2001.\n  Garry has been active in the coal industry and its State, national, \nand international organizations. He is the longest running board member \nof the National Mining Association and is a former member of the board \nof directors of the American Coal Foundation. He is a founder of the \nMining and Reclamation Council of America , MARC, a national trade \norganization representing primarily surface miners that later merged \nwith the National Coal Association in 1987. Garry served as MARC's \nfirst chairman. He is a member of the board of directors and past \nchairman of the Alabama Coal Association and a former member of the \nNational Coal Council, an advisory group appointed by the U.S. \nSecretary of Energy.

A bill to implement antitrust enforcement enhancements and \ncooperation incentives; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague Senator \nDeWine, to introduce the ``Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and \nReform Act of 2003.'' This important bipartisan antitrust reform bill \nwill strengthen the procedures under which antitrust settlements are \nreviewed by the courts, will increase criminal penalties for the most \negregious antitrust violations, and will enhance the Justice \nDepartment's existing leniency program to encourage more antitrust \ncriminal wrongdoers to come forward and thereby significantly assist \nthe Department in detecting and preventing antitrust conspiracies.\n  This bill will accomplish three important goals. First, it will \nstrengthen the review of the Justice Department's civil antitrust \nsettlements under the Tunney Act. The Tunney Act is an important \nstatute, passed nearly thirty years ago, that insures the public \ninterest and consumers are protected when the Justice Department \nsettles civil antitrust cases. The Tunney Act requires that, before \nentering any proposed consent judgment proposed by the Justice \nDepartment, the court must determine that the judgment is in the public \ninterest. The statute also contains strict procedures for the public \ndisclosure of proposed antitrust consent decrees and an opportunity for \npublic comment.\n  The Tunney Act was passed in 1974 in response to concerns that some \nJustice Department settlements were motivated by inappropriate \npolitical pressure and were simply inadequate to restore competition or \nprotect consumers. Congress concluded that review by the district \ncourts to be an essential safeguard to deter the Justice Department \nfrom settling cases without regard for the public interest or the \ninterest of affected consumers. The Tunney Act was enacted to end the \nthen-prevalent practice of district judges ``rubber stamping'' \nantitrust consent decrees.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, many courts--including specifically \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit--have \nmisconstrued the plain meaning of the Tunney Act and have returned to \nthe practice of ``rubber stamp'' review of antitrust settlements. The \ncontrolling precedent in the D.C. Circuit is now that trial courts must \nenter antitrust consent decrees as long as they do not make a ``mockery \nof the judicial power.'' This standard is contrary to the intent of the \nTunney Act and effectively strips the courts of the ability to engage \nin meaningful review of antitrust settlements.\n  Our bill will restore the original intent of the Tunney Act by First, \nproviding that courts are to independently determine that antitrust \nsettlements are in the public interest, second, setting forth a \nspecific list of factors that a court must examine in the course of its \npublic interest review--rather than may consider as the statute is \ncurrently written, and third, requiring the government establish that \nsubstantial evidence and reasoned analysis supports the government's \nbelief that the consent judgment is in the public interest. These \nprovisions will make clear that the court has the authority to conduct \na meaningful review to ensure that antitrust settlements are not \ncontrary to the public interest, or to competition.\n  Second, the bill will enhance criminal penalties for those who \nviolate our antitrust laws. It will increase the maximum corporate \npenalty from $10 to $100 million, will increase the maximum individual \nfine from $350,000 to $1 million, and increase the maximum jail term \nfor individuals who are convicted of criminal antitrust violations from \nthree to ten years. These changes will send the proper message that \ncriminal antitrust violations--crimes such as price fixing and bid \nrigging--committed by business executives in a boardroom are serious \noffense that steal from American consumers just as effectively as does \na street criminal with a gun. We have all learned through unfortunate \nexperience in the last few years at some of our largest at most \nrespected corporations the serious consequences of crime in the \nboardroom, with literally tens of millions of dollars being looted from \nshareholders. These examples of corporate malfeasance teach us that \ncriminal sanctions for white collar crime must be serious enough to \ndeter such misbehavior, and our bill will help ensure our antitrust \npenalties are strong enough to accomplish this mission.\n  Finally, this bill will give the Justice Department significant new \ntools under its antitrust leniency program. The leniency program \nrewards the first member of a criminal antitrust conspiracy to admit \nits crime to the Justice Department by granting the wrongdoer criminal \namnesty. This is an important tool for law enforcement officials to \ndetect and break up cartels that fix prices and limit supply in our \neconomy. This new provision will give the Justice Department the \nability to offer those applying for leniency the additional reward of \nonly facing actual damages in civil suits arising out of the antitrust \nconspiracy, rather than the treble damage liability to which they would \notherwise be subject. This statutory change will remove a significant \ndisincentive to those who would be likely to seek criminal amnesty and \nshould result in a substantial increase in the number of antitrust \nconspiracies being detected.\n  Each of these three reforms are important measures will significantly \nenhance the enforcement of our nation's antitrust laws.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that \nrecognizes the importance of motorsports in America and their century \nof evolution. 100 years ago last March, Ormond-Daytona Beach in Volusia \nCounty, Florida was the venue for the very first annual ``Winter \nAutomobile Racing Meet.'' This race is now recognized as the genesis of \norganized auto racing, giving Ormond-Daytona Beach the title of \n``Birthplace of Speed.'' In the decades that have followed, motorsports \nhave evolved from scattered impromptu events to the second most popular \nsport in the United States.\n\n[[Page S13521]]\n\n  Motorsports is now the fastest growing sport in the country, drawing \nmillions of spectators and tens of millions of television viewers each \nyear. For example, 13 million fans will attend NASCAR races alone in \n2003. Millions of additional fans will attend races sanctioned by the \nAutomobile Racing Club of America, (ACRA); Championship Auto Racing \nTeams (CART); Indy Racing League (IRL); and the Sports Car Club of \nAmerica (SCCA).\n  Tracks are found throughout the country, with over 900 facilities in \nall 50 States hosting races sponsored by sanctioning bodies. These \ntracks make significant contributions to the economies of our \ncommunities, ranging from smaller facilities that host weekly racing \nseries to the largest superspeedways such as Talladega and Daytona.\n  Fans travel hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to attend these \nraces, frequently arriving several days ahead of the headline event. \nOnce at the destination track, they enjoy a variety of interactive \nentertainment attractions, including racing simulators, concerts, \nmemorabilia vendors, hospitality facilities, opportunities to meet \ndrivers, tours of the track and garage areas, etc. Motorsports \nentertainment facilities are amusement parks, dedicated to the themes \nof speed and competition.\n  My resolution today recognizes the importance and growth of \nmotorsports. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, which \nhonors the motorsports entertainment industry for its impressive \ncontributions to the national economy and its ongoing evolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13521-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 254--COMMENDING THE FLORIDA MARLINS BASEBALL TEAM FOR \n                     WINNING THE 2003 WORLD SERIES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Graham of Florida) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (12) because of the longstanding Federal practice of \n     assisting States in creating, protecting, conserving, and \n     restoring areas of significant natural and cultural \n     importance, and the national significance of the Highlands \n     region, the Federal Government should, in partnership with \n     the Highlands States and units of local government in the \n     Highlands region, protect, restore, and preserve the water, \n     forest, agricultural, wildlife, recreational, and cultural \n     resources of the Highlands region.\n\n     SEC.

COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Source of Tradeable Allowances Used.--A covered entity \n     may use a tradeable allowance to meet the requirements of \n     this section without regard to whether the tradeable \n     allowance was allocated to it under subtitle B or acquired \n     from another entity or the Climate Change Credit Corporation \n     established under section 351.\n       (2) Verification by administrator.--At various times during \n     each year, the Administrator shall determine whether each \n     covered entity has met the requirements of this section. In \n     making that determination, the Administrator shall--\n       (A) take into account the tradeable allowances submitted by \n     the covered entity to the Administrator; and\n       (B) retire the serial number assigned to each such \n     tradeable allowance.\n       (b) Alternative Means of Compliance.--For the years after \n     2010, a covered entity may satisfy up to 15 percent of its \n     total allowance submission requirement under this section \n     by--\n       (1) submitting tradeable allowances from another nation's \n     market in greenhouse gas emissions if--\n       (A) the Secretary determines that the other nation's system \n     for trading in greenhouse gas emissions is complete, \n     accurate, and transparent and reviews that determination at \n     least once every 5 years;\n       (B) the other nation has adopted enforceable limits on its \n     greenhouse gas emissions which the tradeable allowances were \n     issued to implement; and\n       (C) the covered entity certifies that the tradeable \n     allowance has been retired unused in the other nation's \n     market;\n       (2) submitting a registered net increase in sequestration, \n     as registered in the database, adjusted, if necessary, to \n     comply with the accounting standards and methods established \n     under section 372;\n       (3) submitting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction (other \n     than a registered net increase in sequestration) that was \n     registered in the database by a person that is not a covered \n     entity; or\n       (4) submitting credits obtained from the Administrator \n     under section 303.\n       (c) Dedicated Program for Sequestration in Agricultural \n     Soils.--If a covered entity chooses to satisfy 15 percent of \n     its total allowance submission requirements under the \n     provisions of subsection (b), it shall satisfy up to 1.5 \n     percent of its total allowance submission requirement by \n     submitting registered net increases in sequestration in \n     agricultural soils, as registered in the database, adjusted, \n     if necessary, to comply with the accounting standards and \n     methods established under section 371.\n\n     SEC. 303. BORROWING AGAINST FUTURE REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall establish a \n     program under which a covered entity may--\n       (1) receive a credit in the current calendar year for \n     anticipated reductions in emissions in a future calendar \n     year; and\n       (2) use the credit in lieu of a tradeable allowance to meet \n     the requirements of this Act for the current calendar year, \n     subject to the limitation imposed by section 302(b).\n\n[[Page S13528]]\n\n       (b) Determination of Tradeable Allowance Credits.--The \n     Administrator may make credits available under subsection (a) \n     only for anticipated reductions in emissions that--\n       (1) are attributable to the realization of capital \n     investments in equipment, the construction, reconstruction, \n     or acquisition of facilities, or the deployment of new \n     technologies--\n       (A) for which the covered entity has executed a binding \n     contract and secured, or applied for, all necessary permits \n     and operating or implementation authority;\n       (B) that will not become operational within the current \n     calendar year; and\n       (C) that will become operational and begin to reduce \n     emissions from the covered entity within 5 years after the \n     year in which the credit is used; and\n       (2) will be realized within 5 years after the year in which \n     the credit is used.\n       (c) Carrying Cost.--If a covered entity uses a credit under \n     this section to meet the requirements of this Act for a \n     calendar year (referred to as the use year), the tradeable \n     allowance requirement for the year from which the credit was \n     taken (referred to as the source year) shall be increased by \n     an amount equal to--\n       (1) 10 percent for each credit borrowed from the source \n     year; multiplied by\n       (2) the number of years beginning after the use year and \n     before the source year.\n       (d) Maximum Borrowing Period.--A credit from a year \n     beginning more than 5 years after the current year may not be \n     used to meet the requirements of this Act for the current \n     year.\n       (e) Failure To Achieve Reductions Generating Credit.--If a \n     covered entity that uses a credit under this section fails to \n     achieve the anticipated reduction for which the credit was \n     granted for the year from which the credit was taken, then--\n       (1) the covered entity's requirements under this Act for \n     that year shall be increased by the amount of the credit, \n     plus the amount determined under subsection (c);\n       (2) any tradeable allowances submitted by the covered \n     entity for that year shall be counted first against the \n     increase in those requirements; and\n       (3) the covered entity may not use credits under this \n     section to meet the increased requirements.\n\n     SEC. 304. OTHER USES OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Tradeable allowances may be sold, \n     exchanged, purchased, retired, or used as provided in this \n     section.\n       (b) Intersector Trading.--Covered entities may purchase or \n     otherwise acquire tradeable allowances from other covered \n     sectors to satisfy the requirements of section 301.\n       (c) Climate Change Credit Organization.--The Climate Change \n     Credit Corporation established under section 351 may sell \n     tradeable allowances allocated to it under section 332(a)(2) \n     to any covered entity or to any investor, broker, or dealer \n     in such tradeable allowances. The Climate Change Credit \n     Corporation shall use all proceeds from such sales in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 352.\n       (d) Banking of Tradeable Allowances.--Notwithstanding the \n     requirements of section 301, a covered entity that has more \n     than a sufficient amount of tradeable allowances to satisfy \n     the requirements of section 301, may refrain from submitting \n     a tradeable allowance to satisfy the requirements in order to \n     sell, exchange, or use the tradeable allowance in the future.\n\n     SEC. 305. EXEMPTION OF SOURCE CATEGORIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator may grant an exemption \n     from the requirements of this Act to a source category if the \n     Administrator determines, after public notice and comment, \n     that it is not feasible to measure or estimate emissions from \n     that source category, until such time as measurement or \n     estimation becomes feasible.\n       (b) Reduction of Limitations.--If the Administrator exempts \n     a source category under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall also reduce the total tradeable allowances under \n     section 331(a)(1) by the amount of greenhouse gas emissions \n     that the exempted source category emitted in calendar year \n     2000, as identified in the 2000 Inventory.\n       (c) Limitation on Exemption.--The Administrator may not \n     grant an exemption under subsection (a) to carbon dioxide \n     produced from fossil fuel.\n\n    Subtitle B--Establishment and Allocation of Tradeable Allowances\n\n     SEC. 331. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall promulgate \n     regulations to establish tradeable allowances, denominated in \n     units of carbon dioxide equivalents, for calendar years \n     beginning after 2009, equal to--\n       (1) 5896 million metric tons, measured in units of carbon \n     dioxide equivalents, reduced by\n       (2) the amount of emissions of greenhouse gases in calendar \n     year 2000 from non-covered entities.\n       (b) Serial Numbers.--The Administrator shall assign a \n     unique serial number to each tradeable allowance established \n     under subsection (a), and shall take such action as may be \n     necessary, to prevent counterfeiting of tradeable allowances.\n       (c) Nature of Tradeable Allowances.--A tradeable allowance \n     is not a property right, and nothing in this title or any \n     other provision of law limits the authority of the United \n     States to terminate or limit a tradeable allowance.\n       (d) Non-Covered Entity.--In this section:\n       (1) In general.--The term ``non-covered entity'' means an \n     entity that--\n       (A) owns or controls a source of greenhouse gas emissions \n     in the electric power, industrial, or commercial sectors of \n     the United States economy (as defined in the Inventory), \n     refines or imports petroleum products for use in \n     transportation, or produces or imports hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride; and\n       (B) is not a covered entity.\n       (2) Exception.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an entity \n     that is a covered entity for any calendar year beginning \n     after 2009 shall not be considered to be a non-covered entity \n     for purposes of subsection (a) only because it emitted, or \n     its products would have emitted, 10,000 metric tons or less \n     of greenhouse gas, measured in units of carbon dioxide \n     equivalents, in the year 2000.\n\n     SEC. 332. DETERMINATION OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall determine--\n       (1) the amount of tradeable allowances to be allocated to \n     each covered sector of that sector's allotments; and\n       (2) the amount of tradeable allowances to be allocated to \n     the Climate Change Credit Corporation established under \n     section 351.\n       (b) Allocation Factors.--In making the determination \n     required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider--\n       (1) the distributive effect of the allocations on household \n     income and net worth of individuals;\n       (2) the impact of the allocations on corporate income, \n     taxes, and asset value;\n       (3) the impact of the allocations on income levels of \n     consumers and on their energy consumption;\n       (4) the effects of the allocations in terms of economic \n     efficiency;\n       (5) the ability of covered entities to pass through \n     compliance costs to their customers;\n       (6) the degree to which the amount of allocations to the \n     covered sectors should decrease over time; and\n       (7) the need to maintain the international competitiveness \n     of United States manufacturing and avoid the additional loss \n     of United States manufacturing jobs.\n       (c) Allocation Recommendations and Implementation.--Before \n     allocating or providing tradeable allowances under subsection \n     (a) and within 24 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary shall submit the determinations under \n     subsection (a) to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation, the Senate Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Science, and the House of Representatives Committee on Energy \n     and Commerce. The Secretary's determinations under paragraph \n     (1), including the allocations and provision of tradeable \n     allowances pursuant to that determination, are deemed to be a \n     major rule (as defined in section 804(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code), and subject to the provisions of chapter 8 of \n     that title.\n\n     SEC. 333. ALLOCATION OF TRADEABLE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning with calendar year 2010 and \n     after taking into account any initial allocations under \n     section 334, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) allocate to each covered sector that sector's \n     allotments determined by the Administrator under section 332 \n     (adjusted for any such initial allocations and the allocation \n     to the Climate Change Credit Corporation established under \n     section 351); and\n       (2) allocate to the Climate Change Credit Corporation \n     established under section 351 the tradeable allowances \n     allocable to that Corporation.\n       (b) Intrasectorial Allotments.--The Administrator shall, by \n     regulation, establish a process for the allocation of \n     tradeable allowances under this section, without cost to \n     covered entities, that will--\n       (1) encourage investments that increase the efficiency of \n     the processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (2) minimize the costs to the government of allocating the \n     tradeable allowances;\n       (3) not penalize a covered entity for emissions reductions \n     made before 2010 and registered with the database; and\n       (4) provide sufficient allocation for new entrants into the \n     sector.\n       (c) Point Source Allocation.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate the tradeable allowances for the electricity \n     generation, industrial, and commercial sectors to the \n     entities owning or controlling the point sources of \n     greenhouse gas emissions within that sector.\n       (d) Hydrofluorocarbons, Perfluorocarbons, and Sulfur \n     Hexafluoride.--The Administrator shall allocate the tradeable \n     allowances for producers or importers of hydrofluorocarbons, \n     perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride to such producers or \n     importers.\n       (e) Special Rule for Allocation Within the Transportation \n     Sector.--The Administrator shall allocate the tradeable \n     allowances for the transportation sector to petroleum \n     refiners or importers that produce or import petroleum \n     products that will be used as fuel for transportation.\n       (f) Allocations to Certain States; Rural Electric \n     Cooperatives.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall make the \n     allocations described in paragraphs (2) and (3) each year at \n     no cost. The\n\n[[Page S13529]]\n\n     allocations shall be offset from the allowances allocated to \n     the Climate Change Credit Corporation.\n       (2) State allocations.--The Administrator shall allocate, \n     for all electric generating units located in a State in which \n     the average heating value of coal consumed by electric \n     generating units in 1999 was less than 7,000 Btu per pound, \n     allowances in an amount equal to the greenhouse gas emissions \n     of the units in 2000, multiplied by 1.3.\n       (3) Rural electric cooperatives.--For each electric \n     generating unit that is owned or operated by a rural electric \n     cooperative and not taken into account for purposes of \n     paragraph (2), the Administrator shall allocate allowances in \n     an amount equal to the greenhouse gas emissions of each such \n     unit in 2000, plus an amount equal to the average emissions \n     growth expected for all such units.\n\n     SEC. 334. ENSURING TARGET ADEQUACY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Commerce for \n     Oceans and Atmosphere shall review the allowances established \n     by section 331 no less frequently than biennially--\n       (1) to re-evaluate the levels established by that \n     subsection, after taking into account the best available \n     science and the most currently available data, and\n       (2) to re-evaluate the environmental and public health \n     impacts of specific concentration levels of greenhouse gases,\n\n     to determine whether the allowances established by subsection \n     (a) continue to be consistent with the objective of the \n     United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change of \n     stabilizing levels of greenhouse gas emissions at a level \n     that will prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with \n     the climate system.\n\n       (b) Review of 2010 Levels.--The Under Secretary shall \n     specifically review in 2008 the level established under \n     section 331(a)(1), and transmit a report on his reviews, \n     together with any recommendations, including legislative \n     recommendations, for modification of the levels, to the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n     the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the \n     House of Representatives Committee on Science, and the House \n     of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\n     SEC. 335. INITIAL ALLOCATIONS FOR EARLY PARTICIPATION AND \n                   ACCELERATED PARTICIPATION.\n\n       Before making any allocations under section 333, the \n     Administrator shall allocate--\n       (1) to any covered entity an amount of tradeable allowances \n     equivalent to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions \n     reductions registered by that covered entity in the national \n     greenhouse gas database if--\n       (A) the covered entity has requested to use the registered \n     reduction in the year of allocation;\n       (B) the reduction was registered prior to 2010; and\n       (C) the Administrator retires the unique serial number \n     assigned to the reduction under section 201(c)(3); and\n       (2) to any covered entity that has entered into an \n     accelerated participation agreement under section 336, such \n     tradeable allowances as the Administrator has determined to \n     be appropriate under that section.\n\n     SEC. 336. BONUS FOR ACCELERATED PARTICIPATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--If a covered entity executes an agreement \n     with the Administrator under which it agrees to reduce its \n     level of greenhouse gas emissions to a level no greater than \n     the level of its greenhouse gas emissions for calendar year \n     1990 by the year 2010, then, for the 6-year period beginning \n     with calendar year 2010, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) provide additional tradeable allowances to that entity \n     when allocating allowances under section 334 in order to \n     recognize the additional emissions reductions that will be \n     required of the covered entity;\n       (2) allow that entity to satisfy 20 percent of its \n     requirements under section 301 by--\n       (A) submitting tradeable allowances from another nation's \n     market in greenhouse gas emissions under the conditions \n     described in section 312(b)(1);\n       (B) submitting a registered net increase in sequestration, \n     as registered in the National Greenhouse Gas Database \n     established under section 201, and as adjusted by the \n     appropriate sequestration discount rate established under \n     section 371; or\n       (C) submitting a greenhouse gas emission reduction (other \n     than a registered net increase in sequestration) that was \n     registered in the National Greenhouse Gas Database by a \n     person that is not a covered entity.\n       (b) Termination.--An entity that executes an agreement \n     described in subsection (a) may terminate the agreement at \n     any time.\n       (c) Failure To Meet Commitment.--If an entity that executes \n     an agreement described in subsection (a) fails to achieve the \n     level of emissions to which it committed by calendar year \n     2010--\n       (1) its requirements under section 301 shall be increased \n     by the amount of any tradeable allowances provided to it \n     under subsection (a)(1); and\n       (2) any tradeable allowances submitted thereafter shall be \n     counted first against the increase in those requirements.\n\n             Subtitle C--Climate Change Credit Corporation\n\n     SEC. 351. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Climate Change Credit Corporation is \n     established as a nonprofit corporation without stock.

SEQUESTRATION ACCOUNTING.\n\n       (a) Sequestration Accounting.--If a covered entity uses a \n     registered net increase in sequestration to satisfy the \n     requirements of section 301 for any year, that covered entity \n     shall submit information to the Administrator every 5 years \n     thereafter sufficient to\n\n[[Page S13530]]\n\n     allow the Administrator to determine, using the methods and \n     standards created under section 204, whether that net \n     increase in sequestration still exists. Unless the \n     Administrator determines that the net increase in \n     sequestration continues to exist, the covered entity shall \n     offset any loss of sequestration by submitting additional \n     tradeable allowances of equivalent amount in the calender \n     year following that determination.\n       (b) Regulations Required.--The Secretary, acting through \n     the Under Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology, \n     in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, the \n     Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator, shall issue \n     regulations establishing the sequestration accounting rules \n     for all classes of sequestration projects.\n       (c) Criteria for Regulations.--In issuing regulations under \n     this section, the Secretary shall use the following criteria:\n       (1) If the range of possible amounts of net increase in \n     sequestration for a particular class of sequestration project \n     is not more than 10 percent of the median of that range, the \n     amount of sequestration awarded shall be equal to the median \n     value of that range.\n       (2) If the range of possible amounts of net increase in \n     sequestration for a particular class of sequestration project \n     is more than 10 percent of the median of that range, the \n     amount of sequestration awarded shall be equal to the fifth \n     percentile of that range.\n       (3) The regulations shall include procedures for accounting \n     for potential leakage from sequestration projects and for \n     ensuring that any registered increase in sequestration is in \n     addition that which would have occurred if this Act had not \n     been enacted.\n       (d) Updates.--The Secretary shall update the sequestration \n     accounting rules for every class of sequestration project at \n     least once every 5 years.\n\n     SEC. 372. PENALTIES.\n\n       Any covered entity that fails to meet the requirements of \n     section 301 for a year shall be liable for a civil penalty, \n     payable to the Administrator, equal to thrice the market \n     value (determined as of the last day of the year at issue) of \n     the tradeable allowances that would be necessary for that \n     covered entity to meet those requirements on the date of the \n     emission that resulted in the violation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2029.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 254 submitted earlier \ntoday by Senators Nelson and Graham of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 254) commending the Florida Marlins \n     baseball team for winning the 2003 World Series.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nFlorida Marlins for their outstanding victory in the 2003 World Series. \nThe Marlins, under the leadership of their Managing General Partner \nJeffrey Loria, General Manager Larry Beinfest and Manager Jack McKeon, \ndefeated the 26-time World Champion New York Yankees to garner their \nsecond World Championship in only their 10th year of existence.\n  With their combination of youthful energy and veteran experience, the \nMarlins were able to defeat the defending National League Champion San \nFrancisco Giants in four games in the divisional series before coming \nback from a three games-to-one deficit to defeat the Chicago Cubs in \nseven games to win the National League Pennant. Led by the enthusiastic \nleadership of veteran catcher Ivan Rodriguez and the pitching of \nbudding superstar Josh Beckett, the Marlins have a bright future ahead \nof them.\n  Floridians from Key West to Pensacola were riveted by the Marlins \ncomeback style and gritty determination as they watched their home team \ndefeat three of baseball's most storied franchises on their way to the \nchampionship. As a silence fell over the boroughs of New York City, a \nparty of historic proportions broke out in my home state as our team \nemerged from the dugout to celebrate its second championship.\n  The Florida Marlins continue to be a source of pride for residents of \nthe Sunshine State and this year's team, so often faced with adversity, \nstood as a fine representative of all that our great state has to \noffer.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to urge passage of \na resolution sponsored by Senator Graham and myself commending the \nFlorida Marlins for winning the 2003 World Series.\n  In their 10th anniversary season the Marlins have once again reached \nthe pinnacle of baseball. They provided us with a magical season many \nin Florida and elsewhere won't soon forget. They started the season \nwith little fanfare and low expectations, and they struggled at first \nwith a losing record. And just when things seemed as if they couldn't \nget any worse, they lost their manager. For many the Marlins' early \nmisfortunes signaled another losing season.\n  But on May 23, the team began a magical run that culminated in a \nWorld Series title over the storied New York Yankees. During this \nremarkable stretch, they compiled the best record in baseball, earned a \nwild-card playoff\n\n[[Page S13533]]\n\nspot, upset the heavily favored San Francisco Giants in the Division \nseries, shocked the Chicago Cubs by rebounding from a three-games-to-\none deficit to win the National League Championship and became the \nfirst opposing team to capture a World Series title in Yankee Stadium \nin 22 years.\n  During their season, and especially the playoffs, the Marlins \nconfidently believed in their abilities and their play made believers \nout of many all along the way. If nothing else, their season \nillustrates for everyone a lesson we all should heed--never give up. We \noffer congratulations to all members of the Florida Marlins \norganization and to their fans in South Florida.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 254) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 254\n\n       Whereas on October 25, 2003, the Florida Marlins defeated \n     the New York Yankees, 2 to 0, in Game 6 of the World Series, \n     to capture their second World Series title in the 11 seasons \n     of the franchise;\n       Whereas the Florida Marlins became the first visiting team \n     to celebrate a World Series championship in Yankee Stadium \n     since the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1981;\n       Whereas under the leadership of manager Jack McKeon, \n     general manager Larry Beinfest, and team owner Jeffrey Loria, \n     the Marlins compiled the best record in baseball since May \n     23, 2003, becoming only the ninth team in Major League \n     Baseball history to rebound from at least 10 games under .500 \n     to reach the playoffs;\n       Whereas each player, manager, coach, trainer, and \n     administrator of the Florida Marlins contributed to a magical \n     turnaround that resulted in the Florida Marlins reaching the \n     pinnacle of the sport, a World Series Championship;\n       Whereas the manager of the Florida Marlins, Jack McKeon, \n     became the oldest manager in Major League Baseball history to \n     win the World Series, and led Florida to the title after \n     joining the team in May of 2003;\n       Whereas Florida Marlins pitcher Josh Beckett was named \n     World Series Most Valuable Player, after pitching a complete \n     game, 5 hit shutout, on 3 days rest in Yankee Stadium during \n     Game 6 of the World Series;\n       Whereas young stars like Miguel Cabrera, Juan Pierre, and \n     Luis Castillo combined with established veterans like Ivan \n     Rodriguez and Jeff Conine to produce an exciting, never-say-\n     die team that won over fans around the country during an \n     unexpected march to the World Series;\n       Whereas the Florida Marlins upset the San Francisco Giants \n     in 4 games to win the Division Series, then stunned the \n     Chicago Cubs by coming back from a 3 games to 1 deficit to \n     win the National League Championship Series in 7 games; and\n       Whereas fans of the Florida Marlins and the South Florida \n     community demonstrated commendable team support and pride: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Florida Marlins for winning the 2003 \n     World Series;\n       (2) recognizes the achievements of the players, coaches, \n     and support staff who were instrumental in securing a second \n     World Series title for the Florida Marlins;\n       (3) commends the support and pride of the fans of the \n     Florida Marlins; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit for \n     appropriate display an enrolled copy of this resolution to--\n       (A) the owner of the Florida Marlins, Jeffrey Loria;\n       (B) the general manager of the Florida Marlins, Larry \n     Beinfest;\n       (C) the manager of the Florida Marlins, Jack McKeon; and\n       (D) each player and coach of the 2003 World Series Champion \n     Florida Marlins baseball team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/29/senate-section/article/S13533-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2003\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
