Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately \nresume consideration of the DC appropriations bill. The managers are \nhere and ready to work. Therefore, we do hope Members will come forward \nwith their amendments during today's session. If a rollcall vote is \nordered on an amendment, we will stack that vote for Monday's session. \nAs I announced last night, there will be no rollcall votes today.\n  Yesterday we made progress on the bill, and I thank the managers for \ntheir efforts in moving the bill forward. I do hope we can finish this \nbill on Monday. I understand there may be further amendments from the \nother side of the aisle, but it is our desire to complete this bill \nearly next week. I do expect the Senate to begin consideration of the \nurgent supplemental request at the earliest possible time next week. \nGiven that schedule, it is imperative that we expedite the DC \nappropriations bill.\n  With regard to next week's schedule, I want to forewarn all Members, \nit will be a very busy week. I anticipate that we will have late \nsessions Tuesday night, Wednesday, Thursday, and possibly Friday. We \nwill have votes throughout that session. Our discussion on the floor \nyesterday reflected in large part the interest in having time to \ndiscuss and debate and amend, if necessary, or offer amendments on the \nsupplemental. Thus, it will require the attention and focus of our \ncolleagues throughout the week.\n  I wanted Senators to begin to plan their schedules with this in mind. \nI do thank all colleagues. I will outline Monday's schedule a bit later \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12027-6", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12027-S12028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The acting Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Before the majority leader leaves the floor, I indicated to \nthe Senator last week that we should have done something else rather \nthan bringing up the DC bill. I don't see the DC bill moving. I don't \nsee us being able to complete it on Monday. I think we have other \nappropriations bills we could move through fairly quickly. With the \nvoucher issue involving the DC bill, it makes it very difficult to slog \nthrough the bill. I know how we have to put a positive note on \neverything--especially you--but I think we will have a lot of trouble \nin completing the DC appropriations bill Monday or any time in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, listening very carefully, I am \ndisappointed. I think we have an opportunity in this body to address a \ntragedy, and that is that there are impoverished children trapped in \ntoday's schools that are not serving them well. We have an opportunity \nto reach out and help those children. We have today to work on it. We \nhave Monday to work on it. But if the other side of the aisle feels we \ncannot\n\n[[Page S12028]]\n\nmake progress on it, I will listen, but I am very disappointed in that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, if I may make a suggestion--Senator \nDeWine can speak for himself--this bill is so important and this \nsubject is so important to so many people, I am wondering if we could \njust be flexible and move the discussion of DC in and out of other \nthings, not stopping anything else that is important or would take \nprecedence, but this issue really deserves full debate. As you know, \nthe hours of Senate debate are not always completely and fully taken. I \noffer for consideration that we have time this morning, we will have \ntime on Monday, and if the leadership wants to move to something else, \nwe could temporarily set this aside and come back to it. There are many \nMembers, at least on our side, who really want some time to speak about \nthis issue. They are most certainly entitled to because it is a very \nimportant issue--not just for the District but for the Nation. I lay \nthat out to my friend and colleague as a suggestion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12028-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we made very good progress yesterday on \nthe District of Columbia bill. We were able to approve a very \nconstructive amendment by my colleague and friend from California. \nSenator Feinstein brought to the floor an amendment that brought about \nmore accountability in regard to the section of the bill having to do \nwith the scholarship provision. We did make very good progress. As the \nmajority leader said, we have the opportunity to keep this bill moving \nforward. We have the opportunity today for Members to come to the floor \nand discuss the bill. We will have the opportunity all day Monday for \nMembers to come to the floor to offer amendments. We are certainly \ngoing to be open for business Monday for Members to come to the Chamber \nand offer amendments.\n  I know my colleague from Illinois was on the floor and talked about \noffering an amendment to strike the scholarship provision. He certainly \nhas the opportunity to do so, and we can have a very rigorous debate. \nWe started that discussion yesterday, and we can continue it. We hope \nwe can get a vote at some point on that issue.\n  My friend and colleague, the ranking member on the committee, has had \nsome suggestions. I assume those will become an amendment at some \npoint. We had a good debate last night, along with our colleague from \nDelaware. They have some ideas that will become a part of an amendment \nat some point, we assume. We can debate that.\n  There is good opportunity for good debate. I encourage my colleagues \nto get those into the form of an amendment, get down here, and let's \ndebate it and move this bill forward.\n  This is a good bill. This is a bill my colleague from Louisiana and I \nhave worked long and hard on.\n  As we discussed yesterday, it is a bill that is focused to a large \nextent on the children of the District of Columbia. It has a provision \nI take a lot of pride in, and I know my colleague takes a lot of pride \nin, and it has to do with foster care. We have heard the horror \nstories, and we have read the excellent series of articles that \nappeared in the Washington Post--very frightening and troubling \narticles that the Post has run over a series of months about the \nhorrible situation in the foster care system in the District of \nColumbia. Children have been neglected and abused; they have not been \ntaken care of.\n  This bill says, for the first time, that the Federal Government and \nthis Senate intend to try to do something about it. Senator Landrieu \nand I held hearings. We brought in experts from across the country, \nbrought in experts from the District of Columbia. We brought everybody \ntogether and said, OK, what is the problem? They told us some of the \nproblems, and we got experts from outside the District who told us of \nsome of the problems as they perceived them. We took that advice and \ncame up with three or four ideas--not our ideas but the experts' \nideas--and we put them together in this bill and provided a significant \namount of money. That is what is in the bill. So we have the Federal \nGovernment taking some responsibility in this area and beginning to \nmove forward.\n  It is our intention with this bill that this will be the first step. \nSenator Landrieu and I have pledged, as long as we have anything to do \nwith this bill--which I imagine will be for the next several years--\nthat we will move forward to try to help these foster care children. So \nthis is something of which Members of this body can be very proud.\n  This bill also continues our efforts to deal with the homeland \nsecurity problems. Since September 11, we have become even more aware \nof the unique security needs of the District of Columbia. We are a \ntarget; we understand that. My colleague in the chair well knows about \nthis, as the chairman of the committee has been very cognizant of this \nand helped us to deal with these problems in the District of Columbia \nas we have worked with the Mayor. This bill continues to try to address \nthese problems.\n  Thirdly, the bill also addressed some of the long-term infrastructure \nproblems of the District of Columbia. These are issues that are not \nvery glitzy or exciting but what we have to deal with in the long-term. \nSo this is a strong bill, a more reasoned bill, a bill within budget, \nbut it is a bill of which we all can be very proud.\n  Let me turn to the fourth item which is, frankly, the only \ncontentious issue in this bill, the scholarship program. I believe it \nis a very well-balanced, well-thought-out section of the bill. It is \nsomething that Senator Feinstein, as we discussed yesterday, has been \nso very helpful in crafting. As I said yesterday, she went so far to \nhelp improve the language. The bill in front of us today, frankly, is a \nbetter bill because of what my colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, has contributed in her suggestions. She came to Senator \nGregg and to me and to the chairman and said she had some suggestions \nthat would improve the constitutionality, allow the Mayor to be much \nmore involved, and would make the system much more accountable so we \ncan measure how well the children are doing, and we incorporated those \nchanges.\n  Then, yesterday, she had an additional amendment that provided for \ntesting being the same for the children who would be in the program as \nchildren not in the program. We adopted that by voice vote yesterday. \nSo she has been a great trigger to this bill, and this scholarship \nprogram will be a lot better because of what she has done.\n\n  As I was saying, it is a very balanced program. It is a program, as \nwe talked about yesterday, that was designed--and I think this is \nsignificant and we need to keep it in mind--not by us but by the Mayor \nof the District of Columbia. If anybody has any doubts about this, they \ncan just go ask the Mayor. The Mayor is the one who designed this \nprogram. The Mayor said: Give me more help with public schools. So we \nsaid, yes--with $13 million more for the public schools.\n  The Mayor said: Give me more help with the charter schools. The Mayor \nhas been working to expand the charter schools. My colleague from \nLouisiana has been very helpful in this regard. She has taken the \ncharter schools on as something in which she has been very much \ninvolved. We have done that with this bill with $13 million more to \nexpand the charter schools. It will allow for the creation of three or \nfour or five more charter schools in the District of Columbia.\n  The third prong the Mayor outlined was this: He said give me some \nhelp to create these new scholarships for children, and they and their \nfamilies will\n\n[[Page S12029]]\n\nhave choice. That is what the bill provides: money for public schools, \nmoney for charter schools, and money for the new scholarships for the \nparents to go out and choose schools--private schools--if that is what \nthey want to do. Again, this is what the bill does: $13 million for \npublic schools, $13 million for charter schools, and $13 million for \nthe choice to go out on these scholarships and choose the private \nschools. It is a well-balanced approach, designed by the Mayor, by the \npeople of the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. President, this is a well-developed bill, a well-designed bill. I \nthink it is something of which we can all be very proud. So I encourage \nmy colleagues to come down to the floor today and debate this bill, and \nthen as we begin this process today and continue the process on Monday, \ncome to the floor on Monday and offer these amendments so that we can \nproceed. We got a great start with the adoption of the Feinstein \namendment yesterday. We now need to move forward and continue the \nprocess. I thank the Chair. I know my colleague from Louisiana wants to \ndiscuss this bill.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to begin by commending, as I have \noften, my colleague from Ohio for his leadership on this issue. It has \nbeen a joy and a privilege to work with him as we have alternated the \nchairmanship of this very important committee for this region and this \nNation and, obviously, for the residents of the District itself. It has \nbeen a real joy to work with him. We have found a tremendous amount of \ncommon ground in the course of these few years, and I think we have \nmade a lot of progress in some of the most complex challenges here in \nthe District. He noted this morning the challenge, still, with the \nfoster care system and its weaknesses, and he outlined how this \ncommittee and this Congress has worked in partnership, very closely, \nwith all the city leaders to recognize the problems, admit them, and \nbegin to put in the resources and the management changes necessary to \nmake that child welfare system much better and, hopefully, a model for \nthe Nation.\n  I am proud to have worked with him, along with other Senators. \nSenator Durbin is one, along with Senator Hutchison from Texas and \nothers, who worked on some initial foundation work on restoring fiscal \ndiscipline, if you will, and fiscal health to the District. That is \nanother accomplishment of which we can be very proud, both on the \nDemocratic and Republican sides.\n  So as my colleague from Ohio has said, there is a lot to be proud of \nin this bill. There is a tremendous amount of progress that has been \nmade, and we will continue to find common ground where we can. But \nthere is one area of this bill where we are struggling to find common \nground, and I am not sure we will be able to because principles are \nvery important in terms of education reform and accountability.\n  I want to start this discussion this morning on that proposal by \nsharing an article that I read in the paper this morning on a \ncompletely different subject, but I think it makes the point very well.\n  We woke up this morning to read a headline in the New York Times on \nthe front page. The headline says: ``Dogged Engineer Pressed NASA on \nShuttle, but Rebuffs Were Constant.''\n  I submit this article for the Record because it is lengthy and it is \nvery detailed, but it is excellent. I ask unanimous consent to print \nthe article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 26, 2003]\n\n           Dogged Engineer's Effort To Assess Shuttle Damage\n\n                   (By James Glanz and John Schwartz)\n\n       Houston.--Over and over, a projector at one end of a long, \n     pale-blue conference room in Building 13 of the Johnson Space \n     Center showed a piece of whitish foam breaking away from the \n     space shuttle Columbia's fuel tank and bursting like \n     fireworks as it struck the left wing.\n       In twos and threes, engineers at the other end of the \n     cluttered room drifted away from their meeting and watched \n     the repetitive, almost hypnotic images with deep puzzlement: \n     because of the camera angle, no one could tell exactly where \n     the foam had hit.\n       It was Tuesday, Jan. 21, five days after the foam had \n     broken loose during liftoff, and some 30 engineers from the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its \n     aerospace contractors were having the first formal meeting to \n     assess potential damage when it struck the wing.\n       Virtually every one of the participants--those in the room \n     and some linked by teleconference--agreed that the space \n     agency should immediately get images of the impact area, \n     perhaps by requesting them from American spy satellites or \n     powerful telescopes on the ground.\n       They elected one of their number, a soft-spoken NASA \n     engineer, Rodney Rocha, to convey the idea to the shuttle \n     mission managers.\n       Mr. Rocha said he tried at least half a dozen times to get \n     the space agency to make the requests. There were two similar \n     efforts by other engineers. All were turned aside, Mr. Rocha \n     (pronounced ROE-cha) said a manager told him that he refused \n     to be a ``Chicken Little.''\n       The Columbia's flight director, Le-Roy Cain, wrote a curt \n     e-mail message that concluded, ``I consider it to be a dead \n     issue.''\n       New interviews and newly revealed e-mail sent during the \n     fatal Columbia mission show that the engineers' desire for \n     outside help in getting a look at the shuttle's wing was more \n     intense and widespread than what was described in the Aug. 26 \n     final report of the board investigating the Feb. 1 accident, \n     which killed all seven astronauts aboard.\n       The new information makes it clear that the failure to \n     follow up on the request for outside imagery, the first step \n     in discovering the damage and perhaps mounting a rescue \n     effort, did not simply fall through bureaucratic cracks but \n     was actively, even hotly resisted by mission managers.\n       The report did not seek to lay blame on individual managers \n     but focused on physical causes of the accident and the \n     ``broken safety culture'' within NASA that allowed risks to \n     be underplayed. But Congress has opened several lines of \n     inquiry into the mission, and holding individuals accountable \n     is part of the agenda.\n       In interviews with numerous engineers, most of whom have \n     not spoken publicly until now, the discord between NASA's \n     engineers and managers stands out in stark relief.\n       Mr. Rocha, who has emerged as a central figure in the 16 \n     days of the Columbia's fight, was a natural choice of his \n     fellow engineers as a go-between on the initial picture \n     request. He had already sent an e-mail message to the shuttle \n     engineering office asking if the astronauts could visually \n     inspect the impact area through a small window on the side of \n     the craft. And as Mr. Rocha was chief engineer in Johnson \n     Space Center's structural engineering division and a man with \n     a reputation for precision and integrity, his words were \n     likely to carry great weight.\n       ``I said, `Yes, I'll give it a try,' '' he recalled in mid-\n     September, in the course of five hours of recent interviews \n     at a hotel near the space center.\n       In its report, the independent Columbia Accident \n     Investigation Board spoke of Mr. Rocha, 52, as a kind of NASA \n     Everyman--a typical engineer who suspected that all was not \n     well with the Columbia but could not save it.\n       ``He's an average guy as far as personality, but as far as \n     his engineering skills, he's a very, very detail-oriented \n     guy,'' said Dan Diggins, who did many of the interviews for \n     the report's chapter on the space agency's decision-making \n     during the flight and wrote that chapter's first draft before \n     it was reworked and approved by the board. Never in hours of \n     interviews did Mr. Diggins find a contradiction between Mr. \n     Rocha's statements and facts established by other means, he \n     said.\n       Mr. Rocha's experience provides perhaps the clearest and \n     most harrowing view of a NASA safety culture that, the board \n     says must be fixed if the remaining shuttles are to continue \n     flying.\n\n\n                        early love with shuttle\n\n       Alan Rodney Rocha loved the Columbia long before it was \n     lost. In August 1978, as a young NASA engineer, he took his \n     first business trip for the agency to Palmdale, Calif., where \n     the still unfinished Columbia sat in a hangar among the \n     Joshua trees, awaiting its first mission.\n       Working from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. each night, he had the job of \n     climbing into the orbiter's wheel well, through the fuselage \n     and among the labyrinth of tubes, wires, struts and \n     partitions in the right wing, to check that each of 200 \n     strain gauges were just where the plans said they should be. \n     And the Columbia took its place in his heart.\n       ``I felt so privileged to be there,'' he said. The Columbia \n     took its maiden flight in 1981; five years later its sister \n     vessel the Challenger was lost with its crew of seven when O-\n     ring seals in one of the solid rocket boosters failed in the \n     launching, severing a strut connecting the booster to the \n     shuttle's external fuel tank.\n       For Mr. Rocha, the Columbia disaster began on the eve of \n     its final liftoff. That afternoon, he and other engineers \n     were stunned to learn of new tests at a NASA laboratory \n     showing that a ring attaching the rocket boosters to the \n     external tank had not met minimum strength requirements. As \n     he watched, managers hastily considered the problem at a \n     prelaunching meeting beginning at 12:10 a.m. on Jan. 16.\n       Instead of halting the launching on the spot, Mr. Rocha \n     said, the shuttle manager,\n\n[[Page S12030]]\n\n     Linda Ham, granted a temporary waiver that reduced the \n     strength requirements, on the basis of data that the \n     investigation board later found to be flawed. Mr. Rocha would \n     draw on an old rocketry term--``launch fever''--to describe \n     what had happened at the meeting.\n       The launching went ahead that Thursday morning. The ring \n     held, but an unrelated problem turned up when insulating foam \n     tore away from an attachment to the external tank 81.7 \n     seconds after liftoff and struck the orbiter's left wing.\n       Mr. Rocha said that when he learned of the foam strike in a \n     phone call on Friday afternoon, he gasped. All weekend he \n     watched the video loop showing the strike, and at 11:24 p.m. \n     on Sunday, he sent an e-mail message to the manager of the \n     shuttle engineering office, Paul Shack, suggesting that the \n     astronauts simply take a look at the impact area.\n       Mr. Shack never responded. But by Tuesday afternoon, Mr. \n     Rocha was showing the loop to the so-called debris assessment \n     team at the meeting in Building 13, where he had his own \n     office. As arresting as the images were, the team agreed, \n     they were too sketchy to draw conclusions without new images.\n       To engineers familiar with the situation, the request was \n     an easy call. ``We all had an intense interest in getting \n     photos,'' said Steven Rickman, a NASA engineer whose staff \n     members served on the assessment team. ``As engineers they're \n     always going to want more information.''\n       In his second e-mail appeal for satellite imagery, Mr. \n     Rocha wrote in boldface to Mr. Shack and other managers, \n     ``Can we petition (beg) for outside agency assistance?''\n       But Mr. Rocha did not know that the strange politics of the \n     NASA culture had already been set in motion. Calvin \n     Schomburg, a veteran engineer who was regarded as an expert \n     on the shuttle's thermal protection system--though his \n     expertise was in heat-resisting tiles, not the reinforced \n     carbon-carbon that protected the wings' leading edges--had \n     been reassuring shuttle managers, Mr. Diggins said. Mr. \n     Schomburg either ``sought them out or the managers sought him \n     out to ask his opinion,'' Mr. Diggins said.\n       Whether because of Mr. Schomburg's influence or because \n     managers simply had no intention of taking the extraordinary \n     step of asking another agency to obtain images, Mr. Rocha's \n     request soon found its way into a bureaucratic dead end.\n       On Wednesday, an official Mr. Schomburg had spoken to--Ms. \n     Ham, the chairwoman of the mission management team--canceled \n     Mr. Rocha's request and tow similar requests from other \n     engineers associated with the mission, according to the \n     investigation board. Late that day, Mr. Shack informed Mr. \n     Rocha of management's decision not to seek images.\n       Astonished, Mr. Rocha sent an e-mail message asking why. \n     Receiving no answer, he phoned Mr. Shack, who said, ``I'm not \n     going to be Chicken Little about this,'' Mr. Rocha recalled.\n       ``Chicken Little?'' Mr. Rocha said he shouted back. ``The \n     program is acting like an ostrich with its head in the \n     sand.''\n       Mr. Shack, Mr. Schomburg and Ms. Ham declined to comment \n     for this article or did not respond to detailed requests for \n     interviews relayed through the space agency's public affairs \n     office.\n       On the day he talked with Mr. Shack, Mr. Rocha wrote an \n     anguished e-mail message that began, ``In my humble technical \n     opinion, this is the wrong (and bordering on irresponsible) \n     answer.'' He said his finger hovered over the ``send'' \n     key, but he did not push the button. Instead, he showed \n     the draft message to a colleague, Carlisle Campbell, an \n     engineer.\n       ``I said, `Rodney, that's a significant document,' '' Mr. \n     Campbell said in an interview. ``I probably got more \n     concerned or angry than he did at the time. We could not \n     believe what was going on.''\n       But Mr. Rocha still decided he should push his concerns \n     through official channels. Engineers were often told not to \n     send messages much higher than their own rung in the ladder, \n     he said.\n\n\n                        taking the issue higher\n\n       The next day, Mr. Rocha spoke with Barbara Conte, a worker \n     in mission operations, about spy telescopes. In a written \n     response to reports' questions, Ms. Conte said her colleague \n     ``was more keyed-up and troubled than I had ever previously \n     encountered him.''\n       That day, she and another NASA employee, Gregory Oliver, \n     took the issue to Mr. Cain, the Columbia's flight director \n     for landing, at an unrelated meeting.\n       ``We informed LeRoy of the concern from Rodney'' and \n     offered to help arrange an observation by military \n     satellites, Mr. Oliver wrote on March 6--a month after the \n     accident--in a previously unreleased e-mail chronology of \n     shuttle events. The message continued, ``LeRoy said he would \n     go talk to Linda Ham and get back to us.''\n       About two hours later, at 12:07 p.m. that day, Mr. Cain \n     sent out his own e-mail message saying he had spoken with \n     management officials, who had no interest in obtaining the \n     images. Therefore, Mr. Cain wrote, ``I consider it to be a \n     dead issue.''\n       It was not over for Mr. Rocha, though. On Thursday \n     afternoon, Jan. 23, he encountered Mr. Schomburg, the expert \n     on the heat-resisting tiles, on the sixth floor of Building \n     1, where most of the managers had offices. They sat down in \n     the anteroom of an office and began arguing about the need \n     for imaging, said Mr. Rocha and the investigative board's \n     report.\n       Mr. Schomburg insisted that because smaller pieces of foam \n     had broken off and struck shuttles on previous flights \n     without dire consequences, the latest strike would require \n     nothing more than a refurbishment after the Columbia landed. \n     Mr. Rocha maintained that the damage could be severe enough \n     to allow hot gases to burn through the wing on re-entry and \n     threaten the craft.\n       As their voices rose, Mr. Rocha recalled, Mr. Schomburg \n     thrust out an index finger and said, ``Well, if it's that \n     bad, there's not a damn thing we can do about it.''\n       On Jan. 24, eight days into the mission, engineers and \n     managers held a series of meetings in which the debris strike \n     was discussed. At a 7 a.m. meeting, Boeing engineers \n     presented their analysis, which they said showed that the \n     shuttle probably took the hit without experiencing fatal \n     damage.\n       Those results were hastily carried into the 8 a.m. meeting \n     of the mission management team, led by Ms. Ham. When a NASA \n     engineer presented the results of the Boeing analysis and \n     then began to discuss the lingering areas of uncertainty, Ms. \n     Ham cut him off and the meeting moved along. The wing \n     discussion does not even appear in the official minutes.\n       Mr. Diggings, the accident board investigator, said it \n     should not be surprising that such a critical issue received \n     short shrift. A mission management meeting, he said, is \n     simply ``an official pro forma meeting to get it on the \n     record.'' The decision to do noting more, he said, had long \n     been made.\n       By then, Mr. Rocha said, he decided to go along. ``I lost \n     the steam, the power drive to have a fight, because I just \n     wasn't being supported,'' he said. ``And I had faith in the \n     abilities of our team.''\n       He waited through the weekend until the Boeing engineers \n     closed out the last bit of their analysis, and on Sunday, \n     Jan. 26, he wrote a congratulatory e-mail message to \n     colleagues, saying the full analysis showed no ``safety of \n     flight'' risk. ``This very serious case could not be ruled \n     out and it was a very good thing we carried it through to a \n     finish,'' he wrote.\n       But his anxiety quickly spiked again. He slept poorly. Mr. \n     Diggins said, ``I think that what was gnawing away at him was \n     that he didn't have enough engineering data to settle the \n     question he had in his mind.'' With days to go in the \n     mission, Mr. Rocha continued to discuss the possibility of \n     damage with Mr. Campbell, the expert in landing gear.\n       ``He started coming by my desk every day,'' Mr. Campbell \n     recalled. ``He was trying to be proper and go through his \n     management,'' he said, but ``he was too nice about it, \n     because he's a gentleman; he didn't get nasty about the \n     problem.''\n\n\n                        Being There for Re-entry\n\n       On Feb. 1, the last day of the Columbia's flight, Mr. Rocha \n     rose before dawn. He wanted to be in the mission evaluation \n     room, an engineering monitoring center on the first floor of \n     NASA's Building 30, by 6:45 a.m., well before the shuttle \n     fired its rockets to drop out of orbit. Normally, he would \n     just watch the landing on NASA-TV, the space agency's \n     channel, but he said he wanted to see the data from the wing \n     sensors.\n       The room was jammed with people and computers. There was a \n     pervasively upbeat mood.\n       Before long, things began to go wrong--and in the ways that \n     Mr. Rocha had feared. The scrolling numbers giving \n     temperature readings for the left and right wings began to \n     diverge. Then, at 7:54 a.m., four temperature sensors on the \n     left wing's wheel well failed.\n       In fact, the hole that the foam had punched into the wing \n     16 days before had been allowing the superheated gases of \n     reentry to torch through the structure for some several \n     minutes, and observers on the ground had already seen bright \n     flashes and pieces shedding from the damaged craft.\n       As the number of alarming sensor readings quickly mounted, \n     ``I started getting the sick feeling,'' Mr. Rocha said, \n     pointing to his stomach. He looked up from the fog of fear \n     and saw another engineer, Joyce Seriale-Grush, in tears. He \n     approached her and she said, ``We've lost communication with \n     the crew.''\n       Mr. Rocha did the only thing he could think of: He called \n     his wife. ``I want you to say some prayers for us right \n     now,'' he said. ``Things aren't good.'' Finally, they got \n     word that observers on the ground had seen the shuttle break \n     up over Texas.\n       Emergency plans came out of binders; engineers locked their \n     doors to outsiders and began to store data from the flight \n     for the inevitable investigation. Frank Benz, the Johnson \n     Space Center director of engineering, and his assistant, \n     Laurie Hansen, came in. Mr. Rocha recalled that Ms. Hansen, \n     trying to console him, said, ``Oh, Rodney, we lost people, \n     and there's probably nothing we could have done.''\n       For the third time in two weeks, Mr. Rocha raised his voice \n     to a colleague. ``I've been hearing that all week,'' he \n     snapped. ``We don't know that.''\n       He was instantly ashamed, he said, and thought, ``I'm being \n     rude.''\n\n\n                      troubled sleep, late thanks\n\n       The next days passed in a blur. Mr. Rocha was assigned to \n     the team to investigate the mission. At the same time, he was \n     working with the team that was looking into the attachment \n     ring problem that nearly scuttled the mission the night \n     before liftoff, while handling his other duties.\n       At one point he got to ask Ralph Roe, a shuttle manager, \n     why the photo request had\n\n[[Page S12031]]\n\n     been denied. He got no direct answer, he recalled. Instead, \n     Mr. Roe replied: ``I'd do anything now to get a photo. I'd \n     take a million photos.''\n       Mr. Rocha's sleep was still troubled--now, by nightmares, \n     he said, describing some: he was in the shuttle as it broke \n     up; his relatives were on the shuttle; ``Columbia has \n     miraculously been reassembled, and we're looking at the \n     wiring and it's got rats in there.''\n       Since the accident, Mr. Rocha said, engineers and other \n     colleagues have thanked him enthusiastically for speaking up, \n     saying things like, ``I can't imagine what it was like to be \n     in your shoes.'' His immediate supervisor has been supportive \n     as well, he said. But from management, he said: ``Silence. No \n     talk. No reference to it. Nothing.''\n       Except, that is, from the highest-up higher-up. One day Mr. \n     Rocha read an interview with the NASA administrator, Sean \n     O'Keefe, who wondered aloud why engineers had not raised the \n     alarm through the agency's safety reporting system. This \n     time, Mr. Rocha broke the rules: he wrote an e-mail message \n     directly to Mr. O'Keefe, saying he would be happy to explain \n     what really happened.\n       Within a day, he heard from Mr. O'Keefe, who then \n     dispatched the NASA general counsel, Paul G. Pastorek, to \n     interview him and report back. In a recent interview, Mr. \n     O'Keefe said Mr. Rocha's experience underscored the need to \n     seek the dissenting viewpoint and ask, ``Are we talking \n     ourselves into this answer?''\n       NASA, following the board's recommendation, has reached \n     agreements with outside agencies to take images during every \n     flight. And 11 of the 15 top shuttle managers have been \n     reassigned, including Ms. Ham, or have retired.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, my point is, as we seek the truth in \nwhat happened with the tragedy of the crash of the shuttle, we will \nhave to explore the tragedy in detail, and if we continue to press and \nfocus on the details, the truth will emerge. If we continue to focus on \nthe details and take the time, the truth will emerge, and when the \ntruth emerges, if the truth is allowed to emerge, then the appropriate \nactions can be taken.\n  NASA, of course, says that safety is their highest priority. There is \nnot a person I know who ever worked for NASA or who works for NASA \ntoday or who will work for NASA in the future who does not believe that \nsafety is important.\n  When we explore the details, as this article does beautifully, we \nwill be able to say: They say that, but what do they really mean? They \nsay safety is important, but when this engineer--I believe his name is \nMr. Rocha, and they go through in detail about his pleas that went \nunheard, his sterling reputation that was pushed aside by others who \nwere basically ready to launch. We will find the truth.\n  The same is going to be true in this debate with the District of \nColumbia on this scholarship voucher program because the details of it \nare very important. The details will show us the truth about what \nhappened.\n  I wish to begin by saying that my colleague from Ohio is correct in \nthe sense that the Mayor does support this three-pronged approach. He \nis correct. But the way we got to this point I wish to share with my \ncolleagues this morning.\n  The President offered earlier in the year in his State of the Union \nAddress a choice initiative. The President, in his budget, basically \nsaid: Despite the fact I am not going to fully fund Leave No Child \nBehind, I am not going to fund it at the authorized level as promised \nand implied, instead, I am going to offer--his budget shows--a $75 \nmillion voucher initiative for the country, and it is going to be put--\nthe budget showed and the administration said--in the Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill. That is how this whole issue began.\n  The administration said one thing, but I want to focus on what the \nbudget actually showed. The budget that was laid down showed: We are \nnot going to fully fund Leave No Child Behind, but this administration \nwants to fund a choice program for the Nation and they want to fund \nthat through the Health and Human Services appropriations bill.\n  The Health and Human Services appropriations bill is chaired by the \nSenator from Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Harkin and Mr. \nSpecter. They together, and their staffs, basically sent word back that \nwe would not have a voucher proposal in their bill. There was \nbipartisan agreement: We do not want vouchers in this bill. We do not \nwant to support Federal vouchers. And so it was removed from that bill.\n  It managed to find its way into the DC appropriations bill because \nthis bill, for better or worse, is sometimes the bill that is used to \nmake political points instead of good public policy.\n  That is what the record will reflect. That is the truth, and I will \nsubmit for the Record those details as this debate goes forward.\n  The voucher program finds its way into the DC appropriations bill, of \nwhich committee I am the ranking member.\n\n  When the proponents of vouchers say this was the Mayor's idea, I have \nto comment on this for a moment. The Mayor will be able to express \npublicly, as he has, his position and can respond in any way, but the \nMayor said--and I say this as respectfully as I can, and I think he has \nsaid this publicly--that he at no time went to the White House to ask \nfor a voucher program. He did not say: I need money for my schools and \nI am convinced the voucher program will work and I would like vouchers \nfor the District.\n  What happened was, this money was drifting in the budget, finding its \nway to DC, being pushed to DC by proponents of vouchers, and the Mayor \nwas given a very difficult choice, which any mayor would be tempted to \ntake, which was: Mr. Mayor, we have some money. Your school system \nneeds help, and we are happy to give you some money, but--but--we need \nyou to agree to a voucher component.\n  The Mayor, for whom I have the greatest respect for many reasons--\none, because he is an out-of-the-box thinker, he is innovative, he is \ngutsy, he is smart, he is honest--had a very difficult choice. As I \nhave told him, if I were the Mayor, I am not sure I would have made a \ndifferent choice than he did. But because we are Senators and not \nmayors, we have a respectfully different perspective.\n  He said: I will take the money. I will take the $40 million. I have \nschools that have leaky roofs. I have schools that have no computers. I \nhave children in my schools who haven't had gym classes in 10 years. I \nhave an obesity problem. I have children who can play music but they \nhave no instruments. I have children who will be great in science \nexcept they have no microscopes. And I have children who can learn but \nI have 40 kids in a class and I need more teachers. If I were the \nMayor, I would have taken the money, but I am not the Mayor.\n  The Mayor was forced to make a pretty difficult decision driven by \nvoucher proponents who will not give up on the vouchers. Even though we \npassed Leave No Child Behind, there is a determined group of people who \nwill not give up on vouchers. The Mayor, as best as he could--and he \nhas my respect and admiration--at least took a really rotten proposal \nand crafted a three-pronged approach and said: OK, let's present it: a \nthird for charter schools, a third for public schools, and the \ntransitional schools, the great reforms that are underway, and, all \nright, I will take a third for vouchers. Then it went forth: This is \nthe Mayor's proposal; this is what the Mayor has asked.\n  I hope the truth has been spoken, and if any of my colleagues want to \ndebate those points or submit for the Record a different view or a \ndifferent story, please do. But that is how we got to this point.\n  Every time we get on this subject, the proponents want to say this \nwas the Mayor's idea and the Mayor is a Democrat; he is an African-\nAmerican Democrat; this was his idea. I want to be clear for the \nrecord, this was not the Mayor's idea. This was the President's idea, \nthe administration's idea laid down in a budget, rejected by the \nRepublican chairman and a Democratic ranking member of the Health and \nHuman Services Appropriations Subcommittee, that has made its way to \nthe DC Appropriations Subcommittee, and then was modified to become the \nissue we are discussing today.\n  The Mayor, from his perspective, I could argue, made the best choice \nfor his city, but that might not be the choice the Senate needs to \nmake, for obvious reasons.\n  One of those obvious reasons, to anybody with an open mind, is that \nwe should not, as a Senate or Congress, at this critical time in the \nfunding history of education reform, in any way send any signal to any \ncity that they\n\n[[Page S12032]]\n\ncannot get money from Washington, they cannot get new money from \nWashington, unless they take a voucher program.\n  They keep saying this is new money. One could argue that, but let's \njust take it as new money. The only way someone can get money is if \nthey enter into a voucher proposal. It should be obvious to people who \nare following this debate that that would be an inappropriate signal, \nand a dangerous signal, to send out as States, cities, counties, and \nparishes, as in the State of Louisiana, are struggling with making \ndecisions about how can we get more money for these reforms, where \nshould we allocate them. They have flexibility now.\n  Let me say on that point that voucher proponents do not want to \nlisten to what the truth is. They do not want to listen, but this is \nthe truth: Under the historic bipartisan bill that, if implemented, \nfunded, and followed, can improve schools in America, under title I \ndollars, under tutorial services that are in that bill, communities \ntoday can craft private school vouchers or choice in their local \njurisdictions. It is not done because there are very serious and \nreasonable people on both sides of the debate, but local jurisdictions \ncan do that now. The question is, Should the Federal Government have \nbasically a mandate for vouchers over, for instance, charter schools, \ntransitional public schools, public contract schools, or other kinds of \nnewly innovative reforms? The answer is obviously no.\n  So when Senator Carper and I offered the amendment to the other side \nsaying, look, we just cannot support a Federal mandate for vouchers--\nalthough we as cosponsors of this important and significant legislation \nunderstand where the Mayor is coming from--would you please remove the \nFederal mandate, we were told no.\n  There is a reason: Because the voucher proponents want a Federal \npreference for vouchers. But they will not get it in the long run. They \nmay have the power now to get it in the short run, but they will not \nget it in the long run because the people of the United States do not \nwant a Federal mandate for vouchers. Particularly, the people of the \nUnited States--Republicans and Democrats, Independents, Black, White, \nHispanic, and Asian--who support the new reforms in education do not \nthink vouchers are a superior method to charter schools, to public \nschool innovation, to accountability, and that was a great victory \nthat, in my opinion, they are not willing to undo.\n  Another part I wish to speak about this morning is the evaluation \ncomponent. The reason Senator Carper and others have argued with the \nvouchers-always-only-and-forever crowd, basically, is that if a \nscholarship program is going to be offered, recognizing that there is a \ntremendous amount of opposition to it on legitimate constitutional \ngrounds--separation of church and state--but if one could manage to get \nthrough those very important issues, one of the key reasons for moving \nin this direction would be to demonstrate definitively whether this \nworks.\n  Why is this important? Because those of us who are trying to find the \nways to bring excellence to education through a public system with as \nmuch choice as possible, to every child, regardless of the kind of \nfamily or resources to which they are born, we believe strongly that \nthis Nation can and should--and if it stays the path--do what no other \nnation has ever done in the world, and that is a belief that every \nchild can learn if we provide resources for every child to learn, \nwhether they are blind, deaf, in a wheelchair, have some disease, or \nthey were born with incomplete mental capacity. This Nation believes no \nchild should be left behind.\n\n  For 200 years, we have struggled through segregation times, through \nslavery times, through lots of times to reach that goal. We are making \nprogress on that goal. Are there lots of problems? Yes, there are lots \nof problems, but we are making progress.\n  Those of us over the decades, way before we were in this Senate, who \nfought--and some in some instances died--over this principle continue \nto work today. So those of us who are committed to keeping our eyes on \nthe prize--and the prize is excellence in education for every child and \nequity and equality, without pulling the children from the top down but \nby pushing all the children up--keep our eyes on that prize.\n  People ask me: Why, Senator, do you feel so strongly about this \nevaluation component? It is because I think there would be some good \nreason--actually, I would argue to my colleagues who are opposed to \nvouchers, and I respect them all for their very strong views, that if \nthey were going to do a scholarship program, one value for the Nation \nwould be to have a demonstration project that could show once and for \nall, to those who think vouchers are the greatest thing since sliced \nbread and to those who think it is the worst thing since the Devil \nhimself, to come together and have the data and reason together and say \nit either worked or it did not work.\n  So when Senator Carper submitted our amendment and we said, all \nright, we are reluctant, but if we could do this, this evaluation has \nto be tight--Milwaukee has had this for 13 years. I will be submitting \nfor the Record constant referrals to that written by almost every \nobjective newspaper in the country. There are some that are not, but \nmost newspapers are objective. Most of the newspapers, whether they are \nconservative or liberal--I am not talking about very partisan papers--\nstate it is inconclusive because there is no evaluation component. So \nwe put one in our proposal that requires full and independent \nevaluation for the scholarship program that would include, amongst \nother things, a comparison of the academic achievements of scholarship \nstudents in high-performing schools and nonscholarship students \nattending high-performing public or charter schools.\n  Let me repeat that it would require a full and independent evaluation \nfor the scholarship programs that would include, among other things, a \ncomparison of the academic achievement of scholarship recipients in \nhigh-performing private schools and nonscholarship students attending \nhigh-performing public or charter schools, because that is what we do \nnot know.\n  Let me explain what we do know. We do know if you take a poor child \nout of a school that is mismanaged and underresourced and put that \nchild in a private school that is better managed and better resourced, \nthat child will do better. It does not take a genius to know that. \nAnybody knows that. We don't need a study. We don't need a thing. We \nknow it.\n\n  I will tell you what we don't know. What we don't know is, if you \ntake a poor child and put that child in a high-performing or moderately \nperforming private school, and then you take that same poor child and \nput that child in a high or moderately performing public school or a \npublic charter school or public contract school, does that child do \nbetter or worse? That is what we need to know because what we need to \nknow is does the scholarship itself make a difference? Does the \nscholarship, the act of giving the scholarship to the parent and the \nchoice and the freedom, make a difference when all other things are \ncontrolled? Nobody in America or the world knows that.\n  So Senator Carper and I said we would like to know that. We would be \nwilling, maybe, to put this debate to rest once and for all if we could \ncommit to a rigorous evaluation by outside experts who are not from the \nDemocratic spin room or the Republican spin room. Then maybe we could \nbe for this. They said no.\n  Let me go to two more points, briefly. I see my colleague from South \nDakota is here and he probably wants to speak on this, or perhaps other \nsubjects, but there are two issues I want to hit before we move to \nsomething else.\n  Last night several of my colleagues came to the floor and argued for \nvouchers on the basis that we do this for higher education and we have \none of the finest higher education systems in the world. And they are \nright. We are proud of our system of higher education. It has been \ndeveloped over hundreds of years. People from all over the world want \nto come to use our higher education system. Even given some of its \nweaknesses, it is a pretty remarkable institution we have created.\n  But there is a fundamental difference between higher education and \nelementary and secondary education that cannot be ignored. It is one of \nthe details that is very important to understand.\n\n[[Page S12033]]\n\nHigher education is not mandatory in the United States. If you want to \ngo, you can go. If you don't want to go, you do not have to go. But \nelementary and secondary education is basically mandatory in the United \nStates. Children have to go to school. There are some exceptions for \nchildren in home schooling, which I actually support. Some people \ndon't, but I think home schoolers do a beautiful job over time, as long \nas they are held accountable, and that is true in some States. But \neducation in this country is mandatory; at least we have to offer it. \nIt has to be universally offered.\n  In America today, even considering how great our higher education \nsystem is, only 20 percent of adults have college degrees. In African-\nAmerican or Hispanic populations, that may be down to 10 or 15 percent. \nMaybe the national average is about 20 or 25.\n  We would like 100 percent of children to have a high school degree. \nThey can drop out, but our goal as a Nation is 100 percent to have a \nhigh school degree. So the systems in their essence are different.\n  I will say maybe the word mandatory is a little strong. It is a goal \nof the United States to have 100 percent of our population to have a \nhigh school degree.\n\n  So you cannot compare these systems. While choice, as I said, is \ndesirable, with the freedom like we have in the higher education \nsystem, because we do not have a policy that says we want to provide 16 \nyears mandatory through college, then the freedoms that can exist in \nhigher education are very different than what the public could support \nor afford for elementary and secondary education.\n  I wanted to get that statement on the record.\n  I see my colleague from South Dakota who wants to speak as in morning \nbusiness. I will resume the discussion of Leave No Child Behind and the \nscholarship tuition debate when he has concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank my colleague from Louisiana for her \nextraordinary leadership on education issues. I do not want to take \nlong on another topic.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Johnson are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, back to the budget of the District of \nColumbia, earlier this morning it was said by our friends on the other \nside of the aisle that perhaps we should just have a debate today and \nMonday and move off of this bill, indicating a permanent move off of \nthis bill.\n  I argue there is certainly a way, if this body desires--and I hope \nthey would continue this very important debate--to figure out a way to \nspend some quality time debating this proposal. There are many \nconcerned Members on both sides, I am certain, based on the level of \nintensity and the discussions at the committee level.\n  Since I was chair or ranking member of those committees, I was on the \nfront row for those debates. I am confident there are Members on both \nsides who want some time to talk about this issue and to debate it in \nfull. There is no reason that could not continue for weeks, as we take \nup other matters and move decisively based on agreements that can be \nreached.\n  As the ranking member, I go on record to both Republican and \nDemocratic leadership, it would be my strong suggestion we continue to \ndebate this issue. The details are extremely important for the Nation \nto grasp so we can move on to education reform.\n  There was debate earlier regarding the District of Columbia. A lot \nhas been said about the Mayor's position. Yesterday, Mayor Williams was \nin the Senate. He has been a tireless advocate for school reform in the \nDistrict. He should be commended.\n  I will read the Mayor's own words regarding his position. I believe \nhis position has been misconstrued by opponents of vouchers. His words \nwill clarify his position, so I will read into the Record this morning \nthe Mayor's comments before the Governmental Affairs Committee in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  He says:\n\n       Along with city council education committee chair Kevin \n     Chavous [who is another very strong and respected leader in \n     the city for education reform] and board of education \n     president Peggy Cooper Cafritz [who also has done an \n     excellent job of leading reforms in the school district in \n     Washington, DC] I support a 3-sector approach that would \n     focus new Federal resources towards increasing the \n     availability of quality education options for district \n     students and families.\n\n  He says, I repeat, ``I support a 3-sector approach . . . ''\n  It does not say: ``I support a voucher-only approach.''\n  He says:\n\n       I support a three-sector approach that would focus new \n     Federal resources towards increasing the availability of \n     quality education options for District students and families. \n     This strategy would require a significant and ongoing \n     investment toward the following: One, the development of a \n     Federally funded scholarship program for students to attend \n     nonpublic schools; two--\n\n  And this a detail that is extremely important that has been \noverlooked by some and undercut by others--\n\n     a permanent and predictable support for the District of \n     Columbia's public schools--\n\n  ``permanent and predictable support for the District of Columbia's \npublic schools''--\n\n     targeted at leadership and instructional excellence and \n     student achievement; and, three, a fiscally sound and \n     comprehensive approach to the acquisition and renovation of \n     charter school facilities.\n\n  This is the Mayor's position.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Why a three-sector approach? The most compelling reasons \n     focus on fairness, the legacy of Federal/District relations, \n     and a strong sense that choice means the most when a number \n     of quality educational options is maximized. Specifically, I \n     mean that while DCPS faces considerable administrative and \n     operational challenges that transcend any particular funding \n     level, our public schools are paying the price of a legacy of \n     disinvestment and crumbling school buildings, many \n     constructed originally by the Federal Government. While \n     bearing the cost associated with both the local school \n     districts and a state system, the city has the tax base of \n     neither. As the recent GAO report documented, the city needs \n     ongoing assistance from the Federal Government in addressing \n     the structural imbalance.\n\n  So let me take the Mayor's words, the Mayor's position, to make some \npoints.\n  First of all, this statement should make it clear that the Mayor \nhimself and Councilman Chavous and education President Peggy Cooper \nCafritz have soundly rejected the vouchers-only approach. Yet to this \nday, on the floor of the Senate, at this hour--we have now been \ndebating this issue on and off over the last several months; not \npublicly in this Chamber, but this debate has been raging in \ncommittees, in conference rooms, and meetings all over America--we have \nnot had a definitive statement from this administration that they, too, \nreject the vouchers-only approach and that they will protect the three-\npronged approach through this process.\n  Let me repeat, the administration has not, to my knowledge--if they \nhave, please, someone, send me a letter or a telegram or an e-mail that \nwould say: Senator, you are wrong. The administration only supports a \nthree-sector approach, we will commit to that and make that possible by \nusing the power of the White House--which is considerable--to ensure \nthat happens.\n  In fact, one of the reasons I am particularly puzzled is because \nyesterday the administration released a statement of policy. For every \nbill, as we all know, when we are debating bills, which is appropriate, \nthe administration says to Congress: These are the things I like about \nyour bill. These are the things I do not like about the bill. And as \nthe system goes, if we do not get a little bit more in line, usually, \nwith what the administration wants--whether they are Republican or \nDemocratic Presidents--sometimes they will veto what we do. That is \nprocess. So it is important to hear from the administration about what \nthey are thinking so we can decide if we are willing to risk a veto. So \nwe like to get these statements. It is helpful to this process.\n\n  I hold in my hand the President's statement, and I am going to submit \nit again for the Record:\n\n       The administration is pleased the committee bill included \n     $13 million for the President's school choice initiative \n     fund. This innovative reform will increase the capacity of \n     the District to provide parents, particularly\n\n[[Page S12034]]\n\n     low-income parents, with more options for obtaining a quality \n     education for their children who are trapped in low-\n     performing schools. The administration appreciates the \n     committee's support for strengthening the District's school \n     system and strongly urges the Senate to retain this \n     initiative.\n\n  Now, unless I missed a paragraph--and I don't think I did, because it \nis only two pages long, and the others go on to other issues--there is \nnothing here on the three-sector approach. There is no charter school \nlanguage. There is no public school initiative language.\n  So in one hand I have the Mayor's comments, which speak of a three-\nsector approach, and in the other hand I have the administration's \ncomments. That is why Senator Carper and I laid down an amendment to \ntry to clarify this issue. To date, it has not been clarified.\n  In all fairness to my colleague from Ohio, he did say last night--and \nI believe what he said is true--that a clarifying statement is on its \nway. Perhaps it is here and it just has not reached me. If it is, I \nwill be happy to submit that for the Record at any time anyone can \nproduce it for me. But I do not have it, and neither does my staff. So \nthat is an important point to clarify. Maybe that will be clarified as \nthis debate goes on.\n  The other part of the Mayor's comments that I think sheds a lot of \nlight on the detail of what this argument is about, and I actually \nagree with the Mayor--not all Democrats do--but I agree with him when \nhe says: ``a strong sense that choice means the most when the number of \nquality educational options is maximized.''\n  Now, let me put a few things on the record that the proponents of \nvouchers-only want to continue to say that is fundamentally untrue. It \nis just untrue. What they say is, families in the District of Columbia \nhave no choice. It is my understanding--and I am going to submit it for \nthe Record because if I am wrong I would like to be corrected--that \nrecently--I am not sure on what day or year--but in the last few years, \nunder the District's reform initiatives, there is districtwide choice \nin public schools.\n  Not every jurisdiction in America has districtwide choice, but it is \nmy understanding--and I think I am correct--that in the District of \nColumbia--unlike New York City or San Francisco or even New Orleans, \nwhich I am more familiar with, or Baton Rouge or Shreveport, which I am \nmore familiar with, those cities being in Louisiana--there is \nwidespread choice. Parents can move from school to school with greater \nease. That is a very important component.\n  Also, it is my understanding that there are more charter schools in \nthe District of Columbia than any other jurisdiction per capita in the \nNation, with 14,000 out of the 67,000 children enrolled in public \ncharter schools, and there are waiting lists for charter schools.\n\n  But the problem is, there has been limited money in the Federal \nbudget. Basically, there has been limited money for charter schools, so \nthere is a waiting list of children to get into quality charter \nschools. Because the funding has been short on the Federal level, and \nperhaps maybe short on the local level, we cannot create more charter \nschools.\n  But the answer for the proponents of vouchers is, we are not going to \ngive additional money for charter schools. We are just going to lay \ndown a voucher-only proposal. Clearly, the Mayor said that would not be \nhis position.\n  And finally, the Mayor says in his statement:\n\n       The city needs ongoing assistance from the Federal \n     Government to address the structural imbalance.\n\n  So here is really the big picture that is quite troubling. This \nadministration, instead of coming to the District of Columbia initially \nand saying, ``We want to help you fund your reform efforts that are \nunderway. We want to really encourage you in terms of your charter \nschools. We recognize your structural deficit, and we want to help with \nyour structural deficit,'' instead of saying, ``We acknowledge that \nyour public schools need some additional resources,'' the \nadministration and the House--I should say specifically the House \nRepublican leadership--has not offered anything in the budget toward \nthose ends.\n  They have offered kind words. They have offered comments. But they \nhaven't offered anything in the budget--which is the only thing you can \ntake to the bank, the only thing you can count on--to the District. \nThey have offered a $10 million, now $13 million, voucher only--not \njust voucher only to go to kids, children in failing schools, they want \nto have a voucher program for children to go to any school.\n  Some of us wanted to work with the other side of the aisle and did \nwork with this administration to pass Leave No Child Behind that \nallowed great flexibility at the local level, that encouraged and \npushed for more choice within the constitutional limits, and that \nsuggested front and foremost that quality was not only important for \nthe student and parents but for the taxpayers who are picking up this \ntab. And it is a big lift for taxpayers all over this Nation, not just \nto help the District with its funding and the taxpayers here. But \ntaxpayers all over this Nation pay a lot of money in property taxes and \nin sales taxes and in other fees associated with supporting schools. \nThe taxpayers deserve to know if that money is resulting in a quality \nproduct. The mayor acknowledges that.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal, in its detail--not what is said about it \nbut in its detail--gives no assurance for quality. There is no \nevaluation component that is rigorous enough. There is a modest \nevaluation component. But because it lacks rigor, there is no quality \ncontrol in the current proposal, which is one of the reasons the \nmayor's position is actually, when read and understood, quite different \nfrom the voucher proposal, at least seemingly from the administration, \nbased on their own statement, and definitely from the House Republican \nleadership.\n  I would like to read Chairman Davis's comments into the Record. He \nsaid:\n\n       Some are making a mountain out of a molehill over the fact \n     that this legislation authorizes funding for school choice \n     but not enhanced funding for DC public schools or charter \n     schools. The reason for this is simple. This bill deals with \n     authorization for a new and historic program. Authorization \n     for spending on DC public schools and charter schools already \n     exists. The debate will be over how low and how high that \n     spending should be.\n\n  That is what Representative Davis said. But what the Mayor says is \ndifferent. What the Mayor says is that this strategy ``would require a \nsignificant and ongoing investment that is permanent and predictable.'' \nThese are two very different positions.\n  Again, the Mayor of the District of Columbia:\n\n       We need a three-sector approach with predictable and \n     permanent support.\n\n  This is the House leadership approach: Some people are making a \nmountain out of a molehill. We don't really have to authorize any new, \npredictable, permanent funding--I am paraphrasing--for public schools \nand charter schools because they already exist. This debate will be \nsimply how high or how low that spending should be.\n  One of the problems Senator Carper and I have, and it is a \nsignificant problem, is in recognizing this disparity. We went to our \nfriends on the other side and said: These are totally different \npositions. I know what you are saying, but these are different \npositions. Can you clarify that for us? We would be willing, if you all \nwould admit or agree, to not a $40 million new authorization but a $200 \nmillion authorization over 5 years. It is not just $40 million for 1 \nyear. And the only permanent part of that $40 million is the voucher \ncomponent. We said: If you want to do a 5-year program, we could even \nagree if you would say we are going to do $200 million over 5 years, \n$40 million a year for 5 years--a third, a third, and a third--so that \nwe would have for 5 years a predictable source of Federal revenue that, \nno matter what happened, no matter what the underlying budgets did, no \nmatter how big the deficit got, no matter how tough the war turned out \nto be, at least this demonstration project would be $200 million--a \nthird for public schools, a third for charter schools, and a third for \nthis new voucher program. But at the end of 5 years, we would have \naccomplished one great thing, and that would be a definitive answer as \nto whether or not scholarships work, because for the greatest school \nsystem in\n\n[[Page S12035]]\n\nthe world today, our future depends on knowing that.\n\n  The rhetoric is so high on both sides, with some people saying, you \nwill never fix public schools if you don't have vouchers, and some \npeople saying, if you go to vouchers, you will wreck the system. Those \nof us who are interested in school reform and quality and the truth \nwould be interested in funding a predictable $200 million Federal \ndemonstration project in a city such as this, where the Mayor is \nsupportive and several key leaders, but, let me be quick to say, in a \ncity that has voted against vouchers and in a city with equally \nrespectful leaders on the other side.\n  But our colleagues said no because they are not, to my knowledge or \nmy view, the proponents--again, this is not my colleague from Ohio but \nthe proponents of vouchers only, and there are some--are evidently only \ninterested in this $10 million voucher program for the District, even \nin a district where the people are on record in the last referendum as \nvoting 81 percent against vouchers. That remains a point of contention.\n  Let me move now to a discussion about charter schools for a moment. I \nwill submit some more items for the Record.\n  There has been no disagreement between Senator DeWine and me, as the \nchairman and ranking member of this committee. Again, without his \nsupport, this would not be possible. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison--of course, they speak \nfor themselves--have been leaders for charter schools as well. Without \ntheir support, the District would not be in the enviable place it is \ntoday; that is, having more students per capita having options for \ncharter schools. So far, this very worthy and worthwhile experiment \nseems to be working. Most of the charter schools are doing a very good \njob.\n  In 2001, because rigorous evaluation components are in place, 99 \npercent of the students in the Oyster School--this is a very exciting \ninitiative underway in the District, a bilingual, very cutting edge \ncharter school in the Nation--are performing above basic in math and \n100 percent are performing above basic in reading. This is just one \nexample of one of the 41 charter schools that are operating in the \nDistrict. It is a pre-K through sixth grade school; 362 students are \nattending. The students-for-teacher ratio is 11.7 students for every \nteacher, which is excellent. They are in the District of Columbia \npublic schools. You can get other information from their Web page, but \nthey have 17 percent African-American, 1 percent American-Indian, 3 \npercent Asian, 52 percent Hispanic, and 27 percent White students.\n  The details of this and the reports look excellent. This is happening \nall over the United States of America. This Congress has come to a \npoint to say let's push the envelope, let's open up choice, let's \ncreate new charters, but let's do it in the public realm; and when we \nare spending public dollars, let's have accountability and have reports \nlike this so the parents know, the students know, and the taxpayers \nknow where we are getting the money we are spending.\n  I could not be more complimentary or excited about the fact that in \nour budget Senator DeWine and I have every year tried to do what we \ncould to support this wonderful effort underway by adding some money. \nIt hasn't been a huge amount because our budget is tight and we have \nlimits. But in each of the budgets, we have tried to put in some money \nfor the charter school effort. So we are not just saying we think \ncharter schools are good; Senator DeWine and I are saying not only do \nwe think the effort is good, but it is worthy of our support. We put \nour money where our mouth is, and we will continue to do that. If we \ncan get general agreement from others to do that, perhaps we could make \nsome progress.\n  Another charter school called the Tree of Life Charter School says \nthe results were quite impressive for a second-year school. Most \nsignificant is the fact that 88 percent of the school students improved \nin reading. This represents the largest percentage of students showing \npositive gain among all charter schools this year. More than half of \nthe students improved in math. Students showed good progress in \nperformance levels, with 75 percent of the students performing at basic \nor above in math and 72 percent at basic or above in reading.\n  It should be noted that the majority, 91 percent of the school's \npopulation, is low income. The Tree of Life Charter School is another \nexample of what is working in the District and what we as the Congress \nshould continue to fund in a predictable and dependable way.\n  Again, that is what is missing in this proposal today. There is, in \nthe underlying bill, money for charter schools, money for public \nschools, and money for vouchers. But there is no agreement, no \ncommitment, and there are no solid statements that have been made or \narrangements that have been made--which can be made--to indicate that \nthe funding for charter schools would even happen next year. I realize \nthat appropriations are annual. I understand that. But I also realize \nwhen this Federal Government wants to make a point about making sure \nthat funding could be dependable, there are ways that can be done; it \nhas been done in the past and it can be done now.\n  So I, for one, would be open to a limited, carefully crafted \nopportunity for children in failing schools to go to private schools, \nif there are seats available and if there is a proper evaluation. I \nfind it extremely disconcerting that in this proposal there is not a \nsimilar commitment to charter schools and, as a result, at this point \nit is one of the reasons I am unable to support the proposal. There are \nmany other reasons.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure for me to rise on \nthe subject of opportunity scholarships for kids in the District of \nColumbia. Before I make my statement, I am going to ask that a couple \nof items be printed in the Record. My good friend and colleague from \nLouisiana, I understand, has suggested that the administration does not \nor may not support those aspects of this bill which provide funds for \nDC public schools directly or for charter schools.\n  I have a letter signed by the Secretary of Education. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   The Secretary of Education,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: I am writing today to express my \n     strong support for the District of Columbia education \n     improvement initiative that is contained in the DC \n     appropriations bill now pending before the Senate.\n       Debate in the Senate this week has highlighted the fact \n     that excellence in education is critical to the future of the \n     District's school children and to the economic and social \n     vitality of DC as a whole. Yet the DC public school system \n     has not yet taken the steps needed to reform its operations \n     and raise student achievement to the level required. That is \n     why we need a package of reforms that both improves DC public \n     schools and gives parents and students additional educational \n     options, including the option to attend charter schools and \n     private schools. The appropriations bill now before the \n     Senate would do just that.\n       The bill includes a three-pronged initiative to: (1) \n     improve DC public schools that serve predominantly children \n     from low-income families; (2) create new charter schools and \n     ensure that DC charter schools have adequate facilities; and \n     (3) provide scholarships to a limited number of DC children \n     so that they can attend private schools in the District. Each \n     of these three elements of the initiative is critical and \n     each must be retained in the final bill.\n       The debate in the Senate has clarified many facts about the \n     scholarship component of the program, which I know is the \n     most controversial. It has shown that Mayor Williams and \n     other leaders of the District are fully supportive of the \n     entire initiative, including the scholarship program; it is \n     what they want and need. It has shown that the scholarship \n     program would be carefully evaluated, so that we know if a \n     program like this can be successful in raising student \n     achievement. And Senators have reiterated forcefully that the \n     entire, three-pronged initiative represents new money for the \n     District. It is simply untrue to state that any of it\n\n[[Page S12036]]\n\n     would take money from DC public schools, and it would be \n     tragic if any of this assistance were denied to DC residents \n     at this point.\n       I hope this letter conveys the commitment that the \n     Administration feels, and that I personally feel, toward this \n     very important initiative. If my staff or I can be of any \n     assistance to you in enacting this program, please let me \n     know immediately.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rod Paige.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. TALENT. In relevant part, it refers to the three funding \ninitiatives in the bill, and then says each of these three elements of \nthe initiative is critical and each must be retained in the final bill. \nThat is on behalf of the administration. I think that makes clear the \nadministration is strongly supportive of all three aspects of this \nmeasure and feels they are a package, and I think that is true. That is \nhow all of us who support this measure feel.\n  I know suggestions have been made with regard to Mayor Williams' \nsupport of this measure, that it was somehow foisted upon him by \nsomebody or some group.\n  I refer the Senate to an op-ed piece in the Washington Post, and I \nalso ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 3, 2003]\n\n               Washington's Children Deserve More Choices\n\n  (By Anthony A. Williams, Kevin P. Chavous and Peggy Cooper Cafritz)\n\n       For those of us involved every day in urban education, \n     there are some staggering realities that keep us awake at \n     night. Every child who graduates without basic skills--or who \n     drops out altogether--is on a potential pathway to public \n     assistance, to being alienated from the full benefits of \n     participation in society or, worse, to a life in the criminal \n     justice system. The D.C. appropriations bill before Congress \n     would provide $40 million in new funding for K-12 education \n     in the District to be divided among public schools, public \n     charter schools and scholarships for private and parochial \n     schools. We think that this is an appropriate investment by \n     the federal government in the children of the nation's \n     capital. Without the resources ordinarily provided by a \n     state, the District is more challenged than other cities in \n     its efforts to adequately fund public education and foster \n     innovative reform.\n       Our children have endured decades of neglect in public \n     education. But there is hope. We have a reconfigured school \n     board and a respected superintendent who have begun needed \n     reforms. Fifteen ``transformation schools'' have been \n     reconstituted from top to bottom--new principles, new staff \n     and extra resources. In addition, we have the country's most \n     robust charter school movement with 40 schools educating 16 \n     percent of our children.\n       But despite these underpinnings, parents still want more \n     choices. At town hall meetings, community picnics, hearings \n     and PTA meetings, we hear the same complaints: ``I can't find \n     the right setting for my child'' or ``My child is not \n     flourishing in this environment.''\n       Despite steady reform, change cannot occur rapidly enough \n     to provide relief to all public schools. As elected leaders, \n     we cannot tell parents who yearn for an opportunity for their \n     children to delay the same fulfillment we can provide our own \n     children. This is especially so when we have extra assets in \n     our midst: openings in non-public schools. Obviously, the \n     issue of whether federal funds should be allocated to private \n     schools is enormously difficult, but it is an issues that has \n     been settled by the Supreme Court.\n       We are not advocating a national voucher policy. We, as \n     local leaders, are simply imploring Congress to embrace our \n     efforts to help our long-neglected student population with \n     every available tool. We believe the current proposal \n     adequately addresses legitimate concerns about \n     constitutionality, separation of church and state, \n     accountability, selection of students and other issues. We \n     have worked closely with the Bush administration and with \n     congressional leaders in developing our proposal. Students \n     receiving scholarships will be randomly selected and must \n     fall within certain family income parameters. Participating \n     schools will be monitored by local authorities and the U.S. \n     Department of Education. And our public schools will not be \n     penalized financially for the loss of students to private or \n     parochial schools. The notion that this ``school improvement \n     imitative'' is being imposed on us from on high belies the \n     reality that this three-sector approach was conceived by us--\n     D.C. officials duly elected by local citizens.\n       No one should argue that private-school scholarships are a \n     panacea. Most students in the District will remain in our \n     public schools, and nothing will deter us from our commitment \n     to improve those schools. But we trust that, given additional \n     options, D.C. parents will exercise sound judgment in \n     selecting the right setting for their children. We are \n     confident that the proposed legislation will allow us to \n     evaluate the effect of school choice on youngsters whose \n     parents opt for it.\n       Funding for the initiative is correctly placed in the D.C. \n     appropriations bill and is not in competition with other \n     federal education priorities. This is a welcome partnership \n     between the District and Congress. The discussion should not \n     be burdened with agendas and ideologies unrelated to the best \n     interest of the school children in our city.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. It is written by the Mayor, along with Councilman Chavous \nand the President of the District of Columbia Board of Education, in \nwhich they go into their reasons for supporting this measure. It is a \nrather passionate explanation of why they believe this measure is so \nimportant; in fact, not just important but absolutely necessary to \nthousands of kids in the District of Columbia who otherwise would have \nlittle hope of getting a good education.\n  That is the feeling I have noticed in all of us who have encountered \nthis issue over time feel. I encountered the issue of opportunity \nscholarships for kids when I first started working on community \nrenewal, which is what our little group used to call urban renewal, and \nas some people call it. I got involved in that in the mid-1990s. As \npart of that involvement, I toured a lot of places in Missouri and in \nthe country where people were revitalizing their neighborhoods. They \nwere doing it by adopting the kind of measures that brought small \nbusiness investment in their neighborhoods, working with the police and \ncommunity policing, working with local organizations on substance abuse \nprograms and on home ownership. It was all tremendously inspiring.\n  I ended up filing the Community Renewal Act first in 1995 on the \nHouse side with then-Congressman J.C. Watts and Congressman Floyd \nFlake. Subsequently, a Senate bill was filed by then-Senator Abraham \nand my good friend from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman. We were all \ninvolved in this and believed in it passionately.\n  I remember I was in Indianapolis talking to some residents about \ntheir community renewal efforts. They brought up the whole subject of \nopportunity scholarships, or school choice, or whatever one wants to \ncall it. This was a depressed urban area like many parts of the \nDistrict of Columbia, and they said we have to have good local schools \nbecause it does not do any good for us to get jobs and safety on the \nstreets and the other things that are vital to community renewal if we \ndo not have good local schools because, what happens is people get jobs \nand then they leave. They do not stay because they have to have a good \neducation for their kids.\n  I got involved with this issue at the time, and in the bill we filed \nwe had a little piece of it that was simply directed to opportunity \nscholarships for the urban poor for kids going to failing schools. I \nremember we introduced it at a press conference, and the press asked: \nIs this just something you are doing to try to help the Catholic \nSchools? That was one of the charges: They said this is something the \nCatholic Church is doing to help its schools.\n  Spence Abraham thought about it, and he started to answer it. Then he \nlooked at the five of us standing there and he said: Wait a minute. \nJim, what denomination are you?\n  I said: I am a Presbyterian.\n  He said: J.C., you are a Baptist youth pastor, are you not?\n  J.C. Watts said: Yes.\n  Then he asked former Congressman Floyd Flake: You are a pastor in the \nAME Church?\n  Floyd said: Yes.\n  Then he turned to Senator Lieberman: Joe, of course, you are an \nOrthodox Jew.\n  Joe said: Yes.\n  And he said: I am Greek Orthodox.\n  We are doing this as part of a conspiracy by the Catholic Church to \nget money into those schools? Those Catholics play a pretty deep game.\n  For the next few years, we debated that measure and eventually passed \nthe Community Renewal Act without the opportunity scholarship part of \nit.\n  The point I am trying to make is, I have been back and forth for \nyears now with all of the arguments, pro and con, on this. I have heard \nthem all. I have participated in them all, in the House, and then in a \nrace for Governor in Missouri in the year 2000, then in the race for \nthe Senate in the year 2002. It is not that those arguments are not \nimportant, because they are. They have usually been argued with great \neloquence.\n\n[[Page S12037]]\n\nThey have been on the floor this morning. They were yesterday, and I \nwas listening to some of them on both sides and appreciating the \neloquence and vigor with which they argued.\n\n  But I am at the point where I have to ask myself, what difference do \nthose arguments really make in the face of the brute reality that every \nday thousands of kids in the District of Columbia get up and go to \nschool where their parents and they know they are not safe, they will \nnot learn, and it is not going to change? That is the position real \npeople are in every day. They do not have any other options. That is \nthe reality.\n  I think of this more and more from the standpoint of the parents, \nbecause I have talked to a lot of them over the years. I have three \nkids. They are 13 and 11 and 7. You will not be surprised to find out \nthat my wife and I spend a lot of time talking about the education of \nthese kids, trying to make the same decisions parents all over the \ncountry have to make about education: Which first grade teacher would \nbe better for the 7-year-old? We spend a lot of time talking about that \none. What kind of electives should the 7th grader take, now that he can \nfinally take electives? Should he be in the public presentation class \nor Spanish or what? We talk about this, and these decisions are very \nimportant to our kids. These kinds of decisions for our kids might make \na difference in terms of how far they go in life. It might make a \ndifference in terms of how successful they are in life, so we spend an \nawful lot of time on it.\n  But I am going to tell you these parents I talk to about this issue, \nthey are not making those kinds of decisions. Those are not the kinds \nof things they are debating. When I talk to them, there is a sense of \nurgency and sometimes a sense of panic in their eyes because they know \na lot more is at stake than which teacher their kid is going to get in \nfirst grade. They know what is at stake for their kids may be not how \nsuccessful they are in life or how far they go in life but whether they \nhave a real shot at it at all. This is the difference between a good \neducation and not a good education when you are trying to raise kids on \nyour own in these neighborhoods and you don't have any help from \nanybody else anyway. That is why they feel this sense of panic, because \nthey are looking at their kids and they know, if something is not done \nquickly--and it is not going to be done in the traditional system--if \nsomething is not done quickly for their kids, they are looking at kids \nwho, if they are trapped in that school for their whole educational \ncareer, are a whole lot more likely to end up by the time they are 25 \nyears old in a gang or on drugs or in jail or wounded or maybe dead. \nThat is what these parents are thinking. That is why this bill is \nimportant to them.\n  We ought to give them a chance. That is for all they are asking. They \nhave been looking for this kind of relief for years. The House has \nvoted it for years. The Senate has voted on it. The idea that this is \nsomething new this President has presented is just not correct. There \nare a bunch of us who have been involved in it one way or another for a \nwhole lot of years. Now we actually have a chance to pass it. Now we \nhave a chance to give these parents and their kids some options, and we \njust ought to do it.\n  The upside for these families is tremendous. The downside is just not \nthat great. If it doesn't offer them a better education, they will not \ntake advantage of these scholarships and the money will revert--I guess \nto the District of Columbia. Or does it revert to the Treasury? To the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n\n  OK, the arguments against it. I guess the argument--I had not heard \nthis but I suppose it could happen--the District of Columbia voted \nagainst vouchers 20 years ago. It was 20 years ago.\n  The argument I hear a lot, that opportunity scholarships or school \nchoice will hurt the public schools.\n  This is kind of ironic and I have discussed this with parents. Of \ncourse, everybody else in the country, except these, usually, single \nmoms in these neighborhoods, has school choice. Talk to somebody in the \nrealtor business if you do not believe that. When people buy a house \nsomeplace what do they ask about? They ask about the schools, don't \nthey? Because, for the average person in this country, if your school \nis a school where you think your kid is missing out, it is not a \nmarginal question. If that school is really failing your kid, for \nwhatever reason, you are going to do one of three things. You are going \nto move, you are going to put your kid in a private school or a \ndifferent school of some kind, or--and this is an increasing number of \npeople--you are home schooling your kids. You are going to do \nsomething.\n  But these moms can't do that because they don't have the money to \nmove, they don't have the money to put their kids in a private school, \nand they are working, so they don't have the time to stay home and home \nschool. So they are stuck.\n  Everybody else in the country has this kind of opportunity and that \nhas not hurt the public schools. This is a country that believes in, \nand is enriched by, diversity, by people having different opportunities \nand different choices. Everybody has it except them. They think that \nargument is quite ironic.\n  The argument against this, that it will cost the public schools \nmoney--Mr. President, do words have meaning? It gives the public \nschools more money, $13 million more than they would otherwise get. If \nthe scholarships don't work, they will get more. The $13 million will \nrevert to the Treasury and we can give that to them as well.\n  I have already gone over the argument that it was foisted on the \nMayor. It wasn't. Boy, if it is, he is doing a pretty good job dealing \nwith something that was foisted on him. I saw him down here in the \nSenate the other day.\n  I don't like to burden the Senate too much with my speeches. It is \nonly when I have dealt with something for a while where I feel strongly \nabout something. I do about this issue. I appreciate the opportunity to \ntalk and I appreciate the passion and the sincerity of those who oppose \nthis.\n  I would like to reach out and say to folks, let's try this year. I \nthink it is going to work. These parents think it is going to work. We \nhad 10,000 people line up in 1997 for 1,000 part-time scholarships. \nLet's give these kids a chance. I think we will be glad we did, if we \nwill vote this in.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here this morning to announce that \nwe will have a markup of the supplemental request presented by the \nPresident, the emergency supplemental request for Iraq, on Tuesday \nmorning at 10 a.m. I wish to state some of the reasons that I have \nscheduled this hearing.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld appeared before our committee and made several \nstatements. I want to repeat a few quotes from his statement to our \ncommittee. He said:\n\n       Standing between our people and the gathering dangers is \n     the courage of our men and women in uniform.\n\n[[Page S12038]]\n\n       The vast majority of the funds the President has requested \n     are going to troops who are risking their lives in this \n     struggle. Of the $87 billion the President requests, $66 \n     billion is to support ongoing military operations, money for \n     military pay, fuel, transportation, maintenance, weapons, \n     equipment, lifesaving body armor, ammunition, and other \n     critical military needs.\n\n  Further on he says:\n\n       So $66 billion or 75 percent of this request is for troops. \n     They need it and they need it soon.\n\n  Again, continuing on through his statement, he pointed out that:\n\n       In less than 5 months virtually all major Iraqi hospitals \n     and universities have been reopened and hundreds of secondary \n     schools, a few months ago most often used as weapons caches, \n     these have been rebuilt and are ready to start the fall \n     semester; 70,000 Iraqis have been armed and trained in just a \n     few months and have been contributing to the security and \n     defense of their country. A new Army is being trained. More \n     than 40,000 Iraqi troops are conducting joint patrols with \n     coalition forces. By contrast, it took 14 months to establish \n     a police force in post-Germany, and 10 years to begin \n     training a new German Army.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       As security improves, so does commerce. Some 5,000 Iraqi \n     small businesses opened since the liberation on May 1 and the \n     Iraqi Central Bank was established and a new currency \n     announced just two months ago--accomplishments that would \n     have taken 3 years in postwar Germany.\n\n  He mentioned other items. He said that all of this and more has taken \nplace in less than 5 months. The speed and breadth of what Ambassador \nBremer, GEN Tom Franks, GEN Rick Sanchez, and GEN Abizaid and the \ncivilian military and civilian teams have accomplished is impressive \nand it may be without historical parallel, whether compared to postwar \nJapan, Germany, Bosnia, or Kosovo.\n  I listened with great interest to the Secretary of Defense, and I am \nconvinced he has made the case for the early consideration of this \nsupplemental.\n  Before the Armed Services Committee, my distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd, asked Ambassador Bremer:\n\n       I believe you said you didn't need the money until January. \n     I believe you said in the Appropriations Committee or in the \n     Democratic caucus--whichever request it was. Is that a fact?\n\n  Ambassador Bremer said:\n\n       No, Senator. We need this money right away. I think there \n     is some confusion. I was asked a specific question which was, \n     When does the Iraqi government run out of money? And I said \n     sometime in January. That's not the same as this. We have got \n     to get these reconstruction programs going right away as \n     quickly as possible. There is nothing more urgent.\n\n  Later, in response to a question by Senator Warner, Ambassador Bremer \nsaid:\n\n       Yes, Senator. This is the most important thing that is \n     accelerated by the supplemental. There are the security parts \n     where we can speed up the training of the Iraqi army; instead \n     of taking two years, take one. We can't do that without more \n     money speeding up particularly the training of the Iraqi \n     police force which requires almost $2 billion. Each month \n     that goes by where we don't start those projects is a month \n     longer where those guys potentially leave our troops with \n     some of the duties that I have outlined in my statement. The \n     same is true for the infrastructure. We need to get started \n     letting contracts that we have to open--that we have to open \n     bids. It is going to take time. If we can get started to get \n     those bids started now quickly, we can get the repairs \n     started quickly.\n\n  Chairman Warner asked General Abizaid:\n\n       Is there a correlation, in your professional judgement, \n     General?\n\n  The general said:\n\n       Sir, there certainly is. The more the Iraqis are policing \n     and patrolling the security work to defend their own country \n     the sooner we will be able to draw down our forces and the \n     sooner we will be able to turn over the country to the \n     rightful owners, which are the Iraqis.\n\n  Chairman Warner asked:\n\n       It has a correlation to the tragic death, loss of life and \n     limb by our forces and our coalition. Am I correct?\n\n  General Abizaid said:\n\n       Sir, there is a correlation. We should all make sure we \n     understand as long as American troops are in Iraq there will \n     be casualties.\n\n  I take the position that winning the war on terrorism requires us to \nfinish our job in Iraq. Very clearly, we are in a different situation \nnow than we were in World War II. In World War II, after the defeat of \nthe Nazis, we went to the point of having an occupation force there for \nover 4 years. That occupation force had a military government. We have \ndetermined not to establish a military government in Iraq. We want to \nmove toward having the Iraqis themselves start a new form of government \nfor themselves. In doing so, we are in a position where the lives of \nour soldiers and our military there in Iraq depend upon the speed with \nwhich these people can establish their own government and their own \nmilitary.\n  I came across an article this past week in the RAND Review for the \nsummer of 2003. It is a most interesting article about ``The \nInescapable Responsibility of the World's Only Superpower.'' It points \nout that, from Germany to Afghanistan, we had a period of training. In \nterms of the training for the operations we are facing now in Iraq, \neach succeeding effort--what this person calls ``nation building''--was \nsomewhat better managed than the previous one. This article compares \nGermany, Japan, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan to Iraq \nin terms of the problems we face.\n  I find it very interesting to note, quoting the article:\n\n       Among the recent operations, the United States and its \n     allies have put 25 times more money and 50 times more troops \n     on a per capita basis in post-conflict Kosovo than into post-\n     conflict Afghanistan.\n\n  We are already learning how to move forward and establish the new \ngovernments in the countries we are involved with. Afghanistan is a \ngood example.\n  If you follow through on what this person is stating, he is taking \nthe position of the RAND organization:\n\n       We at RAND believe that Iraq will require substantial \n     external funds for humanitarian assistance and budgetary \n     support. It is highly unlikely that taxes on the Iraqi oil \n     sector will be adequate to fund the reconstruction of the \n     Iraqi economy in the near future. Judging by the experience \n     of Bosnia and Kosovo, territories that have higher per capita \n     incomes than Iraq, budgetary support will be necessary for \n     quite some time. To manage immediate operating expenditures, \n     we suggest that post-conflict authorities in Iraq first \n     establish a reasonable level of expenditures, then create a \n     transparent tax system and ask foreign donors to pick up the \n     difference.\n\n  We have a donors' conference scheduled later next month.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction with the \n     objective of promoting a transition to democracy appear to be \n     the inescapable responsibility of the world's only \n     superpower. Therefore, in addition to securing the major \n     resources that will be needed to carry through the current \n     operation in Iraq success, the United States ought to make \n     the smaller long-term investments in its own institutional \n     capacity to conduct such operations.\n\n  I find this article very interesting in terms of the problems we \nface. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at the \nend of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  See exhibit 1.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, going back to the statements made before \nour committee, as Ambassador Bremer said to us on September 22:\n\n       There are some things I would like to point out about this \n     $87 billion request. No one part of the supplemental is \n     indispensable and no part is more important than the others. \n     This is a carefully considered request. This is urgent. The \n     urgency of military operations is self-evident. The funds for \n     nonmilitary action in Iraq are equally urgent. Most Iraqis \n     welcome us as liberators and we glow with the pleasure of \n     that welcome. Now the reality of foreign troops on the \n     streets is starting to chafe. Some Iraqis are beginning to \n     regard us as occupiers and not as liberators. Some of this is \n     inevitable, but faster progress in reconstruction will help. \n     Unless this supplemental passes quickly, the Iraqis will face \n     darkness eight hours daily. The safety of our troops is \n     indirect but real. The people who ambush our troops are small \n     in number and do not do so because they have undependable \n     electricity. However, the population of a few is directly \n     related to their cooperation in hunting down those who attack \n     us. Earlier progress gives an edge against terrorists.\n\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I take the position that \nwe should act as quickly as possible on this bill. If we can get it to \nthird reading before we leave here the next week, the House will act on \nthe bill while we are gone. We can marry our version of the bill to the \nHouse version of the bill here in the Senate and take it up the first \nweek we are back after the recess.\n\n[[Page S12039]]\n\nIf we do that, we should be able to get this bill to the President and \nto the Department of Defense and to Ambassador Bremer's operation by \nmid-October at the latest. It is urgent we do that.\n  We have the option to demonstrate to the world we are not going there \nto occupy Iraq. We did not intend to occupy Iraq. As a matter of fact, \nunder the Iraq Liberation Act enacted in 1998, Congress stated the \npolicy:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic \n     government to replace that regime.\n\n  Further, it stated:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress once the Saddam Hussein \n     regime is removed from power in Iraq, the United States \n     should support Iraq's transition to democracy by providing \n     immediate and substantial humanitarian assistance to the \n     Iraqi people, by providing democracy transition to Iraqi \n     parties and movements with democratic goals, and by convening \n     Iraq's foreign creditors to develop a multilateral response \n     to Iraq's foreign debt incurred by Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to escape the long \ndelay of military occupation and carry out our goal of liberation of \nthe Iraqi people as we decided in 1998.\n  It is essential we proceed with this markup and get the bill to the \nSenate as quickly as possible. It is my hope it would be on the floor \nby Tuesday night. I hope the leader will give us the time during the \nnext week to take this bill, that provides the funds, to third reading \nso we can act as an Appropriations Committee in conjunction with our \ncolleagues from the House on the bill they will produce when we are on \nrecess.\n  Nothing is more important than demonstrating to those people in \nuniform in Iraq that we mean business. We need this money. There is no \nquestion they need this money.\n  Because of the requests made during the debate on the last \nsupplemental, we convinced the administration to submit a 2004 Defense \nbill. The 2004 Defense bill did not contain any money for Iraq. That \nwas in the separate supplemental submitted to us in response to the \nrequest from the Congress to do just that.\n  For the first time in history the President has requested money in \nadvance to conduct a war. All Presidents in the past have taken money \nfrom existing Government funds, spent them, and then came to Congress \nto replace the funds from which those moneys were taken.\n  This President submitted a concise request. As a matter of fact, one \nMember of the other side of the aisle in the budget markup asked for \n$100 billion for the Iraqi defense activities. This President asked for \na total of $66 billion plus $20.3 billion for the activities conducted \nunder Ambassador Bremer's aegis to hasten the ability of the Iraqi \npeople to take over their own government, their own security, and their \nown future.\n  If we can act quickly, we can escape a long period of occupation. \nCompare the two sections of this bill: $66 billion for defense, $20 \nbillion for the humanitarian and governmental activities. The longer we \nkeep our troops in Iraq, the more expensive it will become from a \nmilitary point of view. The sooner we can help these people establish \ntheir own government, provide their own security, their own army, the \nsooner we can bring our people out of Iraq and release these \nextraordinary expenses. The President has enabled us to view those \nexpenses.\n  The bill we just passed, and the President will soon sign for 2004 \nfor Department of Defense, does not contain money for Iraq. The money \nfor Iraq is in a separate bill and demonstrates to everyone how \nexpensive it is to keep an army in Iraq.\n  Our goal is to get that $20.3 billion as quickly as possible.

Not all \n     these hard-won lessons have yet been fully applied to \n     America's most recent nation-building efforts in Afghanistan \n     and Iraq.\n       We define nation-building as ``the use of armed force in \n     the aftermath of a conflict to underpin an enduring \n     transition to democracy.'' We have compared the levels of \n     progress toward this goal among seven historical cases: \n     Germany, Japan, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and \n     Afghanistan. These are the most important instances in which \n     American military power has been used in the aftermath of a \n     conflict to underpin democratization elsewhere around the \n     world since World War II.\n       From our review of the historical cases, we at RAND have \n     derived a number of overarching conclusions:\n       Many factors--such as prior democratic experience, level of \n     economic development, and social homogeneity--can influence \n     the ease or difficulty of nation-building, but the single \n     most important controllable determinant seems to be the level \n     of effort, as measured in troops, money, and time. \n     Multilateral nation-building is more complex and time-\n     consuming than a unilateral approach. But the multilateral \n     approach is considerably less expensive for individual \n     participants.\n       Multilateral nation-building can produce more thorough \n     transformations and greater regional reconciliation than can \n     unilateral efforts.\n       United of command is as essential in peace operations as it \n     is in war. This unity of command can be achieved even in \n     operations with broad multilateral participation when the \n     major participants share a common vision and tailor the \n     response of international institutions accordingly.\n       There appears to be an inverse correlation between the size \n     of the military stabilization force and the level of \n     casualties. The higher the proportion of troops relative to \n     the resident population, the lower the number of casualties \n     suffered and inflicted. Indeed, most of the post-conflict \n     operations that were generously manned suffered no casualties \n     at all.\n       Neighboring states can exert significance influence, for \n     good or bad. It is nearly impossible to put together a \n     fragmented nation if its neighbors try to tear it apart. \n     Every effort should be made to secure their support.\n       Accountability for past injustices can be a powerful \n     component of democratization. Such accountability can be \n     among the most difficult and controversial aspects of any \n     nation-building endeavor, however, and therefore should be \n     attempted only if there is a deep and long-term commitment to \n     the overall operation.\n       There is no quick fix for nation-building. None of our \n     cases was successfully completed in less than seven years.\n       These lesions are drawn from the ``best practices'' of \n     nation-building over the past 60 years. We explain the \n     lessons in greater detail below and then suggest how they \n     might be applied to future operations and, in particular, \n     to Iraq. Although the combat phase of the war against Iraq \n     went very well and the regime collapsed much faster than \n     many had expected, the United States has been left with \n     the unenviable task of seeking to build a democratic, \n     economically vibrant Iraqi nation.\n\n\n                      From Germany to Afghanistan\n\n       The cases of Germany and Japan set a standard for post-\n     conflict nation-building that has not been matched since. \n     Both were comprehensive efforts at social, political, and \n     economic reconstruction. These successes demonstrated that \n     democracy was transferable, that societies could be \n     encouraged to transform themselves, and that major \n     transformations could endure.\n       For the next 40 years, there were few attempts to replicate \n     these early successes. During the cold war with the Soviet \n     Union, America employed its military power to preserve the \n     status quo, not to alter it; to manage crises, not to resolve \n     the underlying problems; to overthrow unfriendly regimes and \n     reinstall friendly ones, not to bring about fundamental \n     societal change.\n       After 1989, a policy of global containment of the Soviet \n     Union no longer impelled the United States to preserve the \n     status quo. Washington was now free to overlook regional \n     instability in places like Yugoslavia and Afghanistan as long \n     as the instability did not directly threaten American \n     interests. At the same time, though, the United States had \n     the unprecedented opportunity of using its unrivaled power to \n     resolve, not just to manage or to contain, international \n     problems of strategic importance. In addition, the United \n     States could secure broader international support for such \n     efforts than ever before.\n       Throughout the 1990s, each successive post-cold war effort \n     became wider in scope and more ambitious in intent than its \n     predecessor had been. In Somalia, the original objective was \n     purely humanitarian but was subsequently expanded to \n     democratization. In Haiti, the objective was to reinstall a \n     president and to conduct elections according to an existing \n     constitution. In Bosnia, the objective was to create a \n     multiethnic state out of a former Yugoslav republic. In \n     Kosovo, the objective was to establish a democratic polity \n     and market economy virtually from scratch.\n       From Somalia in 1992 to Kosovo in 1999, each nation-\n     building effort was somewhat better managed than the previous \n     one (see table). Somalia was the nadir. Everything\n\n[[Page S12040]]\n\n     that could go wrong did. The operation culminated in the \n     withdrawal of U.S. troops in 1994 after a sharp tactical \n     setback that had resulted in 18 American deaths in October \n     1993. This reverse, which became memorialized in the book and \n     film ``Black Hawk Down,'' was largely the result of an \n     unnecessarily complicated U.S. and United Nations command \n     structure that had three distinct forces operating with three \n     distinct chains of command. Despite its failure, the Somalia \n     mission taught America crucial lessons for the future. One \n     was the importance of unity of command in peace operations as \n     well as in war. Second was the need to scale mission\n\n                                      AMERICA'S HISTORY OF NATION-BUILDING\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Country or                                              International\n    territory           Years        Peak U.S. troops       cooperation         Assessment      Lessons learned\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWest Germany....  1945-1952.......  1.6 million.......

A \n     third lesson was the importance of deploying significant \n     numbers of international police alongside international \n     military forces to places where the local law enforcement \n     institutions had disappeared or become illegitimate.\n       America applied these lessons to Haiti in the mid-1990s. We \n     had unity of command throughout the operation. We did not \n     have parallel American and allied forces. We had a single \n     force under a single command with a clear hierarchy of \n     decisionmaking. We deployed a large number of police within \n     weeks of the military deployment, and the police were armed \n     with both weapons and arrest authority. Unfortunately, we \n     were obsessed with exit strategies and exit deadlines in the \n     wake of the Somalia debacle. So we pulled out of Haiti with \n     the job at best half done.\n       The Bosnia experience of the late 1990s, was more \n     successful. We set an exit deadline but wisely ignored it \n     when the time came. On the negative side, there was a lack of \n     coordination between the military stabilization efforts of \n     NATO and those organizations responsible for civilian \n     reconstruction. Consequently, the authority for implementing \n     the civilian reconstruction projects became fragmented among \n     numerous competing institutions. To complicate the situation \n     further, the international police who had been deployed were \n     armed with neither weapons nor arrest authority.\n       By the time of the Kosovo conflict in 1999, we and our \n     allies had absorbed most of these lessons. We then made \n     smarter choices in Kosovo. We achieved unity of command on \n     both the civil and military sides. As in Bosnia, NATO was \n     responsible for military operations. On the civil side, we \n     established a clear hierarchical structure under a United \n     Nations representative. Leadership was shared effectively \n     between Europe and the United States. Working together, we \n     deployed nearly 5,000 well-armed police alongside military \n     peacekeepers. Although far from perfect, the arrangement was \n     more successful than it had been in Bosnia.\n       During his presidential campaign in 2000, George W. Bush \n     criticized the Clinton administration for this expansive \n     nation-building agenda. As president, Bush adopted a more \n     modest set of objectives when faced with a comparable \n     challenge in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the attempt to \n     reverse the trend toward ever larger and more ambitious U.S.-\n     led nation-building operations has proven short-lived. In \n     Iraq, the United States has taken on a task comparable in its \n     vast scope to the transformational efforts still under way in \n     Bosnia and Kosovo and comparable in its enormous scale to the \n     earlier American occupations of Germany and Japan. Nation-\n     building, it appears, is the inescapable responsibility of \n     the world's only superpower.\n\n\n                   Quantitative Comparisons of Cases\n\n       For each of the seven historical cases of nation-building, \n     we at RAND compared quantitative data on the ``inputs'' \n     (troops, money, and time) and ``outputs.'' The outputs \n     included casualties (or lack thereof), democratic elections, \n     and increases in per capita gross domestic product (GDP).\n       Troop levels varied widely across the cases. The levels \n     ranged from 1.6 million U.S. troops in the American sector in \n     Germany at the end of World War II to 14,000 U.S. and \n     international troops currently in Afghanistan. Gross numbers, \n     however, are not the most useful numbers for comparison, \n     because the size and populations of the nations being built \n     have been so disparate. We chose instead to compare the \n     numbers of U.S. and foreign soldiers per thousand inhabitants \n     in each occupied territory. We then compared the proportional \n     force levels at specified times after the conflict ended (or \n     after the U.S. rebuilding efforts began).\n       Figure 1 shows the number of international troops (or in \n     the German and Japanese cases, U.S. troops) per thousand \n     inhabitants in each territory at the outset of the \n     intervention and at various intervals thereafter. As the data \n     illustrate, even the proportional force levels vary immensely \n     across the operations. (The levels vary so tremendously that \n     they require a logarithmic, or exponential, scale for \n     manageable illustration.)\n       Bosnia, Kosovo, and particularly the U.S.-occupied sector \n     of Germany started with substantial proportions of military \n     forces, whereas the initial levels in Japan, Somalia, Haiti, \n     and especially Afghanistan were much more modest. The \n     levels generally decreased over time. In Germany, the \n     level then rose again for reasons having to do with the \n     cold war. Overall, the differences in force levels across \n     the cases had significant implications for other aspects \n     of the operations.\n       Figure 2 compares the amount of foreign economic aid per \n     capita (in constant 2001 U.S. dollars) provided to six of the \n     territories during the first two years. Although Germany \n     received the most aid in raw dollar terms ($12 billion), the \n     country did not rank high on a per capita basis. Per capita \n     assistance there ran a little over $200. Kosovo, which ranked \n     fourth in terms of total assistance, received over $800 per \n     resident. With the second-highest level of economic \n     assistance per capita, Kosovo enjoyed the most rapid recovery \n     in levels of per capita GDP. In contrast, Haiti, which \n     received much less per capita than Kosovo, has experienced \n     little growth in per capita GDP.\n       Germany and Japan both stand out as unequaled success \n     stories. One of the most important questions is why both \n     operations fared so well compared with the others. The \n     easiest answer is that Germany and Japan were already highly \n     developed and economically advanced societies. This certainly \n     explains why it was easier to reconstruct their economies \n     than it was to reconstruct those in the other territories. \n     But economics is not a sufficient answer to explain the \n     transition to democracy. The spread of democracy to poor \n     countries in Latin America, Asia, and parts of Africa \n     suggests that this form of government is not unique to \n     advanced industrial economies. Indeed, democracy can take \n     root in countries where neither Western culture nor \n     significant economic development exists. Nation-building is \n     not principally about economic reconstruction, but rather \n     about political transformation.\n       Because Germany and Japan were also ethnically homogeneous \n     societies, some people might argue that homogeneity is the \n     key to success. We believe that homogeneity helps greatly but \n     that it is not essential, either. It is true that Somalia, \n     Haiti, and Afghanistan are divided ethnically, \n     socioeconomically, or tribally in ways that Germany and Japan \n     were not. However, the kinds of communal hatred that mark \n     Somalia, Haiti, and Afghanistan are even more pronounced in \n     Bosnia and Kosovo, where the process of democratization has \n     nevertheless made some progress.\n       What principally distinguishes Germany, Japan, Bosnia, and \n     Kosovo from Somalia, Haiti, and Afghanistan is not their \n     levels of Western culture, democratic history, economic \n     development, or ethnic homogeneity. Rather, the principal \n     distinction is the level of effort that the United States and \n     the international community have put into the democratic \n     transformations. Among the recent operations, the United \n     States and its allies have put 25 times more money and 50 \n     times more troops on a per capita basis into post-conflict \n     Kosovo than into post-conflict Afghanistan. These higher \n     levels of input account in significant measure for the higher \n     levels of output in terms of democratic institution-building \n     and economic growth.\n\n[[Page S12041]]\n\n       Japan, one of the two undoubted successes, fully meets the \n     criterion regarding the duration of time devoted to its \n     transformation. In the first two years, Japan received \n     considerably less external economic assistance per capita \n     than did Germany, Bosnia, or Kosovo, indeed less than Haiti \n     and about the same amount as Afghanistan. Japan's \n     correspondingly low post-conflict economic growth rates \n     reflect this fact. Japan's subsequent growth of the 1950s, \n     spurred by American spending linked to the Korean War, helped \n     to consolidate public support for the democratic reforms that \n     had been put in place in the immediate postwar years. As with \n     the German economic miracle of the 1950s, the experience in \n     Japan suggests that rising economic prosperity is not so much \n     a necessary precursor to political reform as a highly \n     desirable successor and legitimizing factor.\n       In proportion to its population, Japan also had a smaller \n     military stabilization force (or, as it was then termed, \n     occupation force) than did Germany, Bosnia, or Kosovo, \n     although the force was larger than those in Haiti and \n     Afghanistan. The ability to secure Japan with a comparatively \n     small force relates to both the willing collaboration of the \n     Japanese power structures and the homogeneity of the \n     population. A third important factor was the unprecedented \n     scale of Japan's defeat--the devastation and consequent \n     intimidation wrought by years of total war, culminating in \n     the fire bombing of its cities and finally two nuclear \n     attacks. In situations where the conflict has been terminated \n     less conclusively and destructively (or not terminated at \n     all), such as Somalia, Afghanistan, and most recently Iraq, \n     we have seen more difficult post-conflict security \n     challenges. Indeed, it seems that the more swift and \n     bloodless the military victory, the more difficult can be the \n     task of post-conflict stabilization.\n       The seven historical cases have differed in terms of \n     duration. The record suggests that although staying long does \n     not guarantee success, leaving early assures failure. To \n     date, no effort at enforced democratization has been brought \n     to a successful conclusion in less than seven years.\n\n\n                            unity of command\n\n       Throughout the 1990s, the United States wrestled with the \n     challenge of gaining wider participation in its nation-\n     building endeavors while also preserving adequate unity of \n     command. In Somalia and Haiti, the United States experimented \n     with sequential arrangements in which it initially managed \n     and funded the operations but then quickly turned \n     responsibility over to the United Nations. In Bosnia, the \n     United States succeeded in achieving both broad participation \n     and unity of command on the military side of the operation \n     through NATO. But in Bosnia the United States resisted the \n     logic of achieving a comparable and cohesive arrangement on \n     the civil side. In Kosovo, the United States achieved broad \n     participation and unity of command on both the military and \n     civil sides by working through NATO and the United Nations.\n       None of these models proved entirely satisfactory. However, \n     the arrangements in Kosovo seem to have provided the best \n     amalgam to date of American leadership, European and other \n     participation, financial burden-sharing, and unity of \n     command. Every international official in Kosovo works \n     ultimately for either the NATO commander or the Special \n     Representative of the U.N. Secretary General. Neither of \n     these is an American. But by virtue of America's credibility \n     in the region and America's influence in NATO and on the U.N. \n     Security council, the United States has been able to maintain \n     a satisfactory leadership role while fielding only 16 percent \n     of the peacekeeping troops and paying only 16 percent of the \n     reconstruction costs.\n       The efficacy of the Bosnia and Kosovo models has depended \n     on the ability of the United States and its principal allies \n     to attain a common vision of the objectives and then to \n     coordinate the relevant institutions--principally NATO, \n     the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \n     the European Union, and the United Nations--to meet the \n     objectives. These two models offer a viable fusion of \n     burden-sharing and unity of command.\n       In Afghanistan, in contrast, the United States opted for \n     parallel arrangements on the military side and even greater \n     divergence on the civil side. An international force--with no \n     U.S. participation--operates in the capital of Kabul, while a \n     national and mostly U.S. force operates everywhere else. The \n     United Nations has responsibility for promoting political \n     transformation, while individual donors coordinate economic \n     reconstruction--or, more often, fail to do so.\n       The arrangement in Afghanistan is a marginal improvement \n     over that in Somalia, because the separate U.S. and \n     international forces are at least not operating in the same \n     physical space. But the arrangement represents a clear \n     regression from what we achieved in Haiti, Bosnia, or, in \n     particular, Kosovo. It is therefore not surprising that the \n     overall results achieved to date in Afghanistan are better \n     than in Somalia, not yet better than in Haiti, and not as \n     good as in Bosnia or Kosovo. The operation in Afghanistan, \n     though, is a good deal less expensive than those in Bosnia or \n     Kosovo.\n\n\n                      Applying the Lessons to Iraq\n\n       The challenges facing the United States in Iraq today are \n     formidable. Still, it is possible to draw valuable lessons \n     from America's previous experiences with nation-building. \n     There are four main lessons to be learned for Iraq.\n       The first lesson is that democratic nation-building can \n     work given sufficient inputs of resources. These inputs, \n     however, can be very high. Regarding military forces, Figure \n     3 takes the numbers of troops used in the previous cases of \n     nation-building and projects, for each, a proportionally \n     equivalent force for the Iraqi population over the next \n     decade. For example, if Kosovo levels of troop commitments \n     were deployed to Iraq, the number would be some 500,000 U.S. \n     and coalition troops through 2005. (There are roughly 150,000 \n     coalition troops stationed in Iraq today.) To provide troop \n     coverage at Bosnia levels, the requisite troop figures would \n     be 460,000 initially, falling to 258,000 by 2005 and 145,000 \n     by 2008.\n       In addition to military forces, it is often important to \n     deploy a significant number of international civil police. To \n     achieve a level comparable to the nearly 5,000 police \n     deployed in Kosovo, Iraq would need an infusion of 53,000 \n     international civil police officers through 2005 (in addition \n     to the forces represented in Figure 3).\n       It is too early to predict with accuracy the required \n     levels of foreign aid, but we can draw comparisons with the \n     previous historical cases. Figure 4 takes the amount of \n     foreign aid provided in six of the seven previous cases of \n     nation-building and projects proportionally equivalent \n     figures for the Iraqi population over the next two years. If \n     Bosnia levels of foreign aid per capita were provided to \n     Iraq, the country would require some $36 billion in aid from \n     now through 2005. Conversely, aid at the same level as \n     Afghanistan would total $1 billion over the next two \n     years.\n       We at RAND believe that Iraq will require substantial \n     external funds for humanitarian assistance and budgetary \n     support. It is highly unlikely that taxes on the Iraqi oil \n     sector will be adequate to fund the reconstruction of the \n     Iraqi economy in the near future. Judging by the experiences \n     of Bosnia and Kosovo, territories that have higher per capita \n     incomes than Iraq, budgetary support will be necessary for \n     quite some time. To manage immediate operating expenditures, \n     we suggest that the post-conflict authorities in Iraq first \n     establish a reasonable level of expenditures, then create a \n     transparent tax system, and ask foreign donors to pick up the \n     difference until the nation gets on its feet. We believe that \n     this will be the most efficacious avenue to economic \n     recovery.\n       At the same time, we suspect that Iraq will not receive the \n     same per capita levels of foreign troops, police, or economic \n     aid as did either Bosnia or Kosovo. Figures of 500,000 troops \n     or $36 billion in aid are beyond the capacity of even the \n     world's only superpower to generate or sustain. Even half \n     those levels will require the United States to broaden \n     participation in Iraq's post-conflict stabilization and \n     reconstruction well beyond the comparatively narrow coalition \n     that fought the war, thereby mounting a broader international \n     effort on the Balkan models. According to the lessons \n     learned, the ultimate consequences for Iraq of a failure to \n     generate adequate international manpower and money are likely \n     to be lower levels of security, higher casualties sustained \n     and inflicted, lower economic growth rates, and slower, less \n     thoroughgoing political transformation.\n       The second lesson for Iraq is that short departure \n     deadlines are incompatible with nation-building. The United \n     States will succeed only if it makes a long-term commitment \n     to establishing strong democratic institutions and does not \n     beat a hasty retreat tied to artificial deadlines. Moreover, \n     setting premature dates for early national elections can be \n     counterproductive.\n       Third, important hindrances to nation-building include both \n     internal fragmentation (along political, ethnic, or sectarian \n     lines) and a lack of external support from neighboring \n     states. Germany and Japan had homogeneous societies. Bosnia \n     and Kosovo had neighbors that, following the democratic \n     transitions in Croatia and Serbia, collaborated with the \n     international community. Iraq could combine the worst of both \n     worlds, lacking both internal cohesion and regional support. \n     The United States should consider putting a consultative \n     mechanism in place, on the model of the Peace Implementation \n     Council in the Balkans or the ``Two Plus Six'' group that \n     involved Afghanistan's six neighbors plus Russia and the \n     United States, as a means of consulting with the neighboring \n     countries of Iraq.\n       Fourth, building a democracy, a strong economy, and long-\n     term legitimacy depends in each case on striking the balance \n     between international burden-sharing and unity of command. As \n     noted above, the United States is unlikely to be able to \n     generate adequate levels of troops, money, or endurance as \n     long as it relies principally upon the limited coalition with \n     which if fought the war. On the other hand, engaging a \n     broader coalition, to include major countries that will \n     expect to secure influence commensurate with their \n     contributions, will require either new institutional \n     arrangements or the extension of existing ones, such as NATO.\n       In its early months, the American-led stabilization and \n     reconstruction of Iraq have not gone as smoothly as might be \n     expected, given abundant, recent, and relevant American \n     experience. This is, after all, the sixth major nation-\n     building enterprise the United States has mounted in eleven \n     years, and the fifth in a Muslim nation or province.\n\n[[Page S12042]]\n\n       Many of the initial difficulties in Iraq have been \n     encountered elsewhere. Somalia, Haiti, Kosovo, and \n     Afghanistan also experienced the rapid and utter collapse of \n     their prior regimes. In each of those instances, the local \n     police, courts, penal services, and militaries were \n     destroyed, disrupted, disbanded, and/or discredited. They \n     were consequently unavailable to fill the post-conflict \n     security gap. In Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan, \n     extremist elements emerged to fill the resultant vacuum of \n     power. In all five cases, organized crime quickly developed \n     into a major challenge to the occupying authority.\n       In Bosnia and Kosovo, the external stabilization forces \n     ultimately proved adequate to surmount these challenges. In \n     Somalia and Afghanistan, they did not or have not yet, \n     respectively.\n       Throughout the 1990s, the management of each major \n     stabilization and reconstruction mission represented a \n     marginal advance over its predecessor, but in the past \n     several years this modestly positive learning curve has not \n     been sustained. The Afghan mission cannot yet be deemed more \n     successful than the one in Haiti. It is certainly too early \n     to evaluate the success of the Iraqi nation-building mission, \n     but its first few months do not raise it above those in \n     Bosnia and Kosovo at a similar stage.\n       Over the past decade, the United States has made major \n     investments in the combat efficiency of its forces. The \n     return on investment has been evident in the dramatic \n     improvements demonstrated from one campaign to the next, from \n     Desert Storm to the Kosovo air campaign to Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom. But there has been no comparable increase in the \n     capacity of U.S. armed forces, or of U.S. civilian agencies \n     for that matter, to conduct post-combat stabilization and \n     reconstruction operations.\n       Nation-building has been a controversial mission over the \n     past decade, and the extent of this controversy has \n     undoubtedly curtailed the investments needed to do these \n     tasks better. So has institutional resistance in both the \n     state and defense departments, neither of which regards \n     nation-building among its core missions. As a result, \n     successive administrations tend to treat each new such \n     mission as if it were the first and, more importantly, the \n     last.\n       This expectation is unlikely to be realized any time soon. \n     In the 1990s, the Clinton administration conducted a major \n     nation-building intervention, on the average, every two \n     years. The current administration, despite a strong \n     disinclination to engage American armed forces in these \n     activities, has launched two major such enterprises in a \n     period of eighteen months.\n       Post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction with the \n     objective of promoting a transition to democracy appear to be \n     the inescapable responsibility of the world's only \n     superpower. Therefore, in addition to securing the major \n     resources that will be needed to carry through the current \n     operation in Iraq to success, the United States ought to make \n     the smaller long-term investments in its own institutional \n     capacity to conduct such operations. In this way, the ongoing \n     improvements in combat performance of American forces could \n     be matched by improvements in the post-conflict performance \n     of our government as a whole.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

We \nwould be pleased to receive it if there is such a letter indicating \nsupport for this three-sector approach, because all we have is the \n``Statement of Secretary of Education Rod Paige On the DC School Choice \nInitiative Before the House Committee on Government Reform,'' dated \nJune 24, 2003.\n  I have spent the last 30 minutes reviewing again the statement, which \nI had read once before, and there was no mention at all in this \nstatement of any three-sector approach. It is approximately 20 pages \nlong, and I have highlighted every reference to the choice initiative \nfund proposed by the President, and there is no reference in here for \ncharter schools or for education reform for traditional public schools.\n  So I want to submit this statement for the Record. That is all we \nhave on this side. If there is a new statement from the Secretary, we \nwould be happy to review it. I ask unanimous consent that the statement \nof Secretary Paige be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Secretary of Education Rod Paige on the DC School Choice \n Initiative Before the House Committee on Government Reform, June 24, \n                                  2003\n\n       Chairman Davis and members of the Committee, thank you for \n     the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the \n     Bush Administration's proposal to initiate a program to \n     expand school choice in the District of Columbia in fiscal \n     year 2004. I welcome the opportunity to describe our proposal \n     and explain our reasons for putting it forward. I am also \n     very pleased to appear at this hearing with Mayor Anthony \n     Williams, who has been, and will continue to be, our partner \n     in developing this initiative. I truly appreciate the Mayor's \n     willingness to work with us, and the relationship we have \n     developed around the simple idea that wider educational \n     options can benefit the children of the District of Columbia.\n       This hearing occurs very close to the anniversary of a very \n     historic moment in the history of educational choice in \n     America. On Friday, we will observe the one-year anniversary \n     of the Supreme Court's decision in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, \n     the case that determined that a properly structured school \n     voucher program is constitutional. When the Court announced \n     that decision, I hailed it as one that could open doors of \n     opportunity to thousands of children and could transform the \n     educational landscape in our country. That statement is worth \n     repeating today, as we think about how to improve and reform \n     elementary and secondary education in Washington, DC.\n       Mr. Chairman, I know that officials in my Department and \n     Members of Congress have been concerned about the quality of \n     education in the District of Columbia for many years. D.C. \n     public schools are only a short walk from our offices, we see \n     District students going to and from school each day, and we \n     read about the challenges of the D.C. public schools in the \n     newspapers almost daily. We all want the capital of the \n     greatest nation on earth to have some of the finest schools \n     on earth. At one time this city's schools were considered \n     among the best in the entire Nation. But for many years we \n     have been disappointed by the performance of public schools \n     in the District, and at the seeming inability of public \n     school officials to manage schools and programs effectively.\n       In some respects, the situation in the District may be no \n     different from that in other urban school districts that \n     educate large numbers of children living in poverty, but in \n     other respects the District has sometimes seemed uniquely \n     resistant to reform and improvement. I say that with full \n     respect for Superintendent Vance and with appreciation for \n     what he is trying to accomplish and for some of the things he \n     has achieved, but I think it's the truth.\n       Let's consider the performance of D.C. students on the \n     National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP as it's \n     called, the assessment that measures the performance of \n     students over time in reading, writing, math, and other core \n     academic subjects. In the most recent mathematics assessment, \n     administered in 2000, only 6 percent of D.C. fourth-graders \n     tested at the ``proficient'' or ``advanced'' levels, the \n     levels that show that students have demonstrated competency \n     over challenging subject matter. A lower percentage of \n     students in D.C. demonstrated proficiency than was the case \n     for any State. At the other end of the scale, 76 percent of \n     D.C. fourth-graders scored at the ``below basic'' level, \n     which means that they could not demonstrate even partial \n     mastery of the math skills and knowledge that are appropriate \n     at the fourth-grade level. The 2000 8th grade math results \n     were very similar; only 6 percent of D.C. students tested at \n     the ``proficient'' or ``advanced'' levels, and 77 percent \n     were ``below basic.''\n       The most recent NAEP reading assessment took place in 2002, \n     and the National Assessment Governing Board announced the \n     results just last week. The results for D.C. students were a \n     little better than the 2000 math scores, but still were \n     completely inadequate. Only 10 percent of D.C. fourth-graders \n     could read proficiently, while 69 percent were ``below \n     basic.'' At the 8th grade level, 9 percent were \n     ``proficient'' or ``advanced'' and 52 percent were ``below \n     basic.''\n       Looking at the quality of a school system requires more \n     than just reviewing scores on achievement tests. But when we \n     look at other indicators, they too show that D.C. public \n     schools are not providing the education that children in the \n     District need or deserve. The most recent edition of Quality \n     County, the annual review of education trends and data \n     produced by the newspaper Education Week, gave the District a \n     grade of only a D+ for having an acceptable system of \n     academic standards and accountability, a C in the area of \n     success in recruiting new\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\n     teachers, and a D+ for school climate. The D.C. public school \n     system has a long history of management problems in such \n     important areas as facilities maintenance, personnel and \n     payroll, food service, procurements, and even in accurately \n     counting enrollments. In addition, the system has \n     historically failed to comply with the requirements of \n     Federal programs, such as Title I and Special Education, to a \n     point where the Department has had to enter into compliance \n     agreements with the District that call for implementation of \n     major reforms within specific timelines. We insisted on these \n     agreements not because some paperwork wasn't being filled out \n     correctly, but because the District was, for instance, \n     failing quite egregiously to provide its disabled students \n     with the free appropriate public education required under the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n       I would like to repeat what I said a few minutes ago: I \n     support and respect the work that Paul Vance is doing in the \n     District. I know that he has taken on the major management \n     problems and having been a big-city school superintendent \n     myself, I know that turning around a system is not easy. And \n     Superintendent Vance has shown some results. The District's \n     Stanford-9 achievement test scores for 2002 showed minor \n     improvements at most grade levels in reading and math. And \n     the proliferation of charter schools in the District, \n     including some that have achieved great initial success, has \n     given more choices and greater hopes to students and parents. \n     But I believe the preponderance of information demonstrates \n     that schools in the District are not achieving what they \n     should and that more needs to be done if children in the \n     District are to achieve to the high levels called for under \n     the No Child Left Behind Act.\n       The Bush Administration has responded to this problem by \n     including, in our fiscal year 2004 budget request, a school \n     choice initiative for D.C. You might ask whether expanding \n     educational choice to include private-school options is \n     appropriate for the District, whether it is likely to work, \n     whether giving students wider educational opportunities is \n     likely to help the D.C. public school system improve, and \n     whether we should, instead, request more money for D.C. \n     public schools. Let me address those issues.\n       We believe that the President's budget includes more than \n     adequate support for D.C.'s public schools, including charter \n     schools. Our request for Department of Education elementary \n     and secondary education formula programs would provide some \n     $92 million to the District in 2004, an increase of 15 \n     percent over the level only two years ago (2002). And let's \n     forget that D.C. already spends, per student, more than all \n     but a handful of urban districts across the country. If money \n     were the solution, then we would have solved the problems of \n     public schooling in the District a long time ago. We believe, \n     instead, that tackling this problem will depend in large \n     measure on giving D.C. students more educational choices.\n       In the communities across the country that have \n     experimented with publicly and privately funded school choice \n     programs that include private-school options, the results \n     have been extremely positive, for the students directly \n     served by the programs and for the school system as a whole. \n     For example, research by Patrick Wolf of Georgetown \n     University, along with Paul Peterson and Martin West of \n     Harvard, on the first two years of the scholarship program \n     administered by the privately funded Washington Scholarship \n     Fund (WSF), showed that the math and reading achievement of \n     African-American students who enrolled in private schools \n     using support from the Fund was significantly higher than the \n     achievement of a control group of students who remained in \n     D.C. public schools. This research also found that parents \n     who received support from the Fund gave their children's \n     schools higher ratings than did parents of children in the \n     control group, and that their children were doing more \n     homework. Studies by these and equally eminent scholars in \n     other cities, such as Milwaukee, San Antonio, Cleveland, and \n     Dayton, offer very similar results.\n       What about the charge that voucher programs ``cream'' the \n     best students from the public schools and thereby weaken \n     public school systems? We find no evidence to buttress that \n     claim. To the contrary, research by Caroline Hoxby of Harvard \n     and others has found that students who take advantage of \n     private school choice options are typically at least as \n     educationally and economically disadvantaged as students who \n     remain in the public schools. To some extent, this is because \n     existing choice programs have explicitly targeted children \n     from low-income families, as our initiative would do. But \n     even without this targeting, programs that include private-\n     school options seem to attract students who are no more \n     affluent, and have no better an educational profile, than \n     other students. In addition, there is at least preliminary \n     evidence that school districts in which public schools have \n     been exposed to private-school options seem to attract \n     students who are no more affluent, and have no better an \n     educational profile, than other students. In addition, there \n     is at least preliminary evidence that school districts in \n     which public schools have been exposed to private-school \n     competition, through a choice program, have responded by \n     improving educational services. In Milwaukee and in the \n     Edgewood district in San Antonio, the presence of a choice \n     program was associated with gains in achievement in the \n     public schools.\n       Those findings are consistent with my own experience \n     directing the Houston Independent School District, the \n     Nation's seventh-largest. In Houston, we didn't resist school \n     choice; we embraced it. We created a system of charter \n     schools even before the State did. We let children in low-\n     performing schools take their share of the funding--$3,750 a \n     year--to a private school. I believe that our acceptance of \n     choice, our willingness to compete with charter and public \n     schools, helped us to make the changes we needed to make in \n     order to achieve the learning gains for which we received \n     national acclaim.\n       For these reasons, the Administration has put forward our \n     proposal. The outlines of this proposal are very simple. The \n     President's budget request for fiscal year 2004 includes $75 \n     million for a national Choice Incentive Fund. Under this \n     program, the Department would make grants to support projects \n     that provide low-income parents, particularly those who have \n     children attending low-performing public schools, with the \n     opportunity to transfer their children to higher-performing \n     public and private schools, including charter schools. A \n     portion of the money would be reserved for the District of \n     Columbia.\n       We anticipate making a grant either to the D.C. public \n     school system or to another, independent entity to operate \n     the program in the District. The grantee would then develop \n     and implement procedures for certifying schools to \n     participate in the program, informing D.C. families about the \n     choices available to them, selecting students to participate, \n     and then monitoring and reporting on the program as it goes \n     forward. The proposal in our budget did not specify the \n     maximum amount of assistance an individual student could \n     receive, but we want it to be sufficient to allow students a \n     good choice of educational options.\n       We also see accountability as a major feature of this \n     initiative, because it will give parents in D.C. the ability \n     to hold schools accountable for meeting the educational needs \n     of students. And we will provide for a rigorous evaluation of \n     the project in D.C. (as well as the other projects funded by \n     the national Choice Incentive Fund) by examining the academic \n     achievement of students, parental satisfaction, and other \n     results, so that the lessons can be applied to future \n     programs and initiatives. We want to obtain solid evidence on \n     the benefits of expanding educational options and making \n     schools accountable to parents while respecting the \n     flexibility and freedom of participating private schools.\n       Mr. Chairman, I know that this proposal has engendered a \n     great deal of attention in the media and elsewhere, including \n     some vociferous criticism. Before I end my statement, I would \n     like to respond to some of the major criticisms, to set the \n     record straight.\n       We've heard that the Administration is trying to impose \n     this initiative on the District against the will of its \n     citizens and with no input from its elected and appointed \n     leadership. That is not the case. We have met not only with \n     Mayor Williams, but with Councilman Kevin Chavous, who is the \n     Chairman of the Council's Education Committee, and with \n     School Board President Peggy Cooper Cafritz to discuss our \n     proposal, and we look forward to continuing our discussions \n     with these and other local officials. I would like to commend \n     these officials for the courage they have shown in publicly \n     endorsing a D.C. school choice initiative and their \n     willingness to work with us on the details. We want to \n     implement a choice program that reflects the needs of the \n     District and reflects the input of D.C.'s leadership; we \n     don't pretend to have all the answers.\n       I acknowledge that a choice initiative that includes \n     private school options will probably not, in the end, be what \n     some of the political leaders in the District want. It is, \n     however, what I believe the parents want. The Washington \n     Scholarship Fund has a waiting list of approximately 5,000 \n     children. One D.C. parent, Virginia Walden-Ford, the leader \n     of the D.C. Parents for School Choice, testified before \n     Councilman Chavous's committee and said the following:\n       ``We have received hundreds of calls from parents who have \n     not been lucky enough to get a scholarship through the many \n     scholarship groups in town, WSF, Black Student Fund, etc., \n     and parents who are camping out for charter schools that are \n     not keeping up the pace of parents' need to get out of \n     failing schools. They contact us looking for better options \n     for their children. Parents here in the District are daily \n     expressing their frustration in a school system that is \n     taking too long to fix itself.''\n       I note also that a majority of people in the District of \n     Columbia support choice, including choice that includes \n     private school options. In a 1998 Washington Post poll, 56 \n     percent of D.C. residents said that they supported using \n     Federal money to help send the city's low-income students to \n     private or parochial schools, while only 36 percent opposed. \n     For African-Americans this support was even stronger--60 \n     percent were in favor--and among African-Americans with \n     annual incomes of under $50,000, it was even stronger, with \n     65 percent in favor.\n       We in the Department have also heard that this initiative \n     will bleed money from the District's public schools. That is \n     also not the case. The Choice Incentive Fund proposed by the \n     President represents new money. It was not obtained by \n     subtracting funds from the other Federal programs that \n     support D.C. public schools. If the initiative does not go \n     forward in the District, my guess is that the money will be \n     used in other communities to expand educational choices and \n     improve educational outcomes in those communities.\n       We've also heard complaints that we are supporting a \n     voucher program when we could\n\n[[Page S12044]]\n\n     be supporting the District's charter schools instead. We find \n     this complaint especially interesting since it has recently \n     been voiced by some who were never strong charter school \n     supporters before. But that's all right with us because we \n     strongly support charter schools too. We will continue to \n     fight to make sure the President's charter school funding \n     priorities are fulfilled, especially on the facilities front, \n     so that this vibrant movement can keep flourishing.\n       And, finally, we've heard that all the Administration cares \n     about is launching a voucher program in the District, that we \n     don't care about the children who will remain in the public \n     school system. That couldn't be farther from the truth. Our \n     Department has a record of reaching out to the D.C. Public \n     Schools, to work with the system on overcoming its problems, \n     of providing it with information, technical assistance, and \n     other resources. We've adopted individual schools in the \n     District and provided those schools with hands-on assistance. \n     In our meetings with D.C. officials, we have said that we \n     will continue these efforts, and I'm happy to state that in \n     public today. The choice initiative should be just one \n     element in an effort to improve education in the District and \n     ensure that all children can achieve to high standards. We \n     want to contribute to the larger effort as well.\n       Let me close with a quotation from Dr. Howard Fuller, the \n     former superintendent of schools in Milwaukee, currently the \n     Director of the Institute for the Transformation of Learning \n     at Marquette University, and a strong advocate of opening up \n     wider educational choices for children and parents. Dr. \n     Fuller has said:\n       ``In America, it is virtually impossible for our children \n     to bring their dreams to reality without an education. \n     Unfortunately, far too many of our children are not only \n     having their dreams deferred, they are having them destroyed. \n     They are being destroyed by educational systems that are \n     undereducating them, miseducating them, and pushing them out \n     by the thousands every day. We must have a sense of urgency \n     about changing this unacceptable situation.''\n       It is that ``sense of urgency'' that drives this proposal.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. I \n     would be happy to respond to any questions that the Committee \n     may have.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, another point I would like to make is \nthat the Senator made a statement that needs clarification. As I \nstarted out this morning, I said the details of this are very \nimportant, because if you pursue the details and you dissect the \ndetails, you will eventually get to the truth. So there is one detail I \nmust repeat. And I guess I am going to have to stand here, I don't \nknow, every day or a month or a year to continue to say this until the \nother side cries uncle. This proposal is not--it never was, it is not \ntoday--limited or designed for failing schools. Let me repeat, this \nproposal is not--not when it was initially proposed, not last week, not \nyesterday, not last night, not today, not this morning at 5 minutes to \n12--limited to children in failing schools.\n  Although the proponents say they are interested in helping children \nin failing schools, the real issue for proponents of vouchers is they \nsimply believe in choice. That, of course, is their prerogative. But to \nstand behind the visual of poor people struggling in schools that are \nfailing is absolutely false. This proposal, as written, if anyone reads \nit, is not limited or directed to failing schools. It gives a \npreference to students in failing schools, but it is not designed to \nstudents in failing schools.\n  That principle is worth fighting over because the whole \naccountability system we have put into place is about identifying \nschools that are failing, and then providing resources to those schools \nto make them better.\n  If the other side gets away with saying, ``Well, that is what we \nsaid, but that is not really what we meant, because we aren't \ninterested in putting resources into failing schools, we are interested \nin putting resources into all schools, because our job is to make \nparents happy,'' I think that is just such a foolish goal.\n  Let me say why I think it is foolish. As much as I would like to see \nevery parent happy, in my 25 years in public life I don't know how in \nthe heck we would measure that because some parents are real happy, \nsome parents are a little happy, and some parents are happy in some \nways and not happy in other ways, and I would have no way of measuring \nwhat is a good measure for parental happiness. If someone in this \nChamber has any way to measure parental happiness in a way that \ntaxpayers could know if parents are a little happy, just a little \nhappy, happy on Mondays and not on Fridays, and that was our goal, \nplease tell me because I would be open to discuss it.\n  It is foolishness. We should be directing revenues, if we are going \nto do that, to failing schools. This proposal is not directed to \nfailing schools. They can say it 1,000 times. I ask you to read the \ndetails.\n  Now my third point. I know my colleague has been very patient, but I \nhave to make this point. My colleague from Missouri asked me, What \ndifference does it make? What difference does all this make?\n  It makes a huge amount of difference. We, as a Congress, with this \nPresident, in a bipartisan way, have embarked upon a new effort, a new \njourney, to take good public schools and make them great, knowing that \nsome schools are excellent but some schools are really bad. And as a \nNation, we are saying since 1965 our general plans are not working as \nwell as they should have, so let's make a big adjustment. We have made \na big adjustment, and that difference is worth fighting for, the \nstrengthening of public education in the greatest democracy in the \nworld.\n  People on my side say to me: Senator Landrieu, you have spent a lot \nof time on this issue. For Louisiana, the State I represent, and for \nthe country I love--and all of us love our country and our States--this \nis about as essential as it gets.\n  The fourth point I want to make: My friend from Missouri talks about \nthe single moms. Please help these single mothers, poor single mothers \nwho are working and can't afford to send their children to school. \nPlease help.\n  And they show pictures of African-American single moms and Hispanic \nsingle mothers, kind of indicating, in a very insulting way--I know \nthey do not mean it to be insulting, but you could interpret it as \nthat; and I know that is not the intention--but there are those of us \nover here who think we spend a lot of time fighting for poor women. I \nhave spent my whole life, basically, doing that. So it is really hard \nfor me to accept this criticism. But I am not perfect, and maybe I have \nfailed in some way in that effort. But when my friends say things to \nme, that we need to help single mothers, let me just ask them a \nquestion. Is it that party or this party which does not support the \nincrease in the minimum wage for these same women? Is it that party on \nthe other side of the aisle which refuses to raise the wage from $5.15 \nto help poor women have more choices in their life, or is it this side \nof the aisle? Is it that side of the aisle which refuses, year after \nyear, to put more money into day care so the same poor women who are \nworking two jobs--early in the morning until late at night--could have \nsome sense of satisfaction that their children will be well cared for \nwhile they are contributing to the great economy of this Nation, or is \nit our side?\n  So you have to understand--I hope people understand--this is a very \nimportant debate. The facts will speak for themselves. They can run all \nthe ads they want, all the bumper stickers, and all the headlines, but \nthat is what the facts are.\n  I have this letter we received today. It is dated September 26. It is \nfrom Secretary Paige.\n\n       I am writing today to express my strong support for the \n     District of Columbia education improvement initiative. . . .\n       This bill includes a three-pronged initiative to:--\n\n  And here it is--\n\n       (1) improve DC public schools . . . (2) create new charter \n     schools . . . and (3) provide scholarships.\n\n  This is the first official letter we have received.\n  This letter is a step in the right direction.\n  I see the leader on the floor. But let me just say, until this \nadministration says they will veto any bill that does not have this in \nit, the Members who are willing to negotiate on this have no assurance \nthat this is the way it will ultimately come out.\n  So I thank the Secretary for clarifying the position. I commend him \nfor his innovation. But again, until we have a statement of a veto from \nthe President unless this proposal includes these three provisions, \nwith permanent funding for all three, we do not have any assurance \nthese words will actually match the rule of law. And that is still a \nproblem.\n  I see my leader and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S12045]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I wish to use leader time to talk briefly \nabout another matter I call to my colleagues' attention.\n  Late last year, I had the opportunity--indeed the obligation--to work \non and support the most important commission that has been established \nin all my years in public service.\n  In the aftermath of the terrible terrorist attacks of September 11, \nthe families of the victims and all Americans turned to their elected \nleaders in the White House and the Congress to help them obtain some \nanswers to how this tragedy occurred and what steps should be taken to \nprevent future 9/11s.\n  Senate Democrats, led by Senators Lieberman and Torricelli, proposed \nthat the best way to provide these answers was to establish a blue-\nribbon, independent panel to carefully sort through all the facts and \nevidence and interview key policymakers.\n  The record will clearly show that this commission was strongly \nopposed by the White House. In fact, Vice President Cheney called me \ntwice to indicate, incorrectly in my view, that creating such a \ncommission could jeopardize the administration's efforts in the war on \nterrorism.\n  Other Bush officials in other settings made it clear to the families \nand Democratic and Republican members of Congress that they were less \nthan enthusiastic about having a commission examine the \nadministration's actions prior to 9/11.\n  After it became clear that their opposition was politically \nunsustainable, the administration switched gears and decided to support \na commission provided that Congress remove several key elements of the \nLieberman/Torricelli proposal designed to ensure the commission \nfunctioned as effectively and independently as possible.\n  Congress was effectively asked to take it on faith that the executive \nbranch would work with the commission on a nonpartisan effort to shed \nlight on the tragedy of 9/11.\n  Regrettably, that promise has not been realized as the administration \ncontinues to throw roadblocks in front of the commission's work. In \nJuly, the Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman Hamilton stated publicly that \nthe Bush administration has been slow and unresponsive in producing \ninformation sought by the commission.\n  Shortly after receiving this report, the Senate unanimously approved \nan amendment offered by myself and several other Senate Democrats \nurging the President to immediately and publicly call for all executive \nbranch agencies to provide their fullest and most timely cooperation to \nthe commission.\n  Unfortunately, no such call was issued, 2 more months have elapsed, \nand we have another report form the chairman and vice chairman that \nshould provide no comfort to those seeking the truth about what \nhappened on 9/11. While stating that administration cooperation has \nimproved, at the half-way mark of the commission's life, Chairman Kean \nsaid, ``We have not got everything. We have not gotten everything that \nwe feel we need to do our job.''\n  Chairman Hamilton indicated that the commission's work is at a crunch \npoint and that unless the commissioners receive satisfactory \ncooperation from the White House the Commission will be unable to meet \nits May, 2004 reporting deadline.\n  Other commissioners have been more stark in their assessment. \nAccording to a recent article in the Los Angeles Times, two \ncommissioners said, ``the investigation is still hampered by heel-\ndragging by the White House and federal agencies.''\n  Despite the administration's attitude toward the creation of this \ncommission, all of us who supported it hoped that once established the \nadministration would recognize the significance and importance of its \nwork and cooperate fully.\n  We all owe an immense debt of gratitude to the commissioners for \ntheir hard work and dedication to this effort. Each of them has already \nspent countless hours on this task and the families and the nation \nappreciate their work. It would be a shame if the administration's lack \nof cooperation prevented them from completing their important task.\n  As Vice Chairman Hamilton's remarks indicate, time is running out on \nthe administration to reverse course and do right by this \ninvestigation. Time is running out on the commission to get the \ninformation it needs to complete their work. And time is running out on \nthe families and all Americans to get the answers they deserve. I urge \nthe administration to immediately and completely cooperate with the \ncommission so this work can be completed successfully to the \nexpectations of those families who have given so much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12045-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12045-S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have just come from a meeting to discuss \nthe Appropriations Committee work beginning next week on the request \nfrom President Bush for $87 billion in urgent supplemental \nappropriations for Iraq. Of that $87 billion, roughly $66 billion is in \nsupport of the military and the mission in Iraq; $21 billion is for the \nreconstruction of Iraq. We will begin writing an appropriations bill in \nresponse to all of this next Tuesday morning at 10.\n  I wish to bring to my colleagues' attention a couple of things with \nrespect to this issue. First, when America sends its sons and daughters \nto defend our interests, when America puts its soldiers in harm's way, \nit has an obligation to provide the resources and funding needed to \nsupport their mission. I will support that. I will vote for that. I \nbelieve the Senate, the entire Congress will do that. But, there is a \ndifference between providing the funding on an urgent basis for support \nof our troops to carry out their mission in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nthe request for the reconstruction of Iraq. I want to describe that \ndifference.\n  Iraq is a country with substantial resources. It is not a country \ndesperately impoverished. It is a country with 24 million people. It \npossesses the second largest oil reserves in the world. Ambassador \nBremer told us this week that when pumping at capacity, by next July he \nexpects the Iraq oil fields to be pumping at about 3 million barrels \nper day. That produces about $20 billion in revenue per year, $16 \nbillion of which is available for export; therefore, the development of \ncurrency as a result of the export sales of $16 billion a year of oil, \neach year, from the country of Iraq. This is not an impoverished \ncountry. This a country with substantial wealth under its sands. \nPumping that wealth in the form of oil and selling it produces \nsubstantial revenue for the 24 million people.\n  With respect to the question of the reconstruction, I want to go back \nto April of this year and to a ``Night Line'' program in which Ted \nKoppel had on one of the top folks in the Department of State who is in \ncharge of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Andrew \nNatsios. He was asking Mr. Natsios about what would be required of the \nAmerican taxpayers for the reconstruction of Iraq. I want to read this \nexchange because it occurred on the ABC television network 5 months \nago.\n  Ted Koppel says: You are saying that the top cost for the U.S. \ntaxpayer will be $1.7 billion with respect to the reconstruction of \nIraq?\n  Mr. Natsios, one of the top officials in the Department of State, who \nheads the USAID which has the mission for projects for reconstruction: \nYes, for the reconstruction. Then there is $700 million in the \nsupplemental budget.\n  He was referring to something we had done earlier this year for \nhumanitarian relief.\n  Koppel says: But as far as reconstruction goes, the American taxpayer \nwill not be hit for more than $1.7 billion, no matter how long the \nprocess takes?\n  Mr. Natsios: That is our plan. That is our intention.\n  Koppel says: And these figures, outlandish figures I have seen, there \nis a bit of hoopla in all of this?\n\n[[Page S12046]]\n\n  Mr. Natsios says, in response to a question: That is correct. One \npoint seven billion is the limit on reconstruction for Iraq.\n  Natsios says: The rest of it is going to come from other countries.\n  He says: We have arrangements with other countries.\n  Then he names the other countries. He says: In terms of the American \ntaxpayers' contribution for the reconstruction of Iraq, $1.7 billion. \nThe rest of the rebuilding of Iraq will be done by other countries that \nhave already made pledges--Britain, Germany, Norway, Japan, Canada, \nIraq.\n  He says: Eventually, in several years, when it is up and running, and \nthere is a new government that has been democratically elected, they \nwill finish the job with their own revenues. They are going to get $20 \nbillion a year in oil revenues. But the American part of the \nreconstruction for Iraq will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any \nfurther funding for this.\n  That was this administration's spokesman said in April of this year.\n  Well, 5 months later, we have a new request to the American taxpayers \nfor almost $21 billion to continue the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Mr. Natsios said $1.7 billion. That is all. We have no plans for any \nother funding requests. Five months later, they are asking for another \n$21 billion.\n  Let me tell you what my contention is on the $21 billion to \nreconstruct Iraq. My feeling is, rather than have the U.S. taxpayers \nprovide $21 billion in grants to reconstruct Iraq, the revenue from \nIraqi oil should be used to reconstruct Iraq. So I asked Ambassador \nBremer about that.\n  he said: Well, that is not possible.\n  I asked: Why?\n  He said: Iraq has a substantial amount of debt. They have a lot of \ndebt. They have to repay this debt.\n  I said: To whom does Iraq owe debt?\n  He said: Germany and France and Russia.\n  So after that hearing, I went and took a look at who Iraq owed money \nto. Well, guess what. The top of the list is not France, Russia, and \nGermany. At the top of the list is Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the \nother Arab States, and then, yes, there is some owed to France and \nRussia and Germany, as well. But at the top of the list is Saudi Arabia \nand Kuwait.\n  What the Ambassador was saying to me is we cannot use Iraq's oil to \nreconstruct Iraq. That oil is going to have to be pumped so they can \nsell it for cash and send money to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. So we will \nhave the American taxpayers pay some of their taxes so they can \nreconstruct Iraq.\n  Sound perverse? It sure does to me. I think we should say to Saudi \nArabia and Kuwait: You loaned Saddam Hussein money. Well, you loaned \nmoney to a government that doesn't exist anymore. You know that $50 \nbillion Saddam Hussein owes you, owed Saudi Arabia and Kuwait? Go find \nthem and hand them a bill. It is not this country's obligation to bail \nout Saudi Arabia for debts that they allowed Saddam Hussein to run up \nwith their countries. That is not our obligation. Iraqi oil ought not \nto be used to repay Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from money they loaned to \nSaddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein is gone. No one can find him. The Saddam \nHussein government is out of power. It doesn't exist.\n  So then the question is, How do you reconstruct this country? Well \nhere is some of what American taxpayers are being asked to pay for: \nForty garbage trucks, $50,000 each; $9 million to create a zip code for \nIraq in the postal system; $54 million for technical and business \nprocess studies into a computer network for the Iraqi postal system; \nbuilding seven new communities, 3,400 homes, including marketplaces, a \nchurch, and so on; two 4,000-bed prisons at $50,000 a bed. Well, that \nis just a start--fix some roads, fix up some electric grids.\n  The interesting thing is that our ``shock and awe'' military campaign \nexplicitly did not target Iraq's infrastructure. We didn't take out \ntheir power grid. We didn't do it because we didn't want to. We didn't \ndestroy their dams or their power grid or the infrastructure of Iraq. \nNow we are told the infrastructure must be reconstructed. Why? Because \nguerrillas and insurgent movements inside Iraq have destroyed some of \nthe infrastructure in Iraq, and because Saddam Hussein let it \ndeteriorate for over 20 years.\n  So the question is, What do we do in Iraq, and who pays for it?\n  That is a long route to get to my central point. I don't believe it \nis the American taxpayers' responsibility to ante up $21 billion for \nthe reconstruction of a country that has the capacity to borrow $30 \nbillion, repay it in 10 years at 6 percent interest, with $4 billion a \nyear that comes from a $16 billion-a-year stream of revenue by pumping \noil out of the sands of Iraq. Common sense? Sure. Maybe there are some \nwho cannot see that, but I think the American people will.\n  I have a September 2003 document. I guess it is 55 pages. It is the \nreconstruction plan for the country of Iraq. Let me say, I believe Iraq \nneeds some reconstruction; there is no question about that. The \nadministration makes the point that the quicker this economy gets up \nand moving, the quicker you have a vibrant set of opportunities in Iraq \nfor the people, and the safer it will be for our troops. I agree \nwith that. That is fine. But if you look at what they are asking the \nAmerican people to create in the country of Iraq in these 55 pages, let \nme go through some of it: Private sector development, $200 million to \nestablish an American-Iraqi enterprise fund to capitalize the \nenterprise fund to invest in a wide array of private enterprises. This \nis sort of a venture capital fund of $200 million. Expand networks of \nemployment centers, $8 million; on-the-job training for private sector \nemployment, $35 million; develop a program for computer literacy \ntraining in Iraq, $40 million; specialized computer training in Iraq, \n$15 million; English as a second language in Iraq, $30 million; \nmodernize vocational training institutes, $25 million.\n\n  I could go on and on for 50 pages. I understand why they want to do \nthis. What I don't understand is why the American people are required \nto pay for this, when this country is a country that has the second \nlargest oil reserves in the world and has the capability to produce the \nrevenue to pay for it themselves. This makes no sense. It defies common \nsense.\n  I am going to offer an amendment in committee next Tuesday, and I \nwill offer it on the floor if it doesn't prevail in committee. I think \nwe ought to do a couple of things. One, I think we ought to separate \nthis issue and move the support for the troops immediately. I don't \nthink anybody here wants to withhold whatever necessary support is \nrequested to support the military. We sent them there; we have a \nrequirement to support them with all they need to complete the mission.\n  Second, I think we ought to separate the question of the \nreconstruction in the country of Iraq and go back to April of 2003, 5 \nmonths ago, and the promise made to us and the American people by the \nhead of the agency and the State Department that is going to do the \nreconstruction, Mr. Natsios, when he said our total obligation we are \ngoing to ask the American taxpayers to fund is $1.7 billion. Believe \nme, he said that is the total amount the American people are going to \nhave to fund.\n  Five months later, they came back and said: By the way, because Iraq \nowes money to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Iraqi oil has to be pumped \nto pay debts to them, we want the American taxpayer to pay for basic \ninfrastructure in the country of Iraq.\n  I am telling you, there is something fundamentally flawed about that. \nI hope my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee will see the same \nthing. We are going to have a chance to vote on my amendment. It is \ngoing to be relatively simple. It says this: Let's fund the military \nrequest the President sent to us and do so quickly, and in a way that \nsays there is no question about supporting the troops we have sent \nabroad. Second, here is the way we ought to reconstruct Iraq. The \nPresident is right. Iraq needs reconstruction, but he is wrong to ask \nthe American taxpayers to pay for that. The way to reconstruct Iraq is \nto securitize the oil to be pumped in Iraq at 3 million barrels a day, \nbeginning in July, according to Bremer, and use that securitization for \nIraqi oil to repay the securities from that over the next 10 to 20 \nyears to reconstruct Iraq exactly as the administration wants it done. \nI don't dispute any of these needs. I don't take issue with the \nadministration saying this ought to be done. I\n\n[[Page S12047]]\n\ntake very strong issue with the suggestion that somehow an \nadministration that promised us 5 months ago the total cost of \nreconstruction would be $1.7 billion, now says it is $21 billion in \nreconstruction, which ought to come from American taxpayers' funds, \nwhen we are dealing with the second largest oil reserves in the world.\n  So we are going to have votes on this in the Appropriations \nCommittee. We are going to have votes on it on the floor if it doesn't \nprevail in committee. I have been reading in the paper that some \ncolleagues feel the same way on both sides of the aisle. They think \nthis makes no sense to talk about $21 billion in grants from the \nAmerican taxpayers to fund these issues. I hope some of them will join \nme and that we can do what is right, use a big barrel full of common \nsense on an issue like this, and help the American taxpayers and the \nIraqi people at the same time and, most importantly, do what is \nnecessary to support the American military who is trying to carry out \nthis critical mission in that part of the world.\n  God bless those men and women. We pray for their safety. We pray for \ntheir families. As we work through this next week, I hope there is a \nhealthy dose of common sense in this Senate dealing with this \nreconstruction issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator has mentioned that the President has come \nbefore us and asked for $21 billion to reconstruct Iraq. In addition to \nthat, the President is saying there is another $40 billion to $50 \nbillion of needs next year for the reconstruction of Iraq that is \nsupposed to come from someplace else. The President and his people have \nsaid some of these other countries are going to contribute. Is the \nSenator aware of this additional $40 billion to $50 billion of money \nfor reconstruction of Iraq that the President has identified?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, responding to the question, I am, and \nAmbassador Bremer made the same point as did Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  There is a donor conference that is being held in Spain in just a \nmatter of a couple of weeks. We have asked what is the proclivity of \nthese countries to begin helping and donating. Here is what we were \ntold: I believe it is 69 countries have donated $1.5 billion total.\n  In this request, they are asking the American taxpayers for $21 \nbillion but say there will be a dramatic amount more that is needed but \nthat is going to come from somebody else. It appears very unlikely it \nis going to come from anybody else. That is my point.\n  The first step is I think this administration ought to work to have \ndebt forgiveness with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and others so they do not \nhave that debt overhanging that country and then have that country's \noil produce the revenue to reconstruct the country.\n  This is not a desperately impoverished country. This is a country \nthat sits on top of massive quantities of money in the form of oil, and \nyet we are being told the American taxpayers--who are already facing \nvery large, staggering deficits, I might say--that somehow the issues \nof building dams, building prisons, building communities, doing job \ntraining, building hospitals, building health care facilities, building \nroads, all of that should be borne by the American taxpayer at a time \nwhen they have the capability to produce the revenue in Iraq to pay for \nall of that. This is inexplicable to me.\n  As I said to my colleague, I hope we have a healthy dose of common \nsense that prevails on this question. Not on the military issue. I want \nsome common sense there, too, but I do not want anybody to question \nwhether we are going to support the military. We do.\n  On reconstruction, we really need to go at this on behalf of the \nAmerican people, in their interest. It is not in their interest to have \nto add this to the Federal debt and say to America's children, you pay \nfor the reconstruction of a country that has oil to pay for its own \nreconstruction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague for giving an excellent presentation \nand an excellent suggestion. This country has the second largest oil \nreserves in the world, and we are getting ready to have the American \npeople rebuild that nation.\n  There is something really wrong with the administration's thinking on \nthis matter, to come before us and ask for $21 billion, to say there is \nanother $40 billion to $50 billion of need in the next year and that \nthey are going to get it from somewhere else, when the somewhere else \nhas promised $1.5 billion. So there is a shortage of another $40 \nbillion. Where is that going to come from, and what is it being used \nfor?\n  My colleague from North Dakota pointed out what was in the Washington \nPost this morning, a detailed analysis of some of these expenditures. \nOne that I found most unusual was $1 million per family in Iraq for a \nwitness protection program for 100 families. That is $100 million--$1 \nmillion a family. That is a pretty good deal. It is going to be used to \nbuild prisons in Iraq for $50,000 a bed. Somebody is not thinking \nstraight.\n  They are going to create a ZIP Code, millions of dollars to create a \nZIP Code; area codes for phone systems, millions of dollars paid for by \nAmerican taxpayers. I do not think so. This in a country that has the \nsecond largest oil reserves in the world. As my colleague has pointed \nout, the reason we cannot use their oil money to rebuild their country \nis that they owe tens of billions of dollars to Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait?\n  Somebody has to have some common sense. We have to slow this thing \ndown and think about what we are doing. I think the administration is \nkind of discombobulated. They are running around throwing out numbers \nthey have not even thought through. That just cannot be what the \nresponse of the Congress is.\n  In light of this request for $87 billion--and that is the tip of the \niceberg, unfortunately. The fact is, it is very clear they are not \ngoing to get the $40 billion or $50 billion from anybody else and they \nwill be right back asking for tens of billions of dollars more. That \ncannot be the response.\n  Now, why not? First, it is not right. It is not fair. The American \ntaxpayer should not be saddled with debts that are not ours. We already \nhave our own debts. We have a runaway freight train of debt in this \ncountry.\n  In light of the President's request for another $87 billion, I think \nit is time for us to go back to his State of the Union Address on \nJanuary 28, 2003, when he said to us:\n\n       This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will \n     not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other \n     Congresses, to other Presidents, and other generations.\n\n  That is what he said to us. But look at what has really happened. We \nare doing precisely what he said we will not do. The debt of the United \nStates, which will be passed on to future generations, which will be \npassed on to future Congresses and to future Presidents, is absolutely \nmushrooming out of control.\n  The President told us just 2 years ago that in 2008 the debt would be \nvirtually paid off. He said there would only be $36 billion left. Now, \nwe know if we enact the President's policies, instead of virtually \npaying off the publicly held debt by 2008, which is the smaller part of \nthe debt, it will be $6.2 trillion. How much is that? That is 6,200 \nbillion dollars. That is how much the debt is going to be by 2008, the \npoint at which the President had told us we were going to have \nvirtually paid off the debt. So the President was wrong, and wrong by a \nmile, on that assertion.\n  The President told us:\n\n       Tax relief is central to my plan to encourage economic \n     growth, and we can proceed with tax relief without fear of \n     budget deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  He told that to us 2 years ago. But let's look at what we now know. \nWhat we now know is that instead of the assertion by the President that \nthere were not going to be budget deficits, we have record budget \ndeficits, the biggest in the history of the country, and by a country \nmile. The President's last proposal was reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and they tell us now that the deficit will be \n$535 billion next year.\n  The previous record deficit was in 1992, when the first President \nBush was in office, and the deficit was $290 billion. Now for next \nyear, it is $535 billion. That is a record deficit. The\n\n[[Page S12048]]\n\nPresident told us just 2 years ago it would not occur.\n  Then the President told us the next year:\n\n       . . . our budget will run a deficit that will be small and \n     short-term. . . .\n\n  He told us the budget deficit would be small and short term. That was \njust a year ago. This is according to the President's own budget \ndocuments. This is what happens if his spending and his tax proposals \nare adopted. What we see is an ocean of red ink, and one that grows \nyear after year. These are not small deficits, they are not short-term \ndeficits, they are the biggest deficits we have ever had. And the next \n10 years is the budget sweet spot. They are the good times, according \nto the President's own analysis of his proposals. His own budget shows \nus that his plan is taking this country right over the fiscal cliff. \nThis is what he says will happen to budget deficits. Not only are they \nnot small, they are record. And they are not short term, they are \nendless.\n\n  This is the President's analysis out to the year 2050, and there is \nno break in deficits anywhere here. It is deficits each and every year. \nWe are in this part of the chart now, which shows the smallest \ndeficits, and we know they are record deficits, the biggest deficits we \nhave ever had in the history of the country.\n  Next year alone, there is a deficit of $535 billion. The truth is, it \nis much worse than that because they are going to take $160 billion of \nSocial Security money on top of that $535 billion of deficit. They are \ngoing to take every penny of Social Security surplus and throw that \ninto the pot. So, on an operating basis, the deficit next year is \nreally going to be $700 billion.\n  The debt of the United States at the time Jimmy Carter was President, \nafter 200 years of history in this country, was around $750 billion, \nand we are going to add that much or virtually that much in 1 year \nunder this President's plan. That is not the most serious part. That is \nnot the part that really worries this Senator. What really worries me \nis, that is the tip of the iceberg, according to the President's own \nanalysis of his plans.\n  He says, if you adopt his budget plan, his spending, his tax plan, \nthat the deficits grow geometrically when the baby boomers start to \nretire. At the very time the baby boomers retire, the cost of the tax \ncuts explode, pushing us deep into deficit and debt, to levels never \nseen in the history of the United States. That is the plan the \nPresident is pursuing. It is a reckless plan and it is a dangerous \nplan.\n  The President presented his budget for fiscal year 2004, and it said:\n\n       Compared to the overall Federal budget and the $10.5 \n     trillion national economy, our budget gap is small by \n     historical standards.\n\n  First of all, there weren't going to be any deficits. That proved to \nbe wrong. Then the deficits were going to be small and short term. That \nproved to be wrong. Now the President is saying, as a share of the \nwhole national economy they are relatively small.\n  The problem with that statement is it is wrong, too. It is wrong, \ntoo. The next chart shows how big these deficits are as a share of our \nnational income. This chart goes all the way back to the end of World \nWar II--just after the end of World War II. You can see the previous \nrecord deficit as a percentage of GDP was back in 1983--6 percent of \ngross domestic product.\n  Next year, the deficit as percentage of gross domestic product is \ngoing to be 6.2 percent, if one excludes the Social Security trust \nfunds from the calculation. So if you are looking at the budget on an \noperating basis, if you are looking at it as any private sector firm \nwould have to look at its budget, what you see is the biggest deficit, \nas a percentage of gross domestic product, since World War II. And the \nPresident says it is relatively small. It is not relatively small, it \nis huge. It is the biggest it has been since World War II.\n  Of course, what the President has left out is that the Social \nSecurity surpluses back in 1983 were virtually nonexistent. So when the \nPresident--the then-President--took those moneys, he wasn't taking \nmuch. But look at what has happened to the Social Security surpluses. \nThey have been mounting dramatically, and now this President is taking \nevery dime of Social Security surplus to pay the operating expenses of \nthe country. No private sector firm would be able to do that. If you \nwere in the private sector, you couldn't take the retirement funds of \nyour employees and throw those into the pot to pay your operating \nexpenses. If you did, you would be on your way to a Federal \ninstitution, but it would not be the White House. It would not be the \nCongress of the United States. You would be on your way to the Federal \npenitentiary, because that is a violation of Federal law.\n\n  Yet that is what this President is doing this year and next year, \ntaking every dime of Social Security trust fund surplus. And not just \nthis year and next year. Under the President's budget plan, he is going \nto take every penny of Social Security surplus this year and next year \nand the year after that and the year after that and the year after that \nand for the next 10 years. Every penny is being taken to pay the \noperating expenses of the Federal Government.\n  This President is taking us down the road that is a fiscal disaster \nof the first order, and we had better start facing up to it. We are \ngoing to have an opportunity next week because the President has come \nbefore us and asked for another $87 billion--put it on the charge card. \nNo, this $87 billion has to be paid for. We have to start getting back \non track.\n  The President, in his latest estimates, tells us that revenue as a \npercentage of gross domestic product is going to be at its lowest level \nsince 1950. You will recall one of his major justifications for the tax \ncuts 2 years ago was that revenue was at a record percentage of gross \ndomestic product. Now we are headed for a record low, in terms of \nrevenue, and his answer is the same: Cut revenue more. It doesn't \nmatter what the question is, the answer from this President, from this \nadministration, is the same: Cut the revenue. If revenue is high, cut \nit. If revenue is low, cut it some more.\n  It is not just a question of revenue being low, it is also a question \nof spending being increased. This chart shows, for this year, 92 \npercent of the increased discretionary spending is in just three \ncategories: Defense, which accounts for the vast majority of it; \nhomeland security, which is the second biggest chunk; and the third \nbiggest chunk is rebuilding New York and providing relief for the \nairlines, so badly affected by what has occurred. So we have not only \nthe lowest revenue since 1950, we also have increased expenses for \ndefense, homeland security, rebuilding New York.\n  Of course, all of us support those increased expenditures in order to \nmeet the obligations the country has taken on under this President.\n  The President is fond of saying, ``It's the people's money.''\n  This is a place where I agree with the President absolutely. It is \nthe people's money, he is absolutely right about that. This is the \npeople's money. But what the President has left out is that it is also \nthe people's debt. What he is running up here is a debt that is truly \nmassive in scope.\n  This looks at the gross debt of the United States. Earlier we were \ntalking about the publicly held debt. But if you look at the gross \ndebt, not only what we owe those who have loaned money to the United \nStates--which, by the way, includes a lot of money from Japan and \nEurope--we also see that we owe money to ourselves. We owe money to the \nSocial Security trust fund that the President has been taking money \nfrom in order to float this boat. That is truly stunning.\n  We have a gross debt of $6.8 trillion at the end of this year. But \nlook at what is going to happen in the next 10 years. We are going to \nhave a gross debt approaching $15 trillion. That is 15,000 billion \ndollars. That is real money. And all of this is happening at the worst \npossible time.\n  Why the worst possible time? Because, as this chart shows right now, \nthe green bar, which is the Social Security trust fund, the blue bar \nwhich is the Medicare trust fund, are running surpluses in anticipation \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation. Unfortunately, the money \nis not being used to prepare us for the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. The money is all being taken and spent on the operating \nexpenses and to pay for the President's tax cuts. That is where the \nmoney is going. Not to prepare for the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration.\n\n[[Page S12049]]\n\n  The red part of these bars is the cost of the President's tax cuts. \nWhat one sees is, when the trust funds go cash negative, which happens \nin the next decade--in fact, it begins to happen pretty soon because in \n2008 the leading edge of the baby boom generation starts to retire.\n  Look at what happens when those trust funds go cash-negative at the \nvery time the cost of the President's tax cuts explode, dragging us \ndeeper and deeper into deficits and debt. This is utterly \nunsustainable. It is leading us to a crash landing.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Here is a report from the New \nYork Times of September 14 reporting on the Congressional Budget \nOffice's warning to all of us here in Congress. Let me quote from the \nNew York Times:\n\n       This course--\n\nthe fiscal course that the President has embarked upon--\n\n     prompted the Congressional Budget Office to issue an unusual \n     warning in its forecast last month: If congressional \n     Republicans and the administration get their wish and extend \n     all of their tax cuts now scheduled to expire, and if they \n     pass a limited prescription drug benefit for Medicare and \n     keep spending at its current level, the deficit by 2013 will \n     have built up to $6.2 trillion.\n\n  That is not the gross debt. That is the publicly held debt--$6.2 \ntrillion. That is 6,200 billion.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Once the baby boomers begin retiring at the end of this \n     decade, that course will lead either to drastically higher \n     taxes, severe spending cuts, or ``unsustainable levels of \n     debt.''\n\n  That is the course we are on. That is the course the President has \nput us on. It is a disastrous course by any judgment.\n  Again, we have heard from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  By the way, the head of the Congressional Budget Office used to be on \nthe President's budget team, his Council of Economic Advisers. He came \nfrom the White House.\n  You don't have to just listen to me or to him. Here is the \nComptroller General of the United States, David Walker, in a speech on \nSeptember 17 to the National Press Club. He said in that speech:\n\n       The ultimate alternatives to definitive and timely action \n     are not only unattractive, they are arguably infeasible. \n     Specifically, raising taxes to levels far in excess of what \n     the American people have ever supported before, cutting total \n     federal spending by unthinkable amounts, or further \n     mortgaging the future of our children and grandchildren to an \n     extent that our economy, our competitive posture and the \n     quality of life for Americans would be seriously threatened.\n\n  This is the Comptroller General of the United States put in place by \nthe bipartisan leadership of Congress warning us that the course the \nPresident has us on is a disastrous course.\n  We don't have to just listen to the head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, or have to listen to the Comptroller General of the United \nStates. We just have to look at what has happened. We all can look and \nwe can read reality tests. Does it make sense?\n  Two years ago, the President told us we could have it all. The \nPresident said we could have massive tax cuts. He told us we could save \nSocial Security and Medicare without touching the trust funds. He said \nwe could have maximum paydown of the debt. He said we could have a big \ndefense buildup. He said we could do it all. He was wrong. He was wrong \nby a country mile. He was wrong on each and every count--not protecting \nMedicare and Social Security. He is taking every dime of the Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses for the entire rest of the decade.\n  He said we wouldn't have deficits. We have record deficits. He said \nhe would virtually pay off the debt. The debt is exploding. The \nPresident is taking us down a course that does not work.\n  Most recently, he told us:\n\n       It is important for you all to understand, for our fellow \n     Americans to understand, the tax relief I have proposed--and \n     will push for until enacted--will create 1.4 million new jobs \n     by the end of 2004.\n\n  We are not at the end of 2004. So we can't make a judgment on that. \nBut we can look back at 2001.\n  In 2001, he made the same kind of claim. He said if you pass his \nplan, which we did, it was going to generate millions of new jobs.\n\n  Wrong again. He hasn't generated millions of new jobs. He has lost \nmillions of jobs--3.3 million jobs lost by August 2003 since this \nPresident took office. That is the worst record on jobs since Herbert \nHoover. No other President of either party has lost private-sector jobs \nduring their entire term since the Great Depression. This President has \nlost 3.3 million jobs with his economic plan.\n  Once again, he is wrong--just wrong. He is just wrong in assertion \nafter assertion after assertion. He is just wrong. That is the hard \nreality we have to cope with.\n  If we look at this recovery that is underway--and there are signs of \neconomic recovery, which one would expect--if you go and write $700 \nbillion of hot checks in a year on the Federal accounts, you expect to \ngive some lift to the economy. By spending all of this additional \nmoney, all of these tax cuts, you would expect the economy to improve, \nand it is improving. But we are not seeing much pickup in jobs.\n  We charted the last nine recessions which have occurred since World \nWar II--the job recovery that occurred during the recovery from those \nrecessions. Here is the trend line that we see: In each of those nine \nrecessions, there has been a good pickup in jobs when the economy \nstarted to recover. Here is the pattern in this recovery. This is like \na dead cat bouncing. Nothing is happening. Jobs are not being \nrecovered. Jobs are still being lost, and the President told us he had \na plan, he had a strategy that was going to bring back jobs--millions \nof jobs, he said. He was wrong.\n  Now some are saying deficits don't really matter. It is really quite \nstunning to hear some of our Republican colleagues, who for years \nbelieved deficits did matter, all of sudden completely change course \nand say deficits don't matter. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard believes deficits matter. Here is what he said before the Senate \nBanking Committee:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy, unless \n     attended to.\n\n  Again, we didn't need to just listen to the head of the Federal \nReserve Board. Hear what the head of the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid in testimony before the Budget Committee earlier this month. He \nsaid:\n\n       To the extent that going forward we run large sustained \n     deficits in the face of full employment, it will in fact \n     crowd out capital accumulation and otherwise slow economic \n     growth.\n\n  This is the testimony of Mr. Holtz-Eakin who was, again, put in \noffice by the Republicans who control both Chambers, and came from the \nPresident's own economic advisors saying that deficits do matter. They \ndo hurt economic growth in the long term.\n  Again, I go back to the Comptroller General and his outstanding \nspeech to the National Press Club on September 17.\n\n       The ``bottom line'' is, there is little question that \n     deficits do matter, especially if they are large, structural \n     and recurring in nature. In addition, our projected budget \n     deficits are not ``manageable'' without significant changes \n     in ``status quo'' programs, policies, processes and \n     operations.\n\n  I don't know exactly when this Congress is going to awaken to the \nthreat that is barreling down on us, but we face a circumstance just as \nclear as it can be: The largest deficits in our history in dollar \nterms, by far. Deficits as a percentage of GDP fairly measured that are \nthe largest since World War II and no relief in sight. Instead, \ndeficits as far as the eye can see, massive deficits that are coming at \nthe worst possible time, right before the baby boomers retire, right \nwhen we should be paying down debt or prepaying the liability.\n  Instead, we are taking the money, hundreds of billions of dollars; in \nfact, over $2 trillion of Social Security surpluses alone over the next \ndecade the President proposes taking to spend on other operations in \ngovernment. That is $2.4 trillion of Social Security money, taking \nevery dime. Not just this year, not just next year, but every year for \nthe next decade.\n  Two years ago the President told us we could expect nearly $6 \ntrillion in surpluses over the next 10 years. In just 2 years that has \nturned into $4 trillion, $4,000 billion of deficits.\n  Where did the money go? Here is where it went: 39 percent went to the \ntax cuts the President proposed and pushed through Congress; 28 percent \nwent to increased spending, largely, as\n\n[[Page S12050]]\n\nI indicated earlier, defense and Homeland Security; 7 percent went to \nthe economic downturn; 27 percent in revenue shortfalls not associated \nwith the tax cuts. So two thirds of the disappearance of the surplus in \nthe move to deficits is on the revenue side of the equation. That is \nwhere the money has gone.\n  Some are saying, we do not have to worry about this; we will grow our \nway out of it. Here is what the Comptroller General of the United \nStates said, again in a speech to the National Press Club:\n\n       [T]he consensus opinion at a recent meeting of prominent \n     economists representing a wide variety of ideological \n     viewpoints was that . . . ``we cannot simply agree our way \n     out of this problem.''\n\n  It is time to face up to reality. It is time to face up to the fact \nwe have again down a course that is not working. I am not casting \naspersions on anyone's intentions or motivations. That does no good. \nBut we can now look back at the President's record objectively and \nclearly. We can see that statement after statement he has made to this \nCongress was simply wrong.\n  He said there would be no deficits. We have record deficits. He said \nthey would be small and short-term. They are massive and unending. He \nsaid they are small as a percentage of our gross domestic product. They \nare the biggest they have been since World War II as a percentage of \ngross domestic product, fairly measured. The President said this would \nall create jobs. He said it would create millions of jobs. Millions of \njobs have been lost.\n  Now he says he needs another $87 million that he does not want to pay \nfor. Where is the money going? We have heard a number of presentations \nthis morning: 500 experts, at $200,000 each, to investigate crimes \nagainst humanity in Iraq. Let me repeat that. Here we are in the \ndeepest deficit, in debt at the worst possible time, and the President \nsays one of the things we should do is get us 500 experts at $200,000 \neach to investigate crimes against humanity. I am all for investigating \ncrimes against humanity, but I am all against spending $200,000 each \nfor 500 people in one year to investigate crimes against humanity in \nIraq. Have we completely taken leave of our senses around here?\n  He wants to build prisons over there at $50,000 a bed. He wants to \nhave a witness protection program that will provide $1 million per \nfamily. Yes, it is there. Read the Washington Post: A witness \nprotection program for families of five, 100 families of five, at \n$200,000 each in the family, five people, $200,000 each, and that is $1 \nmillion for 100 families, for a total of $100 million. We do not have a \nwitness protection program like that in this country.\n  Let's get serious around here. We are in disastrous deficit and debt \nand we are talking about these kind of expenditures in a country that \nhas the second largest oil reserves in the world, and we say, ``Just \nput it on the debt of the American people''? I don't think so. There \nhas to be a better way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, early next week we will take up what has now become \nthe defining issue of this session of Congress--the Bush \nadministration's proposal for $87 billion for Iraq.\n  I support our troops in Iraq. We all support our troops in Iraq. If \nthat is the issue, the vote will be 100 to nothing in the Senate.\n  The administration had an effective plan to win the war. The tragedy \nis that our troops are paying with their lives because the \nadministration failed to prepare a plan to win the peace.\n  Our troops performed superbly in the war. They are doing their very \nbest under enormously difficult circumstances now. They deserve the \nfull support of Congress, and they will get it.\n  But they also deserve a realistic plan from the administration. They \ndeserve to know how the administration will bring in the international \ncommunity, deliver on the promise of democracy, and bring our troops \nhome with honor.\n  The administration has refused to provide a realistic plan to the \nCongress and our troops. It has provided only a 2-month-old, 28-page \nplan called ``Achieving The Vision To Restore Full Sovereignty To The \nIraqi People.''\n  I would like to know why it is called a working document. I would \nlike to know why the administration is asking the Congress to write an \n$87 billion blank check based on the draft plan.\n  This is the draft plan. I will include it by reference rather than \nincluding all of it in the Record. It is 28 pages, including the cover \npage, ``Coalition Provisional Authority, Baghdad, Iraq, Achieving the \nVision to Restore Full Sovereignty to the Iraqi People,'' dated July \n21. It is a working document that is the basis of the administration \nplan that was provided to the Armed Services Committee.\n  I will read from the provisions in the plan on security from August 1 \nto October 3, point 4: Locate and secure and eliminate WMD capability. \nThen November 3 to January 4: Continue to locate and secure and \neliminate WMD capability. And then from February 4: Continue to locate \nand secure and eliminate WMD. Point No. 1: Defeat internal armed \nthreats. That is August to October. November to January 4: Continue to \ndefeat all threats. February 4: Continue transfer responsibility to the \nIraqis.\n  It is an insult to the American people. It is an insult to our troops \nwho are paying with their lives. For most of us, when it comes to Iraq, \nthere is a widening credibility gap between rosy descriptions of \nprogress by the administration and the hard reality on the ground for \nour troops and for the Iraqi people.\n  On September 14, Vice President Cheney said ``90 percent of the \ncities and towns and villages are governed by democratically elected or \nappointed local councils.'' He said that ``all the schools are open, \nand that all the hospitals are up and functioning.''\n  In yesterday's Washington Post, Secretary Rumsfeld wrote glowingly of \nour ``solid progress'' in restoring Iraq. Yet we all know that the \nreality on the ground is quite different. And we are learning that \nthere are even those within the administration who are reporting that \nthings are not going well. Yet, those concerns are kept carefully from \npublic view.\n  In fact, the New York Times reported just last week on September 17 \nthat new intelligence reports conclude that ordinary Iraqis are turning \nagainst us. And Defense Department officials believe that ``indications \nof that hostility extend well beyond the Sunni heartland or Iraq, which \nhas been the main setting for attacks on American forces.''\n  We are still losing an American a day. After going it alone on the \nwar, we have few allies to relieve our troops and join us in winning \nthe all-important peace.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld admitted this week that our failure to recruit \nsufficient foreign troops likely means additional callups for our \nreservists and guard units. General Abizaid told the Senate Armed \nServices Committee yesterday that ``it doesn't look like we'll have a \ncoalition brigade. We have no choice but to plan for American forces.'' \nHe is not counting on foreign troops. Clearly, the situation in Iraq is \nout of control. Our policies are not working. Our plan in Iraq is an \n$87 billion failure, and our troops are paying the price.\n  The administration must admit that our plan is not working, that we \ncannot stay this course. We know it. The American people know it. Our \nallies know it. We cannot afford just to stay the same failing course. \nWe owe our troops a change in plan.\n  Before the Congress writes a blank check for $87 billion, we need to \nknow that the administration has a realistic plan. Our troops who are \npaying with their lives deserve no less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from South \nCarolina, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n\n[[Page S12051]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12051-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are several issues I wish to take \nthis opportunity to comment on at the end of this week. First is the \nissue that has been discussed for the last 3 days and which we will be \ncoming back to on Monday--the issue of education of young children in \nthe District of Columbia.\n  With the leadership of the Mayor and working closely with the person \nwho day in and day out observes firsthand what happens in the District, \nthe head of the school board, and local officials, a proposal has been \nput together, generated at the local level, that we are currently \ntalking about and debating before the Senate. That is the issue of \nallowing young children in school who are trapped--for the most part, \nimpoverished children--in failing schools and giving them the \nopportunity to expand, grow, learn, and become educated, and thus \ngiving them a shot at what we all know as the American dream.\n  Yesterday was a unique day in that on the floor of the Senate was \nMayor Anthony Williams, who made a historic visit to the Senate floor \nat the invitation of Senator Feinstein. From his presence here and in \nour many conversations with him, what is emphasized is how important \nthis issue is to the District, to the future of this District, because \nit has to do with children and education. That is how important this \nissue of choice is, empowering the parents to have some sort of say in \ntheir children's education.\n  As Senator Feinstein has so eloquently argued, the District of \nColumbia choice program is the Mayor's program. It is not our program--\nthe Senate program or the House program, or the Federal Government \nprogram. It is the program of the District and for the District's \nchildren and families. It is what the leaders in the District of \nColumbia want.\n  We have spent almost 3 whole days on the bill, and we will spend, as \nI mentioned, Monday on it. Today, only one amendment has been offered. \nIt is frustrating to me when we recognize the real problems that are in \nthe District today in terms of education and we see there is a response \ngenerated that makes sense and is locally supported, which has new \nFederal dollars, new additional dollars coming in to support the \ninitiatives, it is frustrating that if there are 4, 5, 6--I don't know \nthe number of people who oppose choice in education and parental \ninvolvement, but if they have amendments, we can debate them. Then we \ncan vote on these amendments, and hopefully defeat them, because I am a \ngreat believer in DC choice but at least allow us to debate.\n\n  Avoiding offering amendments when time is being made available on the \nfloor, in response to the great needs that we know exist, is \nfrustrating and in some ways disappointing.\n  The only amendment that has passed, in fact, was by Senator \nFeinstein, who is an advocate for this bill. So really there have been \nno amendments proposed from the other side. Yet, as we heard in the \nopening comments a few hours ago, the opposition insists that we cannot \nmove this bill anytime soon.\n  I say that despite the positive impact that we know this bill can \nmake on the District's schoolchildren. I am not exactly sure why there \nis this refusal to offer amendments and live with the outcome, when the \ntime is made available and the issue is before us. I hope it is not \nnational politics because we are talking about the District's \nschoolchildren. We are not talking about a partisan national debate.\n  Our goal is to give children today the very best education possible. \nSo we need to debate it, we need to amend it, if necessary, and, if \nnot, we need to move on, have a vote on it, and express the will of \nthis Senate for the benefit of the kids.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has passed legislation that does \noffer this city's schoolchildren a genuine opportunity to achieve an \neducation. It has been pointed out on the Senate floor, but it is \nimportant for me to again state it, that this is $40 million of new \nmoney, that is additional money which, if this legislation passes, will \ncome. If the legislation does not pass, that additional $40 million is \nnot going to go into education today. The money is to be divided \nbetween the supporting of public schools, of charter schools which are \nin the District, and then a new nonpublic opportunity scholarship \nprogram whereby over 2,000 students who are impoverished, who are \ntrapped in failing schools by definition in the legislation, are given \nthe opportunity to walk, with a check of $7,500, to any nonpublic \nschool in the District. If we pass the legislation, they have that \nopportunity. If we do not pass the legislation, they are not going to \nhave that opportunity. It is as simple as that.\n  That is, again, why this is frustrating to me as majority leader and \nas one who is trying to schedule the Nation's business accordingly.\n  It is new money. It is not going to take resources from other \neducation. That used to be the argument: There is public education \nmoneys and the money will be taken from public education and diverted \nto nonpublic education. That argument is bogus. It does not exist. This \nis new money that is coming into the system.\n  The record today in the District, in terms of educating children, has \nbeen painted pretty well, but in too many ways it ends up being almost \nstatistics and coldhearted facts. But the coldhearted facts, I have to \nsay, do tell the story. We spend about $1,200 per student right now, \nper capita, per kid, in the District. In spite of that, the outcomes, \nthe scores, are lower than any State in the country today. So the \nanswer is not just money. We know that.\n  Only 10 percent, or 1 out of 10, of the District's fourth graders are \nproficient in math. Less than 12 percent of the District's fourth \ngraders can write at grade level. Actually, it is fewer than 10 percent \nof the District's fourth graders are proficient at math, and right at \n10 percent are proficient in reading. That means 90 percent are not \nproficient at reading. Only 6 percent, about 1 out of 20 or 1 out of \n18, of District fourth graders can do math at a proficient level.\n\n  Words were used like ``disgrace,'' which I think it is, and \n``scandal,'' not in the sense that there is misappropriation but a \nscandal in the fact that the outcome is so poor for these students and \nthe disgrace is really in some ways ours for not responding and \nresponding aggressively and appropriately. That is what we can do by \npassing this bill.\n  I should also add that I believe the dropout rate in the District is \naround 42 percent, and nationwide it is about 29 percent. So 42 percent \ndo not go on to school. As I mentioned before, the ACTs and the SATs, \nwhich would allow one to go to college, are the lowest in the country \nas well. So kids who are graduating from public school are graduating \nwith an inability to read, write, do math, and to add and subtract, \nreally basic measures.\n  None of us in this Chamber would tolerate that sort of outcome for \nour own children, unable to complete simple fourth grade mathematics, \nor in the fourth grade an inability to write at grade level. Would we \ntolerate it? The answer is clearly, no.\n  It has been pointed out that many of the people who oppose school \nchoice for children and parents in the District, in this body and in \nthe House of Representatives as well, send their kids to private \nschools, and yet at the same time, when the opportunity is there, they \ndo not give that same opportunity to other parents.\n  I mentioned Mayor Tony Williams, DC Board of Education president \nPeggy Cooper Cafritz, City Council member Kevin Chavous are all \ncourageously advancing the cause of universal education for DC's kids. \nIn addition to them are the parents of kids in the District. All across \nthe city, parents line up in order to obtain better options for\n\n[[Page S12052]]\n\ntheir children. The need is so real and so intense that the District \npublic school choice programs right now in the District are \noversubscribed.\n  Each year, more than 1,000 schoolchildren are wait-listed for the \ncity's magnet programs, those magnet programs which give those unique \nopportunities for parents to choose, with their kids, the type of \nprogram that best suits their individual needs--again, stressing the \nimportance of parental involvement, of matching needs to sources. More \nthan 1,000 children are wait-listed trying to get into those programs.\n  Right now the District has made more headway than my own State of \nTennessee in the development of charter schools. About 15 percent of \nDC's kids are in charter schools. About 11,500 are in attendance in \nthose charter schools. Once again, because they get that opportunity to \nbetter match resources to needs in an overall system that is failing \nand involves more choice, there is a waiting list of over 1,000 kids in \nthe District for charter schools right now.\n  Indeed, in this $40 million there is increased funding for charter \nschools which are part of the public education system in the District.\n  Thinking in terms of choice and opportunity scholarships, where \nindividual kids have the opportunity to take resources that are already \nbeing spent on their behalf and allowing them to choose the school they \ncould go to, taking that same principle, which is the principle behind, \nthe fundamental power behind, DC choice, one need only to look at when \nJohn Walton and Ted Forstmann invested $2 million in the children's \nscholarship fund in the District. What happened?\n  There were 1,000 seats and yet 10,000 kids applied for those 1,000 \nseats--again, to show the pent-up demand here for greater choice, \ngreater opportunity to choose the type of school that best suits your \nneeds.\n\n  On this particular issue, I just want to close and say I do stand \nwith those parents, with those people on those waiting lists, because \nwe have an opportunity to reverse that and to expand the opportunity \nfor families to become involved and kids to have that choice. To me it \nis nonsensical for us to withhold from them that opportunity when it is \nwithin our power to do so, to support each child's right--and it is a \nbasic right--to learn to read and to write and to add and subtract. \nBasic education for our schoolchildren simply just cannot wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12052-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12052-S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT IN SUDAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to discuss an encouraging \ndevelopment that most Americans have had no reason, at least initially, \nto pay attention to. That is what has happened in a country on another \ncontinent, the country being Sudan.\n  This week, several days ago, we received word that the civil war that \nhas raged there for 20 years and has claimed over 2 million lives, \nlives lost as a product of this civil war, a war that has caused over 5 \nmillion families to leave their homes, to be displaced from their homes \nand have to move to another part of the country--that civil war may be \none step closer to ending.\n  On Tuesday evening the Sudanese rebels and the Khartoum Government \nreached an agreement on the position and size of their respective armed \nforces. A formal agreement, since that time, has been signed. This \nagreement includes three significant breakthroughs: A substantial \nwithdrawal of government forces from the southern region of the \ncountry; redeployment of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the SPLA, \nforces in Khartoum, and third, the formation of an integrated force in \nthe southern Blue Nile region and the Nuba Mountains.\n  What this typically means is that units are integrated to include \ntroops from each side. That way, each side acts as a check, a check and \na balance on each other.\n  Sudan's Vice President, Osman Ali, says the deal ``has paved the way \nfor a comprehensive peace agreement.''\n  The Southern People's Liberation Army, SPLA, leader John Garang, \nconcurs, saying, ``With this agreement, the direction and orientation \nfor peace in Sudan is irresponsible.''\n  Clearly, while the agreement is key, there are still significant \nissues to be resolved. Many issues remain; for example, those regarding \npower and regarding the whole topic of wealth sharing. But the good \nnews and the encouraging news, the news that brings joy to my heart, \nhaving spent so much time in the Sudan personally, is that both sides \nhave looked at extending the cease-fire for 2 additional months, so \nthey can keep talking and keep working toward peace.\n  A 2-month cease-fire, what does that mean? It means there will be \nless of the destructive killing, the bombing, the wars, and the battles \nthat go on almost in a routine manner in that part of the world.\n  I was just in the Sudan about 4 weeks ago. I had the opportunity to \nwork at the mission hospital there and become very intimately \nacquainted, again not as a Senator but as a doctor, with individuals \nwho have suffered, directly or indirectly, from these war injuries. I \ngo to the Sudan about once a year, plus or minus several months, where \nin the past I again have had the opportunity to treat people who have \nbeen hurt directly in the war, people who have lost their legs from the \nland mines which have been planted because of that war.\n  I mentioned part of the agreement applied to the Nuba Mountains. It \nis now about 4 years ago that I first took a trip to the Nuba \nMountains. At that time the United Nations did not allow relief flights \nto go in that part of the world. The Nuba Mountains have been neglected \nin many ways by the international community. I am pleased since we \nfirst went in about 4 years ago, the region has opened up to more \nrelief and more transparency and much more of a spotlight, where the \nworld can see the human tragedy that has gone on in that part of the \nworld.\n  I also mentioned, as part of the agreement, the southern Blue Nile. \nAbout 2 years ago I had the opportunity to go to the Blue Nile region. \nI was in the Blue Nile region actually just a day after a very \nsignificant battle that had been fought in that region. It was just the \nnight before. Again, I am delighted that is part of this formation of \nan integrated force, both in the southern Blue Nile and the Nuba \nMountains.\n  I have had the opportunity to go to Pabong, which is in the oil \nregion, where people have been displaced several years ago. Although \nthis whole wealth sharing is an issue that has to be addressed in the \nfuture, it is an issue about which I am very hopeful, now that progress \nis being made along the lines of increased peace in the Sudan.\n  Last month I was able to operate and perform surgery in a hospital \ncalled Lui Hospitala, a hospital sponsored by the Samaritan's Purse, a \nfaith-based organization here in the United States. When I first \nstarted going to that hospital, it was just a schoolhouse. That was \nabout 6 or 7 years ago, 1997. Osama bin Laden had just left, I think \nabout 1996, from the Sudan. When we first went into the area of \nsouthern Sudan, it was just a schoolhouse there. The original hospital \nhad land mines around it.\n  Since that point in time, over the last 6 or 7 years, the land mines \nhave been removed from the old hospital grounds and now 30,000, 40,000, \n50,000 patients are seen a year at that particular facility.\n  Through these experiences, I have had the opportunity of seeing first \nhand the shattering results of a brutal civil war. President Bush very \nearly on, right after he began office as President, appointed Jack \nDanforth as a special envoy to that region--again showing the \nimportance to the United States to establish, to promote, and to work \nfor peace in that part of the world.\n  In the Senate we passed the Sudan Peace Act. We will continue to \nfollow very closely the situation. We will continue to work with the \nadministration, Jack Danforth and President Bush, to support the \nefforts of the Kenyan mediator, Lazarus Sumbeiywo, to encourage and \nsupport this encouraging undertaking.\n  It is the people of the Sudan--and that's who I spend most of the \ntime with as part of this medical mission work in these clinics and in \nthe treatment and in the doctor-patient relationship--it is the people \nof Sudan who long the most for the end of this violence.\n\n[[Page S12053]]\n\n  So this reported progress from this week is something that is very \ngratifying and pleasing to me and leaves me very optimistic about the \nfuture. It is a wonderful part of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12053-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will be formally \naddressing the issue surrounding the Small Business Administration. \nThus, I would like to briefly comment on the importance of small \nbusiness in this country, how the Senate is responding, and to put a \nlittle bit of perspective around the importance of the United States \ndoing everything it can--whether it is with the regulatory burden, \nwhether it is in making resources and capital available, or opening up \nother opportunities for small businesses in this country--how important \nthat is to overall economic growth.\n  Benjamin Franklin once said: He who would fish must venture his bait. \nFortunately, in America we have millions of creative and driven women \nand men and even teams ready to cast their reels. Fortunately, we have \nthe Small Business Administration ready to help them. You might say \nthat the Small Business Administration is an entrepreneur's bait and \ntackle shop.\n  I believe by today's action in a few moments we will be passing the \nSmall Business Administration's 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of \n2003. This Federal agency has helped more than 20 million Americans \nstart, grow, and expand their businesses. It has become the \nGovernment's most effective instrument for economic development. With \nits help, small companies have grown from a handful of employees into \nliterally thousands. The vitality of the American economy is due in no \nsmall part to this agency, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this \nyear.\n  Thanks to today's legislative victory, this pivotal agency will \ncontinue working with America's job creators to grow the economy, to \nboost the economy, and to expand the economy.\n  Just how important are small business owners? Those innovators create \n60 to 80 percent of new jobs nationwide. Sixty to eighty percent of new \njobs are created by small businesses. They generate more than 50 \npercent of the gross domestic product. Small business owners are the \nheart of the American marketplace, and their contributions to jobs and \nproductivity is its lifeblood.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, 97.1 percent of all businesses are \nsmall businesses. From the year 1999 to the year 2000, Tennessee's \nsmall businesses added a net total of 36,806 employees, and 12,000 \ncompanies with fewer than 100 workers employed 44.9 percent of the \nState's nonfarm sector workers. Workers and consumers depend on the \nsmall business sector to generate jobs, products, and services. The \nSmall Business Administration helps fuel the creativity and the \ndynamism of this vital sector of the economy. And it has been \nextraordinarily successful.\n  Take, for example, one restaurant chain, the Outback Steak House. It \nmay come as a surprise to some, but the Outback Steak House does not \nhave its headquarters in Australia. No. It has its headquarters in \nTampa, FL. In a little over 10 years, the Outback Steak House has grown \nfrom a really small restaurant operation into a dining phenomenon.\n  In February of 1990, the 2\\1/2\\-year-old company employed \napproximately 300 people and had a net worth of less than $2 million. \nThat year, there was an injection from the Small Business \nAdministration. Ten years later, the restaurant chain employs not 300 \npeople but 38,000 people. That $2 million has grown into revenues of \nthe dizzying amount of $1.16 billion. The Outback Steak House now has \nrestaurants in 48 States, 13 countries, and places as far away as Seoul \nand Rio de Janeiro.\n  Staples is another dazzling example of a Small Business \nAdministration injection of help with a catalytic effect. It started as \na single office supply store in Brighton, MA, in 1986. The office \nsupply store is now the country's largest operator of office \nsuperstores, employing more than 58,000 people, with annual gross sales \nof $11.6 billion. It in turn is offering services and products to small \nbusinesses to help them cut their own costs in the hopes that they \nmight also grow to such proportions.\n\n  At a macro level during the last 4 fiscal years, just one financing \nprogram within the Federal agency has helped create 1.3 million new \njobs--newly created jobs all by this one financing program.\n  Over that same period of time, a second lending program at the \nagency--a program called the 504 Loan Program--helped create and retain \nan additional 445,000 jobs.\n  HUBZone is another program that has been a job creator. In the last 2 \nyears, this program which targets severely economically distressed \nareas, has helped create over 30,000 new jobs.\n  These are just a few of the examples--a smattering--of the programs \nat the SBA that have helped and worked so effectively to add new jobs \nto the economy. The SBA, it should be said, is just one of the many \nefforts that are made by this body and by our Government to support job \ncreative policies.\n  We think simply back to the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act. We \nprovided 23 million small business owners with tax cuts averaging, \nthrough that one bill, $2,200 each. In fact, small businesses received \n80 percent of the benefits of the reduction in the top marginal tax \nrate. That 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act quadrupled the amount \nthat small businesses can expense for new capital investments, and that \nin turn will lead to new investment in technology, in machinery, and \nnew investments in equipment.\n  This legislation is yet another example of this body, our Government, \nworking with the President to create jobs and economic growth. Together \nwith the Small Business Administration reauthorization, these progrowth \npolicies--these policies that create jobs and grow the economy--will \nincrease productivity and make every consumer's dollar go further.\n  Remington Electric Shaver magnate and pitchman Victor Kiam once \nobserved:\n\n       Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is \n     little difference between obstacle and opportunity, and are \n     able to turn both to their advantage.\n\n  I think with the passage of this bill we can include ourselves--this \nbody--in that description as well.\n  I applaud my colleagues for supporting the Small Business \nAdministration, which in turn will reach out in support of America's \nmost important job creators, the small business owner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12053-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROSH HASHANAH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this evening at sundown, Jews around the \nworld will gather to begin their observance of Rosh Hashanah, the \nJewish New Year, and the beginning of the high holidays.\n  Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, which will be observed over the next 10 \ndays, are the most significant of all Jewish holidays. They are a time \nfor celebration. They are a time for thanksgiving. They are a time for \nfamily. They are a time of reflection and of atonement.\n  Many today all over the world are reflecting over the last year and \nwhat that last year has brought, and also to look ahead to that next \nyear with those hopes of what will come over the next 12 months. It is \nbelieved that on Rosh Hashanah, God records the destiny of all mankind \nin the Book of Life.\n  It is my hope that as we pray, we will do so for the enduring faith \nin God, and also with the strong, the fervent hope for the strength and \nthe courage and the boldness and also the compassion to see us through \nthese very difficult times for America and the world.\n  So as we end this week, I would like to wish all of my colleagues and \nall of those around the world who observe these holidays a very happy \nand a very healthy and a very sweet new year.\n  L'shana Toua.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12053-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12053-S12055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESIDENT BUSH'S AGENDA FOR IRAQ\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as a Member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, having had the opportunity to listen carefully to Secretary \nof Defense Rumsfeld lay out before the Senate and to the American \npeople President Bush's agenda for Iraq, I think I need to share my \ndismay at some itemization of the President's requests.\n  We all know, due to the lack of internationalization and the go-it-\nalone approach in Iraq, that the cost in blood and in money is almost \nexclusively\n\n[[Page S12054]]\n\nAmerican. That contrasts with Desert Storm over a decade ago when \nGeorge Bush, senior, led that war. While the United States did the \nlion's share of the fighting, the financial cost, at least, was \noffset--not quite but almost entirely--by our allies.\n  In this case, a unilateral or near unilateral preemptive effort, \nalienating our allies, has led us to a situation where, on the heels of \nthe $70 billion supplemental appropriations of a short time ago, the \nPresident has now asked for an additional $87 billion in yet another \ninstallment, and there will be more to come from the American \ntaxpayers. This is at a time when our budget is deep in red ink, having \ngone from budget surpluses from the last years of the Clinton \nadministration to now record deficits.\n  To put this $87 billion in some perspective, that is roughly three \ntimes what the Federal Government spends on K through 12 education for \nan entire year. At a time when we are told we do not have the money to \ncome up with the additional $8 billion for Leave No Child Behind, we \nhave an $87 billion request here. This is, again, due to a woeful lack \nof postwar planning for our circumstances in Iraq.\n  Much of this money will go for equipment and pay and resources for \nour troops in the field. There, there will be no quibbling. There will \nbe strong bipartisan support for that. My own son fought with the 101st \nAirborne in Baghdad. No one is more supportive of our troops than I. \nAlthough out of that immense amount of money, no doubt we do need to \nscrutinize it carefully to make sure the money is well spent.\n  But on the other $20.3 billion request for reconstruction--and when \nGeorge Bush says reconstruction, keep in mind he is not talking about \nrepairing things that were damaged in the war. He is talking about \nbuilding whole new water systems and communications systems and roads \nand schools and housing systems that never have existed before. So it \nwas with some interest that I looked at what some of the components are \nof our taxpayers' money that George Bush recommends that we authorize \nin this body.\n  There is $164 million for the curriculum for training the Iraqi \nmilitary. This doesn't involve any training organization hiring any \ntroops or policing. This is for a new textbook for a few for curriculum \ntraining--$164 million?\n  There is $100 million to finance 500 experts for investigating crimes \nagainst humanity at $200,000 per expert; 500 at $200,000 per expert to \ninvestigate crimes in Iraq; $20 million to protect 400 judges and \nprosecutors at $50,000 a crack--$50,000 a person, or 400 judges. That \nis just this year. Heaven knows what this is going to be in the future.\n  There is $100 million to enroll 100 families of five in a witness \nprotection program at $200,000 a person. Mr. Chairman, $200,000 a \nperson for witness protection in Iraq? I think you ought to be able to \nhide someone pretty well for $200,000 a pop. Yet this is going to cost \nus $100 million.\n  There is $10 million for 100 experts to assist prison reconstruction \nfor 6 months at $100,000 each. These experts must be much cheaper than \nthe $200,000 experts for crime investigation because prison \nconstruction is only $100,000 per piece but we are going to have 100 of \nthem.\n  There are 100 experts advising Iraq on how to build prisons in Iraq. \nThere is $400 million--we are getting into big money--for two new \n4,000-bed prisons at $50,000 a bed; 4,000 prison beds at $50,000 a bed.\n  I have a lot of constituents in my State of South Dakota who live in \nhomes that do not cost $50,000 a bedroom by far. Yet here we are \nbuilding this immense infrastructure in Iraq with American taxpayers' \nmoney at the time we are being told, no, we don't have the money to \nhelp our police and law enforcement in South Dakota and across the \ncountry. We don't have the resources for so many other needs which we \nhave. We are deep in debt and every dime of this is being paid for from \nthe Social Security trust fund?\n  The list goes on:\n  There is $150 million to begin work on a $500-$700 million children's \nhospital with all the latest technology. We all want to help the \nchildren of Iraq, but I have to tell you that we have children in South \nDakota--particularly on our Indian reservations--who have access to \nvirtually no health care at all. We have people in rural areas with \nhospitals that are on the verge of closing because of the lack of \nMedicare reimbursement. We have hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes \nacross America that may not last a year given the inadequacy of \nMedicare reimbursement, particularly in the rural areas.\n  We have teaching hospitals that train the next generation of medical \nexperts in America that are financed on fumes and do not know where \ntheir money is going to come from for next year. Yet we have this kind \nof expenditure request.\n  There is $100 million to build seven new cities, complete with 3,258 \nhouses, roads, elementary schools, two high schools, a clinic, a place \nof worship, and a market--seven new cities with new high schools.\n  I have high schools all over South Dakota that can't pass bond \nissues, that are falling down, that do not have infrastructure, and \nthat literally are a danger to the pupils. President Bush says he would \nveto legislation that would include money to help rebuild and renovate \nschools in America. But guess who is getting the new schools. It is not \nus. We are going to borrow more money out of the Social Security trust \nfund in order to do this. This is President Bush's priorities? What \ndoes that reflect on his values? Think of it.\n\n  There is $54 million for comprehensive technical and business process \nstudies for a computer network for the Iraqi postal system--$54 million \nfor computer studies for the Iraqi postal system. Where I come from, \nyou can buy a lot of computers for $54 million. You could run a pretty \ngood postal system in a small country with that. This is just for \ncomputer studies--$54 million. Think of the hospitals, nursing homes, \nclinics, schools, daycare centers, afterschool programs--think of what \nyou could do with that kind of resource.\n  There is $9 million to reengineer the business practices of Iraq's \npostal service, including instituting ZIP Codes. How has Iraq made it \nfor these thousands years without the Americans helping them develop a \nZIP Code? It is amazing. How have they struggled? How can we expect \nthese people to live without our taking money out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund to help them develop a ZIP Code? What a generous \nthing for this administration to do for other people on the other side \nof the planet on our dime, borrowing money to do it.\n  We have another $2 million for garbage trucks at $50,000 apiece. \nApparently, for these thousands of years the Iraqis have been unable to \ncollect their garbage because they did not have a modern garbage truck. \nThey had other vehicles for doing this. We are going to provide 40 of \nthese at $50,000 a pop.\n  I can tell you that I have a lot of people in communities in my State \nwishing they had some help for their infrastructure--whether it is \ngarbage, sewage, water, or a lot of other things. A lot of communities \nare struggling but they don't have the resources for this kind of help.\n  I am not suggesting that we cut and run from Iraq. I am not \nsuggesting that the United States doesn't have a significant role to \nplay in the reconstruction of that sad country. We are all glad Saddam \nHussein is gone. Heaven knows what is going to be in its place.\n  We have demonstrated that we can win wars unilaterally. But winning \nthe peace, this President should have learned long ago, requires \nsignificant international assistance. Now that our allies have been \nlargely alienated, it looks as if it is going to be our dollars and our \nblood to do it.\n  There is $20.3 billion, and the list of these kinds of things goes on \nand on.\n  I think this requires serious scrutiny. I think this deserves debate \nin this Senate. Our friends in the Republican leadership have told us \nthey don't want to segregate these issues from the financing of our \ntroops because they don't want the embarrassment of having a debate on \nthis and amendments offered and the possible rejection of some of this. \nApparently their goal is to wrap the whole thing up into one huge $87 \nbillion item and anybody who dares vote against that will have their \npatriotism challenged. They will be told they are not good Americans \nbecause they are not supporting our troops.\n\n[[Page S12055]]\n\n  We need a little sanity here. We need an opportunity--not to reject \neverything in the rebuilding of Iraq, but we have a role to play. We \nwill step to the plate to do our share.\n  But this administration has been told in no uncertain terms that this \nshouldn't be exclusively our obligation; that when we do some \nrebuilding it shouldn't be at such a fabulous level of extravagance far \nbeyond what any American community could possibly come to Washington \nand ask for.\n  Our people deserve better. They deserve to know what is in George \nBush's request. They deserve to have some up-and-down votes, and this \nshouldn't be rushed through in a manner that the people do not actually \nunderstand what they are buying into with an agenda such as this.\n  I know we are going to go to markup on this supplemental request very \nquickly next week. The difficulty in shoving this thing through so fast \nis that the American taxpayer will have no idea what was in this thing. \nThey will be told it is $87 billion--a huge number. Who knows what that \nmeans until you explain in some detail what you could buy with that \nkind of money.\n  I think we need to have a national debate about America's role in the \nworld and about the level and scope of the contributions that America \nis making in rebuilding this country. Why has this administration \nfailed to attract international financial support? If you cannot get \ntheir troops, why not at least some financial resources for this \nrebuilding? Why has that failed, as well? We need to know that.\n\n  We need to know what will follow. I assure this body, this is not the \nlast request. This is an installment. There is much more to come, both \nmilitarily and potentially in rebuilding.\n  What has happened to the Iraqi oil revenue? Is there a possibility of \nturning some of this into loans rather than flatout grants? We are told \nwe cannot loan the money because Iraq already has a lot of debt. Their \ndebt is primarily to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Apparently, it appears we \nare going to put repaying their debts ahead of the American taxpayer, \nahead of our financial needs. We are saying we have to give grants \nbecause these people have to pay off their loans to Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait before they can do anything for us.\n  We have water projects in South Dakota. We have sewer wastewater \nproblems. We have roads, railroads, all kinds of infrastructure that is \nunderfunded. Those communities are being asked for matching funds. Many \nprojects in South Dakota and across the country are done by loans. And \nwe have a grant level at $20.3 billion, with mind-boggling levels of \nexpenditure, for purposes that would leave any American citizen shaking \nhis head.\n  We do not want to delay anything unnecessarily. There are some urgent \nneeds in Iraq, particularly for our troops. We need to take care of \nthose needs and have some certainty.\n  I hope in the course of this debate the American people are \nconsidering the use of their dollars, that there be considerable \nscrutiny and the people understand what this President wants them to \nbuy into. If that comprehension is out there, there will be a lot of \nunhappiness in the land if, in fact, this Senate is unable to break out \nsome of these expenditures; if we have to pass this up-or-down vote in \none massive $87 billion item--three times America's education budget--\nfor purposes that would make royalty blush.\n  Our people deserve better. The Senate deserves an opportunity to \nconsider these issues with much more care than is being suggested.\n  We will learn more, no doubt, about the details of some of the \nproposed expenditures from the Bush administration in the days to come. \nI hope we have a very real, sobering debate about the use of our \nconstituents' money and whether this is the best use--some of it, no \ndoubt, is; but much of it, I submit, is an outrageous abuse to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was quite moved by my colleague from \nSouth Dakota and his comments about the war, the budget and the choices \nthat the Senate is going to have to make. I thank my colleague for \ndiscussing such specific, detailed, and passionate comments, and \nraising the awareness of some of the very substantial issues at stake \nin making such a compelling argument as to why this discussion should \ncontinue for some reasonable length of time so these issues can be \naired and the American people can have a better opportunity to come to \ntheir own conclusion based on facts as the Senator outlined this \nmorning.\n  I commend the Senator and thank him. Other colleagues will speak of \nthe issues, including the international challenges that face America, \nas well as the domestic challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12055-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LIE AND BUY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on September 18, 2003, the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics released its annual report on the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System, also known as NICS. According to its \nreport, approximately 136,000, or 1.7 percent, of the 7.8 million of \nthe gun checks performed by the NICS system resulted in a denial. Since \nits inception, the NICS database has prevented approximately 976,000 \nindividuals from illegally acquiring a firearm. The report went on to \nnote that 66 percent of the rejections were due to a felony record or \noutstanding warrant, and about 14 percent were rejected for a domestic \nviolence misdemeanor conviction or restraining order.\n  Earlier this year, the Americans for Gun Safety Foundation released a \nreport entitled, ``The Enforcement Gap: Federal Gun Laws Ignored.'' The \nreport analyzed the Justice Department's record enforcing and \nprosecuting gun laws. The report examined prosecution data acquired \nunder the Freedom of Information Act from the Justice Department for \nfiscal years 2000 through 2002. The AGS study reveals a significant gap \nbetween the number of Federal gun crimes committed and the number of \nFederal prosecutions initiated.\n  The report found that 20 of the 22 major Federal gun laws are rarely \nprosecuted. The two statutes consistently enforced are laws against the \nuse of a firearm in the commission of a Federal crime and a felon in \npossession of a firearm. The 20 laws that address other illegal firearm \nactivity, including gun trafficking, firearm theft, lying on a criminal \nbackground check form, removing firearm serial numbers, and selling \nguns to minors are rarely enforced according to the AGS study.\n  The statistics in the AGS report are startling. According to AGS, in \nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, U.S. Attorneys filed only \n578 cases against individuals who lied on the criminal background check \nform to purchase a firearm despite the fact that over 100,000 people \nwere denied purchases for that reason. President Bush and Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft pledged to vigorously enforce the gun laws on the \nbooks, but the AGS report seems to indicate that the Bush \nadministration has failed to live up to the promise. I believe vigorous \nlaw enforcement is a critical step toward reducing gun violence. I urge \nthe Justice Department to step up its efforts to prosecute not only \npeople who commit gun crimes, but those who illegally seek to buy a \ngun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12055-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12055-S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN ``KELLY'' EARL DAVIS\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am delighted to honor a \nMinnesotan who recently reached the age of 90, after having spent much \nof her life in dedicated service in her community. Carolyn ``Kelly'' \nEarl Davis was born on September 21, 1913, the daughter of Dr. George \nEarl and Lillian Earl. Growing up, Carolyn, affectionately known since \nchildhood as ``Kelly''--the name given to her by her brother, Rol--\nloved to play baseball. She was an all-star player whose exploits on \nthe field were greeted with exhortations of ``Slide, Kelly, slide!''\n\n[[Page S12056]]\n\n  Kelly lived in St. Paul, MN, and attended Summit School, where she \ntook part in student government, sports, and volunteer work. She then \nattended Smith College and the University of Minnesota. In 1936, Kelly \nmarried Edward P. ``Ned'' Davis, Jr., and the Davises, who eventually \nhad three daughters, Sally, Janie, and Mary, lived in St. Paul until \nmoving to Bloomington's Friendship Village retirement community. They \nhad been married 60 years at the time of Ned's death in 1997.\n  Today, Kelly is the proud grandmother of 6 and the great-grandmother \nof 3. Her family activities and interests have included canoeing, \nskiing, tennis, and golf. Throughout her life, Kelly has also given of \nherself through a remarkable career of volunteer service. During World \nWar II, she served her country as a nurse's aide with the Red Cross. \nShe is a member of the House of Hope Presbyterian Church, where she has \nbeen president of the Women's Association Board, among other offices \nand committee memberships. She has taught Sunday school and has also \nbeen a leader of the Brownies and Girl Scouts. Her enthusiasm for \nsports motivated her to teach tennis and skiing to underprivileged \nchildren, having collected the necessary equipment for them to use.\n  Because education has been especially important to her, she belonged \nto the alumni boards of the Saint Paul Academy and Summit School. She \nwas also a member of Summit School's Board of Trustees and chaired the \nschool's 1958 building fund. Even at the age of 79, Kelly was still \nbusy, serving as the chairman of Summit School's 75th anniversary \ncelebration.\n  The range of Kelly's interests and pursuits is formidable: the arts, \npublic health, employment, child and family welfare. She gave of her \nenergies and fund-raising talents to a variety of organizations and \ncauses, including the Junior League, the St. Paul Rehabilitation \nCenter, the Children's Hospital Association, Neighborhood House, \nMerriam Park Community Center, the Volunteer Bureau, the Family Nursing \nService, Planned Parenthood, and the Minnesota Public Health \nAssociation.\n  Despite the passing years, Kelly remained involved into her eighties. \nShe served for two terms on the Friendship Village residents council \nand held the post of chair of the Friendship Village ad hoc committee \nfor the health care center renovation.\n  Kelly's contributions are so numerous that they are almost impossible \nto catalogue. I am proud to salute this remarkable lady for her \nexceptional record of community service and advocacy. Truly, Kelly has \nspent her life working with and enjoying people of all ages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12056-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:44 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2557.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Small and emerging businesses, particularly startups \n     and businesses that lack sufficient or conventional \n     collateral, continue to face barriers accessing mid-sized \n     loans in amounts between $35,000 and $200,000, with \n     affordable terms and conditions.\n       (2) Consolidation in the banking industry has resulted in a \n     decrease in the number of small, locally controlled banks \n     with not more than $100,000,000 in assets and has changed the \n     method by which banks make small business credit decisions \n     with--\n       (A) credit scoring techniques replacing relationship-based \n     lending, which often works to the disadvantage of small or \n     startup businesses that do not conform with a bank's \n     standardized credit formulas; and\n       (B) less flexible terms and conditions, which are often \n     necessary for small and emerging businesses.\n       (3) In the environment described in paragraphs (1) and (2), \n     non-profit intermediary lenders, including community \n     development corporations, providing financial resources that \n     serve to supplement the small business lending and \n     investments of a bank by--\n       (A) providing riskier, up front, or subordinated capital;\n       (B) offering flexible terms and underwriting procedures; \n     and\n       (C) providing technical assistance to businesses in order \n     to reduce the transaction costs and risk exposure of banks.\n       (4) Several Federal programs, including the Microloan \n     Program under section 7(m) of the\n\n[[Page S12070]]\n\n     Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(m)) and the Intermediary \n     Relending Program of the Department of Agriculture, have \n     demonstrated the effectiveness of working through non-profit \n     intermediaries to address the needs of small business \n     concerns that are unable to access capital through \n     conventional sources.\n       (5) More than 1,000 non-profit intermediary lenders in the \n     United States are--\n       (A) successfully providing financial and technical \n     assistance to small and emerging businesses;\n       (B) working with banks and other lenders to leverage \n     additional capital for their business borrowers; and\n       (C) creating employment opportunities for low income \n     individuals through their lending and business development \n     activities.\n\n     SEC. 293.

Mr. President, I rise today to seek unanimous consent for \nthe passage of the Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act of 2003, S. 1375, a bill to reauthorize the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration, SBA and its programs for the next 3 \nyears, together with a managers' amendment.\n  As the chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \nI am pleased to report that this legislation passed the Committee on \nJuly 10, 2003, by a unanimous vote. It is the product of significant \ncontributions by the members of my committee, and I am grateful for the \nefforts of the committee's ranking member, Senator Kerry, to make this \na truly bipartisan bill.\n  The challenge for today's SBA is enormous. Each year, there are 3 to \n4 million new business start-ups--1 in 25 adult Americans is taking \nsteps to start a business. And, small businesses account for \napproximately two-thirds of the net new jobs in our country.\n  We began the reauthorization process this year with a series of \nhearings, roundtables, and discussions to develop a bill that would \nimprove the SBA programs that provide counseling and training for \nentrepreneurs--and to improve the SBA's financial assistance and \nGovernment procurement programs that enable small businesses to prosper \nand expand. While the particulars of this bill are extensive, let me \nhighlight a few of its key areas.\n  In terms of financing programs for small businesses, I have focused \nextensively on improving the credit and venture capital resources that \nthe SBA provides for small businesses. These programs are the \ncenterpiece of the SBA's efforts to help entrepreneurs get started and \nassist small businesses to prosper. In fact, in just the past 3 years \nalone, the SBA's lending programs made it possible for small businesses \nto create or retain more than 1.3 million jobs.\n  Nevertheless, access to capital continues to rank as a primary \nconcern for small business owners. So, we are proposing to continue the \ngrowth of the financing programs through reasonable increases in the \nauthorization levels of the 7(a), 504 and Microloan programs. The bill \nalso increases the amount that small businesses can borrow subject to \nthe SBA's guarantee, so that the SBA's loan sizes realistically reflect \nwhat it costs to start and operate a small business in today's economy. \nMoreover, the bill addresses access to capital by helping SBA's lending \npartners--for instance, through the new National Preferred Lenders \nPilot Program.\n  In the area of entrepreneurial development, we set out to ensure that \nthe SBA's programs continue to provide the products and services \nessential to small businesses. Recognizing the tremendous \naccomplishments by women entrepreneurs, I have included the Women's \nSmall Business Improvement Act of 2003, which I introduced earlier this \nyear, to integrate and better leverage the spectrum of women's business \nprograms that the SBA provides for women entrepreneurs.\n  A cornerstone of these improvements involves making the Women's \nBusiness Center Program a permanent program that will offer \nopportunities for the creation of new centers and renewal grants for \nexisting centers on a competitive basis. By replacing the pilot \nSustainability Program, which expires at the end of the current fiscal \nyear, with a fair and balanced grant program, the bill will correct the \nfunding constraints that have plagued the program in 2003.\n  In addition, the SBA's entrepreneurial development partners--the \nSmall Business Development Centers and the Service Corps of Retired \nExecutives--continue to provide quality training and free counseling \nthrough almost 2,000 locations. As a result, in addition to minor \ntechnical changes in these programs, the bill reauthorizes these \ncritical programs for the next three years.\n  Finally, one of the most serious problems facing small businesses is \ntheir inability to participate fully in Federal contracts, on either a \nprime or subcontract basis. In the last 10 years, contract bundling has \nforced more than 50 percent of small businesses out of the Federal \nmarketplace. The bill addresses the practice of Federal contract \nbundling by changing the definition of ``contract bundling'' to limit \nits use so that small businesses have better access to Federal \ncontracts and a fair opportunity to compete for them.\n  Furthermore, the bill implements the Procurement Program for Women-\nowned Small Business Concerns, which will give contracting officers the \ntools necessary to help women-owned small businesses compete in the \nFederal marketplace more effectively. The bill also contains \nimprovements to the HUBZone program, including the designation of a \nclosed military base as a HUBZone for 5 years to reduce the serious \nconsequences that military base closings pose for our local \ncommunities.\n  With this bill, I am offering a managers' amendment, which is co-\nsponsored by Senator Kerry, to address several issues that have risen \nsince the\n\n[[Page S12081]]\n\ncommittee's markup of the bill. In working with several of my \ncolleagues, on and off of the Small Business Committee, I believe the \nchanges encompassed in this amendment address certain concerns and \nstrengthen particular aspects of the bill so that it provides the \ngreatest benefit to small businesses and entrepreneurs in this country. \nLet me highlight several of these changes.\n  First, the amendment removes section 265, which would have authorized \nthe SBA to develop and implement an innovative 3-year pilot program in \nwhich the SBA would provide a partial guarantee on pools of securitized \nsmall business loans that are not otherwise guaranteed by the SBA.\n  When the President's Fiscal Year 2004 budget request was transmitted \nto the Congress this past February, it stated that the SBA was \nexploring a possible new approach to expand the opportunities of small \nbusinesses to access capital markets by facilitating the securitization \nof conventional small business loans that were not already guaranteed \nby the SBA. Increasing access to capital is a high priority of small \nbusinesses, and has been one of the Committee's priorities throughout \nits history. We are always seeking innovative ways to increase access \nto capital for small businesses, while at the same time measuring the \ncost and risk of loss that the Federal Government must incur to \nfacilitate such financing. Accordingly, I recognized the potential \nbenefits of this proposal for small businesses across the Nation.\n\n  At our roundtable on April 30, 2003, the committee examined the loan-\npooling proposal in greater detail. The SBA reported that it had been \nexploring this type of program for some time, and thought the idea had \nconsiderable merit. The agency, however, was uncertain if it had the \nauthority to develop and implement such a program, absent legislative \nauthorization. After the roundtable, we consulted with the SBA and with \nparticipants in the small business financing industry to determine the \nprogram's appropriate elements.\n  In addition to the support the SBA expressed for the proposal in its \nbudget request, at the committee's roundtable, and in subsequent \ndiscussions with committee staff, the SBA took other steps to help make \nthe proposal a success. For example, the agency entered into a contract \nwith Dun & Bradstreet and with Fair, Isaacs, Co., to create a credit-\nscoring model for small businesses, similar to individual consumer \ncredit scores, to help small businesses gauge their credit quality. The \nscoring model will assist the pooling proposal by providing uniformity \nof pricing, thus reducing a primary obstacle to the securitization of \nnon-SBA small business loans. The SBA also helped build support for the \nproposal by publicizing the need to take the foundational steps to \nbuild a secondary market for small business loans, rather than later \ntrying to create such a market in one step when economic pressures \ncalled for an immediate response.\n  The SBA is not alone in its support for a program to securitize small \nbusiness loans. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \nin its September 2002 Report to the Congress on the Availability of \nCredit to Small Businesses, stated that the securitization of small \nbusiness loans could ``substantially influence the availability of \ncredit'' to small businesses. The Federal Reserve noted that one \nprimary benefit of a secondary market would be that small business \nborrowers could enjoy lower financing costs. In addition to the Federal \nReserve report, other studies have shown that small businesses could \nbenefit from an efficient secondary market for small business loans.\n  The Federal Reserve report noted that a primary obstacle to a wide-\nspread secondary market for small business loans was the lack of \nstandardized information to evaluate small business loans for re-sale. \nAs noted, the SBA has exercised foresight by securing the contract with \nDun & Bradstreet and Fair, Isaacs to attack this problem. With the \ninformation provided by this new credit-scoring model, the \nsecuritization of non-SBA small business loans will be far more \nfeasible.\n  The committee has received support for the pilot program from \nrepresentatives of thousands of small businesses that believe the \nprogram could improve access to capital, and could improve the terms of \nloans received, for many small businesses, particularly those without \nsignificant real estate property to use as collateral. Significant \nsupport for the program has been expressed particularly by small \nbusinesses that are owned by minorities or by women. For these small \nbusinesses, which often have less real estate collateral, on average, \nthan other small businesses, the pilot program holds great potential \nfor creating capital resources to meet their financing needs.\n  Financial firms currently involved in the pooling and securitization \nof SBA 7(a) and 504 loans have also expressed their support for the \nprogram, and have stated their belief that it will increase small \nbusinesses' access to effective capital.\n  With this input from the SBA, small businesses, and financial firms \nin hand, and having considered many studies regarding small business \ncredit and the effectiveness of secondary markets, we included Section \n265 in S. 1375, which was approved unanimously by the committee. \nSection 265 authorized, but did not require, the SBA to develop the \npilot program if the SBA determined that it could be practically \nimplemented.\n  The rationale for this proposal is to increase effective liquidity \nfor small businesses by improving the quality and amount of loans \navailable to them. The pooling structure is based on similar \narrangements for home mortgages, credit card loans, and car loans, \nwhich have active secondary markets. This program would allow lenders, \nincluding community banks, to benefit from the increased liquidity of \nsmall business loans and to utilize capital that is otherwise locked \ninto existing loans, and therefore provide better terms on loans to \nsmall businesses, as well as to make more small business loans.\n  This proposal, as embodied in Section 265, is not a departure from \nthe SBA's current practice of guaranteeing loans and regulating the \nsecuritization of those loans. The SBA already regulates the \nsecuritization of both guaranteed portions of loans provided to small \nbusinesses and non-guaranteed portions of the same loans. These loans \nare made both by Federally-regulated lenders and by lenders that are \nnot Federally regulated. In Fiscal Year 2002, the SBA regulated the \nsecuritization of $3.4 billion in Government-guaranteed small business \nloans made under Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act. When the \nguaranteed portions of the 7(a) loans are securitized separately from \nthe non-guaranteed portions, the SBA is guaranteeing 100 percent of the \nloan pools.\n  The new proposal presents a much more measured SBA involvement than \nis involved with the SBA's current financing programs. Under the pilot \nprogram, financial firms approved by the SBA would pool loans not \nindividually guaranteed by the SBA. These pooling entities would then \nissue securities offering returns based upon the returns from the loans \nin the pool. The securities would be rated by a rating agency and sold \nto investors.\n  The pooling entity would also offer a partial ``first-loss'' \nguarantee to investors on the securities' returns. If the loans had \ninsufficient returns to pay the expected returns on the securities, the \npooling entity's guarantee would be the first guarantee called into \nperformance to pay investors. The SBA would issue partial, not \ncomplete, ``second loss'' guarantees on the return from the securities, \nbut not on individual loans within the pool. The agency's guarantees \nwould thus be available only after the first-loss guarantees offered by \nthe pool issuers are exhausted. In addition, the SBA will only need to \nprovide guarantees at a much lower percentage level than is currently \nthe case for the SBA's guarantees on individual loans. Finally, and \nperhaps most importantly, the cost of the SBA guarantees will be fully \nfunded by fees paid by the loan poolers, so no Federal appropriations \nwill be necessary.\n  The proposed program also requires three separate types of reports. \nThe SBA must provide to the committee and to the Committee on Small \nBusiness of the House of Representatives a report detailing the pooling \nprogram before it is implemented, and wait 50 days after submitting the \nreport before implementing the program. In addition, the SBA must file \nwith the Congress, in the SBA's Budget Request and\n\n[[Page S12082]]\n\nPerformance Plan, an annual report about the program's performance. \nFinally, the GAO is required to study the program, if implemented, and \nreport on the program's performance, including any effects the program \nmay have on the 504 or 7(a) programs, before calendar year 2006.\n  Working with Senator Pryor and with other colleagues, both on and off \nthe committee, we endeavored to provide greater specificity in the \ninstructions the provision gives the SBA regarding the pilot program, \nso as to ensure that the pooling proposal provides the greatest benefit \nto small businesses in need of capital while limiting risk to the \nFederal Government. I believe those modifications would have greatly \nimproved the pilot program and increased its potential to provide \nincreased access to capital on terms that are beneficial to small \nbusinesses.\n  Access to credit for small businesses is often a challenge, and the \ncommittee has consistently believed that encouraging more lending to \nsmall businesses that have a likelihood to succeed, grow, and create \nnew jobs is a sound national policy. The pilot program takes advantage \nof the successful example of the prior securizations of SBA small \nbusiness loans, and of changes in the investment community, to \nfacilitate lending in the small business community for years to come.\n  However, while I continue to recognize the merits of this measure and \nbelieve that it should be included in this bill, the administration has \nnow taken a contrary position. In the interest of expediting the \npassage of S. 1375 before the SBA's current authorizing legislation \nexpires, I am reluctantly removing this provision to focus on those \nelements of the bill that must be enacted.\n  While I am disappointed to have to remove this section, it is clear \nthat this bill must move forward as quickly as possible. I want to be \nclear, however, that I continue to appreciate the benefits of this \npilot program, and will introduce this provision as a separate bill in \nthe near future. With the support this proposal already has, I am \nconfident we can implement this innovative program, and I look forward \nto the benefits it can provide for small businesses as we try to assist \nsmall businesses to prosper, create more jobs, and pull the economy out \nof its current doldrums.\n  The amendment also modifies the provisions of the bill relating to \nthe New Markets Venture Capital Program and the definition of ``low-\nincome geographic area,'' in which New Markets Venture Capital \ncompanies are to invest most of their funds. In order to coordinate the \ndefinition of ``low-income geographic area'' used in the SBA's New \nMarkets Venture Capital Program and that used for the New Markets Tax \nCredit under the tax code, the managers' amendment specifies that the \nSmall Business Act's definition will be based on median family income, \nrather than median household income as under current law.\n  This change will eliminate confusion that has resulted from the use \nof different definitions for two related programs. More importantly, by \nsignificantly broadening the definition of those areas in which \ninvestment is permitted under the New Markets Venture Capital program, \nthis change will increase the flexibility that New Markets Venture \nCapital companies have in choosing small businesses in which to invest. \nAs a result, we should see stronger New Markets Venture Capital \ncompanies and more small businesses being served through this venture \ncapital program.\n  The third part of the managers' amendment modifies several provisions \nin the bill relating to government contracting opportunities for small \nbusinesses. In 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act, FASA, to streamline Federal procurement processes. \nFASA included an amendment to the Small Business Act that created an \nexclusive reservation for small businesses consisting of contracts \nvalued at more than $2,500 but not more than $100,000. And, while it \nhad the chance to classify purchases under multiple-award schedule \ncontracts, including Federal Supply Schedule, within this reserve at \nthat time, the Congress expressly excluded these sales from small \nbusiness set-aside rules. Accordingly, rules on small business set-\nasides do not apply to Federal Supply Schedule purchases, and, instead, \ncontracting officers are required to give a ``preference'' to small \nbusinesses.\n  Although reports now indicate that the level of small business \nparticipation on schedule contracts is growing and is relatively higher \nthan the share small businesses receive on non-schedule contracts, \nsmall businesses continue to report to the committee that they invest \ntime and money to negotiate a schedule contract successfully with the \nGeneral Services Administration or an executive agent managing a \nGovernment-wide Acquisition Contract, and then they never receive the \nbenefit of an order placed against that contract. Small businesses \nfurther report that the Government relies on a limited and preferred \nlist of larger firms to meet its requirements for goods and services.\n  Small businesses deserve to have a fair opportunity to compete for \nthose orders. The Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act would protect small businesses and ensure that they \ncontinue to have access to, and the opportunity to compete for, \nmultiple-award and schedule purchases. Specifically, the bill restricts \ncompetition of schedule orders valued between $2,500 and $100,000 for \nsmall businesses.\n  I know that some of my colleagues believe that by setting aside \nschedule orders under $100,000, thousands of small firms that supply \nand sell through contracts held by large firms may significantly be \nharmed. They also question the need for action if small businesses are \nsuccessfully competing for and winning schedule orders each day. \nFinally, they assert that scheduled contracts are a faster, easier, \nmore flexible way for agencies to meet their needs and any change that \nreduces that ease should be challenged.\n  In my view, if small businesses enjoy a majority share of schedule \ncontracts--which they do--should not their participation in these \ncontracts reflect their representation on the supply schedule? \nCurrently, small businesses represent more than 70 percent of the \ncompanies listed on the Federal Supply Schedule, yet these small \nbusinesses are receiving just under 30 percent of the awards under the \nschedule.\n  The intent of multiple-award contacting was not to have a majority of \norders awarded on a sole-source basis. Rather, it was designed to be a \nstreamlined acquisition process to achieve competition without \nincreasing the government's risk. Including small business helps to \nensure the Federal Government is getting the best products and services \nat the best prices.\n  Nevertheless, in order to ensure the timely passage of this important \nreauthorization legislation, I have agreed to modify the bill's \nprovision that would have allowed small business set-asides of awards \non multiple-award contracts, to require, instead, that contracting \nofficers review the offers of at least two small businesses when \ncompleting orders on multiple-award contacts. While I had hoped to \nprovide stronger provisions for small businesses seeking to contract \nwith the Federal Government, I believe this compromise will still lead \nto greater procurement opportunities for small enterprises.\n  This modification anticipates that a contracting officer will give \nserious consideration to small businesses seeking to provide goods and \nservices to the Federal Government. As an example, when placing orders \nfor supplies with contractors on the General Services Administration's \nFederal Supply Schedule, contracting officers should consider the \ninformation available on the GSA Advantage on-line shopping service or \nother catalogs and price lists of at least two small business multiple-\naward-schedule contractors that provide the supplies that are being \npurchased.\n  Placing orders for services, however, may be more complex at times. \nIn these instances, contracting officers purchasing from Government-\nwide acquisition contacts, multi-agency contracts, or the Federal \nSupply Schedule should include at least two small businesses when they \nsolicit offers. These actions will ensure that small business multiple-\naward contractors have a fair opportunity to be considered for orders.\n  To ensure the necessary steps are taken to establish clear guidance \nand that agencies follow these established procedures to implement this \ncompromise, my committee will closely\n\n[[Page S12083]]\n\nmonitor competition and small business participation on multiple-award \ncontracts. Specifically, the amendment mandates the U.S. General \nAccounting Office, GAO, to report bi-annually to the Committees on \nSmall Business on the number of actions and dollars awarded to small \nbusiness under multiple-award contracts and help to achieve the level \nof competition in Federal contracting that Congress envisioned. In \naddition, the existing provisions in the bill require the GAO to \nconduct periodic reviews of small business participation in multiple-\naward contracts, which will help Congress to ensure these provisions \nare implemented appropriately.\n  Responding to additional concerns raised by my colleagues, the \nmanagers' amendment withdraws language that references the authority of \nagencies to withhold a portion of a performance-related bonus awarded \nto procurement officials for failure to achieve small business goals.\n  The committee believes measures that hold agency officials \naccountable for their performance will drive results. Therefore, \nlanguage in the bill, as reported, would have held agency procurement \nofficials accountable for small business goals. It directed agencies to \ninclude in the annual performance evaluation for agency procurement \nofficials a factor that measures the success of that official in small \nbusiness utilization.\n  It further required agencies to factor the performance of procurement \nofficials in achieving these small business goals into any monetary \nrewards under consideration. In order to avoid delaying the entire bill \nfor this provision, I have reluctantly agreed to withdraw this latter \nprovision. Nevertheless, my committee will continue to monitor the \nextent to which agencies are meeting their small business goals and \nlook for every opportunity to hold failing agencies accountable to our \nsmall business constituency.\n  With respect to subcontracting opportunities, once a contract that \ncontains a small business subcontracting plan has been awarded by a \nFederal agency, the prime contractor is required to submit reports \nperiodically to the Government that include information on the prime \ncontractor's achievement of its subcontracting goals and the dollars \nawarded to small business subcontractors. While the U.S. General \nAccounting Office indicates that most contractors that the GAO reviewed \nmake good faith efforts to comply with their subcontracting plans, \nsmall businesses report to my committee that not only do prime \ncontractors fail to comply with subcontracting plans, but they also \nfail to submit complete and accurate subcontracting reports. Therefore, \nthis managers' amendment contains a technical correction to clarify \nthat the company president or the head of the entity must certify that \ndata contained in subcontracting compliance evaluation reports provided \nto the government is accurate and complete.\n  In addition, under current language in the bill, a contracting \nofficer must first consider ``all reasonable issues regarding the \nsubcontractor's performance, or lack of performance, before making a \ndetermination that the prime contractor failed in its responsibility to \ntimely pay a small business subcontractor.'' Some of my colleagues, \nhowever, have raised concerns that this language limits the contracting \nofficer's discretion to issues regarding only the performance of the \nsubcontractor, and that other issues that might legitimately cause non-\npayment, such as disputes over off-sets, could not be considered. That \nwas never the intent of the bill reported by the committee.\n  In light of these concerns, the managers' amendment modifies the \nlanguage to ensure that a contracting officer can consider ``all \nreasonable issues regarding the circumstances surrounding the failure \nto make timely payment to a small business subcontractor'' before \nmaking a determination to make a direct payment to the subcontractor \nunder a pilot program to test direct payments to small business \ncontractors.\n  The committee also recognizes the economic ramifications that \nmilitary base closures can have on our local communities and economies. \nWe believe the SBA's Historically Underutilized Business Zone, HUBZone, \nprogram can harness the strength and the creativity of the small \nbusiness sector by providing these firms with incentives to relocate to \nareas suffering from the effects of a military base closure. Therefore, \nwe included language in the bill to designate base closure areas as \nHUBZones, and the managers' amendment clarifies that such designation \nwill apply to military bases closed after the date of enactment for a \nperiod of 5 years in order to attract small businesses to areas \naffected by base closure where there are customers and a skilled \nworkforce. The committee believes that new business and new jobs \ncreated through HUBZone small businesses means new life for areas \naffected by base closure.\n  Lastly, our colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, has \nrequested an adjustment to the Program for Investment in \nMicroentrepreneurs, PRIME, which the bill reauthorizes for 3 years. To \naccommodate this request, the managers' amendment authorizes $2 million \nunder the PRIME program to be spent to provide grants to intermediaries \nto assist disadvantaged Native American entrepreneurs. This \nmodification enhances the bill's provisions that encourage Native \nAmerican-owned businesses and new Native American entrepreneurs.\n  Mr. President, I will close by noting that this is one of the most \nexpansive SBA reauthorization bills in the 50-year history of the \nagency. The SBA estimates that reauthorizing the agency will result in \n3.3 million jobs over the next 5 years, with the SBA and its programs \npredicted to support over 1 million jobs over that same period through \nprime contracts and subcontracts.\n  This bill is based on the deliberative, methodical, and systematic \napproach that this committee has taken to review the spectrum of SBA \nprograms, building on those that are working and fixing those that are \nnot. How can we do anything less for the economic engine of our \neconomy--small business--which holds the greatest hope for this \ncountry's recovery from the current economic doldrums?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, as ranking democrat on the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I join the \ncommittee's chair, Senator Olympia Snowe, in bringing to the floor for \nfinal Senate consideration, a 3-year reauthorization bill for the Small \nBusiness Administration's programs.\n  These programs help small businesses with access to capital, business \nadvice and training and Federal procurement opportunities. But before I \nspeak more specifically about the provisions of the bill, I would like \nto thank Chair Snowe for working hand-in-hand with me on this, my third \nreauthorization of the Small Business Administration since becoming \nranking member in 1997. Having worked close on two previous \nreauthorizations, and as a member of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee for over 18 years, I can tell you that the \nSBA reauthorization process takes diligence and a strong attention to \ndetail. I want to commend Senator Snowe for taking the initiative to \ndraft legislation that makes such important and necessary changes to \nthe SBA during this reauthorization process and for showing great \nleadership in her first 9 months as chair of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Our bill will strengthen the SBA and dramatically improve the \nagency's ability to deliver services to small businesses in every \nState. It is based on a sound committee record. In addition to holding \ntwo hearings and three roundtables to specifically address the SBA's \nprograms and related reauthorization issues, our committee met and \nspoke with numerous constituents, program directors and small business \nadvocates. It is through this correspondence, research and input that \nour committee has been able to prepare a comprehensive piece of \nlegislation that should serve the Small Business Administration and the \nentire small-business community well past even the next reauthorization \nperiod.\n  Over the past 3 years, as chairman and ranking member of this \ncommittee, I have seen this administration\n\n[[Page S12084]]\n\nreduce Government funding and transfer that money to the wealthy with \ntax cut after tax cut, resulting in a significant loss of revenue for \nessential initiatives aimed at fostering small businesses and the job \ncreation and economic activity they bring about. While many of like to \nnote that small businesses are the engine of economic growth and should \nbe bolstered by our Government, this administration has given small \nbusinesses more words than action.\n  The need for small business programs--for access to capital, for \ntraining and counseling, for assistance in gaining access to the \nFederal marketplace--runs counter cyclically to the economy. When the \neconomy is slumping, as it now is, small businesses and entrepreneurs \nneed the SBA even more. Our committee has heard from the small-business \ncommunity that demand for training and assistance and access to capital \nis up, yet this administration has proposed freezing funding for \nvirtually all SBA programs for 6 years. Their proposal includes no \nadjustment for inflation or demand, despite the SBA's own numbers that \nshow demand is up for its programs. The SBA's largest lending programs \nwould have run out of money this year had the SBA not taken the drastic \nstep of capping the size of loans. Both the problem of \nimminent shutdown and the SBA's solution of a cap would have been bad \nfor struggling small businesses. But for additional funding of more \nthan $3 billion made available by Congress, the SBA's solution would \nhave disrupted many small businesses' access to otherwise unattainable \ncapital. Again, the problem and its solution could have been avoided \nhad the administration properly funded this important program.\n\n  It is in carrying out our legislative and oversight responsibilities \nthat Chair Snowe and I raised a number of concerns regarding the SBA's \nreauthorization proposal and the overall management and direction of \nmany of the agency's programs through hearings and roundtables and in \nletters and phone calls to the administration. And after hearing from \nthe community and working with small business experts in the field, \nSenator Snowe and I came to the conclusion that many of the proposals \nput forth by the Small Business Administration would not help the \nagency's programs, but rather would ultimately hinder them.\n  This administration and small businesses across this Nation will \nfind, however, that our prescription for small businesses in a flailing \neconomy is quite different. Our reauthorization legislation embraces \nthe initiatives that have worked for years, redirects those that have \nstruggled, and sets the SBA and our small business sector up for \ncontinued success.\n  Although banks have plenty of cash to lend, many small businesses \nstill have a problem getting access to credit. Either the terms are \nunreasonable, or they can not get a loan at all. For the past few years \nas the economy has fizzled, the Federal Reserve has reported that banks \nhave cut back on lending to small businesses, making it harder and more \nexpensive to get loans. And who has been there to pick up the slack? \nThe Small Business Administration and its lending partners.\n  Lending is up 37 percent in the SBA's largest lending program for \nworking capital. Lending is up 22 percent in the SBA's loan program for \nsmall businesses that are growing and need money to buy equipment and \nbuildings. Lending is up in the SBA's microloan program, which serves \nthose with the least access to capital through the private sector. And \nthe SBA's venture capital programs play a significant role in this \ncountry's investment in our fastest-growing small businesses, \naccounting for more than 50 percent of all U.S. venture investments. \nLast year these loans and investments pumped about $20 billion into the \neconomy, leveraged millions more from the private sector, fed the local \ntax base as the Federal Government cut back, and created or retained \nmore than 400,000 jobs.\n  As the committee reviewed the SBA's programs for reauthorization, \nthese facts figured largely into establishing the program levels. I \nthank our chair, Senator Snowe, for working with me to set the levels \nfor the SBA's lending and venture capital programs at increasing levels \nfor the next 3 years. I am particularly pleased with the increased \nfunding levels for the microloan program.\n  I disagree with the administration's proposals over the past few \nyears to cut back its investment in microloans and training assistance \nto micro-entrepreneurs. And I disagree with the administration's \ncontention that these borrowers are being served through the 7(a) loan \nprogram. The small borrower in the microloan program is different than \nthe small borrower being served through the 7(a) loan program. Both \nlending vehicles are important, but they are different, and one is not \na substitute for the other.\n  And who are these borrowers being served through the microloan \nprogram? Thirty percent are African American. Eleven percent are \nHispanic. Thirty-seven percent are women. And anywhere from 30 to 40 \npercent go to small businesses in rural areas. Banks turn \nthese borrowers away, and yet the administration proposed cutting the \nmicroloan program by 36 percent in its most recent budget--fiscal year \n2004. The SBA needs to fully fund these programs and put more resources \ninto the office that manages the program. Four people are not enough to \nmanage 1,400 loans and 180 grants.\n\n  Not only is the program level for microloans troublesome, but also \nthe level for the agency's largest small business lending program, the \n7(a) program. In the report that accompanies S. 1375, the committee \nnotes that our duty as members of this committee, as well as that of \nthe SBA itself, is not simply to maintain these programs but to monitor \nthe demand and adjust the programs accordingly to meet the needs of \nsmall businesses. According to SBA's testimony before the committee on \nApril 30, 2003, the agency estimates demand only by looking backwards--\nwhat has happened in the past year. However, there are other important \nfactors to consider: changes in loan volume, trends in the economy, and \ninitiatives and program changes that will affect loan volume. For \nexample, the agency often enters into memoranda of understanding with \ntrade and ethnic associations in order to help their members who own \nsmall businesses, and recently the SBA opened its lending programs to \nall credit unions, which number 10,000. Both of these changes are \nintended to raise awareness of the SBA's services, which ultimately \nwill affect demand. In a press release from the SBA regarding credit \nunions, the agency stated that delivery of SBA loans through credit \nunions, ``Represents a possible increase of nearly 30 percent in the \noverall number of institutions where entrepreneurs can seek capital for \ntheir businesses.'' That possibility, if it becomes a reality, will \nalmost certainly increase demand for 7(a) loans. Therefore, it should \nbe factored into the SBA's estimate of programs demand for fiscal year \n2004 and beyond, and aligned in its annual appropriations requests and \nlegislative proposals.\n  Aside from setting the level for each small business financial \nassistance program, our SBA reauthorization makes important program \nchanges and starts some important, new initiatives. In the SBA's \nmicroloan program, we have adopted many of the provisions we passed \nlast year as part of S. 174, which Senator Snowe and I introduced and \nthe committee and the full Senate voted to pass by unanimous consent. I \nthank the Association for Enterprise Opportunity, AEO, as well as the \nparticipants of the reauthorization roundtable on April 30, 2003--Mary \nMathews of Minnesota's Northeast Entrepreneur Fund, Zach Gast of AEO in \nWashington, D.C., Alan Corbet of Missouri's Go Connection, and Blake \nBrown of Maine's Coastal Enterprises--for representing the microloan \nindustry so convincingly and educating the committee on the \ninextricable correlation between technical assistance, lending and \nsuccessful businesses that can repay their loans. I thank them for \nillustrating so vividly how they serve borrowers that would not \notherwise have access to capital--because their loans are not \nprofitable enough to appeal to traditional lenders, and because the \nefficiencies of credit scoring work against these small borrowers, even \nthose with repayment ability. The SBA's microloans represent their only \ncredit option to help them achieve economic independence and become \nbankable in the future.\n  Picking up where we left off last year, and even the year before when \nwe\n\n[[Page S12085]]\n\nmade important changes to the microloan program, S. 1375 will make it \npossible for lenders to offer small business ``short-term'' loans. This \nwill benefit small businesses, the lenders and the SBA because it will \neliminate repeated paperwork and administrative oversight from those \nsmall businesses, such as carpenters, who need revolving loans to \nfinance the jobs as they come in, rather than taking multiple little \nfixed-term loans. Rather than tying eligibility to the expertise of the \nentity, we have made it possible for new entities to qualify as the SBA \nmicrolending intermediaries if they have staff with this unique lending \nand technical assistance expertise. We have made a conforming change \nregarding the average smaller size of microloans, increasing it from \n$7,500 to $10,000, to make it consistent with similar changes enacted \nin December 2000.\n\n  Unlike the provisions we considered in 2000 and again last year with \nS. 174, this bill does not go as far to eliminate the restrictions on \nlenders contracting out the technical assistance or assistance before a \nloan is made. Instead, we raise from 25 percent to 30 percent the \namount of TA funds an intermediary can contract with an outside expert \nand the amount of grants a lender can use to counsel prospective \nborrowers. The latter change does not go as far as I would like, but \nrepresents a compromise. Although there is a perception that pre-loan \nassistance means that TA money is used on microentrepreneurs who never \nget loans, in actuality the small-business owner in many cases needs \nhelp getting the loan more than assistance running the business after \nhe or she gets the loan. Also, unlike the last two microloan bills, \ninstead of including a provision authorizing the SBA to fund peer-to-\npeer mentoring among microloan lenders and TA providers, the \nmicrolenders asked the committee to increase the oversight of an \nexisting statutory provision that requires the SBA to contract out 7 \npercent of its loan dollars for training of intermediaries.\n  Now the SBA will have to report annually on this specific provision \nto highlight what they have done to comply with the law. Last, S. 1375 \nrequires the SBA to develop an improved subsidy rate model to determine \nthe cost of microloans because the one they have used since the \nprogram's inception does not reflect the performance of the program. \nFor example, last year, in Fiscal Year 2003, the administration's \nbudget doubled the subsidy rate, which is the Government's cost of the \nprogram, from 6.78 percent to 13.05 percent, even though the program \nhad not experienced any loss of Federal funds since the first loan was \nmade in 1992. This broken method of calculating the cost of these loans \nis a waste of taxpayer money because Congress has to appropriate \nunnecessary funds to run the program.\n  In the 7(a) loan program, the SBA's largest loan program, which \nprovides loans to small businesses for working capital with long terms \nof up to 25 years, we made permanent the reduction in the fees \nborrowers and lenders pay. We are testing a proposal that allows the \nmost proficient 7(a) lenders in good standing to lend in every State. \nLenders have complained that applying for lending autonomy in each of \nthe 70 district offices and branches is administratively burdensome, \nboth for them and for the agency staff, and that some district offices \nhave taken advantage of the power to approve or disapprove lenders when \nthey apply for this special lending status.\n  Let me be clear--while I want to avoid unnecessary paperwork and \neliminate reported abuses, I do not want the lenders to take this as a \nsignal to quit working with the district directors and district staff. \nIt is important to have a local connection and for the SBA and the \nlenders to work together to maximize service to the small businesses. \nWe need to maximize resources to reach not only as many small \nbusinesses as possible, but also those populations that most need \naccess to affordable capital. It would be unreasonable to continue \nholding district directors accountable for lending goals in their areas \nwithout building in a mechanism to encourage interaction. There are \nconcerns that allowing lenders to make loans on a nationwide basis and \nbypass the local SBA staff to work only with SBA staff in Washington, \nDC, could undermine the local infrastructure and the SBA's ability to \nmeet the individual needs of local small businesses. For this purpose I \nhave included a provision that directs the SBA to consider the \nrecommendations and comments of any district directors and regional \nadministrators when reviewing a lender for national lending authority.\n  To increase the value of 7(a) loans sold in the secondary market, the \ncommittee has included a provision to allow the SBA to pool and sell \nthe guaranteed portion of loans with varied rates. Currently, the SBA \nhas the authority to only sell those loans with identical rates. \nProponents argue that this will create efficiencies in the market and \nstrengthen the program by bringing it into line with what the private \nsector has been doing for years.\n  At Senator Snowe's request, in order to reach more under-served small \nbusinesses, we have enhanced the Low-Doc program, allowing lenders to \nuse the simplified application from for loans up to $250,000 from \n$100,000, making it the same as the SBA Express program. We have also \nexpanded the incentives for lenders to provide financing to export \nsmall businesses, and proposed letting 7(a) borrowers use a simplified \nsize standard when determining if an applicant is a small business.\n  To improve the 504 loan program, which makes long-term loans of up to \n20 years to small, growing businesses to buy equipment and buildings, \nwe have raised the debenture size to keep peace with the rising cost of \ncommercial real estate and equipment. We have raised the job \nrequirement standard up from $35,000 to $50,000. This is reasonable \ngiven the increase in the Consumer Price Index since the last time the \njob requirement was changed in 1990. We have directed the SBA to \nsimplify the application and documentation process of applying for and \nclosing 504 loans, long a goal of this Committee and made a priority \nbased on the compelling testimony of some of our witnesses during the \nreauthorization process. We have also created two alternatives for 504 \nlenders to use when establishing a loan loss reserve to cover potential \nlosses.\n  I am particularly pleased that we have included S. 822, the Child \nCare Lending Pilot Act in the reauthorization bill. It allows small, \nnon-profit childcare businesses access to 504 loans. I thank Senator \nSnowe and my colleagues for agreeing to try this for 3 years, similar \nto what we have done with the microloan program. And I thank the trade \nassociation of 504 lenders, the National Association of Certified \nDevelopment Companies, and other 504 lenders for their endorsement of, \nand input on, the pilot.\n  The more research I have done, the more I have come to realize how \nvitally important it is that we give non-profit day care providers the \nsame opportunities as for-profits to expand their businesses. Non-\nprofit day care centers are often the only childcare suppliers \navailable in needy areas, from the most urban to be most rural. I have \ntaken note of states like Oregon, where 79 percent of day care \nproviders are non-profit, Michigan, where that number jumps to 86 \npercent, Iowa with 77 percent, my own State of Massachusetts with 90 \npercent, Ohio with 62 percent, and the list goes on and on. I've \nlearned that in State after State families are waiting for affordable \nday care; from more than 1,000 families on the waiting list in both \nNevada and Maine to more than 30,000 on the list in Texas. These \nparents are waiting for quality day care they can afford, and making \navailable affordable loans to all licensed child care providers may \nincrease access to care and cut down those waiting lists.\n  I understand there is concern about the precedent of the SBA lending \nto non-profits. Right now it is done in only limited circumstances--\nmicroloans, physical disaster loans and economic injury disaster loans \nin the areas affected by the terrorist attacks of 9/11. And I agree it \nshould not be expanded to all industries. However, this is a very \nunique industry whose critically important services in many States are \ndelivered mostly through non-profits, and the only way to increase \nfacilities to provide the child care is to reach both for-profit and \nnon-profit child care providers. Further, non-profits are usually the \nproviders that care for the neediest kids. I have added provisions to \nthe pilot program to ensure that the underwriting\n\n[[Page S12086]]\n\nstandards are just as tough, if not more so, as those applied to for-\nprofit centers. The loans must be personally guaranteed, the collateral \nmust be owned outright by the child care provider, and it must be able \nto make its loan payments and cover normal operating expenses from the \nrevenue generated from its clients. With these protections, the loans \nto non-profits should perform just as well as those made to for-\nprofits, and if there is a problem, the loans should be collateralized \nsufficiently to cover the losses.\n\n  The bill defines a small, non-profit child care businesses as an \nentity organized as a 501(c)(3), but not just any organization. It must \nbe a licensed child care provider; it must meet the size standard for a \nsmall business; and it must provide care to infants, toddlers and pre-\nkindergarten and care to older children after school. This makes \nassistance available to eligible entities that offer Head Start \nservices. At Senator Snowe's request, the pilot is limited to seven \npercent of the number of loans guaranteed by the 504 program overall, \nwhich is less than the 10 percent allowed for pilots under SBA's 7(a) \nguaranteed business loan program. I feel that the agreed upon cap \nshould allow for sufficient lending under the pilot to adequately test \nwhether lending to non-profit childcare providers is effective in \nincreasing access to affordable childcare, and whether it protects the \ngeneral 504 program, which is vital to the financing of small \nbusinesses in this country.\n  Before I move on to discuss another important provision in the bill, \nI want to thank all the members of the Advisory Committee on Child Care \nand Small Business in Massachusetts who not only identified the need \nfor this policy change but also developed many innovative ideas to \ncoordinate Federal and State business services and child welfare \nservices to expand the availability of quality, affordable child care \nand strengthen the businesses of child care of child care providers.\n  The bill also includes a comprehensive study by the GAO to track and \nmonitor the impact of this program both on child care industry and the \n504 program. Last, I want to remind my colleagues that the 504 program \nis funded entirely through fees and does not require appropriations. \nFurther, when the Congressional Budget Office reviewed the \nreauthorization act and estimated its cost and the impact the \nprovisions would have on the programs, CBO assessed no cost increase to \nthe 504 program, its subsidy rate, or the agency by enacting the child \ncare lending pilot provision.\n  Also included in this bill is S. 318, the Small Business Drought \nRelief Act. This simply reinforces in legislation something that the \nSBA should already be doing. You see, the SBA doesn't treat all drought \nvictims the same. The agency only helps those small businesses whose \nincome is tied to farming and agriculture. However, farmers and \nranchers are not the only small business owners whose livelihoods are \nat risk when drought hits their communities. The impact can be just as \ndevastating to the owners of rafting businesses, marinas, and bait and \ntackle shops. Sadly, at present these small businesses cannot get help \nthrough the SBA's disaster loan program because of something taxpayers \nhate about government--bureaucracy.\n  The SBA denies these businesses access to disaster loans because its \nlawyers say drought is not a sudden event and therefore it is not a \ndisaster by definition. Despite numerous requests, written and verbal, \nfor a copy of this legal opinion, the SBA delayed compliance for 6 \nmonths. The delay jeopardized enactment of emergency legislation during \nthe 107th Congress, leaving small business drought victims without \nassistance. Contrary to the agency's position that drought is not a \ndisaster, as of July 16, 2002, the day this legislation was introduced \nlast year, the SBA had drought disaster declarations in effect in 36 \nStates. That number had grown to 48 by the beginning of this year, \ndemonstrating that the problem had gotten worse and even more small \nbusinesses were in need.\n\n  As I have said time and again, the SBA already has the authority to \nhelp all small businesses hurt by drought in declared disaster areas, \nbut the agency will not do it. For years the agency has been applying \nthe law unfairly, helping some and not others, and it is out of \ncompliance with the law. The Small Business Drought Relief Act of 2003 \nwould force the SBA to comply with existing law, restoring fairness to \nan unfair system, and would get help to small business drought victims \nthat need it. I thank former Governor Jim Hodges of South Carolina, and \nhis staffer Lane Hudson, for bringing this to the committee's \nattention. They served the needy small businesses of their State \nextremely well, and I am sorry that politics kept this common sense and \nmuch needed provision from being enacted. I thank the other 15 \nGovernors who fought for their constituents, too. And I thank Senator \nBond for working with me on this when he was the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, and Senator Snowe and \nher staff for all their help and support. While we might have had a lot \nof rain recently in the northeast, there are areas like Lake Mead in \nArizona and Nevada where it is so dry that the water level is down and \nsmall businesses are losing business and having to make expensive \nchanges, such as extending docks to reach the water in order to stay in \nbusiness.\n  In this bill are also provisions to strengthen the SBA's venture \ncapital programs--the Small Business Investment Company Debenture and \nParticipating Securities programs, and the New Markets Venture Capital \nProgram. We have balanced investment incentives with financial \nsoundness issues and allowed small businesses to receive more SBIC \nfinancing than currently permissible if they also have a 504 or 7(a) \nloan. We have improved the arrangement for distributing payments from \nsuccessful SBICs so that the SBA and the investors are treated more \nfairly and the taxpayer has more protection for realizing repayment on \nthe investments. We have put in place conforming amendments to make the \nNew Markets Venture Capital program work with the New Markets Tax \nCredit, as Congress intended. And we have clarified that New Markets \nVenture Capital companies have 2 years to raise their matching capital, \nas Congress intended. The committee has been troubled by the agency's \ninterpretation of the NMVC statute, which SBA viewed as permitting the \nagency to choose how much time it could give conditionally approved \nNMVCs to raise the private-sector matching money. The SBA's chosen time \nframes were unreasonable and not what Congress intended.\n  I very much regret that the managers' amendment that we are \nconsidering today does not include a change to the New Markets Venture \nCapital Program which would better align allowable investments with \nrepayment obligations. Right now the repayment and profit participation \nschedules are out of sync. Experts argue that this situation could \nforce NMVCs to liquidate promising small businesses in order to raise \nrepayment money. It would be unfortunate if this were to occur, \nparticularly for the employees of small businesses in these high-\nunemployment areas who will be hard-pressed in this economy to find \nanother job with sustainable wages and benefits. I do not have an SBA \nNMVC in my State, but there are about 20 States with NMVCs which would \nhave benefited from this proposed change--Maine, New Hampshire, \nVermont, Kentucky, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Delaware, New Jersey, \nPennsylvania, Arizona, and Washington, DC. I am sorry that we could not \nreach a compromise and I hope for the sake of existing NMVCs and the \nsmall businesses they assist that the experts are not right.\n  I thank the many experts who have advised this committee over the \nyears on developing and implementing the new markets venture capital \nprogram. My colleagues on the committee and I are grateful for their \nhelp. It is a great service to the taxpayers and businesses and the \ncommunities that will benefit from this innovative investment. In no \nparticular order, I thank Dr. Julia Rubin who helped us when she was at \nHarvard, at Brown and now at Rutgers University. I thank Saunders \nMiller, now himself a small business owner of Peaq Funds in Manhattan, \nwho was a principal developer of this program and may other venture \ncapital initiatives for the many years he worked at the SBA. I thank \nDon Christensen, the former head of the SBA's investment\n\n[[Page S12087]]\n\ndivision, where he served this nation and president Clinton extremely \nwell. And to the many developmental venture capitalists who routinely \nimpart their expertise and wisdom to this committee, such as Elyse \nCherry of the Boston Community Venture Fund and Ray Moncrief of \nKentucky Highlands.\n  Responding to findings by the General Accounting Office and the SBA's \nOffice of Inspector General, this legislation includes many measures to \nstrengthen the SBA's oversight of lenders. And we have reauthorized and \nclarified the law for surety bond guarantees to help small businesses \nget Government contracts.\n  While no one would deny the importance that access to capital plays \nin the success of small businesses, as SBA Administrator Hector Barreto \nand past SBA administrators have acknowledged time and again, debt is \nnot always the answer. In the SBA's FY 2004 budget request, there is \nreference to information from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and \nDun & Bradstreet that indicates ``80 percent of new businesses \ndiscontinue operation within 5 years because of lack of `knowledge' of \nkey business skills.'' Despite the recognized importance of such \nassistance, the SBA's funding request for fiscal year 2004 and its \nlegislative proposal to implement that request would freeze funding \nlevels for virtually all agency programs, without even accounting for \ninflation, for a 6-year period. If enacted, that would severely \nhamstring this nation's small businesses and their ability to \neffectively compete and prosper in the national economy. For this \nreason, Senator Snowe and I took a comprehensive approach to supporting \nand improving the SBA's entrepreneurial development programs, while \nrejecting proposals put forth that would undermine their success.\n  Cuts to or inadequate funding of the SBA's entrepreneurial \ndevelopment programs are often attributed to vague and unfounded claims \nof duplication. Such claims mistake a common mission of training and \ncounseling for duplication, ignoring the reality that small businesses \nvary greatly, are often at very different stages of development, and \nhave many different needs. Just as it would be ineffective to only have \none type of loan or venture capital financing structure for the 25 \nmillion small businesses in this country, it would be futile to water \ndown specialized management and training programs to impose a one-size-\nfits-all approach.\n  I want to commend Chair Snowe for giving women entrepreneurs such a \nprominent place in the reauthorization process. Rarely do women \nentrepreneurs get the recognition and attention they deserve for their \ncontributions to our economy: Eighteen million Americans would be \nwithout jobs today if it were not for these entrepreneurs who had the \ncourage and the vision to strike out on their own. During my tenure as \na member, chair, and lead Democrat of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have worked to increase and improve \nthe opportunities for enterprising entrepreneurial women in a variety \nof ways, leading to greater earning power, financial independence and \nasset accumulation--and I am glad that Senator Snowe is joining me in \nthis endeavor.\n  As Chair Snowe expressed when she introduced the Women's Small \nBusiness Programs Improvement Act--and when Senator Snowe and I passed \nthe Women's Business Center's Preservation Act--protecting the \nextremely effective and well-established Women's Business Center \nnetwork was a high priority in this reauthorization. For that reason, \nwe make permanent the Women's Business Center Sustainability Pilot \nProgram by creating 3-year ``renewal'' grants for those centers with \nsustainability grants and 4-year ``initial'' grants for new centers; \nincrease the program's authorization levels; and direct the Office of \nWomen's Business Ownership, OWBO, to make all Women's Business Center \ngrants at $150K and to consult with the associations of Women's \nBusiness Centers when making improvements to the program. Other changes \nto the Women's Business Center Program include streamlining the data \ncollection and the grant application and selection criteria, protecting \nthe privacy of Women's Business Center, WBC, clients, and providing for \na smooth transition from sustainability to the newly established WBC \nprogram.\n  Our legislation will not only secure the future of the Women's \nBusiness Center Program, but it will connect all SBA-related women's \ninitiatives with a unified mission, similar guidance and training. \nThese changes were coupled with minor, yet significant, changes to the \nNational Women's Business Council, NWBC, and the Interagency Committee \non Women's Business Enterprise. Senator Snowe and I included provisions \nto give the NWBC cosponsorship authority, to allow more flexibility in \nthe way the council uses funds, and to direct the council to serve as a \nclearinghouse for historical data. Each of these things will enable the \ncouncil to become a better resource for the administration, Congress \nand the entire small-business community. Since its inception, the NWBC \nhas provided Congress, the Small Business Administration, and the \nInteragency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise with independent \nadvice and policy recommendations on issues facing women in business.\n  In recognition of the council's importance to policy making and women \nin business, Senator Landrieu offered and the committee adopted an \namendment identical to her National Women's Business Council \nIndependence Preservation Act of 2003, which seeks to maintain the \nbipartisan balance on the NWBC. The structure of the NWBC helps to \nmaintain its independence. It has 15 members. The chair is appointed by \nthe President and must be a prominent business woman. Six members are \nrepresentatives of women's business organizations, including \nrepresentatives of women's business center sites, and the remaining \neight are members appointed by the SBA administrator based upon \nrecommendations of the chair and ranking members of the Senate Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee and the House Small Business \nCommittee. Of these eight ``party-affiliated'' members, four come from \nthe same political party as the President and four members who are not \nfrom the President's party; all of them must be small business owners. \nThe bipartisan balance in the NWBC's membership helps to ensure that \nany policy recommendations will reflect the needs of women in business \nand not the political agenda of one political party over another.\n  Vacancies on the NWBC are supposed to be filled no later than 30 days \nafter the position becomes open; however, in the past 2 years, the SBA \nhas failed to meet this 30-day statutory deadline. The NWBC Chair was \nvacant from May 29, 2001, to May 21, 2002, a period of 11 months and 22 \ndays. Of the party-affiliated slots reserved for the President's party, \none was vacant for 3 months, two were vacant for a period of 7 months; \nand one was vacant for 21 months. Two of the seats reserved for members \nwho are not from the President's party were vacant for nearly 2 years, \none seat was vacant for 7 months, and the fourth seat remains vacant. \nAt one point during the past 2 years the NWBC had a severe partisan \nimbalance. There were three Republican members on the NWBC and no \nDemocratic members. The committee is concerned that these vacancies \nundermine the effectiveness of the NWBC, and that the lack of \nbipartisan balance will subject any policy positions taken by the NWBC \nto criticism as being motivated by partisan interests.\n\n  Senator Landrieu's amendment, which was approved unanimously by the \ncommittee, requires that vacancies in the party-affiliated slots will \nbe filled to maintain a bipartisan balance on the NWBC. The provision \nalso ensures accountability by requiring the administration to report \nto Congress on vacancies that remain unfilled for more than 30 days. \nThe committee expects the report to cite the reasons for the vacancies, \nwhat is causing any delays in filling the positions, whether nominees \nwere available for consideration, at what stage in the vetting process \nnominees are, whether there are any objections to the nominees and what \nthose objections are, an estimate for when the vacancies will be \nfilled, and any other relevant information relating to the vacancies.\n  To bolster the representation of women business owners in the Federal \nGovernment, our bill re-establishes the Interagency Committee on \nWomen's Business Enterprise, directs the Deputy Administrator of the \nSBA to serve\n\n[[Page S12088]]\n\nas acting chairperson of the Interagency Committee until a chairperson \nis appointed, establishes a Policy Advisory Group to assist the \nCommittee's chairperson in developing policies and programs under this \nact and creates three subcommittees similar to those created under the \nNational Women's Business Council.\n  This bill also supports and protects the Small Business Development \nCenter network, which has served millions of small-business owners \nsince its inception more than 20 years ago. It should also be noted \nthat in 2001, SBDCs helped small businesses create or retain over \n80,000 jobs, generate $3.9 billion in sales and obtain $2.7 billion in \nfinancing. For every dollar spent on an SBDC, $2.09 in tax revenue was \nreturned to the Federal Government. Numbers aside, the nationwide \nnetwork of SBDCs provides important counseling services to small-\nbusiness owners that are unable to afford private consulting, many of \nwhom are women and minority clients. The SBDC program has grown to \nserve 1.25 million small-business owners and entrepreneurs each year, \nand there are nearly 1,000 centers serving every State in the Nation.\n  While this bill rejects the potentially detrimental changes proposed \nby the SBA to the SBDC network, it does address concerns expressed by \nthe centers and small businesses. Our bill increases authorization \nlevels to keep up with increased demand and a provision to protect the \nprivacy of the program's clients and a provision to help the SBDCs that \nhave been adversely affected by poor economic conditions or government \ndownsizing. Also included is a portability provision proposed by \nSenator Snowe to provide supplemental assistance to State SBDC networks \nthat have been adversely affected by a military base or industrial site \nclosure which has lead to a loss of jobs and severe economic harm. If \nimplemented correctly, portability has the potential to help States, \nreeling in the aftermath of a sudden economic change, to provide the \nnecessary small business assistance to quell the economic injury to a \nparticular area.\n  Also, included in the entrepreneurial development section of our bill \nis a provision to increase to $7 million annually the authorization \nlevel for the Service Corps of Retired Executives, SCORE, which has \n10,500 volunteers, and technical change to allow SCORE to keep its \nmodest staff of 14 employees. For more than 38 years, SCORE has been \none of the SBA's greatest and most efficient successes. In 2002, SCORE \nvolunteers held over 300,000 counseling sessions and put in nearly 1.4 \nmillion volunteer hours. To keep up with an our nonstop national \neconomy, SCORE has dramatically advanced the outreach of its online \nservices to reach clients 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Last year, \nfor $5 million, SCORE volunteers provided small business owners an \nestimated $170.8 million worth of professional business advice. It is \nsafe to say that in this down economy, SCORE is one investment that \nwill be paying dividends for years to come.\n\n  I thank Senator Snowe for working with me to include, as introduced, \nthe Native American Small Business Development Act, which I \nreintroduced earlier this year together with Senator Johnson and \nSenator Smith to address the SBA's growing lack of commitment to the \nNative American community. According to a report released by the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, the ``three year average poverty rate for American \nIndians and Alaska Natives from 1998-2000 was 25.9 percent; higher than \nfor any other race groups.'' With an unemployment rate well above the \nnational average and household income at just three-quarters of the \nnational average, Native American communities need a commitment from \nthe Federal Government that we will help them, particularly during \nthese difficult economic times. To reaffirm this commitment, the \nJohnson-Kerry-Smith bill provides Native Americans the resources they \nneed to take advantage of the opportunities of entrepreneurship.\n  The Native American Small Business Development Act, as included in \nour reauthorization bill, will ensure that the SBA's programs to assist \nNative American communities cannot be dissolved by making the SBA's \nOffice of Native American Affairs, ONAA, and its assistant \nadministrator permanent. Our legislation would also create a statutory \ngrant program, known as the Native American Development grant program, \nto assist Native Americans. It would also establish two pilot programs \nto try new means of assisting Native American communities and require \nNative American communities to be consulted regarding the future of the \nSBA programs designed to assist them. In short, this legislation will \nensure that our Native American communities receive the adequate \nassistance they need to help start and grow small businesses.\n  Senator Bingaman and I have worked closely to develop a provision for \ninclusion in a joint managers' amendment to the reported bill, which \nwill expand the Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs, PRIME, \nwith a separate $2 million authorization to provide direct, in-depth \ntechnical assistance and counseling to disadvantaged Native American \nsmall business owners. The provision will complement the Native \nAmerican Business Centers created in the Native American Small Business \nDevelopment Act by following the PRIME model, which provides technical \nassistance through microenterprise entities that have extensive \nexperience helping the least experienced entrepreneurs in low-income \ncommunities. The rationale for amending the PRIME Act, rather than \ncreating a separate program, is that PRIME is currently operational and \nsimply needs additional funding so it can better address the needs of \nthe Native American entrepreneurial community. The provision follows \nthe existing Small Business Administration's approach and terminology \nfor implementing the PRIME Act to enhance the possibility of economic \ndevelopment through entrepreneurship in Native American communities. \nThe Bingaman provision will strengthen the three-pronged approach the \nSenator Johnson and I designed in the Native American Small Business \nDevelopment Act to find a solution to the longterm economic handicap \nexisting in Native American communities nationwide. There are a number \nof microenterprise organizations in states across the country that are \nwilling and prepared to take on the additional challenge of assisting \ndisadvantaged Native American entrepreneurs, and there are a number of \nNative American communities that are eager to take a different path to \neconomic development. However, there are currently a limited amount of \nfunds to allow that to happen. I commend Senator Bingaman for his \nattention to this matter, for his continued support of my small \nbusiness legislation, and for his foresight and vision for Native \nAmericans in New Mexico and across the country. The Native American \ncommunities across our nation will be better off with the assistance \nthat this provision makes possible. Were it not for the persistence of \nSenator Bingaman, this provision would not be part of SBA's tools to \nhelp Native American entrepreneurs. I also want to thank Senator Snowe \nfor working with Senator Bingaman and me to include this provision in \nthe managers' amendment.\n\n  To address the growing business development needs of veterans, \nSenator Snowe and I reauthorized the Advisory Committee on Veterans \nAffairs, expanded veterans outreach grants from solely serving disabled \nveterans, to serving all veterans, reservists and service-disabled \nveterans. Further, we increase the funding for the Office of Veterans \nBusiness Development to enable that office to better deal with the \ndemand by veterans for outreach and development services.\n  Included in a joint Snowe-Kerry amendment, which was unanimously \napproved at the Committee markup, is a reauthorization of PRIME at $15 \nmillion. SBA Administrator Hector Barreto has stated, ``The PRIME \nprogram was created to help the smallest of small businesses. These are \nentrepreneurs at the most basic stage of starting a business and who \ntypically require the greatest amount of committed service and \nguidance. In order to succeed, they require training and technical \nassistance that must be accessible.''\n  PRIME is a powerful investment that provides critical assistance to \nstruggling, distressed communities. It's engineered to help low-income \nand very low-income families, defined as those at 150 percent of the \npoverty line or below. A very low-income family of\n\n[[Page S12089]]\n\nfour earns about $23,000 a year. The International Labor Organizations \nestimates that the return on investment in microenterprise development \nthrough resources like PRIME ranges from $2.06 to $2.72 for every \ndollar invested. Microenterprise contributes to our national economy \nthrough public tax revenues, private income increases, and reduced \ndependence on public assistance, such as welfare. Small Business \nDevelopment Centers define a ``client'' as someone who has received two \nhours of training. On average, however, PRIME organizations spend 10 \nhours with low-income and very low-income entrepreneurs.\n  Many often confuse PRIME assistance with the microloan technical \nassistance. Unlike the microloan program's technical assistance, which \nis directly tied to helping microentrepreneurs obtain access to capital \nthrough microlenders, the PRIME program is designed to help \nmicroentrepreneurs who may not be credit-worthy or don't need or want \nloans, but do need intensive technical assistance.\n  Currently, there are fewer than 80 organizations with PRIME grants, \nyet the need for PRIME assistance is now greater than ever. While \naccess to credit is vital for many microentrepreneurs, for low-income \nindividuals, there is a severe gap between being credit-worthy and \nreceiving the technical assistance needed to be successful in business. \nThe PRIME program addresses this gap. for these reason, Senator Snowe \nand I reauthorized the program for three years. Our bill also moves \nPRIME's statutory language to the Small Business Act and includes a \ndata collection provision.\n  We continue to receive reports of the detrimental effects of the \nAdministration's policy of reduced staffing and resources for essential \nprograms aimed at allowing small businesses to thrive. Week after week, \nthe Federal Times reports on the decline in contracts being allocated \nto small businesses, small businesses losing ground in the Federal \nmarketplace, and most recently, on the awarding of more big contracts \nwith less oversight from Federal agencies. With agencies awarding \nlarger, more complex and more costly contracts with fewer staff \nperforming oversight, this nation's small businesses and its tax payers \nare the ones shouldering the burden when small business goals continue \nto be unmet. In addition to helping small businesses obtain access to \nprocurement opportunities, these goals are meant to help the government \nbenefit from the cost-savings and innovations small business \ncontractors can often provide.\n\n  Significant improvements to the on-going problem of contact bundling, \nalso called contract consolidation, are included in this bill. One \nprovision included in this legislation that will make a significant \nimpact on small businesses' ability to compete is the method we have \nadopted to address the ongoing problem of contract bundling. This \nlanguage is a prime example of the effectiveness of bipartisanship, \ndiligence and compromise. This approach incorporates language from an \namendment to the Department of Defense reauthorization offered by \nSenator Collins and Senator Talent, language from my contract bundling \nbill, S. 633 and the President's initiative on contract bundling.\n  The first provision creates a two-tiered threshold in order to \nprevent unnecessary contract consolidation. Civilian agencies will be \nrequired to meet specific standards if they attempt to consolidate \ncontracts above $2 million and $5 million. The Department of Defense is \nrequired to meet similar requirements for contracts above $5 million \nand $7 million. The bill also further expands the definition of \ncontract bundling to include contract consolidation, closing a loophole \nin the definition that has been widely used and detrimentally affecting \nsmall businesses.\n  The second provision increases in the number of procurement center \nrepresentatives, PCRs. These representatives advocate on behalf of \nsmall businesses in cases directly affecting contracting, such as the \nbundling or consolidation of contracts. Unfortunately, the number of \nPCRs has been reduced from over 200 at its peak in the late 1980s to \nthe current level of just 47. In addition to reducing the number of \ntraditional PCRs, the administration has also eliminated the Breakout \nPCRs, specially trained advocates that analyze highly technical large \ncontracts and ``unbundle'' contracts and break out portions that are \nappropriate for small businesses. Their responsibilities have been \nrolled into that of traditional PCRs, even though the number of PCRs \ncontinued to decline. Often, the role of commercial marketing \nrepresentatives, CMRs, was also incorporated into the responsibilities \nof traditional PCRs. CMRs are responsible for identifying opportunities \nand developing marketing strategies for small businesses to appeal to \nlarge prime contractors. The SBA's attempt to streamline their offices \nand replace trained individuals with electronic systems has resulted in \nthe disenfranchisement of small businesses and hindered the SBA's \nability to maintain a proper level of oversight over Federal \ncontracting.\n  In the bill, we have increased the number of procurement center \nrepresentatives to ensure that every State and every major procurement \ncenter is allocated a PCR. Meanwhile, we have also ensured that these \nPCRs are not burdened with responsibilities that were previously the \nduties of breakout PCRs and commercial marketing representatives. These \ntwo improvements will dramatically increase the efficacy and efficiency \nof all three positions and allow proper review of the approximately 40 \npercent of Federal contracts, nearly, $90 billion, that are currently \nnot being reviewed by PCRs. This should increase small business's \naccess to Federal contract opportunities.\n  The bill would also create a reporting requirement for the \nBusinessLINC program, which has been showing promise in creating real \nteaming opportunities for small businesses in the private sector. \nAlthough the administration recommended elimination of the program, the \nreports this committee received regarding the overwhelming success of \nthe existing nine programs made it clear that the SBA did not have \nsufficient information about BusinessLINC to make an informed decision \non its effectiveness. The committee's bill would ensure that the SBA \noffers the proper level of oversight and would foster the continued \nsuccess of the program. I would like to thank Senator Snowe for working \nwith me to find a compromise to preserve this successful program.\n\n  At the Committee's roundtable on non-credit programs and the hearing \non contract bundling, the small business community reiterated the need \nfor accountability for small business contracting at the agency level. \nI applaud Senator Snowe on her efforts to ensure that Federal agencies \nbe held accountable for fully utilizing small businesses and to allow a \ngreater amount of Congressional oversight of the implementation of \nagency procurement strategies. Provisions within this bill will ensure \nthat the heads of Federal agencies identify a specific portion of their \nbudget request that will be awarded to small businesses in their \nstrategic plan and their annual budget submission to Congress. The bill \nalso gives senior procurement executives and senior program managers \nadditional authority to educate their staff regarding the importance of \nmeeting the government-wide goals for small business utilization and \nallows for greater accountability in annual performance evaluations. I \nwould like to thank the members of the Senate committee on Government \nAffairs for working with Senator Snowe and me on these provisions to \nensure that agency officials have the authority, as well as the \nflexibility, to efficiently and effectively meet the goals we have \nplaced before them.\n  In addition to increasing opportunities for prime contracts, this \nbill addresses another serious problem: Small businesses have been \nseverely hampered by dishonest practices by some businesses that have \nprime contracts with the Federal Government and have received \npreference over other prime contractors due to their superior small \nbusiness subcontracting plans. Senator Snowe and I have worked closely \nto address the concerns of small businesses regarding delays in \npayment, false reporting and the use of ``bait and switch'' tactics by \nprime contractors.\n  The bill holds prime contractors responsible for the validity of \nsubcontracting data, requiring the CEO to certify to the accuracy of \nthe subcontracting report under penalty of law. It also expands the \npenalties for falsifying data included in subcontracting reports to \nmatch the $500,000 or 10\n\n[[Page S12090]]\n\nyears in prison for businesses that falsify their status as a small and \ndisadvantaged business. If one intentionally falsifies data as a part \nof a subcontracting report to a Federal agency, he is defrauding the \nUnited States government and will be punished to the full extent of the \nlaw.\n  During the committee's reauthorization roundtables, we heard numerous \naccounts of subcontractors receiving late payments or partial payments \nfrom their prime contractors. Small firms do not have the luxury of \nwaiting for their payments when they have invested time and money to \nprovide their products and services to the prime contractor. To address \nthis concern, the bill directs the SBA to create a three-year pilot \nprogram, which tests the feasibility of direct payment to \nsubcontractors from the Federal agencies that are receiving the \ncontracts and or services.\n  In 2000, Congress passed legislation to implement a limited \ncompetition, set-aside program for women-owned businesses, intended to \nassist agencies to increase contracting to these firms and help to meet \nthe five percent government-wide goal. The original bill amended the \nSmall Business Act in section 8(m)(4) to require the SBA Administrator \nto complete a study to identify industries in which women-owned \nbusinesses are under-represented and report to Congress. The original \nstudy has been completed, but has been delayed by a subsequent study of \nthe original study's ``methodology,'' causing the program to be delayed \nindefinitely rather than be implemented in 2002, as it should have \nbeen. This bill expedites the implementation of the already overdue \nprogram by reassigning the responsibility of the study from the SBA to \nthe GAO and giving the Comptroller a deadline of December 31, 2003, to \nreport his findings to Congress.\n\n  During this time of economic downturn, we must ensure that long-term \nstrategies of reorganization and restructuring do not have immediate \nnegative impacts on our communities. One example of this is the \neconomic impact on surrounding areas when a military base is closed. \nThe loss of contracts to small businesses, jobs and resources can \ncripple a community's economy. To reduce the impact on these regions, \nthis bill utilizes a contracting program, called the HUBZone program, \nintended to target under-served areas and maintain the profitability of \nthe firms located within these areas. This bill will allow military \ninstallations that are closed after passage of this legislation to \nreceive HUBZone status. Senator Snowe and I have included a further \nprovision within the managers' amendment of S. 1375, which would limit \nthis special classification for 5 years after the closure of the base. \nThe intent of the immediate qualification of these areas is to allow \nfor a smoother transition of the base to commercial use by encouraging \nsmall businesses to relocate to those facilities, through Federal \ncontracting opportunities, and employing the workers in that area. \nAdditional options for assistance for these areas are available through \nthe SBA if these areas do not receive continued economic stability \nfollowing the expiration of the 5-year HUBZone status.\n  I want to thank Chair Snowe and her able staff for all of their \ncooperation over the past several months. I would like to thank the \nmembers of the Senate Committees on Armed Services and Government \nReform for working closely with me and my staff to ensure that this \nbill meets the needs of the Federal Government's diverse procurement \noffices as they work to ensure that the government receives the \nessential goods and services it requires. I also want to express my \ngratitude to all the members of the committee for their diligent \nefforts to improve this legislation and urge them and my other Senate \ncolleagues to support the Small Business Administration 50th \nAnniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of S. 1375, the \nSmall Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of \n2003. This bill revitalizes existing SBA programs and brings to life \nnew pilot programs, all of which promote the demands and growth of the \nsmall business community. I commend the chair, Senator Snowe, for \npassing this bill through the Small Business Committee with unanimous \nsupport.\n  Upon final passage of this bill, we will take a giant step toward \nimproving and refining the SBA and its programs. With the new \nprovisions that enhance agency record-keeping and realign program \noperations under a more appropriate department, it is clear that agency \naccountability and oversight will be strengthened. In addition, small \nbusinesses will benefit from improvements in the leading programs, \ngreater access to capital, new innovations in the entrepreneurial \nprograms, expansion of procurement programs, and improved training and \nassistance provisions.\n  According to the SBA's Office of Advocacy, small businesses represent \nmore than 99.7 percent of all employers, employ more than half of all \nprivate sector employees, and generate 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs \nannually. Given these statistics and the difficult financial times we \nface in today's economy, I urge Congress to continue to nurture the \nneeds of the small business community. We must show enthusiastic \nsupport for this bill, which I am confident will provide the SBA with \ngreater tools to keep pace with the ever-changing global economy and to \nserve the small business community in a more effective and efficient \nmanner. To act otherwise could jeopardize this Nation's much needed job \ngrowth and innovation.\n  Before I yield the floor, I refer to an important small business \nprogram titled the Historically Underutilized Business Zone Contracting \nProgram, or as it is commonly referred to, the HUBZone program. This \nsmall-business program was one of my personal priorities as former \nchairman of the Senate Small Business Committee. It was established in \n1997 with the intent to create jobs in severely economically distressed \ncommunities, both rural and urban. In addition, the HUBZone program \nprovides a Federal contracting preference as an incentive for small \nbusinesses to locate in these low-income areas. The jobs created by the \nHUBZone program bring money to those blighted areas and create a demand \nfor more goods and services, which leads to the creation of more small \nbusinesses and increased commerce in the area. Little by little, the \ncommunity's economic base is reborn.\n  Today, there are over 8,378 small businesses that are HUBZone \ncertified, and the Government has procured approximately $1.7 billion \nin HUBZone contracting this year. The SBA reports that in FY 2001, each \ndollar spent on the program yielded a return of $288 in contract awards \nand as a result, the program helped to create 12,782 jobs in the United \nStates, approximately 8,974 of which were located in distressed areas.\n  Based on FY 2001 procurement statistics, HUBZone firms increased \nemployment 33 percent to 50 percent as a result of contract awards. \nNearly 50 percent of HUBZone firms increased capital expenditures as a \nresult of receiving contracts in FY 2001. As our economy struggles \nduring these difficult times, this vital program will continue to bring \njobs to our Nation's inner cities, poor rural counties, and Indian \nreservations.\n  I urge Congress to support the HUBZone program in its current form \nalong with the new amendments provided in the Senate's version of the \nSBA Reauthorization Act of 2003. Any additional changes not supported \nby the full Senate Committee on Small Business could seriously \nundermine the original intent of the program.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to speak today on behalf of the small \nbusiness community. I encourage my colleagues to support Senator Snowe \nand S. 1375, the Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act of 2003.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Small Business Administration 50th \nAnniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003 reflects a bipartisan effort \nthat passed the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee \nunanimously. This bill reauthorizes many Small Business Administration, \nSBA, programs for 3 years as well as authorizes a number of pilot \nprograms.\n  The reauthorization bill is a great improvement over the President's \nproposal which would have frozen SBA programs at fiscal year 2003 \nfunding levels for 6 years. By reauthorizing the SBA over a shorter 3-\nyear period, as Congress has done traditionally, our\n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\nbill allows Congress to exercise closer oversight than would have been \nthe case under a 6-year bill. Our bill is responsive to our Nation's \nsmall businesses and entrepreneurs, many of whom have no alternative \ncredit source and allowing the SBA to make more loans to small \nentrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs provide the job creation and \nbusiness expansion that can result from the small business loans.\n  I am pleased the Senate SBA reauthorization bill contains an \namendment I authored to establish the Small Business Intermediary \nLending Pilot Program to address the needs of expanding small business. \nThe pilot lending program is aimed at businesses that need loans that \nare larger than those available under the SBA microloan program but a \nvariety of reasons--including lack of sufficient or conventional \ncollateral--are unable to secure the credit they need at the terms they \nneed through conventional lenders, even with the assistance of the 7(a) \nprogram.\n  The pilot lending program is designed to work through local non-\nprofit lending intermediaries. This proposal authorizes the SBA to make \n1 percent, 20-year loans on a competitive basis to up to 20 non-profit \nlending intermediaries around the country. These loans would be used to \ncapitalize a revolving loan fund through which the intermediary would \nmake loans of between $35,000 and $200,000 to small businesses. Unlike \nthe SBA microloan program there would be no technical assistance grant \nprovided to the intermediary. All administrative costs or technical \nsupport provided to business borrowers would be covered by the interest \nrate spread between the lending intermediary's 1 percent loan from the \nSBA and the loans made to the business borrowers.\n  While the SBA is committed to ensuring that 7(a) lenders make smaller \nloans, this pilot is designed to reach a sector of small businesses \nthat 7(a) lenders cannot and will not reach due to the perceived higher \nrisk of these businesses. Many of our States, including Michigan, Maine \nand Idaho, are fortunate to have a health network of community based, \nnon-profit intermediary lenders that are experienced and successful in \nmeeting the needs of these businesses. This pilot program will give \nthem additional tools to help them create badly needed jobs among small \nbusinesses.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the reauthorization bill contains the bill \nproviding disaster relief for small businesses damaged by drought. This \nincludes a provision I authored which would make eligible small \nbusinesses hurt by low water levels on the Great Lakes. I am also glad \nto see it includes the childcare lending pilot program to allow \naffordable and low interest SBA 504 loans for non-profit child care \ncenter. It is my hope that this program will spur the establishment and \nexpansion of child care providers.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nSmall Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of \n2003. There are millions of good reasons why we need to pass this \nimportant bill today and they are reflected in the millions of small \nbusinesses around the country that benefit from the support the Small \nBusiness Administration provides small businesses in Wyoming and around \nthe country. Although we do not have time for me to list those millions \nof reasons I can sum them up in just three words--jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  It's an expression we have heard many, many times but it is the \ntruth--small businesses really are the backbone of our economy. They \nprovide careers for the established generation of workers who need jobs \nto raise their families and they provide jobs to the younger generation \nof workers--teens and young adults of my State and many others who are \nlooking for employment to help them pay the expenses of school and help \nthem learn the lessons of responsibility, commitment and teamwork.\n  As a former small business owner myself, I have seen firsthand how a \npaycheck impacts lives and teaches invaluable life lessons and career \nskills. A job is more than a responsibility--it's a precious gift that \ncan change your life and help you understand what it means to be a \ncontributing member of society.\n  In my home state of Wyoming, 96.5 percent of our businesses are small \nbusinesses and that translates into a lot of jobs and a lot of families \nwith food on the table and a roof over their heads thanks to the SBA \nand the programs it provides the people of our country.\n  That is why I was so pleased to be a part of the important work on \nthe Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act \nof 2003. This is truly a historic occasion as we celebrate the SBA's \nsuccesses of the past 50 years and set its course for the years to \ncome.\n  We've all heard the expression--give a man a fish and you will have \nfed him for today. Teach a man to fish and you will have provided him \nwith the tools he will need to feed himself for the rest of his life.\n  The SBA operates on a similar principle. It does not give a business \nfunding for a day's operation. Instead, it provides the tools, training \nand support necessary to ensure that a business begins to operate on \nfirm, solid footing and has a reasonable chance for success.\n  Then, when the doors open up and the customers come in, the SBA \ncontinues to serve as a reference and a source of support to ensure \nthat a small business has a place to turn to for advice, encouragement \nand help if things take an unexpected turn for the worse.\n  Expect the unexpected--that's not just good advice--it's the focus of \nthe SBA's updated disaster authority in this bill. This section is one \nof the changes we were able to make to help ensure that SBA remains \nresponsive in the bad times--as well as the good. We were able to \nexpand the definition of a disaster to include drought and below \naverage water levels in bodies of water that support small businesses. \nThat change was clearly needed because the impact of a drought or low \nwater level on agriculture is clear to all of us.\n  What might not be so clear is how these water problems also affect \ntourism and recreational businesses. It wasn't clear before, so these \nbusinesses often fell through the cracks of Federal assistance. With \nthe passage of this bill, however, that crack will be filled in and \nsmall businesses will no longer suffer from these problems with no help \nor relief in sight.\n  Native Americans will also benefit from this bill and find help for \nthe terrible challenges poverty and unemployment impose on the Native \nAmerican communities in my State and across the Nation. Promoting the \ncreation and development of small businesses in these areas will bring \nmuch needed assistance to those Native Americans who need a chance to \nhelp themselves. I believe this approach will work because each tribe \nwill actively support it to ensure the program is a success.\n  These and many other changes to the SBA will ensure that it remains a \nbeacon of support and hope for small businesses that are carefully \nnavigating the rough and rocky shores of competition and the thousands \nof details that can slow or destroy a small business at any stage of \nits development.\n  As I have already mentioned, our small businesses are the backbone of \nour economy. The Small Business Administration is the lifeblood of our \nsmall businesses. The support and encouragement of each helps make the \nother more efficient, more productive and more successful.\n  Our small businesses and the Small Business Administration have a \nunique and important relationship. They need each other to grow and \nprosper and best of all--as they do--they help the Nation to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider a bill that \nis very important to small business owners and their employees. I am \nreferring to S. 1375, the Small Business Administration 50th \nAnniversary Reauthorization Act. The purpose of this bill is to \nreauthorize the many needed initiatives at the SBA--from long-term \nloans and venture capital to help with accessing Government contracts--\nthat have helped create successful businesses that are now household \nnames to many Americans. To name just a few, Callaway Golf, Ben & \nJerry's, Winnebago, Apple Computer and FedEx. In Arkansas, last year, \nmore than 305 businesses got loans through the SBA, and with them \ncreated jobs and contributed to the local tax base.\n  We on the committee have worked hard to review the services available \nto small businesses through the SBA and its lending and counseling \npartners. As\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\na result, this bill builds upon what works right at the SBA and \nimproves upon areas that need to be updated. The changes are sensible \nand fiscally responsible. We also included an innovative provision to \naddress workforce issues.\n  I offer my thanks and appreciation to Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry \nfor giving me the opportunity to address my concerns regarding some of \nthe provisions in the SBA reauthorization bill. One of my initial \nconcerns was that we continued to actively support the SBA's 7(a) \nguaranteed business loan and 504 certified business development company \nloans programs.\n  Access to capital is one of the most critical issues facing new and \nsmall businesses alike, particularly for minorities and entrepreneurs \nin inner-city and rural areas who lack sufficient collateral or credit \nto get loans from banks, even when they have a good idea and repayment \nability. I believe, and am hopeful, that the SBA Reauthorization Act \nwill go far in satisfying this demand for capital to those who have \ntraditionally been shut out. Additionally, I have endeavored to ensure \nthat the SBA 7(a) and 504 programs continue unharmed. I encourage the \nSBA to work with the small business community--the trade associations \nfor 7(a) and 504 lenders and borrowers, the National Association of \nGovernment Guaranteed Lenders and the National Association of \nDevelopment Companies, to ensure they are not harmed.\n  Small businesses employ millions of people and provide the fuel for \nour Nation's economic growth. Although most economists aver that the \nrecession has ended, employment figures continue to lag behind other \neconomic data at a rate that continues to cause me great concern--21 \nmonths of straight job losses means we should be using every tool we \nhave to create jobs. With the assistance of Senator Snowe, the SBA \nReauthorization Act should help to spur job creation and increase \naccess to much needed capital for our Nation's small businesses.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill because we need to enact \nthis legislation before many of SBA's programs expire on September 30.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before the Senate prepares to consider \nand pass S. 1375, the Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act of 2003, I would like to bring an important issue \nto the Senate's attention that I hope will be addressed in conference \nwith the House. It relates to the HUBZone program, specifically the \nprice preferences for food aid contracts. I would like to discuss this \nmatter with my colleague, the Chair of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, so that we have a clear record of our \nposition on the issue prior to final passage of the SBA Reauthorization \nlegislation.\n  Let me begin by first congratulating her for bringing this bill \nthrough Committee and to the Senate floor where it will pass \nunanimously. The Committee held informative and useful hearings and \nroundtable discussions to learn from small business owners and leaders \nabout the value of the Small Business Administration's programs. We \nalso heard from SBA Administrator Hector Barreto, about the Bush \nadministration's reauthorization proposal for improving the agency's \nability to respond to the many challenges facing small businesses and \nthe increasing number of start-ups. In the end she put together an \nexcellent bill that I supported when it passed the committee \nunanimously. I expect the Senate to do the same.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for her generous comments, and I \nappreciate her work on the Committee. She added an excellent amendment \nto the bill to ensure that the National Women's Business Council \nmaintains a bipartisan balance. I thank her for supporting this bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The issue I wanted to bring to your attention relates \nto HUBZone provisions in the House version of the SBA reauthorization. \nHUBZones are distressed urban and rural areas characterized by chronic \nhigh unemployment and/or low household income. Mr. President, there are \n152 HUBZone companies creating jobs and empowering communities \nthroughout my State. Under the program, small businesses that locate in \na HUBZone, and hire workers who live in the HUBZone, are eligible to \nreceive price preferences in bidding on government contracts. These \nprice preferences encourage small businesses to locate in our \ndistressed communities and help offset the additional costs they face \nas a result of being out of the regular stream of commerce. Price \npreferences also help to even the playing field between HUBZone \neligible and non-HUBZone firms in competing for contracts. I support \nthe HUBZone program. It is providing an economic boost through job \ncreation and capital investment to areas of poverty and unemployment \nthat really need it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am also a strong supporter of the HUBZone program. Today \nthere are more than 8,300 HUBZone small businesses that helped to \ncreate more than 30,000 jobs in the last 2 years. In our \nreauthorization bill, the committee has made some minor changes to \nstrengthen the program. One of these changes would ensure that \ncommunities affected by military base closures would receive temporary \nHUBZone eligibility, preventing a significant economic downturn. The \nbill also allows HUBZone companies to receive up to 15 percent \ninvestment from outside organizations, allowing them to raise capital, \nexpand their business and create even more jobs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am pleased that the Senate has decided to leave the \nHUBZone program intact with these limited, but sound modifications. An \nissue has been brought to my attention involving how the Department of \nAgriculture has interpreted legislation regarding the treatment of \nHUBZone price preferences for food aid purchases. The current system \nprovides HUBZone firms with a price preference on the first 40 percent \nof a given tender of food aid. A tender is essentially a contract for \naid that spells out how much of a particular commodity--corn, wheat, \nvegetable oil--would be provided under the contract. The remaining 60 \npercent of the contract volume is not subject to the preference, so \nHUBZones companies compete with all other firms, large and small, in \nfull and open competition for this portion of the contract.\n  The Department of Agriculture has misinterpreted the statute and \nunfairly limited the participation of HUBZone firms to only 40 percent \nof any food aid contract. This effectively locked them out of 60 \npercent of every tender contract offered. The Department has since \ncorrected its interpretation and is allowing the program to perform as \nit was intended by Congress when these provisions were added to the \nHUBZone program in 2000.\n  I am glad that the Department of Agriculture has changed its \ninterpretation. Louisiana has 10 HUBZone firms that are exporters and \nmay be able to participate in the food aid program and compete now that \nthe proper interpretation is in effect. Officials with the Port of Lake \nCharles in Lake Charles, LA came to me and expressed their concern with \nthe Department's initial interpretation because they operate in a \nHUBZone and want to attract more businesses to the port. This \ninterpretation limited the amount of contracts HUBZone firms were \neligible to bid on. The correct interpretation allows them to bring new \nbusinesses to the Lake Charles area and help them to reinvigorate an \narea that is working to regain its footing in the current economic \nclimate and provide critical jobs for the families who live there.\n  I know there are some who feel that under the current interpretation \nHUBZone firms may have an unfair advantage. I welcome the opportunity \nto work with the chair and the other members of the committee to \ninvestigate this further. Perhaps the committee could hold a hearing to \nlearn more about this issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for bringing this to my attention. I \nam happy to work with the Senator on this issue. I thank the Senator \nfrom Louisiana for her support of this legislation.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today, the Senate will unanimously pass the \nSmall Business Reauthorization Act. This is a critically important \npiece of legislation for the future of small business in America, and \nin turn, for our Nation's economy. Small businesses are the engines of \neconomic growth, and they play a vital role in expanding our economy. \nThis is something I believe in so strongly that for 2 weeks in August, \nI traveled across the State of\n\n[[Page S12093]]\n\nIndiana to meet with small business owners and to host a series of \nsmall business summits. The purpose of these summits was to link people \nlooking to start or expand their small businesses with every available \nFederal resource that could help them fulfill their dream.\n  During my visits in Indiana, I saw first hand the differences small \nbusinesses can make in their communities. John Roembke, of Ossian, IN, \nused a Small Business Administration loan to start his manufacturing \nand design company nearly 30 years ago. He began as the sole employee \nfor his company, but today he employs more than 60 Hoosiers. Each \nHoosier employed at Roembke Manufacturing represents a family that has \ngreater job security and new economic opportunities thanks to John's \nsuccess and help from the SBA.\n  Our Nation's unemployment rate now stands at 6.1 percent, and in my \nState, there are pockets of even higher unemployment. What these areas \nneed, and what our economy needs, is more job creation, and it is a \nwell-known fact that three out of every four new jobs are created by \nour growing and innovative small businesses. Usually, the only hurdle \nstanding between a company and its desire to expand and hire new \nworkers is capital. Without it, our businesses starve because they \ncannot obtain space, equipment, tooling, and employees. With it, \ncreative businesses can secure all of these assets, expand \nproductivity, increase sales, add new jobs, and improve the quality of \nlife in their communities.\n  The legislation we pass today will build on this kind of success, by \ncreating jobs, improving access to capital, and strengthening crucial \ndisaster assistance programs. Through the efforts of Chairman Snowe, \nRanking Member Kerry, and my other fellow members of the Small Business \nCommittee, the Senate has taken an important step toward reauthorizing \nthe Small Business Administration and its important small business \nassistance programs for the next three years.\n  Today, I look forward to supporting this bill that reauthorizes the \nmost effective capital access programs that exist today in our Federal \ngovernment: the 504 and 7(a) loan guaranty programs. These two programs \nwill provide more than $20 billion in both long and short term funding \nto America's small businesses each and every year of this \nreauthorization. In just the last three years, these SBA loan programs \nhave created more than 500,000 new jobs nationwide. Over the past three \nyears in Indiana, the 504 program alone has provided $125 million in \ncapital to small businesses and created 5,000 new jobs. The employees \nwho fill the new positions and the entrepreneurs who have expanded \ntheir businesses return millions of dollars in payroll, sales, income, \nand real estate taxes to the Federal, State, and local governments in \nevery county and State each year. These programs also provide specific, \ncritical support to businesses that are owned and operated by women, \nminorities, and veterans, groups that sometimes face greater difficulty \nin obtaining capital.\n  Best of all, the 504 loan program provides all of these opportunities \nfor economic growth at no cost to the taxpayer. The 504 program is \nsubsidy-free, financed purely by user fees that borrowers pay to \nfinance the risk inherent in the program. The cost to the taxpayers is \nzero.\n  Even with these advantages, there are still greater needs for capital \nin Indiana, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which employs \n580,000 Hoosiers, a higher percentage of industrial workers than any \nother State. The manufacturing sector is in crisis. Since July 2000, \nmanufacturing has lost 2.6 million jobs--the largest decline during the \npost-World War II era. Recent job losses in manufacturing jobs \nrepresents nearly 90 percent of total U.S. job losses. Manufacturing \noutput has shown virtually no growth since December 2001.\n  Manufacturing is, and will continue to be, critical to our country's \noverall economic growth, and for that reason, I want to help our small \nmanufacturers that are struggling to compete with the low wages and \nhigh technology equipment used by our international competitors. In \norder to addresses this need, I offered an amendment during the mark-up \nof this bill that was graciously accepted by the Committee Chair. The \nprovision directly address the needs of America's small manufacturers, \nproviding them with the additional capital they need to stay \ncompetitive in both the United States and world markets.\n  The provision would increase the 504 maximum loan guaranty for small \nmanufacturers to $4 million and alter the job creation capital \nrequirements for small manufacturers, allowing small manufacturers to \ncreate one new job for each $100,000 in 504 loan guarantees. As a \nresult of this legislation, companies will be able to obtain new \nequipment, become more competitive and, most importantly, hire new \nworkers. Indiana's Certified Development Companies estimate that the \nbill could create between 200 and 400 additional jobs each year.\n  The change to the 504 loan program will allow our manufacturers to \nacquire more state-of-the-art equipment and technology to become more \nproductive, and lower their operating costs. If small manufacturers are \nallowed to invest in state-of-the-art technology, and remain \ncompetitive with foreign competitors, this will put more hardworking \nHoosiers back to work. Further, these jobs will provide higher wages \nand benefits than we see available in many communities today, thereby \nimproving our quality of life.\n  This legislation will provide the fuel that our manufacturers need to \nremain competitive in world market and to create jobs for workers at \nhome. I commend the Senate for passing this bill and hope that the \nSenate and the House will reconcile their differences quickly so that \nthis critical legislation can go to the President's desk for his \nsignature.\n\n\n                         on-demand air service\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to highlight a \nparticular issue that my staff has been talking to the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA about. This relates to an Oregon company named \nSkyTaxi, which has an innovative and ambitious business plan for \nproviding on-demand air service to small communities. As my colleague \nfrom Maine knows better than most, small and rural communities are \noften gravely underserved by commercial airlines. These are places \nwhere transportation links are a make-or-break issue for local economic \nopportunity. But, as a recent General Accounting Office report \nconcluded last January, the trend is not positive. The current turmoil \nin the airline industry hits small communities hard, because those are \nthe first places airlines trim or eliminate service when they are \nlooking to cut costs. And most efforts to promote air service to small \ncommunities have met with limited long-term success.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I agree with the Senator that attracting new air service \nand retaining current service to small communities is a critical \neconomic issue. I am also familiar with the GAO report to which he \nrefers, since Senator Wyden and I were two of the three Senate \nrequesters of that report, together with our colleague on the Aviation \nSubcommittee, Senator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator may recall, then, that the GAO report briefly \ndiscusses SkyTaxi as a potential alternative way to provide air service \nto small communities. The report observes that SkyTaxi offers a \nbusiness model that is still relatively new, but that could help meet \nsome of the needs of small communities.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I share the Senator's view that it is critical to explore, \nsupport and promote alternative approaches for meeting the \ntransportation needs of small and rural communities. This includes \nensuring that Federal agencies take the appropriate action to provide \nfinancial assistance to small business franchisees interested in \nhelping communities improve transportation services.\n  Mr. WYDEN. SkyTaxi intends to operate through a franchise system, in \nwhich individual small businesses would purchase small aircraft and \noperate local SkyTaxi franchises. But purchasing an aircraft takes a \nsubstantial amount of capital, and many potential franchise owners--\nsuch as laid-off commercial pilots who now wish to start their own \nbusinesses--find that financing for aviation-related businesses is \ncurrently very difficult to obtain. SkyTaxi therefore expects and hopes \nthat potential franchise owners\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\nwould be able to turn to the SBA and its lending partners for small \nbusiness loans, in order to get up and running.\n  The problem now arises because, in order to satisfy FAA safety \nrequirements and obtain FAA certification, SkyTaxi needs to retain \ncertain authority over safety matters, including ensuring the \ncompetence of flight crew and the quality of aircraft maintenance.\n  It has set up its franchise agreement accordingly. Unfortunately, the \nSBA has so far taken the position that, due to the authority vested in \nSkyTaxi in the franchise agreement, the SBA would view each of the \nindividual franchise owners as ``affiliated'' with Sky-Tax and each \nother--and thus ineligible to apply for individual SBA guarantee loans.\n  My staff has been in contact with the SBA about this, and I am \nhopeful that this eligibility problem can be solved. For example, it \nmay be possible to work with FAA to clarify the limits of SkyTaxi's \nsafety-related authority over franchisees, and to rework the franchise \nagreement to preserve SBA loan eligibility. But for that to happen, \nit's going to take a commitment from the SBA to work on a cooperative \nbasis to try to find a solution. If the SBA will roll up its sleeves \nand work creatively with my office and with SkyTaxi, then I think the \nproblem can be solved to everyone's satisfaction. And in the end, the \nreal beneficiaries could be rural communities.\n  Ms. SNOWE. As chair of the Small Business Committee, I am concerned \nby any interpretation of the Small Business Act that unnecessarily \ninhibits access to SBA programs and services by eligible small \nbusinesses. This interpretation not only affects the ability of small \nbusinesses to receive financial assistance under the 7(a) loan program \nbut also to bid on Federal contracts set aside for small businesses. As \nthe economy struggles to recover, it is critical that we get back to \nbusiness--an investment in small business is an investment in jobs.\n  As we work with our colleagues on the House Small Business Committee \nto reauthorize the SBA's programs and services, we will carefully \nconsider provisions to address this issue and work with the SBA to find \nan agreeable solution.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3087, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3087) to provide an extension of highway, \n     highway safety, motor carrier safety, transit, and other \n     programs funded out of the Highway Trust Fund pending \n     enactment of a law reauthorizing the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st Century.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will approve a 5-month \nextension of the highway programs authorized by the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, based on an agreement between \nthe Senate and House leadership. Only reluctantly, and because of the \nneed to complete action on the extension immediately to ensure the many \nTEA-21 programs do not come to a halt, do I accept the terms of the \nextension as approved by the House for the safety programs administered \nby the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, FMCSA.\n  The House-passed short-term extension authorizes $56 million less, on \nan annualized basis, for motor carrier safety than the program's fiscal \nyear 2003 appropriated level. I am very concerned that the level of \nfunding in the extension is insufficient to make progress toward the \nnational goal of reducing the rate of truck-related crashes by 30 \npercent by 2008. The extension does not provide sufficient funding for \nFMCSA to fully implement existing, authorized programs in the short \nterm, including the ``new entrants'' program, hazmat permitting, \nadditional carrier compliance reviews, and completion of long overdue \nrulemaking proceedings. Further, the bill provides no funds to continue \nconstruction of inspection facilities at the border. The funding level \nis significantly below the President's funding request for fiscal year \n2004; the Senate Commerce Committee's TEA-21 reauthorization \nlegislation; and the funding levels approved by the Senate and House \nAppropriations Committees. And, it is entirely inconsistent with the \nsignificant funding increases provided over the short-term for highway \nconstruction and maintenance.\n  FMCSA was created after TEA-21 became law to address the increasing \nnumber of truck-related accidents on our nation's roads and highways. \nThe duties assigned to the agency through the Motor Carrier Safety \nAssistance Act, MCSIA, and other legislation have resulted in funding \nlevels significantly above the administrative takedown authorized by \nTEA-21. The extension, however, fails to recognize this and, on the \ngrounds that the bill must comply with the budget resolution, funding \nfor motor carrier safety is being curtailed, while highway construction \nand transit funding is being increased.\n  I want to put my colleagues on notice that either when the full \nSenate moves its 6-year reauthorization bill, or is faced with a \nfurther extension of TEA-21 next February, I will insist that the motor \ncarrier safety programs are authorized at an appropriate level of \nfunding. I believe my views are shared by Senator Hollings, who joined \nme in sponsoring legislation, S. 1646, that would have funded the \nsafety programs for 5 months at a level consistent with the Commerce \nCommittee's reauthorization proposal.\n  I take pride in the fact that the Senate Commerce Committee completed \nwork last June on its 6-year reauthorization of the TEA-21 safety \nprograms under its jurisdiction. Our bipartisan bill is designed to \nmeet the level of commitment to safety needed to achieve aggressive \ngoals for reducing accidents and fatalities on the nation's\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\nroadways. Safety deserves at least the same attention and priority as \nhighway construction and again, I will object to any future related \nmeasure that does not ensure the motor carrier safety programs are \nfully funded for the full 2004 fiscal year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in supporting \nthe pending legislation. This 5-month extension of the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, preserves the basic structure \nof our Federal surface transportation programs, which have proven to be \nextremely beneficial for our citizens' mobility and our national \neconomy over the last 6 years.\n  I want to focus for a moment on the Federal transit program, in which \nI have a particular interest as the ranking member of the Senate \nBanking Committee. The Banking Committee and its Housing and \nTransportation Subcommittee, both last Congress and this Congress, have \nheld a series of hearings on the contributions of the transit program \nto reducing congestion, strengthening our national economy, and \nimproving our quality of life. The clear message of these hearings is \nthat TEA-21 works. The guaranteed funding, the program structure, and \nthe balanced approach to transportation planning encompassed within \nTEA-21 have contributed to a renaissance for transit in this country; \nin fact, transit has experienced the highest percentage of ridership \ngrowth among all modes of surface transportation, growing over 28 \npercent between 1993 and 2001. For this reason, I am pleased that this \nlegislation preserves the structure and programs of TEA-21 for the next \n5 months.\n  While we are talking today about a short-term extension, I think we \nmust take a moment to look toward the future. The transportation needs \nof this Nation are significant, as more and more communities find \nthemselves confronting the problems of traffic congestion and delay. \nAccording to the Texas Transportation Institute, in the year 2000, \nAmericans in 75 urban areas spent 3.6 billion hours stuck in traffic, \nwith an estimated cost to the Nation of $67.5 billion in lost time and \nwasted fuel. As these figures show, congestion has a real economic cost \nto this Nation, in addition to the psychological and social costs of \nspending hours each day sitting in traffic.\n  It is clear to me that we will have to greatly increase Federal \nsupport for transportation to help local communities make the \ninvestments in infrastructure and system preservation that will keep \nAmerica moving forward in the 21st century. The Department of \nTransportation's Conditions and Performance Report estimates that an \naverage of $127 billion per year is needed over the next two decades to \nmaintain and improve the condition of our highways, bridges, and \ntransit systems. Other estimates show an even greater need. I believe \nthat failure to make the needed investment will result in the continued \ndeterioration of our existing infrastructure.\n  Moreover, investment in our transportation infrastructure has \neconomic benefits as well. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \neach $1 billion invested in transportation infrastructure creates \n47,500 jobs. At a time when our economy is struggling, investing in \ntransportation is one of the smartest actions that Government can take. \nIncreased investment creates jobs today and leads to economic growth \ntomorrow.\n  For this reason, I am disappointed that the administration has not \nyet come forward with the resources we will need to develop a full, 6 \nyear reauthorization bill. The administration's reauthorization \nproposal, known as SAFETEA, provides only a minimal increase for the \nFederal highway program, and in fact would cut that program in fiscal \nyear 2004 from its fiscal year 2003 level. For transit, SAFETEA not \nonly fails to grow the program at the pace of inflation, it cuts \nguaranteed funding over the 6 year period, so that the guaranteed level \nin fiscal year 2009 is actually less than the program level today. \nWithout a serious commitment from the administration to make the kind \nof investment needed, and strong bipartisan bicameral leadership in the \nCongress, it will be very difficult for us to reauthorize the surface \ntransportation programs even when this short-term extension expires.\n  Until that commitment is made, however, it is essential that our \nStates and local communities be able to continue to operate and \nmaintain our Nation's roads, bridges, and transit systems. I encourage \nthe Department of Transportation to use the authority granted by this \nlegislation to provide the needed assistance as expeditiously as \npossible. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, as the Senate considers this temporary \nextension of our transportation programs, I would like to note for my \ncolleagues the budgetary implications of this legislation.\n  This bill is subject to a point of order pursuant to section 302(f) \nof the Budget Act because the total level of contract authority for \ntransportation programs within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science and Transportation--on an annualized basis--exceeds \nthe allocation provided to that committee in the FY 2004 budget \nresolution. Because the amount is not significant, and the bill is only \na short-term extension, I have chosen not to pursue the point of order \nat this time.\n  In addition, section 10 of the bill contains a number of provisions \nthat are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget, thus \nsubjecting the bill to another 60-vote point of order pursuant to \nsection 306 of the Budget Act. Subsections (a), (b) and (c) amend \nsections 250 and 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nControl Act of 1985 and purport to extend the life of the \ntransportation categories. Subsection (d) deems certain spending \nadjustments to be ``zero'' for FY 2004. Finally subsection (e) \nexpresses a ``sense of Congress'' with respect to the adjustments for \nrevenue aligned budget authority (aka RABA).\n  While some may argue that these ``budgetary provisions'' are of \nlittle consequence given the expiration of the statutory spending caps \nwhich had been set out in section 251, I feel it is still important to \ncomment upon them. I am concerned that their inclusion in this bill may \nsignal to some that we have prejudged the important fiscal policy \ndebate that must take place when the long-term reauthorization comes \nbefore the Senate. Let me assure my colleagues, that in agreeing to \nthis necessary stop-gap measure today, I am in no way conceding the \nfuture budgetary treatment of transportation spending.\n  These issues have a long history.\n  In 1998 the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) \nwas enacted and from a budgetary perspective introduced two new \nconcepts: two transportation categories (for highways and transit) \nwithin the discretionary spending limits and an annual automatic \nadjustment to those limits, aka RABA. Both concepts were enshrined in \nsection 251 as well as in the transportation laws. In general, section \n251 set out the statutory discretionary spending limits through FY \n2002. These limits were enforced through sequestration. In other words, \nback in 1998 special (one might even say privileged) consideration was \nafforded transportation spending within the context of an overall goal \nto limit spending and balance the budget by 2002. While TEA-21 \npurported to establish special budgetary treatment through FY 2003, the \nmechanisms were placed within section 251 which expired on September \n30, 2002 (pursuant to section 275(b)). Consequently this special \nbudgetary treatment of transportation spending ceased to have any \nsubstantive meaning nearly 2 years ago--after enactment of the FY 2002 \nappropriations bills.\n  I must also remind my colleagues that this RABA mechanism was to have \nbeen a two-way street. If gas tax revenues exceeded previous estimates, \nspending for transportation would go up. Similarly if gas tax revenues \ndecreased, spending levels were to have gone down--thus not altering \nthe ``path to a balanced budget.'' This mechanism worked well through \nthe boom time of the late 1990's as actual gas tax revenues \nconsistently exceeded previous estimates and Congress and the President \nhappily spent this windfall. However, when actual gas receipts cam in \nbelow predicted levels and the President reflected the lower levels \ndictated by TEA-21 in his FY 2003 budget, few in Washington were \nwilling to acknowledge this reality and spend less.\n  I mention this today because I am concerned by the language in this \nbill\n\n[[Page S12097]]\n\nthat expresses the ``Sense of Congress'' on RABA. While the language is \nnot binding and merely suggests that any future provisions should seek \nto minimize fluctuations in spending--which sounds like a good thing--\nits very presence in H.R. 3087 might lead some to believe that the \nconcept of separate transportation categories and the RABA adjustment's \ninclusion in a long-term extension is a done deal.\n  The Senate should remember that when TEA-21 was enacted it was done \nso in the context of 5-year discretionary spending limits--which I \nremind my colleagues were designed to manage the growth of \ndiscretionary spending in order to reach a balanced budget by 2002. \nSince then, balanced budgets, surpluses and the days of 5-year caps \nhave come and gone. And while I sincerely hope we can exercise fiscal \nconstraint in the coming years, I do not know when or if we will again \nput 5-year discretionary caps into law. Our recent experiences have \nshown us that, at best, caps might be useful for 2 years. Consequently, \nI believe that as we work towards a long-term reauthorization of our \nFederal transportation programs, we must take a fresh look at any \nassociated budgetary mechanisms.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important \nissues in the future.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am reluctant to enact a short-term \nextension of the highway funding bill without improving equity for \ndonor States. At issue is the historic mistreatment of about 20 States, \nincluding Michigan, known as ``donor'' States, who, year after year, \nhave sent more gas tax dollars to the Highway Trust Fund in Washington \nthan were returned in transportation infrastructure spending. The \nremaining 30 States, known as ``donee'' States, have received more \ntransportation funding than they paid into the Highway Trust Fund.\n  This came about in 1956 when Senators from a number of small and \nlarge States banded together to develop a formula to distribute Federal \nhighway dollars that advantaged their States at the expense of the \nremaining States. They formed a coalition of about 30 States that would \nbenefit from the formula and, once that formula was in place, have \ntenaciously defended it.\n  At the beginning there was some legitimacy to the large low-\npopulation predominately Western States getting more funds than they \ncontributed to the system in order to build a national interstate \nhighway system. Some arguments remain for providing additional funds to \nthose States to maintain the national system and our bill will do that. \nHowever, there is no justification for any State getting more than its \nfair share.\n  Each time the highway bill is reauthorized the donor States that have \ntraditionally subsidized other States' road and bridge projects have \nfought to correct this inequity in highway funding. It has been a long \nstruggle to change these outdated formulas.\n  Through these battles, some progress has been made, but we still have \na long way to go to achieve fairness for Michigan and other States on \nthe return on our Highway Trust Fund contributions. At stake are tens \nof millions of dollars a year in additional funding to pay for badly \nneeded transportation improvements in our States and the jobs that go \nwith it. Unfortunately, this short-term extension bill does not make \nany improvements on the rate of return for donor States, even on the \nnew funds that are included in this bill that are above last year's \nfunding levels.\n  My colleagues have argued that this short-term bill is a straight \n``clean'' extension of Federal highway and transit programs. They have \nargued that we cannot accommodate any policy changes in an extension \nbill such as improving the rate of return for donor States. But this \nbill does include one policy change. It includes an increase in funding \nover last year. In fairness to donor States and to bring us closer to \nnarrowing the funding gap between donor and donee States, the \nadditional money contained in this bill should have been distributed to \ndonor States at a higher rate.\n  Unfortunately, this bill does not do this. It contains more money \nthan last year yet fails to address the longstanding inequity. Every \ntime we extend these programs without addressing equity, donor States \nlose out on getting back their fair share of gas tax dollars currently \nbeing spent in other States. There is no logical reason for some States \nto continue to send that money to other States to subsidize their road \nand bridge projects and to perpetuate this imbalance is simply unfair.\n  I plan to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to obtain a commitment to \nachieve a 95 percent rate of return for a donor State's share of its \ncontributions to the Highway Trust Fund in the long-term transportation \nreauthorization bill, up from 90.5 percent under the current bill.\n  This is an issue of simple fairness and we should not be satisfied \nuntil we achieve it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3087, \nthe Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2003, which extends the \nexpiring Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century for an \nadditional 5 months.\n  As my colleagues are aware, we are just days from the expiration of \nTEA-21. We continue to make progress in our negotiations on a \ncomprehensive 6-year bill, but we need more time. Earlier this year, 79 \nSenators voted for the Bond-Reid amendment to the fiscal year 2004 \nbudget resolution which stated clearly that the Senate wanted the \nfunding for a 6-year highway bill at $255 billion.\n  I believe $255 billion is a reasonable and responsible level given \nthe pressing transportation infrastructure needs that are out there. \nNow the challenge is to get to that level. My colleagues on the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works and I have been working \nclosely with Senators Grassley and Baucus to find the money. In the \nmeantime, we have to address the imminent expiration of TEA-21.\n  H.R. 3087 provides 5 months worth of the $35.5 billion allowed under \nthe budget resolution of $14.8 billion and a corresponding amount of \nobligation limitation. This is a significant, 7 percent increase in \nhighway funding over 2003. This additional $2.2 billion in highway \nfunding will translate into over 100,000 new jobs.\n  Of course, the best thing we can do to create economic opportunity is \nenact a comprehensive, 6-year reauthorization. As we all know, highway \nbills are job bills. A highway bill drafted at $255 billion over 6 \nyears will create about 2 million new American jobs. This combined with \nthe tax cuts signed by President Bush is the best stimulus the economy \ncan receive.\n  Let me be very clear that my preference is that we would be \nconsidering a 6-year comprehensive bill today, not a 5-month extension, \nbut reality is that the funding needed to do a comprehensive 6-year \nbill at $255 billion has not yet been identified. Because of that, I \nbelieve the best outcome for the long-term is to do a 5-year month \nextension and continue to work on a comprehensive 6-year bill.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3087.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President. I rise in support of H.R. 3087, a bill \nto extend the Nation's surface transportation program, TEA-21, for a \nfive-month period. Absent enactment of H.R. 3087, the program will shut \ndown on September 30, 2003. I urge my colleagues to join me in support \nof this bill.\n  I regret the need for a short term extension to TEA-21. A short term \nextension brings uncertainty to our State transportation departments. \nThis leads to postponed projects and job loss. But we have yet to find \nsufficient revenues to bring a full, 6-year reauthorization bill to the \nfloor.\n  I have worked for the last 2 years on reauthorization of the \ntransportation program, first as chairman of the committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, and now as ranking member. This work has \nbeen bipartisan. I thank and commend Chairman Inhofe and our \nsubcommittee chairman and ranking member, Senators Bond and Reid for \ntheir approach to this task.\n  We have made great progress. We concluded early on that the Nation's \ninfrastructure needs far exceed current resources. We shared our \nfindings with our Senate colleagues. They in turn gave overwhelming \nsupport to the Bond-Reid amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution, to \nincrease spending on the transportation program by roughly 40 percent \nto $311 billion. This has guided our work.\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\n  Our hearings revealed strong support for the existing TEA-21 program \nstructure. In our work to date, we have retained the program structure \nlargely intact. My goal is to maintain the current patterns in \nresources allocation among program categories, as well. On funding \nformulas, we have committed to benefitting all States as the program \ngrows. And the program growth levels approved by our Senate budget \nresolution will enable such an outcome.\n  I will continue to work with Chairman Inhofe to bring a full, 6-year \nbill to the Senate floor within the next 5 months.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3087, a bill \nto provide an extension of highway, highway safety, motor carrier \nsafety, transit, and other programs funded out of the Highway Trust \nFund until February 29, 2004 pending enactment of a law reauthorizing \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21. However, I \nam disappointed that Congress has been unable to enact a 6-year \nreauthorization of TEA-21 prior to September 30, 2003.\n  According to the American Road and Transportation Builders \nAssociation, ARTBA, employment in the transportation construction \nindustry was down in July 2003 compared to July 2002. Specifically, \nthere were 12,100 fewer workers on project sites over the last year, a \ndecrease of 3.7 percent. In Ohio, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, heavy construction jobs are up slightly from last year; \nhowever, there are still 3,800 fewer jobs than in August 2000 when they \nwere at their peak. Moreover, last year had the lowest number of \nemployees in heavy construction since 1995.\n  Our economy needs a public works program to create jobs. Investment \nin our Nation's transportation infrastructure through a 6-year \nreauthorization bill would create thousands of jobs and jumpstart our \nsluggish economy. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, \nfor every $1 billion invested in highway construction, 47,500 jobs are \ncreated. It is also estimated that every dollar invested in the \nNation's highway system generates $5.70 in economic benefits, including \nreduced delays, improved safety, and reduced vehicle operations costs. \nThis is a six-to-one return on investment.\n  Although a 5-month extension extension will continue the flow of \nFederal funding to States' highway programs, it will not deal with the \nNation's pressing, long-term transportation infrastructure needs. \nAccording to the Federal Highway Administration's, FHWA, 2002 \nConditions and Performance Report, the average annual investment level \nneeded to make improvements to highways and bridges is projected to be \n$106.9 billion through 2020. This amount is 65.3 percent higher than \nthe $64.6 billion of total capital investments spent by all levels of \ngovernment in 2000.\n  The average annual investment level necessary to maintain the current \ncondition and performance of highways and bridges is projected to be \n$75.9 billion through 2020. This amount if 17.5 percent higher than \ncapital spending in 2000.\n  If we continue to ignore the upkeep, and allow the deterioration of \nour infrastructure, we risk disruptions in commerce and reduced \nprotection for public safety, health, and the environment. In my view, \nit is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that funding levels are \nadequate and efficiently allocated to the Nation's priority needs. In \n1998, Congress recognized the importance of the Nation's transportation \nsystem through the enactment of TEA-21, a 6-year bill which increased \nby nearly 40 percent Federal investment in highways and transit. Under \nTEA-21, Ohio received a 23 percent increase in transportation funding.\n\n  As chairman of the National Governors Association, I was involved in \nnegotiating TEA-21 and lobbied Congress to ensure that all Highway \nTrust Fund revenues were spent on transportation. I also fought to even \nout highway funding fluctuations and assure a predictable flow of \nfunding to the States. TEA-21 achieved this goal with record, \nguaranteed levels of funding. While TEA-21 has enabled States and \nlocalities to improve the condition of deteriorating and unsafe \nhighways and to increase capacity and performance, the system is still \naging, and in need of additional investment.\n  TEA-21 also dedicated nearly all highway gas taxes to transportation \nfunding and guarantees that States will receive at least 90.5 percent \nof their share of their contribution to the highway account of the \nHighway Trust Fund. One of my top priorities for TEA-21 reauthorization \nis to increase the minimum share for donor states to at least 95 \npercent. This increase in the rate of return would generate an \nadditional $60 million or more in Federal highway funding for the State \nof Ohio.\n  In May 2003, Senator Carl Levin and I, along with House majority \nleader Tom DeLay and Congressman Baron Hill introduced legislation--the \nHighway Funding Equity Act of 2003--to increase donor States' minimum \nrate-of-return to 95 percent. Currently, there are 143 cosponsors of \nthe House bill and 22 cosponsors of the Senate bill.\n  The legislation we are considering today does not improve donor State \nequity; rather, it continues current law with respect to the minimum \nguarantee program. For donor States, this is another reason why a 6-\nyear reauthorization is so important and critical to our States. I am \nstrongly committed to improving donor state equity in the longer term \nreauthorization, and look forward to working with my colleagues on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to ensure that states receive \ntheir fair share of Highway Trust Fund dollars.\n  I am disappointed that the legislation we are considering does not \ncontain language which would have ensured that States that consume \nethanol-blended fuel are no longer penalized. The Finance Committee \nreported legislation I have cosponsored that would transfer 2.5 cents \nof the Federal tax on ethanol-blended fuel from the General Fund of the \nTreasury to the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund and replace \nthe 5.2 cents per gallon reduced tax rate for ethanol-blended fuel with \na tax credit. As a result, the same Federal tax will be collected and \ndeposited into the Highway Trust Fund regardless of whether a gallon of \nfuel contains ethanol. The Ohio Department of Transportation, ODOT, \nestimates that Ohio would restore up to $170 million annually as a \nresult of the Finance Committee's legislation. I am hopeful this \nlegislation will be passed soon.\n  Ohio has the Nation's tenth largest highway network, the fifth \nhighest volume of traffic, the fourth largest interstate highway \nnetwork, and the second largest inventory of bridges in the country. \nOhio's transportation challenge is to expand its 1960s transportation \nsystem to meet 21st century needs. Recently, Ohio approved a State \nmotor fuel tax increase that will ensure an annual $250 million new \nconstruction program for the next 10 years while maintaining bridge and \nhighway conditions. With additional Federal funds, ODOT has set a goal \nof having a $5 billion, 10-year Ohio construction program dedicated to \naddressing Ohio's most pressing congestion, safety, and rural access \nneeds. The plan is predicated on Congress enacting legislation to \ncorrect the ``ethanol penalty'' which reduces Ohio's transportation \nrevenue, increase donor states' minimum rate-of-return to 95 percent, \nand provide an increased level of investment in the nation's highways \nand bridges.\n  This is why a 6-year reauthorization is important to my State. I am \nhopeful that Congress can reach a consensus on how to fund a longer-\nterm reauthorization. As far as this Senator is concerned, I support \nthe principle that the highway program is a fully user-fee based system \nthat pays its own way, and I am reluctant to borrow more money for \nhighways.\n  Furthermore, as chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to include provisions in the 6-year reauthorization that \nwill streamline the project delivery process while protecting the \nenvironment and historic resources, reform the conformity process, and \nreauthorize and improve the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nprogram.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together to produce a six-year \nreauthorization of TEA-21 before the extension bill expires at the end \nof next February. Reauthorization of TEA-21 will be one of the most \nimportant actions this Congress will take to get people back to work.\n\n[[Page S12099]]\n\n                        inequity of donor states\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am concerned that the 5-month highway \nbill extension being considered by the Senate today does not address \nthe inequity faced by the donor States for so many years. The donor \nState inequity issue is the historic problem of about 20 States, \nincluding Michigan, Ohio and Oklahoma, known as ``donor'' States, who \nhave sent more gas tax dollars year after year to the Highway Trust \nFund in Washington than were returned in transportation infrastructure \nspending. The remaining 30 States, known as ``donee'' States, have \nreceived more transportation funding than they paid into the Highway \nTrust Fund. For a long time there has been no legitimacy to retaining \nsuch antiquated and unfair formulas that require taxpayers in 20 of our \nStates to subsidize highway projects in 30 other States. We should not \nconsider a highway bill without addressing this important issue.\n  It is a high priority to see that this historic inequity be \ncorrected. At stake are tens of millions of dollars a year in \nadditional funding to pay for badly needed transportation improvements \nin Michigan and the jobs that go with it. My colleague from Ohio and I \nhave authored legislation that would bring donor States to a 95 percent \nrate of return on their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. This \nwould be up from the current minimum rate of return of 90.5 percent \nunder the current TEA-21 bill. I am reluctant to see even a short term \nextension of the highway bill go through without increasing the minimum \nrate of return for donor States to address the inequity. I would at the \nvery least like to get a commitment from the chairman that achieving \ndonor State equity in a 6-year reauthorization bill in his intention \nand an urgent priority. I know he is as determined as we are to achieve \nequity for donor States.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more with my colleague \nfrom Michigan. There is no logical reason why donor States should be \ncontributing more dollars to the Highway Trust Fund than are returned \nto them for highway, bridge, and other surface transportation projects. \nDonor States like Ohio, Michigan, and Oklahoma have as many \ntransportation infrastructure needs as other States. With so many \nprojects needing funding in our own States, why should the citizens in \nour States continue to pay for transportation improvements in other \nStates?\n  I, too, would like an assurance that the donor State equity issue \nwill be addressed in the reauthorization of the Transportation Equity \nAct for the 21st Century and that this long-term reauthorization will \nbe presented to the Senate as soon as possible.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want my colleagues from Michigan, Ohio, \nand the many other donor States to know that I am committed to \nimproving the return to donor States. It is my intention that any \ncomprehensive 6-year reauthorization bill considered by the Senate \ninclude a provision that guarantees all donor States get to a 95 \npercent minimum rate of return at the end of the life of the bill \nwithout harming the opportunity for all States to grow. However, \nMembers need to understand that this is only possible if we are able to \nfund the bill at $255 billion which means we must identify additional \nrevenue.\n  I also want to further assure my donor State colleagues that the next \nhighway bill I plan to mark up is a 6-year bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am reassured to hear such a strong \ncommitment from my colleague from Oklahoma to achieve a 95-percent \nminimum rate of return for all States in the long-term highway \nreauthorization bill. I look forward to continuing to work closely with \nthe chairman to achieve this goal and in the fight for true donor State \nequity.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am also reassured to hear the strong \nconviction of my colleague from Oklahoma that donor States should \nreceive a minimum rate of return of 95 percent on the share of their \ncontributions to the Highway Trust Fund. I too look forward to working \nwith the chairman and my colleague from Michigan to improve donor State \nequity.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3087) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12099-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12099-S12101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RUNAWAY, HOMELESS, AND MISSING CHILDREN PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 289, S. 1451.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1451) to reauthorize programs under the Runaway \n     and Homeless Youth Act and the Missing Children's Assistance \n     Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to take up and pass S. \n1451, the Runaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection Act. It \npassed unanimously in the Judiciary Committee earlier today, and it \ndeserves the support of every Senator. I joined with Senator Hatch in \nintroducing this legislation to reauthorize and improve the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act, and to extend the authorization of the Missing \nChildren's Assistance Act. This bill follows in the footsteps of the \nrecently enacted PROTECT Act legislation, and presents another \nmilestone in our efforts to safeguard all of our children.\n  In the 29 years since it became law, the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct has helped some of the most vulnerable children in our country. I \nhave worked in the past to extend the program, most recently in the \n106th Congress, when I cosponsored S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and \nRunaway Children Protection Act, which extended the act through this \nyear. I am pleased to help extend it once again.\n  A Justice Department report released last year estimated that 1.7 \nmillion young people either ran away from or were thrown out of their \nhomes in 1999 alone. Other studies have suggested an even higher \nnumber. This law and the programs it funds provide a safety net that \nhelps give these young people a chance to build lives for themselves. \nIt is slated to expire at the end of this fiscal year, and we should \nnot allow that to happen.\n  In my State, both the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless \nYouth and Spectrum Youth and Family Services in Burlington receive \ngrants under this law, and they have provided excellent services both \nto young people trying to build lives on their own and to those who are \nstruggling on the streets. Reauthorizing this law will allow them to \ncontinue their enormously important work.\n  This bill would improve the law by extending the period during which \nolder homeless youth can receive services under the Transitional Living \nProgram, to ensure that all homeless youth can take advantage of \nservices at least until they turn 18. The bill would also make \npermanent the Secretary of Health and Human Services' authority to make \ngrants explicitly to help rural areas meet the unique stresses of \nproviding services to runaway and homeless youth. Programs serving \nrunaway and homeless youth have found that those in rural areas are \nparticularly difficult to reach and serve effectively, and this bill \nrecognizes that fact.\n  The improvements proposed in this bill to the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act build on provisions included in the PROTECT Act \nlegislation that we enacted earlier this year. In that bill, we \nauthorized National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, \nactivities through 2005 and authorized the Center to strengthen its \nCyberTipline to provide online users an effective means of reporting \nInternet-related child sexual exploitation in distribution of child \npornography, online enticement of children for sexual acts, and child \nprostitution. This bill would extend NCMEC through 2008. Now more than \never, it is critical for Congress to give the center the resources it \nneeds in order to pursue its important work. A missing or abducted \nchild is the worst nightmare of any parent or grandparent, and NCMEC \nhas proved to\n\n[[Page S12100]]\n\nbe an invaluable resource in Federal, State, and local efforts to \nrecover children who have disappeared.\n  Although this is a good bill on the whole, I am disappointed that \nSenator Hatch did not agree to remove a provision that was included in \nthe House-passed bill that prohibits grantees from using any funds \nprovided under this program for needle distribution programs. This is a \nsuperfluous provision that simply repeats what is already law. In \naddition, it is unnecessary because no grantee under this program \noperates needle exchange programs or has expressed interest in doing \nso. The inclusion of this needless provision, however, does not change \nthe fact that this is still a very good bill.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs have received tremendous \nbipartisan support over the years, and the House has already passed its \nversion of this bill by a vote of 404 to 14. I urge the Senate to \nfollow suit today.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1451) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1451\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, although we have not been able to finish \nthe DC appropriations this week, we have addressed a number of \nsignificant, very important issues over the course of the week.\n  Earlier in the week, we finished the Interior appropriations bill, \nafter a lot of great work, fantastic work and leadership by Senator \nConrad Burns and the ranking member.\n  In addition, we completed final action on three appropriations \nconference reports, those being the Department of Defense, Homeland \nSecurity, and the legislative branch bills. Those will now be sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate was able to respond, very \nappropriately and very quickly, on the Do Not Call legislation, \nalthough within several hours after passage, we had yet another \nsetback, a setback in the sense that the will of the American people is \nbeing trumped by a decision made in a Colorado court on this issue of \n``do not call.''\n  Earlier this week, a Federal judge in Oklahoma had ruled that the \nFederal Trade Commission had no authority to operate the Do Not Call \nTelemarketing Registry, which was just about ready to go into effect, \nand very quickly we responded with legislation. But then, last night, \nas most people know, a Colorado judge ruled that the registry \nrestrictions were a violation of the first amendment.\n  Even over the course of the morning, I can tell you, because of the \nnumber of phone calls that have come to me, and talking with \nconstituents back home, as well as the news media, it clearly is the \nsentiment, the feeling of the overwhelming majority of Americans that \nthese decisions make no sense.\n  Americans this summer have signed up for that ``sound of silence'' in \nthe evenings from that telephone ring right when they are sitting down \nfor that very special time--dinner with their family--and there are the \nrepetitive phone calls that start coming to them by telemarketers \nhawking the variety of wares with which we are all familiar.\n\n  The daily lives of millions of people are interrupted each and every \nday--again and again--with that telephone ring interrupting meals and \nfamily time, interrupting their togetherness. You pick up the phone and \nhear the pitch.\n  Every time I am in Tennessee, I hear about this. According to the \nFTC, as of\n\n[[Page S12102]]\n\nSeptember 16--the most recent information available--677,669 Tennessee \nphone numbers have been registered with the National Do Not Call \nRegistry; over 187,000 of those registered by phone and over 490,000 by \nthe Internet alone.\n  As for parents, it is, as we all know, one of those important \ninterests, and we are committed to do something about that.\n  Yesterday, with the leadership of Chairman Billy Tauzin in the House, \nthe House responded with legislation. Chairman McCain, along with \nSenators Ensign and Dorgan and many others in this body, worked on \nlegislation identical to the Tauzin bill. We passed that bill. The \nHouse passed their bill. We passed our bill. Yet we now have this \nColorado ruling, from late yesterday, which goes counter to the will of \nthe American people.\n  At this juncture we will have to review the decision to determine how \nbest to proceed, and for telemarketers how we can put--and we will \nfigure out some way to do it--some sort of permanent busy signal on the \nphones of families in Tennessee and indeed across the country.\n  Finally, earlier this week, we were able to schedule and give consent \nto Senator DeWine's Video Voyeurism Prevention Act. Several important \nauthorizations were completed this week, including the one we just did \nwith the Small Business reauthorization, as well as the authorization \nfor the Federal Maritime Commission. Senators McCain and Snowe guided \npassage of those measures.\n  We also successfully negotiated an agreement to allow for Senate \npassage of the U.S. Olympic Committee Reform Act. Senator Campbell and \nMcCain engaged in that effort and pushed ahead.\n  Just a few moments ago, we also confirmed formally a number of \nmilitary nominations, including Gordon England to be Secretary of the \nNavy.\n  I would like to say, also, that we confirmed six district judges this \nweek. Again, steady progress has been made with respect to these \njudicial nominations. Yet I very quickly have to remind my colleagues \nthat we have an additional 12 judges that are now waiting on the \nExecutive Calendar. I will continue to work with the Democratic leader \nto schedule Senate votes on those remaining nominations.\n  Let me close by saying--this is really to notify my colleagues--on \nthe Executive Calendar we have a whole number of--too many, I think--\nnonjudicial nominations that are pending for floor action.\n  I know that individual Members may have specific concerns with some \nof these nominations, but I am also aware that Senators will hold these \nnominations so we cannot address them on the floor for unrelated \nissues. Because we are now coming down to the closing weeks of this \nsession, I do hope and encourage each and every one of our Members to \naddress, from their own perspective, these nominations, and if there is \nsomething holding up consideration from the floor, to work with us and \nto allow these individuals to be scheduled for votes. We have \nnominations, in fact, that have been on the Executive Calendar since \nMarch, again, waiting for us to act. I hope each of us will address \nthis very important issue.\n  I do thank my colleagues in advance for addressing this over the \ncoming days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/26/senate-section/article/S12102-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M., MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
