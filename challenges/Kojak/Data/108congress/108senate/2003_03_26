We are heirs to a freedom, \nitself not free, but bought by others' sacrifice. We think even now of \nthose who suffered and died to pass on this legacy.\n  Remind us, Lord, that the everyday panoramic picture of life in this \nland is only possible when maintained within the framework of a strong \ndefense. Since the only guarantee of the rights enunciated by the \nConstitution lies in the will of people prepared to die for them, then \nmultiply, O God, our gratitude to all those who have done so in the \npast and those who continue to lay their lives on the line for the \nlong-term safety and protection of this Nation and the cause of liberty \nacross the globe. In these testing times give guidance and \nsteadfastness to freedom's defenders: the President and his advisors, \nthe Armed Forces, our allies, and the representatives of the people who \ngather under this roof.\n  O God, although the future is unknown, yet grant to this Senate to \nsee clearly the eternal beacons by which the Founders were led.

For the information of all Senators, this morning there \nwill be a period for morning business until 11:30 a.m. A number of \nMembers have requested time to make remarks regarding our courageous \nmen and women of the Armed Forces, and this morning will be an \nopportunity for them to do that.\n  At 11:30, we will resume consideration of the budget resolution. We \nmade substantial progress yesterday. Of the 22 amendments remaining on \nthe list, far fewer will be offered and require votes. We will resume \nvoting on the offered amendments at 11:30 a.m. and will continue voting \nover the course of the afternoon until we reach passage of the \nresolution.\n  Under the consent agreement reached last week, we will vote on \nadoption of the budget resolution at 4 p.m. today. It may be possible \nto complete action on the resolution earlier than that, but we will \nhave to wait and see how many amendments will actually necessitate \nvotes over the course of the late morning and early afternoon. To this \npoint, we have had 45 rollcall votes on this budget resolution.\n  I take this opportunity to congratulate the chairman and ranking \nmember for their orderly consideration of this very important measure. \nI will have more to say about their good work as we approach passage \nover the course of the afternoon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. While the majority leader is in the Chamber, on behalf of \nthe Senate, I commend him and the minority leader for the arrangement \nthat was made. This legislation upon which we work is almost impossible \nto go through each year, but we have done it. This year has been about \nas orderly as I have seen. I know the leader wanted to finish this bill \nlast week, but it was just impossible to do, no matter what his wishes \nwere. The work that the majority leader and Senator Daschle have done \nto allow us to get to this point has made it possible that the two \nmanagers could do the great work they have done to move this \nlegislation along.\n  As I heard one Senator say last night, this is the Senate at its \nbest. I\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\nbelieve we have had good, short debate and we have had some spirited \nvoting. I hope we can continue that today, which I am confident we \nwill, and make this one of the most productive weeks we have had in a \nlong time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the assistant minority leader for his comments. \nIndeed, I believe that by 4 p.m. today the product we end up with will \nreflect the will of the Senate after adequate time for debate, \ndiscussion, and time for people to express both their feelings and \ntheir convictions. We will have a product of which we will all be \nproud, where neither side will agree with it in its entirety.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I appreciate the comments and look \nforward to a productive day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the majority and minority \nleaders for setting aside this time for Senators to talk about events \nin the battlefield. While our troops are in the field in the Iraqi \nconflict, I certainly hope we will set aside an hour every morning for \nSenators to talk about happenings in the field, tributes to the troops, \nand other related incidents. I can think of no better way to start the \nSenate every morning than to pay tribute to those who are in the field \nas we speak.\n  All of us have seen the graphic pictures on television of the \nsandstorm and our troops continuing to make their way forward toward \nBaghdad, even though the pictures show that it is so dark that even in \nthe daytime they have been hampered by these horrendous sandstorms.\n  I am particularly moved by the prisoners of war and the missing in \naction. All of us were riveted this weekend to the television that \nshowed our first prisoners taken. There have been quite graphic \npictures of these prisoners taken by the Iraqis and published on \ntelevision stations overseas. They have not, mostly, been published \nover here. Certain parts have not been published at all.\n  I say, first, that every single one of the missing or prisoners are \nfrom Texas bases, they are from Fort Bliss or Fort Hood--every single \none of them.\n  I have talked to some of the families. I have tried to reach some but \nI have not been able to. But it really brings it home when you hear \nthat this has happened and you feel as if you know these people because \nthey are so close to home.\n  I want to reiterate what the President of the United States has \nsaid--all of our leaders. We hope the Iraqis will treat the prisoners \nof war as Americans are treating the Iraqi prisoners of war. Americans \nare giving the Iraqis medical treatment. They are giving them food and \nwater. I think one of the most poignant early pictures from the field \nwas a marine giving water from his canteen to an Iraqi soldier who had \nsurrendered.\n  It is my fervent hope that the Iraqis will show a good side in \ncomplying with the Geneva Convention so they will not harm these \nprisoners or in any way treat them improperly, certainly not humiliate \nthem in any way.\n  There will be more stories of heroism as we go through the coming \ndays and weeks. Today I wish to share some remarks from British Army \nLTC Tim Collins, who spoke to his troops just before they moved into \ntheir first battle against Saddam's forces. These words are stirring \nand they give us a glimpse into the hearts of those who are carrying \nout the job in Iraq, who are doing the job so well, part of a coalition \nof freedom-loving people.\n  I don't think anyone in America will ever forget the incredible \nsupport of the British Government and the British Army. There are many \nother governments and armies that have come forward. We are up to 45 \ncountries in support of this action, the last I heard. But I \nparticularly was touched by Lieutenant Colonel Collins's speech to his \nmen. He said:\n\n       There are some who are alive at this moment who will not be \n     alive shortly. It is my foremost intention to bring every \n     single one of you out alive, but there may be some among us \n     who will not see the end of this campaign. We will put them \n     in their sleeping bags and send them back. There will be no \n     time for sorrow. . . .\n       Those who do not wish to go on that journey, we will not \n     send. As for the others, I expect you to rock their world. \n     Wipe them out if that is what they choose. But if you are \n     ferocious in battle, remember to be magnanimous in victory. \n     It is a big step to take another human life. It is not to be \n     done lightly. . . .\n       I know of men who have taken life needlessly in other \n     conflicts. I can assure you they live with the mark of Cain \n     upon them. If someone surrenders to you, then remember they \n     have that right in international law and ensure that one day \n     they can go home to their family. The ones who wish to fight, \n     well, we aim to please. . . .\n       We go to liberate, not to conquer. We will not fly our \n     flags in their country. Iraq is steeped in history. It is the \n     site of the Garden of Eden, of the Great Flood and the \n     birthplace of Abraham. Tread lightly there. . . .\n       You will see things that no man could pay to see and you \n     will have to go a long way to find a more decent, generous \n     and upright people than the Iraqis. You will be embarrassed \n     by their hospitality even though they have nothing. . . .\n\n  Colonel Collins and his men formed the first battalion of the Royal \nIrish Regiment. Colonel Collins is from Belfast and most of his men are \nfrom Northern Ireland. We are very proud to have them among our \ncoalition.\n  I think I speak for every American in saying we support our troops, \nwe support our allies, and we support everything they are doing in the \nfield as we are here, enjoying the freedom they are fighting to keep \nfor us, for our children and our grandchildren.\n  We will never be able to fully repay the debt to those who have lost \ntheir lives, but we will always remember them. We will respect them. We \nwill duly honor them as time goes by, as one of those brave souls in \nthe history of our country who have allowed us to keep the freedom that \nis the beacon to the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4398-5", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4398-S4399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 100 years from now, none of us will be \nhere. I guess that is the bad news. We will all be dead a century from \nnow. But those who are interested in who we were, what we were, what \nour value systems were about, could take a look at what we are doing \nhere and determine a little something about what we thought was \nimportant.\n  Someone once asked the question, if you were charged with writing an \nobituary for someone else and knew nothing about them but had to write \nit from their check register--the only information you had about \nsomeone was their check register--how would you write their obituary? I \nsuppose you would find out what they spent their money on, what they \nthought was important, what was their value system.\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\nSo, too, could you evaluate the value system of this country and this \nCongress by this budget we are voting on today.\n  I am going to vote against this budget. I will tell you why. Because \nI think in the rearview mirror, this budget represents a value system \nthat misses much of what is important about what our obligation is \ntoday.\n  We are at war. We are at war with terrorists. We are at war in Iraq. \nWe have a responsibility to protect our homeland. We have a serious \nthreat with respect to North Korea, apparently now building additional \nnuclear weapons.\n  What does this budget document tell us is the most important element \nin the Federal Government? They say the most important element is to \ngive those who have the highest incomes in America more tax cuts.\n  Let me turn to page 6 and tell you what this budget document says. \nThis budget document says, assume all of the President's proposed tax \ncuts, most of which go to wealthy Americans--assume that. This is the \nresult on page 6: By the year 2013, this country will have a nearly $12 \ntrillion Federal debt--this country will have a nearly $12 trillion \ndebt. The gross debt will be $11.919 trillion--almost $12 trillion.\n\n  We are saying to those men and women fighting for this country today, \nyou go ahead and pursue this battle on behalf of America and when you \ncome back what we will do is burden you, we will saddle your shoulders \nwith all of this debt because the priority in this budget is tax cuts, \nmost of which will go to upper income Americans.\n  We heard all day yesterday on amendments that this is going to hurt \nthe growth package. What growth? Where is the growth? The only growth I \nsee in this package is going from $6.6 trillion in debt to $12 trillion \nin debt. Yes, it is on page 6. That assumes all the tax cuts. This is \nthe President's plan. The plan is to go to $12 trillion in debt. I \ndon't think that is much of a plan. This grows the economy, does it? It \nproduces new jobs, new economic opportunity? New tax revenues? I guess \nnot, not if you are going to go to a $12 trillion gross debt. I do not \nunderstand at all what on Earth is happening here.\n  About 2 years ago we had this debate about dramatically increased tax \ncuts. Some of us said let's be a bit conservative. The President said, \nno, there is no need to be conservative; let's pass all these tax cuts. \nThen we had a recession. The technology bubble burst. The stock market \npancaked. We had 9/11. We had a war on terrorism. We had the largest \ncorporate scandals in decades and decades--perhaps in this country's \nhistory. And the result, of course, was very large budget surpluses \nturned to very large budget deficits.\n  Now we are told if we just pass this budget it will be better. But \nlook on page 6. Assuming all the President wants, assuming all he asks \nus to do, on page 6, they say, in the year 2013, our gross debt will be \nnearly $12 trillion. Explain that. Explain this. It makes no sense. \nThat is why I am going to vote no.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4399-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECONSTRUCTION AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a comment about another item. \nWe will be, later this week, responding to the President's request for \na supplemental appropriations.\n  Clearly, we need to provide supplemental funding. We will not send \nAmerica's sons and daughters to war and then decide we will not provide \nthe funds necessary. This Congress will and must.\n  One piece, however, of this request by the President is for \nreconstruction assistance in Iraq, and humanitarian assistance. Should \nwe do humanitarian assistance? You bet we should. Absolutely. It ought \nto be a first priority.\n  But reconstruction? Let me make the case that reconstruction in Iraq, \nin my judgment, should be funded from Iraqi resources and Iraqi oil. \nThis is a country rich in resources, endowed with very substantial oil \nreserves.\n  While I will support reconstruction in Iraq, I am one who believes, \nwhen the job in Iraq is finished, the resources and the oil that exists \nin the country of Iraq ought to produce the revenue for the \nreconstruction of Iraq. I intend to make that case in the \nAppropriations Committee later this week and next week here in the \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4399-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COVERAGE OF THE WAR ON TELEVISION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make one final point while I am in \nthe Chamber.\n  I came to talk about this budget and the $12 trillion of debt that \nthis budget document heads us toward. Let me make one final point. I \nwatch the television coverage every morning, as do most Americans, with \nrespect to the war. And my thoughts and prayers are with our soldiers. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with the innocent folks in Iraq. We have no \nquarrel with the Iraqi citizens. This is with Saddam Hussein and his \nregime.\n  It breaks my heart to see casualties on any side. But one of the \nthings that concerns me, in the mornings when I watch this coverage, or \nin the evenings before I retire and I watch this coverage, is there are \na number of retired generals and admirals and others who stand before \nthe cameras, showing us, on the maps, exactly where our troops are \nmoving, exactly what the strategy is, saying: Here is the route to \nBaghdad for this division and that division.\n  I ask myself: I wonder if that is in the interests of the American \nsoldiers fighting in Iraq. I just wonder. Do we need to have retired \nofficers, with pointers, pointing to maps and saying, ``Here is where \nthis division is going; here is where I think it is going to be,'' and \nsome saying, ``I disagree with the current strategy''?\n  I worry a lot about whether the information provided to the other \nside--the information provided to our adversaries from that kind of \nbriefing that goes on on every channel, every network, by retired \nofficers, who know a great deal about battle plans--I wonder whether \nthey should be offering that precise analysis of exactly where troop \nmovements are on television morning, noon, and night.\n  The 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week coverage on this is something I think \nprovides information to the American people--and I think we want \ninformation--but I do not believe anyone wants information disclosed \nduring this 24-7 news cycle in a manner that would in any way alert the \nadversary about what is happening.\n  I worry sometimes, when I see this on television: Is this healthy? Is \nmore information made available, by retired generals and admirals and \nothers who are analyzing troop movements, than really should be made \navailable to our adversaries? I just ask the question. I think it is an \nimportant question to ask. I intend to ask it this morning in the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, where I will return in just a few \nmoments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4399-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4399-S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, has morning business been allocated \nequally to each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent, we have the \nSenator from Virginia to speak next. And I believe the time will be \nequally divided after that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak following the Senator from Virginia. As I understand \nit, the Senator from Virginia is now to be recognized to speak. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to speak following the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will certainly accede to that, but that \nthen we should indicate the Senator from Utah would follow the Senator \nfrom Maryland, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nalso\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nlike to get in this queue. So we make sure, maybe we can specify the \ntimes as well so that we know that we have got enough time before \n11:30.\n  How much time does the Senator from Virginia----\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my distinguished colleague, about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator from Maryland seek?\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time would there be available?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We have until 11:30 in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So there would be 25 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes. Equally divided?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would that be fair for the Senator, if we equally divide \nthe remaining time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Reserving the right to object, I want to accommodate my \nfriend and more senior colleague, but I had understood that the time \nwas equally divided between the two sides; the Republicans would have \n11 to 11:30, and the Democrats from 10:30 to 11. If that were not done, \nI would be more than happy to split the time available, after the \nSenator from Virginia is finished, with the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 \nminutes for the Senator from Virginia, followed by the Senator from \nMaryland for 8 minutes, the Senator from Utah for 8 minutes, and 8 \nminutes for the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, and then the time \nremaining would be accorded to someone on this side of the aisle, \nshould that person appear to seek that recognition?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think that will actually use up all the time, I say to \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. If there is time remaining, then it would return to this \nside.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4400-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4400-S4402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORTING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise this morning with a deep sense of \nhumility to express this Senator's gratitude for the courage and \nbravery being displayed from our President, Commander in Chief, to the \nSecretaries of State and Defense, and to, particularly, General Franks \nand General Abizaid, and those immediately in charge of the operations \nin Iraq, and, most importantly, to the men and women of the Armed \nForces under these commands, and their families.\n  We all start this morning with expressing our deepest condolences to \nthe families and loved ones who have lost members of the Armed Forces. \nThat is the cost of freedom.\n  As we watch unfolding the pictorial representation of these families, \nas they boldly step up to appear on media, all of us cannot but be \nheartened by the courage that the families are showing, and as \nexemplified by the men and women in uniform fighting this battle.\n  I thought to myself, there were roughly 1,300,000 men and women on \nactive duty prior to the commencement of the larger operations in Iraq. \nAnd as the buildup progressed, the President called up roughly \n300,000--somewhat short of that--so for ease of mathematics, about 1.5 \nmillion are now on active service, together with their families. I \nalways mention the families.\n  In that 1.5 million, if you juxtapose it with the total population of \nthis Nation of 290 million, roughly one-half of 1 percent--one-half of \n1 percent--of our population is out there assuming the full risks of \nloss of life and limb to defend freedom and to defend this Nation. That \nshows the magnitude of the depth of gratitude that we have to all those \nwho are engaged in this conflict.\n  We have conducted--and I commend the administration--each morning, at \n9 o'clock, a briefing in S-407. All Senators are invited. We have had \nvery good attendance. We will have, this afternoon, from 5:30 to 6:30, \na briefing with the Secretary of Defense in S-407 again for all \nSenators. But the questions raised there are very good questions. They \nare tough questions.\n  I assure America that the Senate is involved in its oversight \nresponsibilities as a coequal branch in this conflict, in the judgment \nof this Senator. I am proud of the large participation from numbers of \nour Senators--questions about the magnitude of the battle plan; is that \nsufficient?\n  Our colleague from North Dakota just mentioned that there had been a \nlot of criticism. That is part of the freedoms we enjoy. Those who have \nserved honorably in our Armed Forces are coming forth with their \nexpertise. Frankly, I follow it very carefully. I think it has been \nconstructive on the whole. Nevertheless, the Secretary of Defense, here \nin the Vice President's office yesterday afternoon when he met with \nseveral of us, was asked questions on the battle plan. He very firmly \nsaid this battle plan was conceived carefully. It went through the \nJoint Chiefs, not once, not twice, but perhaps a dozen times, and was \nshared with our principal ally, Great Britain, and others. I have total \nconfidence in the manner in which this war is being conducted by our \nmilitary commanders and, indeed, by the Commander in Chief, the \nPresident.\n  The question of the prisoners of war is very much on our minds. It is \nhoped that the Senate will address this issue in the near future. I \nhave been in consultation, as have other Senators, with the \ndistinguished leadership on both sides. It is important that this \ninstitution express its strong sentiment for the care and protection \nand adherence to international law as this conflict ensues.\n  The coalition has been very substantial, over 40 nations. I will ask \nunanimous consent to print in the Record following my remarks a \ncommunication from the distinguished Ambassador to the United States \nfrom Australia, Mr. Michael Thawley, along with the comments of the \nPrime Minister of Australia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Australia has been a vital part of the coalition from the \nbeginning. They have forces in country in Iraq now assisting in many \naspects for the success of this operation.\n  This morning at around 6:30, I watched the Prime Minister of Great \nBritain address Parliament just prior to his departure for the United \nStates to confer with our President today. In the course of that \ndissertation--it is always fascinating for those of us in the Congress \nto watch their freewheeling system--the first question out of the box \nto the Prime Minister: Will you talk to the President, impressing upon \nhim the need to address the conflict in the Middle East, most \nspecifically, the remarks made by the President just recently as to \nreasserting once again the efforts of this President to foster the \npeace process.\n  This brings to mind a thought this Senator has had for some time as \nto one idea--it is just an idea, a concept, a concept that might help \nto bring about some stability in that region--a cessation of some \nhopefully large measure of the conflict so that the talks can get under \nway. It is difficult to see how any constructive talks can take place \nwithout the cessation of the fighting, the human bombing employed by \nthe Palestinians, and the retaliation, that is really necessary but all \ntoo often takes place before the cameras, as a disproportionate use of \nforce in the eyes of the world, by the Israelis, who have been \nafflicted so grievously by these human bombs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter I wrote to \nthe President just a week or so ago, on March 14.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I will now address the contents of the letter.\n\n       Dear Mr. President: I would like to commend you on the step \n     you took today to give new impetus to the Middle East process \n     by announcing that it was time to share with Israel and the \n     Palestinians the road map to peace that the United States has \n     developed with its ``Quartet'' partners. This is a welcome \n     and timely initiative, given the complex way in which the \n     Middle East conflict, Iraq and the global war against \n     terrorism are intertwined.\n\n  I pointed out that I have given basically this same set of remarks in \nconcept on the floor three times. I have\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\naddressed the NATO ambassadors and given this concept. It is one \nbasically that can help to bring about a measure of stability and \ncessation to the fighting; that is, at the invitation of the Government \nof Israel and the Palestinian Authority, particularly now that the new \nPrime Minister has been designated, at that invitation, that NATO be \nasked to look at whether or not they could constitute a peacekeeping \nforce to bring in to work in coordination with the security structures \nof both the people of Israel and the people of Palestine in hopes that \nthe fighting can be brought under control such that the peace talks can \noriginate. That is something I believe in strongly because it has a \ndirect relationship, a threat to not only our forces but the other \nforces throughout the world of the hatred generated among militants in \nthat region, generated by this conflict.\n  To the degree this conflict can be brought under control and peace \ntalks initiated, hopefully there will be a commensurate lessening of \nthe threat to our forces, not only the military but our embassies and \nothers abroad. It is an important step. I commend our President. I hope \nthey will consider this concept as they proceed.\n  The war we are witnessing in Iraq was a last resort to disarm a \nregime that for more than 12 years has defied the international \ncommunity and brutalized its own people. Despicable tactics Iraqis are \nusing on the battlefield and the way in which they are treating some of \nthe POWs are further proof of the willingness of this regime to flout \ninternational law and the laws of human decency. The coalition is \ntaking great efforts to protect innocent civilians and minimize \ncivilian casualties. Humanitarian assistance--food, water, and \nmedicine--is already being delivered. That will increase in the days \nahead hopefully.\n  Once this regime is removed, the Iraqi people can hopefully look \nforward to a measure of the freedom they have not experienced these \nmany years, governed by a rule of law of their own design.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                         Embassy of Australia,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 2003.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I just wanted to thank you very much for your \n     reference in the Senate debate yesterday to the support of \n     Australian armed forces in the current fighting in Iraq. It \n     was greatly appreciated. It is nice to know that our \n     contribution is valued.\n       You might like to see the Prime Minister's comments about \n     the role of our alliance with the United States in the speech \n     he made to the Australian parliament on our commitment. I \n     also attach his address to the nation in which he set out the \n     reasons why the Government had authorized the engagement of \n     Australian forces in military action.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                  Michael Thawley,\n     Ambassador.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Extract From Prime Minister Howard's Statement to the Australian \n                       Parliament, 18, March 2003\n\n       Our alliance with the United States is unapologetically a \n     factor in the decision that we have taken. The crucial, long-\n     term value of the United States alliance should always be a \n     factor in any major national security decision taken by \n     Australia.\n       America has given strong leadership to the world on the \n     issue of Iraq. The Security Council would not have been re-\n     energised, the United Nations would not have been re-\n     energised, had it not been for the action of the United \n     States returning the issue to the United Nations in September \n     of last year. We have supported the American position on this \n     issue because we share their concerns and we share their \n     worries about the future if Iraq is left unattended to. \n     Alliances are two-way processes and, where we are in \n     agreement, we should not leave it to the United States to do \n     all of the heavy lifting just because they are the world's \n     superpower. To do so would undermine one of the most \n     important relationships we have and, in an increasingly \n     globalised and borderless world, the relationship between \n     Australia and the United States will become more rather than \n     less important as the years go by.\n                                  ____\n\n\nTranscript of the Prime Minister, The Hon. John Howard, MP, Address to \n                       the Nation, March 20, 2003\n\n       Good evening: The Government has decided to commit \n     Australian forces to action to disarm Iraq because we believe \n     it is right, it is lawful and it's in Australia's national \n     interest.\n       We are determined to join other countries to deprive Iraq \n     of its weapons of mass destruction, its chemical and \n     biological weapons, which even in minute quantities are \n     capable of causing death and destruction on a mammoth scale.\n       Iraq had been an aggressor in the past against its \n     neighbours and even its own people. If Iraq is allowed to \n     keep these weapons not only might she use them again but \n     moreover other rogue countries will copy Iraq knowing that \n     the world will do nothing to stop them.\n       And the more countries that have these weapons--countries \n     run by despotic regimes--the greater becomes the likelihood \n     that these weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists. If \n     that happens can anyone doubt that the terrorists will use \n     them whatever the cost might be?\n       The attacks on the 11th of September and in Bali showed \n     that international terrorists have no regard for human life \n     no matter what the nationality of their victims may be.\n       Iraq had long supported international terrorism. Saddam \n     Hussein pays $25,000 to each family of Palestinian suicide \n     bombers who wreak such murderous havoc in Israel. He has \n     sheltered and sponsored many terrorist groups.\n       International terrorism knows no borders. We have learnt \n     that to our cost. Australia and Australians anywhere in the \n     world are as much targets as any other western country and \n     its people.\n       Therefore the possession of chemical, biological, or even \n     worse still, nuclear weapons by a terrorist network would be \n     a direct undeniable and lethal threat to Australia and its \n     people.\n       That is the reason above all others why I passionately \n     believe that action must be taken to disarm Iraq. Not only \n     will it take dangerous weapons from that country but it will \n     send a clear signal to other rogue states and terrorists \n     groups like Al Qaeda which clearly want such weapons that the \n     world is prepared to take a stand.\n       There's also another reason and that is our close security \n     alliance with the United States. The Americans have helped us \n     in the past and the United States is very important to \n     Australia's long-term security.\n       It is critical that we maintain the involvement of the \n     United States in our own region where at present there are \n     real concerns about the dangerous behaviour of North Korea.\n       The relationship between our two countries will grow more \n     rather than less important as the years go by.\n       A key element of our close friendship with the United \n     States and indeed with the British is our full and intimate \n     sharing of intelligence material.\n       In the difficult fight against the new menace of \n     international terrorism there is nothing more crucial than \n     timely and accurate intelligence. This is a priceless \n     component of our relationship with our two very close allies.\n       There is nothing comparable to be found in any other \n     relationship--nothing more relevant indeed to the challenges \n     of the contemporary world.\n       I know that some people are saying that what we have done \n     makes it more likely that terrorists will attack Australia.\n       Australia has been a terrorist target at least since the \n     11th of September 2001.\n       Australia is a western country with western values. Nothing \n     will or should change that. That is why we are a target.\n       Remember that bin Laden specifically targeted Australia \n     because of our intervention to save the people of East Timor.\n       Does any Australian seriously suggest that if bin Laden's \n     warning had come before the East Timor action we should have \n     caved in and changed our policy. That will never be the \n     Australian way.\n       We believe that so far from our action in Iraq increasing \n     the terrorist threat it will, by stopping the spread of \n     chemical and biological weapons, make it less likely that a \n     devastating terrorist attack will be carried out against \n     Australia.\n       I want to assure all of you that the action we are taking \n     is fully legal under international law. Back in the early \n     1990s resolutions were passed by the Security Council \n     authorizing military action against Iraq.\n       That action was only suspended on condition that Iraq gave \n     up its weapons of mass destruction. Clearly we all know this \n     has not happened. As a result the authority to take military \n     action under those earlier resolutions has revived.\n       America's critics both here and abroad have been both \n     opportunistic and inconsistent. They know and admit that \n     weapons inspectors only returned to Iraq because of the \n     pressure of the American military build-up. Yet they have \n     persistently criticized American policy.\n       Apparently they believe that a quarter of a million \n     American, British and indeed Australian troops should stay in \n     the desert doing nothing indefinitely. We all know that if \n     the troops had been withdrawn Iraq would have immediately \n     stopped its minimal co-operation with the inspectors.\n       Another point I'd make to you very strongly is that we're \n     not dealing here with a regime of ordinary brutality. There \n     are many dictatorships in the world. But this is a \n     dictatorship of a particularly horrific kind.\n       His is an appalling regime: its torture, its use of rape as \n     an instrument of intimidation, the cruelty to children to \n     extract confessions from parents. It is a terrible catalogue \n     of inflicting human misery on a people who deserve much \n     better.\n       This week, the Times of London detailed the use of a human \n     shredding machine as a\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\n     vehicle for putting to death critics of Saddam Hussein. This \n     is the man, this is the apparatus of terror we are dealing \n     with.\n       The removal of Saddam Hussein will lift this immense burden \n     of terror from the Iraqi people.\n       Our argument is with Saddam Hussein's regime. It is \n     certainly not with Islam.\n       Australians of an Arab background or of the Islamic faith \n     are a treasured part of our community. Over the weeks ahead \n     and beyond we should all extend to them the hand of \n     Australian mateship.\n       To those in the community who may not agree with me, please \n     vent your anger against me and towards the government. \n     Remember that our forces are on duty in the Gulf in our name \n     and doing their job in the best traditions of Australia's \n     defence forces.\n       Can I say something that I know will find an echo from all \n     of you whether or not you agree with the Government. And that \n     is to say to the men and women of the Australian Defence \n     Force in the Gulf--we admire you, we are thinking of you, we \n     want all of you to come back home safe and sound. We care for \n     and we anguish with your loved ones back here in Australia. \n     Our prayers and our hopes are with all of you.\n       We now live in a world made very different by the scourge \n     of international terrorism.\n       This has been a very difficult decision for the Government \n     but a decision which is good for Australia's long term \n     security and the cause of a safer world. Good night.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2003.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I would like to commend you on the step \n     you took today to give new impetus to the Middle East peace \n     process by announcing that it was time to share with Israel \n     and the Palestinians the road map to peace that the United \n     States has developed with its ``Quartet'' partners. This is a \n     welcome and timely initiative, given the complex way in which \n     the Middle East conflict, Iraq and the global war against \n     terrorism are intertwined.\n       The festering hostilities in the Middle East are an \n     enormous human tragedy. Along with you, and many others, I \n     refuse to accept that this is a conflict without end. You \n     have articulated a vision of an Israeli and a Palestinian \n     state living side by side in peace and security. That is a \n     bold initiative that deserves strong international support. \n     With the Israeli elections concluded, and the imminent \n     confirmation of a Palestinian Prime Minister, you are right \n     to refocus international attention on the Middle East peace \n     process.\n       Mr. President, in August 2002, I wrote to you to propose an \n     idea concerning the possibility of offering NATO peacekeepers \n     to help implement a cease-fire in the Middle East. I have \n     spoken of this idea numerous times on the Senate Floor. I am \n     now even more convinced that the United States and its NATO \n     partners should consider an additional element for the ``road \n     map'' concept: NATO should offer, and I stress the word \n     ``offer,'' to provide a peacekeeping force, once a cease-fire \n     has been established by the Israeli Government and the \n     Palestinian authority. This NATO force would serve in support \n     of the cease-fire mechanisms agreed to by Israel and the \n     Palestinian Authority. The NATO offer would have to be \n     willingly accepted by both governments, and it in no way \n     should be viewed as a challenge to either side's sovereignty. \n     The acceptance of this offer would have to be coupled with a \n     commitment by Israel and the Palestinian Authority to \n     cooperate in every way possible to permit the peacekeeping \n     mission to succeed.\n       I fully recognize that this would not be a risk-free \n     operation for the participating NATO forces. But I \n     nonetheless believe that the offer of peacekeepers from NATO \n     would have many benefits. First, it would demonstrate a \n     strong international commitment to peace in the Middle East. \n     Second, it would offer the prospect of a peacekeeping force \n     that is ready today. It is highly capable, rapidly \n     deployable, and has a proven record of success in the \n     Balkans. A NATO peacekeeping force is likely to be acceptable \n     to both parties, given the traditional European sympathy \n     for the Palestinian cause and the traditional United \n     States support of Israel.\n       Third, this would be a worthy post-Cold War mission for \n     NATO in a region where NATO member countries have legitimate \n     national security interests. It could even be an area of \n     possible collaboration with Russia through the NATO-Russia \n     Council. A NATO peacekeeping mission in the Middle East would \n     be wholly consistent with the Alliance's new Strategic \n     Concept. Approved at the NATO Summit in Washington in April \n     1999, the new Strategic Concept envisioned so called ``out-\n     of-area'' operations for NATO.\n       Given the fractious debate in NATO over Iraq and the \n     defense of Turkey, it would be important to show that NATO \n     can work together to make a positive contribution to solving \n     one of the most challenging security issues of our day.\n       There will be many detractors to the idea of sending NATO \n     peacekeepers to the Middle East to help implement a cease-\n     fire. But I think there is a broad agreement on the \n     imperative of giving new hope to the peace process and \n     redoubling diplomatic efforts to keep Israel and the \n     Palestinians moving on the road to peace. Peacekeepers coming \n     from many NATO nations could give new hope and confidence to \n     the peoples of Israel and Palestine that there could soon be \n     an end to the violence that overhangs their daily lives.\n       Mr. President, I hope that you will receive this idea in \n     the constructive spirit in which it is offered,\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      John Warner,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It contains within it \nthousands of decisions with respect to our national life.\n  We really set our national priorities by our budget, making \nfundamental decisions within the budget--how much shall we allot for \nthis spending program, what shall we do on the tax side. In addition, \nthe aggregate budget and the projected deficit can have a profound \neffect upon our overall economy, not only this year but extending well \ninto future years.\n  We are considering this budget in the context, first and foremost, of \nthe military conflict in Iraq and, secondly, in the context of a \ndomestic economy which is clearly sputtering.\n  Last month, we lost over 300,000 private sector jobs. The number of \nlong-term unemployed continues to go up. Now almost 2 million people \nhave been out of work for more than 26 weeks. Consumer confidence is at \na nine-year low.\n  Moreover, our fiscal situation has deteriorated significantly over \nthe course of this administration. In January of 2001, when President \nBush took office, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting a \nbudget surplus over 10 years of $5.6 trillion. In fact, the President \npointed to that projected surplus as a rationale for doing the 2001 tax \ncuts. Now the Congressional Budget Office is projecting a $2.1 trillion \ndeficit over the same period, assuming the President's tax proposals \nare adopted. That is a swing of more than $7.5 trillion in our fiscal \nposition, from a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion to a projected \ndeficit of $2.1 trillion. Despite this severe economic deficit outlook, \nthe fight over this budget resolution has focused primarily on whether \nto encompass within it sufficient room for another very large tax cut \nwhich the President is seeking.\n  It is asserted by the Administration that this is going to be a \ngrowth stimulus package. It is not going to be a growth stimulus \npackage. It is only a flagrant example of discredited trickle-down \neconomics.\n  Instead, this budget is going to drive us deeper into the deficit and \ndebt hole. It is going to leave us with deficits projected out into the \nindefinite future. We are really mortgaging away our future. This is \nbad macroeconomic policy.\n  In addition, within the budget, our urgent national priorities are \nnot being adequately addressed. There is not enough for homeland \ndefense. We have a pressing health care problem in this country, with \nregard to both the uninsured and prescription drug benefits for our \nsenior citizens. We have an affordable housing crisis, in which \nmillions of working families cannot afford even a modest apartment in \nmany high-cost cities. We have the question of supporting our first \nresponders. The mayors across the country are saying they are not \ngetting sufficient support from the Federal level in order to meet \ntheir responsibilities. Instead of providing fully for education so we \nleave no child behind, the proposed tax cuts are designed to leave no \nmillionaire behind.\n  But I want to address a somewhat broader issue dealing with fairness \nand equity. I first want to note that in every previous instance when \nwe went to war, we didn't cut taxes; we raised taxes to help pay for \nthe war and to meet its costs. The President has now submitted a $75 \nbillion supplemental, and it is very clear that that is a downpayment \nonly. No one asserts that is going to cover the full cost of the war \nand the reconstruction. So clearly the $75 billion represents the \ninitial downpayment, and there is more to follow.\n  That further raises the question whether this is the appropriate time \nto commit away significant resources to a tax cut to benefit the \nwealthy. Analysis of the tax cut, which the President\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nis seeking and which his supporters in the Senate are trying to carve \nout room in the budget resolution to accommodate, shows that almost \nhalf of the benefits of the proposed tax cut will go to the top 1 \npercent of the population. Almost three-quarters of it goes to the top \n5 percent of the population. The proposed tax cut is very heavily \nskewed toward those at the very top of the income and wealth scale in \nthis country; this at the very time when the Nation is being rallied, \nas it should be, to support our men and women in the Armed Forces. This \nat the very time when we are talking about sacrifice. And it is \nappropriate that we should talk about sacrifice at a time like this \nbecause one cannot follow the events taking place now in Iraq without \nsome deep appreciation of the sacrifice our fighting men and women are \nmaking and the risks they are taking every minute.\n  What sacrifice are those who are most favored in our society in terms \nof their economic position making at this critical juncture in our \nhistory? Not only are they not making a sacrifice, they are getting a \nvery large tax cut skewed to their benefit which, in turn, will put our \neconomy in a more difficult position into the future. It will build up \ndeficits and debt which the fighting men and women, when they return \nhome, will have to pay off well into the future. They are being called \nupon to make a double sacrifice, now and in the future.\n  What is the sacrifice here at home that the beneficiaries of this tax \ncut will be making? Winston Churchill, at the beginning of World War \nII, when he became Prime Minister, told his nation, ``I have nothing to \noffer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.''\n  Our young men and women positioned in the Middle East are called upon \nto sacrifice even as we debate this budget resolution. There will be \nsweat. There will be tears. There will be toil. And there will be \nblood. What sacrifice will be made by those who are the most well off \nin our society? At a time when we face these critical challenges, \nshould they not be making a contribution instead of reaping a large \neconomic benefit?\n  Mr. President, I urge the defeat of this budget resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have heard on this floor and in the \npopular media that the main reason we are at war is because ``diplomacy \nhas failed,'' and there are those who have attacked the President for \nhis ``failure'' in diplomacy. We also hear that polls are running \nheavily against the war.\n  My mind goes back to a somewhat similar situation in Great Britain \nwhen Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich and said, ``We have \nestablished peace in our time.'' He referred to the Czechs, whose \ncountry he gave to Adolf Hitler in this fashion:\n\n       Why should we consider people who live in a land far away \n     and with whom we have little or nothing to do?\n\n  Winston Churchill opposed the treaty that Neville Chamberlain brought \nhome from Munich. He offered stirring rhetoric, saying, ``We have \nsuffered a defeat of the first magnitude.'' That stirred my soul as a \nyoung schoolchild reading about it. What I didn't realize until I \nbecame an adult is that Winston Churchill got only three votes, as \nParliament overwhelmingly endorsed Chamberlain. And the popular polls, \nas I say, made Chamberlain the most popular politician in Great \nBritain, and maybe in all of Europe. Of course, within 2 years, we \nfound that Winston Churchill was right and Chamberlain went off to \nhistorical disgrace.\n  The Munich example is not exactly analogous to this situation. No \nhistorical situation is exactly analogous to a current circumstance, \nbut it is one we should keep in mind as we hear rhetoric saying that \ndiplomacy has failed. Diplomacy in Munich is what failed and the war \nfollowed.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has a resolution she wishes to offer \nwith respect to the current British Prime Minister.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair for this opportunity \nthis morning to bring to my colleagues' attention where we stand with \nrespect to the budget resolution that we will be completing today.\n  A very important report came out late yesterday from the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan, which is in charge \nof estimating the effects of what we do here. I might add, while the \nCBO is nonpartisan, because the Republicans control the House and the \nSenate, they were able to choose the new CBO Director. One of the tests \nthey had was the use of so-called dynamic scoring. The gentleman who \nnow heads CBO is committed to dynamic scoring, and he has now released \nan analysis of the budget before us based on dynamic scoring. His \nconclusion is exactly what I have been reporting to my colleagues day \nafter day on the floor: Tax cuts will make the deficit soar.\n  I hope we can put this old canard to rest once and for all that \nsomehow you can tax cut your way to prosperity when at the same time \nyou are increasing spending. When you start from a base of record \nbudget deficits, there can only be one result. When you start with \nrecord budget deficits and then cut your revenue stream, as the \nPresident has proposed, by nearly $2 trillion and increase spending, \nthe deficits and the debt are going to get bigger. The Congressional \nBudget Office is telling us that is exactly what we face.\n  There was another article in the Washington Post on this same story. \nThey point out:\n\n       The CBO report also said the president's tax and spending \n     proposals ``imply a deficit in every year over the next \n     decade,'' thus adding to the national debt and to the annual \n     interest payments on that debt beyond 2013.\n       ``For some time, that added need could be met by running \n     higher deficits. However, the federal government could not \n     follow such an approach indefinitely. At some point in the \n     future under the president's proposals, either taxes would \n     have to be higher than they otherwise would have been, or \n     spending would have to be lower,'' the report said.\n\n  It is time we sober up around here. I do not know what happened to \nour friends on the other side who used to be fiscal conservatives, who \nused to believe in balanced budgets and now endorse tax cuts that are \ngoing to plunge us into deep deficit and debt.\n  This is the analysis again from the Congressional Budget Office of \nwhat the plan before us will do. This is the President's budget plan: a \ndeficit next year of $512 billion. That does not count the war costs. \nAdd in the $75 billion the President wants for the war, and the deficit \nnext year will be $587 billion. Does anybody have sticker shock around \nhere yet? That is getting close to being twice as big as the previous \nrecord deficit.\n  The analysis shows we will not be out of deficit any year for the \nnext 10 years. But that is not the most sobering effect. None of the \ndeficits will be less than $400 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one quick \nquestion?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to be very clear. The Senator is saying the \nbudget deficit for the next year will be close to $600 billion, more \nthan double the highest deficit we have ever run previously; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly what we are being told by the \nCongressional Budget Office. We now face, if we adopt the President's \nplans for massive tax cuts on top of the spending increases for defense \nand homeland security, which we all endorse--we endorse the increased \nfunds for defense and homeland security--that we are going to have \nbudget deficits as far as the eye can see, and they are not going to be \nsmall deficits. They are going to be massive deficits.\n\n  This chart shows that, in fact, we are in the sweet spot now. This is \nnot my\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nchart. This comes from the President's own document. It shows in the \nperiod we are in now that the deficits, although they are record \nlevels, are going to get much bigger. As we approach the retirement of \nthe baby boom generation and as we approach the full phasing in of the \nPresident's proposed tax cuts, at the very time the cost of the Federal \nGovernment explodes, the retirement of the baby boom generation, the \ncost of the President's tax cuts explode, sending us right off the \ncliff into deficits and debt that are totally unsustainable.\n  The other day one of our colleagues on the other side said Democrats \nwere proposing spending that he suggested was just out of control. This \nchart shows the Democratic alternative we offered. This is a comparison \nof spending with the Republican plan, which is the green line, 18.8 \npercent of GDP; the blue line is our spending, 19.3 percent. One of the \nbig reasons there is a difference is because we put the money in to pay \nfor the war. We put the money in to pay for increased homeland \nsecurity. So certainly we have more spending. We have more spending \nbecause we have responded to the President's call to put the spending \nin for the war. Our friends on the other side did not.\n  Let me go to the next chart quickly. He also showed what he called \nthe Democrat spend-o-meter. We can look at the Republican debt-o-meter \nbecause what they are doing is running up the debt.\n  When the President took office, he told us that by 2008, there would \nonly be $36 billion of debt left. In his 2002 budget, he said--\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me complete this thought first, and then I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  He had the debt run up to $1.2 trillion after adopting his plans; in \nAugust of 2001, $1.6 trillion. In February of 2002, with the \nPresident's 2003 budget, the debt is up to $3.2 trillion. And if we \nadopt his budget for 2004, the debt by 2008 will be $5 trillion.\n  I conclude by saying when we proposed additional spending to fund the \nwar, to fund homeland security, and to improve education, we did it in \na controlled way, every bit of it paid for, but we added deficit \nreduction so that we would have less deficit, less debt, a stronger \neconomy, and more opportunity for the American people.\n  When I see in the newspapers the President in his plan is down to \n$350 billion of tax cuts, oh, no, they are only looking at half the \nproposal. Right now the budget resolution that is before us has $852 \nbillion in tax cuts, not the $350 billion that has been widely \nreported. When they are talking about the $350 billion, they are \ntalking about the reconciled tax cuts, those that will be given special \nconsideration which cannot be filibustered. So the total tax cuts in \nthis plan are $852 billion.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Maryland for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the ranking member of the Budget Committee, with \nthese record deficits and this incredible buildup of debt which would \nflow out of the administration's policy, who is going to carry the \nburden of that debt? Will not the same men and women who are now \nfighting out in the Middle East, when they come home, have that debt \nsettle upon them? And in the meantime, very big tax cuts are being \ngiven to very wealthy people. What sacrifice are the people who have \nbeen most favored in our society economically making in order to meet \nthis economic crisis? There is no sacrifice on their part.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the brave men \nand women who are serving our country in both Iraq and Afghanistan, \nthree individuals in particular. First, I will speak briefly about SP \nJoseph Hudson. He is a 1998 graduate of Alamogordo High School in my \nState. He is a member of the 507th Maintenance Company out of Fort \nBliss, TX, who was captured this past Sunday. His image was seen on a \nvideotape by his wife and high school sweetheart, Natalie, and young \ndaughter Cameron, and his mother Anecita, also of Alamogordo, as well \nas everyone around the world watching the television coverage of this \nwar. Like them, we wait anxiously for any word about his well-being, \nand pray for his safe return.\n\n  While our attention is focused on the fierce conflict in Iraq, it is \nimportant to remember that there are also young men and women putting \ntheir lives on the line every day in the conflict in Afghanistan as \nwell. Many of us in New Mexico got a terrible reminder of that on \nSunday, when two young people with strong ties to New Mexico were \nkilled attempting to help two Afghan children.\n  Air Force 1LT Tamara Long Archuleta was the copilot of the helicopter \nthat crashed while on a rescue mission, killing all six aboard. Tammy \nwas from Adelino, near Belen, NM, and her life was a shining example of \nthe power of discipline, drive, and determination. Tammy was \nvaledictorian of her class and a world karate champion. She graduated \nfrom the University of New Mexico with honors, and while there became \ninvolved with Air Force ROTC. She had wanted to become a fighter pilot, \nbut instead decided to do rescue work. Her grandfather was a Navy pilot \nand her uncle a pararescue man, and Tammy had been strongly influenced \nby her family's dedication to service.\n  Tammy had a 3-year-old son and was to marry a fellow Air Force pilot \nsoon. Sadly, she was scheduled to return home in a mere 2 weeks. Words \ncannot express the grief many New Mexicans are feeling about the loss \nof this extraordinary young woman.\n  I would also add that New Mexico was twice touched by this tragedy, \nthe loss of this helicopter. Another young man killed in the crash, SSG \nJason Hicks, met his future wife, Cristy Nolan of Rio Rancho, NM, when \nhe was in training at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. We honor \nhis memory as well as Tamara's.\n  We hope this is the end of the casualties and problems we see for the \nyoung men and women of our State.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4404-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4404-S4405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IMMINENT DANGER PAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is the nature of our debate on the \nbudget resolution that there is a very limited amount of time available \nto discuss amendments which we will be offering. I am taking this \nopportunity this morning to describe to my colleagues and those \nfollowing the debate an amendment which I plan to offer this morning to \nthe budget resolution.\n  All of us are transfixed by images that come over the television, as \nwe listen to the radio, and as we read the newspaper about the war in \nIraq. We are reminded on a minute-by-minute basis of the heroism, \nbravery, and determination of our Armed Forces.\n  Last week, there was a resolution commending the Armed Forces for \ntheir efforts, as well as standing, by the President as Commander in \nChief as he leads these forces into battle. That resolution was enacted \nby a vote of 99 to 0, with all Senators present voting in favor of it--\nall Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. It is an indication of \nthe solidarity in this Chamber behind the men and women in uniform.\n  The amendment which I will offer during the course of the budget \nresolution debate today will be further evidence of our solidarity \nbehind the men and women in uniform. My colleagues may be surprised to \nlearn that those who are serving in the military in Iraq are eligible \nfor what is known as imminent danger pay, combat pay. It is one of \nthose rare moments in military life when we know these men and women \nput their lives on the line and we give them a bonus, an imminent \ndanger pay bonus, above their ordinary compensation. One might ask \nthemselves, well, how much is combat pay for those who are serving? \nCombat pay today is $150 a month, $5 a day. Combat pay to our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guard is less than the minimum wage \nfor one hour in America for each day they are in battle in harm's way. \nThat was last changed in 1991, when it was raised to $150.\n  The amendment I will propose, the imminent danger pay increase \namendment, will raise the monthly amount to $500 a month. Make no \nmistake,\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\nthere is no compensation in dollar amounts we can give these men and \nwomen for their heroism and sacrifice, but I think it is important that \nwe step forward with this increase so that combat pay is $500 a month.\n  There is a second part to the amendment. We also say when we activate \nsomeone into a war theater that we help their family at home. That is \nknown as family separation allowance. How much do we give the family of \nthese service men and women back home during the period of time their \nloved ones are in combat? The family separation allowance is $100 a \nmonth. I met with some of those families at the Rock Island Arsenal in \nmy State last Saturday. They are facing extraordinary challenges for \nchild care, for the expenses of their families they had not \nanticipated. We should do better for them. I am suggesting as part of \nmy amendment that $500 should be the monthly compensation for the \nfamily separation allowance. That is the nature of my amendment.\n\n  I ask all my colleagues in the Senate who stood shoulder to shoulder, \n99 to nothing behind the men and women in uniform, to do the same now \nwhen we raise combat pay to $500 a month and the family separation \nallowance to $500 a month as well. That will be a clear demonstration \nthat our commitment to these troops goes beyond words and goes to the \nbudget, so we can provide them and their families the resources they \nneed to not only come home safely but without the hardships that would \nbe part of this service if we did not do our part to help them.\n  I hope my colleagues on a bipartisan basis will join as we did on the \nresolution.\n  I might add, there are some procedural hurdles being thrown in my \npath. People are saying the procedures may not allow you to offer this \namendment. I beg my colleagues on both sides, as our men and women in \nuniform cannot hide in the deserts of Iraq, we should not hide on the \nfloor of the Senate behind procedural niceties when it comes to fair \ncompensation for our men and women in uniform and their families \nwaiting dutifully at home.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider their opposition to this \namendment. This is the right thing to do, and we should do it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4405-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE GUARD AND RESERVE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, in just a few moments as we get underway \nto debate a series of amendments to the budget bill, I am going to be \noffering an amendment. Under the rules, I will have just a minute to \nspeak on it, so I thought I would take this time while we are getting \norganized to describe a little more detail about the Landrieu amendment \nregarding the Guard and Reserve.\n  There have been any number of articles--I see the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee here, and he is well aware of this--there have \nbeen any number of articles written as of late about the tremendous \nweight the National Guard and Reserve are carrying in our current war \nagainst terror, whether it be the campaign underway in Iraq, the \nsupporting of a civilian government in Afghanistan, the carrying out of \nour missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, or guarding the homefront right \nhere; whether it is in New Orleans or Baton Rouge or sites in Maryland \nor Virginia or your home State, Mr. President, or overseas.\n  The Guard and Reserve are doing a magnificent job. These are men and \nwomen who maybe served part of their time in the military for a few \nyears and then, because of other family commitments or other calls on \ntheir talents, went into the private sector. Some of them started their \nown businesses. They come from a wide range of backgrounds. You \nyourself, Mr. President, served in the National Guard and Reserve. \nThere are several Members of Congress who have not only carried out \ntheir job here, serving as Member of Congress, but also serve in this \ncapacity.\n  You are to be commended. I know you have spoken out, Mr. President, \non many instances about the problems that are arising in the sense that \nwe are calling on the National Guard and Reserve over and over again. \nTheir deployments are longer and our compensation to them, our benefit \npackage to them, the way we supply them equipment, in my opinion--and \nan opinion that I think you share and is shared on both the Republican \nand Democratic sides--is not supportive to the degree that they, \nbasically, are supporting us. I guess I could put it that way.\n  We ask these men and women to go for longer deployments, more \nfrequent deployments, and not only put their life on the line but their \nlivelihood on the line. We need to keep up our commitment on the \nbenefit compensation end, on the financing side. In a moment--I know I \nonly have a minute or so--whenever the leadership feels it appropriate \nfor my amendment to be taken up, I am going to suggest we make a very \nmodest change in the budget submitted to us by the President. Of \ncourse, there are parts of that budget I support. There are some parts \nthat I think could be improved. That is what the amendment process is \nall about.\n  This is one of those areas that I think can be improved, to take $10 \nbillion out of the tax cut portion that is not the stimulative part but \nthe unreconciled portion of the tax cut, and add basically $1 billion a \nyear over 10 years to provide critically needed equipment for our Guard \nand Reserve units.\n  There are two units now that are being forward deployed to Iraq that, \nunder the President's budget as submitted--and I believe one unit is \nfrom Georgia and one unit, I say to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, is from Virginia--those units will be decommissioned. There \nis not even enough money in the current budget we are debating to keep \nthose units fighting and forward.\n  That is what my amendment attempts to do. It adds money. I would like \nto get more, but we are trying to be reasonable in this request because \nthe Guard is really carrying a tremendous weight. They are happy to do \nit. They are proud to serve. They are not whining and complaining. But \nwe should be supporting them. I think that is what we should be about \ntoday.\n  I thank you for letting me explain the Landrieu amendment. At the \nappropriate time, it will come up in the list of amendments. But now, \nmore than ever, we are depending on them.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 23, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 23) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2004 and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal year 2003 and for fiscal years 2005 through \n     2013.\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the managers of the bill are working with \nSenators Durbin and Landrieu to try to get something resolved there.\n  We know Senator Warner wants to speak. He should be given whatever \ntime he needs to respond to the Senator from Louisiana. But I would \nindicate that as soon as we get this resolved, and Senator Warner has a \nchance to talk, rather than going directly to the Landrieu amendment, I \nthink we should go to Dayton and get that out of the way.\n  In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nVirginia be recognized to speak for up to 6 minutes to speak on the \nLandrieu amendment, which will be offered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished colleague from\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\nLouisiana for bringing to the attention of the Senate the need for \ngreater attention to the Guard and Reserve forces. It has been \nabsolutely magnificent how they have been, in many instances, abruptly \ncalled from their families and their jobs and within days they are side \nby side with an active force member performing duties with commensurate \nskills and commensurate risks.\n  That is the concept of the total force. It has been in place for some \ntime. But, today, in this situation involving Iraq, we have seen the \nmagnificence of how this total force concept is working.\n  The Senator is correct; there are needs to increase the equipment, \npay in benefits. But the amendment, as written, only goes to equipment. \nBut I am glad you mentioned pay in benefits because the Armed Services \nCommittee will be taking this up, first, in the context of the \nsupplemental, where there will be some provisions therein to provide \nfor the needs the Senator points out, and, secondly, in the annual \nreview of the 2004 Presidential budget we will make corrections.\n  But as the Senator knows, having served with great distinction on the \nArmed Services Committee for several years--and you are always welcome \nback, I say to the Senator--there is a fine balance between allocating \nthe funds between the active and Reserve and Guard forces. And with all \ndue respect to our distinguished colleague, I do not believe this \napproach you suggest at this time enables us to do the fine balance \nthat we must do, first in the supplemental, and then subsequently in \nthe 2004 review.\n  The distinguished Senator from Georgia is our chairman of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee; he will have a good deal to say about this as \nour committee reviews both. So I yield such time as I have remaining to \nmy colleague from Georgia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman very much for \nyielding time.\n  To the Senator from Louisiana, let me say, I do not think there is \nanybody in this body who disagrees with you with respect to our need to \nlook at some sort of modernization package--that is the way I refer to \nit--for our Guard and Reserve.\n  I think when the Guard and Reserve were created decades ago, nobody \never anticipated they would be called to active duty as many times as \nthey have been called over the last 10 years. We do need a \nmodernization package.\n  Now, the Senator from Louisiana has this amendment which applies to \nincreasing hardware purchases for our Guard and Reserve. That is great. \nWe need that, certainly. But there are some additional things I think \nwe need to do immediately.\n  We are not going to send anybody into harm's way--Active-Duty, Guard, \nor Reserve--who is not properly equipped. But we have families of those \nguardsmen and reservists who are at home now who need to be taken care \nof.\n  For the Senator's information, I will tell you, we have a series of \nbills, some of which I think will reach the floor at the end of this \nweek, in which we are going to be dealing with benefits, both from the \nstandpoint of pay and additional benefits, such as commissary use, and \nany number of other benefits for the families of those individuals.\n  Over the next several weeks, we are going to have, through the normal \nprocess, an additional benefits package, that is a modernization \npackage, where we look at health care benefits, and where we look at \nlong-term retirement benefits for our Guard and Reserve. Because, in my \nhome State, we now have the 116th Guard Wing, the Air Control Wings at \nRobbins Air Force Base, where the Guard has been blended into the \nactive force.\n  Our Guard folks, today, as we sit here and speak, are flying the \nJoint Stars Airplane weapon system in Iraq. It is critically important \nthat we continue to look after our Guard and Reserve. And I think there \nis an ongoing series of packages that are going to be coming forward \nthat are more necessary at the present time than what the Senator from \nLouisiana is asking for here.\n  But I look forward to working with the Senator to try to do that long \nterm.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia has 1\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I thank my colleague from Georgia.\n  I say to our colleagues from Louisiana and Georgia, those Guard and \nReserve that are now reporting for duty and are integrating with our \nactive forces are, by and large, using that equipment which is in the \nregular force structure, the equipment which they use having been left \nat home at their various training centers in the several States. So at \nthis time I believe the equipment to which you refer is that which will \nbe kept in the respective States for the purpose of training.\n  So I wish to point out that our Guard and Reserve do have the best of \nequipment. It is available; namely, that of our active forces today.\n  Will the Senator not concur?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Without question. Nobody is going to be sent into \nharm's way without being properly equipped.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will leave it to the managers.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-five seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will take those 25 seconds, if I could.\n  Mr. President, I thank the leadership for this discussion. I think it \nhas been helpful. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nfashion a remedy. But at the appropriate time, I will insist on a vote \non this amendment because in order for us to put a budget together, we \nhave to have some money reserved for all of these changes that we are \ntalking about.\n  I hope, over the course of the day, we can come to some resolution so \nthat the Guard and Reserve can depend on something in this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, for \nthe purpose of offering an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 409\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 409.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 409.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide full and mandatory funding for IDEA beginning in \n                                FY 2004)\n\n     SEC. 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds that: Twenty-eight years ago, the Federal \n     Government promised to pay for 40 percent of the additional \n     cost of special education. Presently, the Federal share is \n     only 17.6 percent. The Nation's school districts cannot \n     afford such a large unfunded mandate. Thus, it is imperative \n     that Congress increase IDEA funding to the long-promised 40 \n     percent share.\n\n     SEC. 2.\n\n       On page 3 line 10, increase the amount by $792,000,000.\n

Madam President, this amendment increases spending for \nAmerica's schoolchildren and reduces the tax cut for millionaires. That \nshould not be controversial. It finally fulfills the promise Congress \nmade 28 years ago that we would pay for 40 percent of special education \ncosts and would do so starting in fiscal year 2004.\n  The President deserves great credit for proposing, and Congress for \npassing, increased special education funding. We have raised the \nFederal share to 17 percent nationwide, but that is still less than \nhalf of what we promised. It is good, but it is not enough.\n  We have increased spending for defense and homeland security in the \nlast couple years, and when that wasn't enough, we increased it more. \nWe responded to urgent needs. For once, let's meet an urgent need that \nisn't military. Last year's increase for special education was only 2 \npercent of that for the Department of Defense. We can afford to do \nmore.\n  The need is so urgent that surely we can postpone half of the tax cut \ngoing to the richest Americans. The President's proposal would give \npeople whose annual incomes exceed $1 million tax cuts averaging \n$85,000 every year. That is in addition to the $45,000 they are already \ngetting each year from the 2001 tax bill.\n  So who comes first, schoolchildren or millionaires? Yes, it is a vote \nfor our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. We \nseem to have had an intermission on the issue of spending, but the \ncurtain has risen again. This amendment sets a new standard, quite \nhonestly.\n  We increased IDEA spending by 24 percent in this bill in 1 year, and \n380 percent since 1996. What this amendment would do is increase IDEA \nspending by 250 percent in 1 year, $229 billion over 10 years. In fact, \nthe way the amendment is drafted, the Federal Government would now be \npaying not 40 percent of the cost of IDEA; it is on\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\na glidepath--under the amendments that were already accepted, the \nFederal Government would be paying 60 percent of the cost of IDEA, \nwhich is 20 percent over what we committed to as a government. Now, \nthat is absurd.\n  At some point, this spending simply has to be brought under control. \nAt some point, we have to recognize that what is happening here is not \nan attempt to have fiscal responsibility or proper budgeting but simply \nto put forward a show.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, for the information of our colleagues, \nwe are making progress a little slower today than we would like. But \nyesterday we had 23 rollcall votes. We had 13 voice votes. So we \ndisposed of a lot of amendments, a lot of resolutions yesterday. We \nonly have a few remaining for today.\n  I thank a couple of my colleagues, particularly Senator Warner, \nSenator Durbin, and Senator Landrieu, because they have been able to \nwork out a couple of amendments, probably saving us two or three \nrollcall votes. So I appreciate their cooperation. Shortly we will be \naccepting a couple of other amendments that I believe will be offered \nby the Senator from California and the Senator from Michigan. So we are \nmaking progress and we will make our 4 o'clock final vote. I just \nwanted to mention that to our colleagues.\n  We will shortly be voting on the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, dealing with AIDS.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Biden was necessarily absent on \nthe last vote as a result of attending a funeral. I want the Record to \nreflect that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                             Change Of Vote\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, on rollcall vote No. 94, amendment 413, \nI voted yea. It was my intention to vote nay. I ask unanimous consent I \nbe permitted to change my vote, since it will not affect the outcome of \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 383, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I now yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, for the purpose of presenting an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 383. I ask \nunanimous consent to modify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order, please.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 383 having to do \nwith afterschool activities and ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment, deleting finding No. 5 in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 383) as modified, is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure that the number of children in after-school \n                      programs does not decrease)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __ . FUNDING FOR AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Studies show that organized extracurricular activities, \n     such as after-school programs, reduce crime, drug use, and \n     teenage pregnancy.\n       (2) According to the FBI, youth are most at risk for \n     committing violent acts and being victims of violent crimes \n     between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.--after school is out and before \n     parents arrive home.\n       (3) There remains a great need for after-school programs. \n     The Census Bureau reported that at least 8 to 15 million \n     children have no place to go after school is out.\n       (4) Current funding for after-school programs provide \n     almost 1.4 million children across the country a safe and \n     enriching place to go after school instead of being home \n     alone.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that funding for \n     21st Century Community Learning Centers is at least enough to \n     ensure the number of children participating in after-school \n     programs does not decrease.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \nagreeing to this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I will be very brief in \nexplaining it.\n  The budget before us assumes a cut of 40 percent in afterschool \nprograms. This is a program that both sides of the aisle have been very \ninvolved in crafting, watching the number of children grow in the \nprogram.\n  We know from the FBI the greatest number of juvenile crimes occur \nafter school. We also know mentoring is working in these afterschool \nprograms. We do not want to see 570,000 kids kicked out of the valuable \nprogram, so this sense of the Senate simply is actually a plea that it \nnot occur, and at the minimum we provide afterschool slots for the \ncurrent number of children who are in those programs right now, 1.4 \nmillion children.\n  I ask at this time the amendment be unanimously agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I thank our colleague from California. \nWe have no objection to her sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for a vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 383), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, to address amendment No. 281.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 281\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I call up amendment No. 281.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Daschle, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 281.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Kohl, Lautenberg,\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\nDaschle, and Boxer be added as cosponsors and the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, March 19, 2003, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KERRY. As all of us know, there are 42 million people living with \nAIDS worldwide. The Senate has addressed this issue previously, but the \namount of money annually allocated falls short of the promises almost \nevery single year. We have been working in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee to develop bipartisan legislation. What I ask our colleagues \nto do today is to provide the amount of money that we will authorize in \nthat legislation, in order to combat the AIDS epidemic. It simply \nincreases the funding level included in the budget resolution to match \nthe spending levels that will be in the authorization bill by $800 \nmillion.\n  In addition, I tell all my colleagues, this is completely in line \nwith the legislation Senator Frist and I wrote and put together and \nthat the Senate passed last year. So it is not a change; it is what we \ndid before, but it meets the promise of the Senate and does not fall \nshort. It also dedicates $800 million for deficit reduction.\n  I ask my colleagues to help us fulfill a promise that has been too \nlong in coming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we adopted an amendment yesterday, \noffered by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Lugar, to restore spending to international affairs \nprograms next year by over $1.1 billion, from the committee's level. \nThe bipartisan Lugar-Biden level would fund the President's proposal \nnext year for global AIDS prevention. The resolution now accommodates \n$15 billion in spending over the next 5 years for those countries \nhardest hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This is the largest commitment \nmade by any country in the world to address this specific problem.\n  This administration is taking a very bold step, which we support, to \ncombat HIV/AIDS. I therefore rise in opposition to the Kerry amendment \nwhich would increase by nearly 80 percent the amount of money provided \nby this function of the budget. It would also increase taxes by nearly \n$1.6 billion, further undermining the growth package now assumed in the \nresolution.\n  I have been working with Senator Lugar and others on this important \nissue and will devote my full resources to the effort to combat the \nscourge of HIV/AIDS.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added to \nthe amendment as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 281. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent this vote be limited to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. Reid: I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller), is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), is \nattending a family funeral.\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 104 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Biden\n     Miller\n       \n  The amendment (No. 281) was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 403\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 403, offered by \nour colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 403.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Friday, March 21, 2003, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this is something we are all familiar \nwith, except perhaps new Members. Back in the fifties, we had a program \nto replace some of the money that was taken away when land was taken \noff the tax rolls. It is called impact aid.\n  Over the years, people started taking money out of this program. It \nis an easy place to grab money. It has gotten down to 40 percent \nfunding. We are now up to 70 percent. The current legislation would \nleave it at 70 percent. This amendment will increase it by $112 \nbillion, bringing it up to $1.3 billion, 76 percent. That keeps us on \ntrack to have it fully funded 5 more years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, maybe my ears deceived me. I heard the \nSenator say $112 billion. My reading on the amendment is $112 million.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is what I said.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I heard the Senator say $112 billion.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We are used to using the B's around here. It is $112 \nmillion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. My further understanding is this is\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nfunded by an across-the-board cut in all other functions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So there are no new discretionary funds available through \nthis amendment. With that understanding, there is no objection on this \nside to the Senator's amendment. He is quite correct that impact aid is \nunderfunded, and it is important to virtually all our States and all \nour communities.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that. I ask for the adoption of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I encourage our colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 403) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I believe the Senator from Alaska has \nan amendment to send to the desk.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, we have been negotiating for some time, \ntrying to resolve two or three amendments. I think we have done that.\n  I thank Senator Warner, Senator Chambliss, Senator Durbin, and \nSenator Landrieu because I think they have cooperated. They came up \nwith amendments I think all of us can be supportive of.\n  I ask on this amendment, and this amendment alone, there be 4 minutes \nequally divided so all the principal players can have a moment to speak \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 429\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Warner, and Senator Chambliss, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Chambliss, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 429.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: Provide additional pay and benefits for active duty, guard, \n and reserve forces, such as augmenting Imminent Danger Pay and Family \nSeparation Allowance, and for modernization of equipment, weapons, and \n technology needs of the National Guard and Reserves in recognition of \n those currently involved in conflict operations and the need of their \n                      family members left behind)\n\n       On page 8, line 23, increase the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 8, line 24, increase the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 20, increase the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 21, increase the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $3,000,000,000.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStabenow and Senator Lincoln be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank my colleagues and particularly \nSenator Durbin for his work in working out this amendment. It is for \nthe Guard and Reserve units that have been called up.\n  This amendment is crucial. It is important that we adopt it for a \nnumber of reasons. No. 1, from 1945 to 1990, a period of 45 years, our \nGuard and Reserve units were called up four times. In the last 13 years \nthey have been called up eight times. They represent a growing and \nnecessary component of our force protection for our Nation, both abroad \nand at home.\n  Unfortunately, our commitment to their budget has not kept up with \nthe contributions they are making. This amendment attempts to begin to \nfill that gap.\n  I submit for the Record, because this is a $1 billion amendment, a \nlist of equipment needs that could be provided by this amendment. I \nsuggest the $1 billion could be for this or something comparable to it. \nI ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  STRATEGIC EQUIPMENT, WEAPONS, AND TECHNOLOGY NEEDS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Service                                      System                                                      Cost\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAir Force Reserve.................

This amendment is supporting the Guard and Reserve for \nequipment, as well as for pay and compensation, and Senator Durbin will \nexplain the second part of this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my cosponsors, Senators \nMikulski, Dayton, Boxer, Schumer, Clinton, and Feingold.\n  What we are seeking to do here is to raise combat pay, the imminent \ndanger pay for those who are serving overseas. It will be raised from \n$150 a month to at least $250 a month, and to increase the family \nseparation allowance from currently $100 a month to at least $250 a \nmonth.\n  Senator Warner was generous enough to talk about $3 billion here, \nwhich will accommodate the needs for the Guard and Reserve that Senator \nLandrieu has raised and also bring the combat pay and separation \nallowance figures up to where they should be. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished managers of the bill and our \ntwo colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think this is an \namendment each Senator not only can but should vote for. I hope we get \n100 votes because it is a consensus across the aisle about the imminent \nneeds of the men and women of the Armed Forces, indeed the Guard and \nReserve which in historic numbers have rallied to the call to serve \nside by side with the Active Force in the conflict, not only in Iraq \nbut also elsewhere in the world.\n  I strongly support it and yield the remainder of my time to my \ncolleague from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I, too, thank my colleagues, Senators \nWarner, Landrieu, and Durbin for their strong leadership on this issue. \nWe now have a significant number of Guard and Reserve personnel who are \nin harm's way, protecting freedom and democracy. It is only right that \nwe address some shortfalls in the way in which these folks are \ncompensated.\n  In addition to that, we have provided within this budget number for \nthe ability of the authorizing committees to come back and purchase \nneeded equipment from a hardware perspective, as well as to look after \nthe families of our brave guardsmen and reservists.\n  I think this is a good amendment. I echo what Senator Warner said. I \nhope we get 100 votes so we can send the right message to all our Guard \nand Reserve and Active duty personnel that we are concerned about them \nand we want to make sure we treat them fairly and equitably. This does \nso.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Kennedy as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 430\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 430.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         On page 45, line 24, increase the amount by \n     $47,904,000,000.\n         On page 46, line 1, increase the amount by \n     $18,768,000,000.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator withhold for a moment.\n  I think it would be wise for us to get in place an agreement on the \namendment that would either be in the second degree or be side by side \nat this moment so that that is prepared at the end of the presentation \nof the Senator\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\nfrom Alaska. Otherwise, the second-degree amendment would be offered. I \nthink it would be better if we did not do it that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \ndisposition of the Murkowski amendment, Senator Conrad or his designee \nbe allowed to introduce a sense of the Senate relative to the Murkowski \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, the current budget resolution assumes \nthe growth package will immediately raise the $600 child tax credit to \n$1,000. My amendment is going to require that the growth package extend \nthat $1,000 child credit until the year 2013. The child credit is \ncurrently $600, and it is scheduled to go up to $1,000 in 2010. The \nproblem we have with this, however, is that in the year 2011, you are \ngoing to have a child credit of $1,000. But the following year, that is \ngoing to drop in half to $500. In other words, families with two \nchildren will face a $1,000 tax increase in the year 2011. A family of \nthree is going to face a tax increase of $1,500. I don't think any of \nus would suggest that is fair. This is to help the families, \nparticularly in times when we have some economic difficulties. This is \nan amendment that will help America's families.\n  I urge Members' support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me just say to my colleagues, the \namendment of the Senator from Alaska has nothing to do with the child \ntax credit--zero. The amendment increases the tax cut by $47.9 billion \nand increases the instruction to the Finance Committee for outlays of \n$18.8 billion. It has nothing whatever to do with the child tax credit \nbecause the budget resolution does not make those decisions, as the \nchairman has indicated over and over.\n  There will be a subsequent amendment by the Senator from Arkansas \nthat will make clear there is plenty of room in the underlying tax cut \nto accommodate the child tax credit the Senator from Alaska is \nadvocating. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this increase to the tax \ncut.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on this amendment \nand subsequent amendments be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 430.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 106 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 430) was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I believe there is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that is going to be offered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas for the purpose of offering another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 431\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 431.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding extending the \n      $1,000 child credit for three additional years (2011-2013))\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE $1,000 CHILD CREDIT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that extending the $1,000 \n     child credit for three additional years (2011-2013) can be \n     accommodated within the revenue totals and instructions of \n     this resolution.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Alaska \nfor the intent of the previous amendment. Many of us in this body have \nchildren. We understand what it takes to raise our children. Across \nthis country, we want to provide all families, all parents the ability \nto do as much as they possibly can for their children. I again \ncompliment the Senator from Alaska for the intent of her amendment.\n  My amendment expresses that it is the sense of the Senate that we \nshould extend the refundable child credit for 3 years and that this can \nbe accommodated within the revenue totals in the resolution as it \ncurrently exists.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma has said several times during this \ndebate, we cannot write the tax cut on the budget resolution. The \nprevious amendment was simply an attempt to increase the size of the \ntax cut, nothing more, nothing less.\n  Although the intent of the amendment of the Senator from Alaska I \nthink was good, I do think it is important that we make sure this tax \ncut actually goes in the child credit and we understand that the money \nalready exists to do it. I ask for my colleagues' support of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense of the Senate. \nIt may provide political cover--I compliment my colleague from Alaska \nfor her effort to help American families--but this is a sense of the \nSenate, so it does not change any revenue numbers. It may give \npolitical cover.\n  I have no objection to this amendment. I hope we accept it by a voice \nvote. Almost all of the sense-of-the-Senate amendments have been \naccepted by voice vote.

The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 407\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 407.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 407.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the final budget \nconference agreement should not take or propose any actions that reduce \n    the level of funding provided for domestic nutrition assistance \n  programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture below current \n               baseline spending levels for the programs)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR DOMESTIC \n                   NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) domestic nutrition assistance programs administered by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture--\n       (A) have a long history of bipartisan support;\n       (B) have an accomplished record of preventing health \n     problems for children and promoting the health, growth, and \n     development of children;\n       (C) provide United States agricultural producers and food \n     manufacturers with important and substantial markets through \n     which they can obtain and sustain livelihoods; and\n       (D) are due to be reauthorized and improved during the \n     108th Congress; and\n       (2) the budget proposed by the President for fiscal year \n     2004--\n       (A) maintains current levels of funding for child \n     nutrition;\n       (B) extends and improves nutrition assistance programs, \n     including--\n       (i) the school breakfast program established by section 4 \n     of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773);\n       (ii) the school lunch program established under the Richard \n     B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et \n     seq.); and\n       (iii) the child and adult care food program established \n     under the section 17 of the Richard B. Russell National \n     School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1766); and\n       (C) renews and fully funds the special supplemental \n     nutrition program for women, infants, and children \n     established by section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1786).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the final budget conference agreement should not take or \n     propose any actions that reduce the level of funding provided \n     for domestic nutrition assistance programs administered by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture below current baseline spending \n     levels for the programs.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense of the Senate \ndeclaring that there will be no cuts to important domestic nutrition \nprograms in this year's budget. I am very pleased to have letters of \nsupport from the American School Food Services Association and a number \nof other nutrition organizations. This is a bipartisan amendment \ncosponsored by Senators Fitzgerald, Harkin, Leahy, Johnson, Murray, \nDayton, Kohl, Corzine, Jack Reed, Clinton, Bingaman, Dodd, and Wyden.\n  Our concern is that the House budget resolution will cut child \nnutrition funding by an estimated $5.9 billion. These cuts would have a \ndevastating impact on important child nutrition programs such as the \nSchool Lunch Program, breakfast programs, child and adult care feeding \nprograms, and WIC.\n  We, in the Senate, have a long tradition of working together in a \nbipartisan way on nutrition programs. I hope we can adopt this sense of \nthe Senate and, once more, show that we are very supportive that \nreauthorization of child nutrition programs is one of the Agriculture \nCommittee's top priorities this year.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, we need more funding for child nutrition, not \nless. I ask for the Senate's support.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Ms. Stabenow and my \nother colleagues today in offering this amendment to express the sense \nof the Senate that the final conference agreement on the budget \nresolution should not reduce funding for domestic nutrition programs \nbelow the current baseline levels. The reconciliation instructions \nincluded in the House Budget Resolution to cut mandatory funding in the \nareas of domestic nutrition assistance would be devastating to the \nchildren and families who count on these programs to meet their daily \nfood needs. In these difficult economic times, we must not put the \nbasic needs of low-income Americans--particularly children--on the \nchopping block in order to make room for an ill-advised tax cut package \nthis country cannot afford. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe we adequately take care of many \nof the functions that our colleague from Michigan mentioned in her \nstatement. We have no objection to accepting her amendment by a voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 407) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the majority leader \nfor comments about the former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nwho did such a superb job over so many years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take this opportunity, before we enter \ninto the final vote on the resolution, to congratulate the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, first, on bringing before this \nChamber a budget resolution, and for the last 7 days of his very \ndiligent work. My thanks to him and his staff for the long hours of \nhard work and their dedication.\n  I also thank the ranking member, Senator Kent Conrad, for his \ncooperation here on the floor, as well as that of the Democratic \nassistant minority leader and the minority leader. We have not agreed \non many issues over the last several days, but it has, nonetheless, \nbeen a respectful debate. And I think the will of the Senate will have \nspoken in a sound way when we adopt this resolution today.\n  I will have more to say about the resolution after adoption, but I \ndid want to take just a few moments to pay tribute to the former \nchairman and former ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, \nSenator Pete Domenici.\n  For many in this Chamber who have been through the budget wars over \nthe last nearly three decades, it has been a little strange over the \nlast 7 days not to see the senior Senator from New Mexico right here \nand down in the well managing this resolution. But I also know he \ntrained his successor--and all of us--well, and we have all benefited \nfrom his counsel and guidance.\n  With the start of this Congress, Senator Domenici stepped down as the \nlongest serving chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. I should note, \nunder our conference rules, he could have served as chairman of the \nBudget Committee but chose, rather, to pursue\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\nanother of his passions, energy policy. He gave up the chairmanship of \nBudget to take on another with the Energy Committee. I know he will \ndevote his extensive talents and energies to help the country craft a \nsensible and reliable energy policy, as much as he devoted them to the \nprocess over the last 28 years in the field of the budget. Both remain \nmajor challenges.\n  Senator Domenici has been a member of the Budget Committee since \n1975--1 year after it was created with the enactment of the \nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. History will also \nshow that shortly after his first coming to this Chamber in 1972, he \nand a group of other Senators, including the very distinguished Senator \nBob Byrd of West Virginia, saw a need to put some order into what was \nthen an even more chaotic budget and appropriations process. Indeed, it \nwas through this freshman Senator Pete Domenici's efforts and prodding \nthat the Budget Act became a reality.\n  Until Senator Nickles took over the reins in January, Senator \nDomenici had been the only Republican chairman in the committee's \nhistory, holding that position for 12\\1/2\\ years, and the ranking \nmember position for 9 years. Over 21 years--three-quarters of the \ncommittee's history--Senator Domenici has been at the forefront of \nsetting and guiding fiscal policy in this country.\n  I am proud to say, in my first 8 years in this body, I had the honor \nto call Senator Domenici my chairman, as I served on that committee, \nlearning the complexities of the Federal budget.\n  Senator Domenici has always been known for his tireless devotion to \nthe budget process, his ability to patch together coalitions, and even \na moodiness on fiscal policy that led another majority leader from \nTennessee, Howard Baker, to dub his good friend Senator Domenici as the \n``Hamlet of the Senate'' in the 1980s.\n\n  What has been accomplished under his leadership? Over the period, \nSenator Domenici has participated in the adoption of 26 concurrent \nbudget resolutions, 27 Senate-passed budget resolutions, 26 committee-\nreported budget resolutions, and 17 major budget reconciliation bills. \nConservatively, we estimate that he has taken over 1,000 votes on the \nSenate floor during the budget debates, and countless additional votes \non motions to waive the Budget Act when enforcing the budgets he helped \nto craft.\n  He has been at the center of all debates and legislation to modify \nthe Budget Act over the years, with the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act of 1985, better known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nAct. When differences between the Senate, House, and President seemed \nto doom the budget process, he took the Senate lead in putting it back \non track with its major budget summits in 1987, 1990, and, of course, \nthe 1997 historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement.\n  Many of these agreements were not always popular, even with some of \nhis fellow Republicans. But he has always--always--stood on principle \nand what he thought was best for the country at the time. Those \nprinciples and convictions to sound public policy have been evident in \nthis debate on this resolution, specifically related to ANWR and the \nFederal energy policy in this country.\n  Despite the impressive record on the budget, the one statistic no one \nwill ever challenge in the Senate's entire history, and the one \nstatistic he is probably most proud of, is the fact that in 1986, while \nserving as a Senator, Senator Domenici had seven children in college \nand graduate school at one time. This son of an Italian immigrant \ngrocer has always been devoted to his family through the good and the \ntough times. His wife Nancy has been loving support and inspiration to \nher husband throughout their 45 years of marriage. But I also know that \nNancy, in her own right, has been a dedicated public servant, working \nto improve health care throughout the country, and particularly in New \nMexico.\n  So, Mr. President, I did not want this occasion to pass, as we are \nabout to complete another budget resolution, without paying tribute to \nthe former chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee for his \nyears of service and devotion to this process, to his family, to his \nState, and to his country.\n  Thank you, Senator Domenici.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, momentarily we will be voting on final \npassage. We have a couple of additional things to do.\n  I believe we are trying to work out a McConnell sense of the Senate. \nThat will take just a moment. And then we will be voting in just a few \nminutes.\n  I also wish to join the majority leader in complimenting Senator \nDomenici for his many years of service, either as chairman or ranking \nmember of this committee. I have a much greater appreciation for its \nchallenges. He passed resolutions when we had a majority and minority, \neven when we were 50-50. My compliments to him. He is ``Mr. Budget'' as \nfar as I am concerned. Plus, as evidenced in some of the debates, he \nproved that he knows this act unlike any other on the floor.\n  So I thank our friend and colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 432\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \non behalf of Senator McConnell to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. McConnell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 432:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for future consideration of a possible free trade \n                   agreement with the United Kingdom)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       ``It is the Sense of the Senate that the President should \n     negotiate a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been said that the United States \nand the United Kingdom are a common people separated by a common \nlanguage. But we also share a unique cause for freedom, and to preserve \nthat we should also share a common market.\n  Today I am offering an amendment that ensures that our economies \nbecome as integrated as the other common causes that we share. The \namendment will provide for a Free Trade Agreement to be negotiated \nbetween the United States and United Kingdom similar to the North \nAmerica Free Trade Agreement.\n  Specifically, this amendment will create room in the budget for \nCongress to consider, and the President to successfully negotiate with, \nthe United Kingdom for a Free Trade Agreement with the United States.\n  The world is witnessing once again the unique brotherhood of freedom \nand the special bond between America and United Kingdom. Those who know \nand enjoy the benefits of freedom are willing to join together and pay \nfreedom's price. With so much at stake, America and United Kingdom \nshould do all we can to ensure our common cause stays strong for the \nbenefit of generations to come. With this United Kingdom--United States \nFree Trade amendment, our mutual bond will only become stronger.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will agree with \nthis. We can agree with it by voice vote. It is a sense of the Senate \nthat we should negotiate a free trade agreement with the United \nKingdom. The United Kingdom has proved to be a very valuable ally, \ncertainly in this latest conflict, but they have been for a long time. \nI compliment Prime Minister Blair and his leadership team and \ncompliment Senator McConnell for his amendment and also thank the \ncooperation of the staff of the Finance Committee for working with us \nto make this an acceptable resolution. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection on this side.\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 432) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I had to \noppose Senator Corzine's amendment to increase funding for \nenvironmental and natural resource programs in the budget resolution.\n  Let me be clear that I fully support the goals of Senator Corzine's \namendment. While it is true that we are facing a tight budget \nsituation, protecting our environment and the health and well-being of \nour citizens should remain a top priority. That includes setting aside \nadequate funding for programs such as the Superfund and Brownfields \nprograms.\n  But I was forced to vote against Senator Corzine's amendment because \nof another concern. My concern with mounting deficits. The budget \nresolution brought before us includes tax cuts that total $1.3 \ntrillion. The budget also proposes that $725 billion of these tax cuts \nbe enacted immediately, under the reconciliation process.\n  Two years ago, we passed a $1.3 trillion tax cut. I supported that \ntax cut. But those were different times. We had a surplus. We did not \nforesee the significant decline in revenues. Or the deficits that \nfollowed.\n  This is not the time to reduce revenues by $725 billion. It would \nhurt our budget and our economy.\n  Why is $725 billion in tax cuts inappropriate at this time? The most \ncrucial problem is that it is not paid for. The budget resolution \nbrought before us forecasts enormous deficits for almost the next \ndecade. Reducing revenues by $725 billion adds to the already mounting \ndeficits. In order to prevent the passage of tax cuts that would drive \nup the deficit and hurt our economy, I believe that we must reduce the \nsize of this tax cut.\n  I joined three of my colleagues in a letter that laid out these \nconcerns--we pledged that we would not agree to tax cuts above $350 \nbillion. This is crucial. The Budget Committee approved $725 billion in \ntax cuts, and brought it to the Senate floor. Along with my colleagues, \nI promised to vote to bring this number down by $375 billion.\n  In a narrowly divided Senate, it is important that both parties work \ntogether to come up with the appropriate spending and revenue targets \nfor the budget. That is why I worked with both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Together, we came up with a target of $350 billion for \nthis tax cut, and we agreed that we would all stick to that number.\n  As part of our commitment to try to reduce the size of the tax cut \napproved by the Budget Committee, we also agreed that we would not try \nto reduce the size of the tax cut below $350 billion. That means I am \nforced to make difficult decisions. In order to keep my commitment to a \nmore responsible tax cut, I have to vote against funding priorities.\n  During tough times, we must make tough choices. I chose to commit to \na responsible tax cut. A tax cut that will prevent worsening deficits \nthat would hurt our economy.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the fiscal \nyear 2004 budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 23.\n  Although I believe this budget, as amended on the floor of the \nSenate, is better than the resolution passed by the Budget Committee, \nit is still fiscally irresponsible, and I cannot support it at this \ntime.\n  This budget, if passed, would increase the fiscal year 2004 budget \ndeficit by $138 billion above the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \nbaseline, to $338 billion. This does not include the cost of the war or \nthe reconstruction of Iraq, which is likely to push the budget deficit \nabove $400 billion.\n  The resolution contains a $350 billion tax cut which we cannot \nafford, and which would be financed entirely through deficit spending.\n  The resolution does not adequately address numerous domestic spending \npriorities, such as education and homeland security.\n  Despite having been amended to reduce the size of the tax cut from \n$726 billion to $350 billion, this budget would still add more than \n$1.3 trillion to our national debt over the next 10 years when interest \ncosts are included.\n  Our budget deficit this year alone is likely to surpass $400 billion, \neven before the new tax cuts proposed in this budget go into effect. \nWhile the administration pushes for new tax cuts, our fiscal situation \ncontinues to deteriorate.\n  Just last night, CBO released a report that indicates that even with \nno changes in tax law, the Government will take in $30 billion less in \n2003, and $60 billion less between 2004 and 2008.\n  In the same report, CBO estimated that the President's tax cut \npackage would have at most a small stimulative effect on economic \ngrowth, and might not increase growth at all.\n  While the effect this budget will have on the economy is uncertain, \nwe can be certain that it will increase our debt. In fact, net public \ndebt will exceed $5 trillion by the end of the decade, and interest \npayments on the debt will double over the next 10 years, from $155 \nbillion this year to $310 billion in 2013.\n  Only at the very end of the 10-year budget period, and under the most \noptimistic scenario, would we return to surplus.\n  There is an urgent need to fund many priorities which are not dealt \nwith in this budget, and those needs are not likely to disappear over \nthe next decade.\n  Those priorities include, among others: The war in Iraq and the \nsubsequent reconstruction of Iraq, the President's No Child Left Behind \neducation initiative, homeland security, and a full prescription drug \nbenefit in Medicare.\n  Thanks to the success of an amendment offered by Senator Feingold, \nthe budget does include a $100 billion war reserve fund to be used to \ncover the cost of the war in Iraq. The reserve fund is not paid for, \nhowever, and will increase the deficit substantially in fiscal years \n2003 and 2004.\n  Moreover, the ultimate costs of the war and postwar reconstruction \nare still unknown, and could be substantially higher than $100 billion.\n  With regard to domestic spending, the limits set out in this budget \nare extremely low. The President's No Child Left Behind initiative \nwould go largely unfunded, and funding for homeland security is not \nadequate to meet the security needs of cities, towns, and counties \nacross the country.\n  Many priorities that are important to Californians are either cut or \neliminated altogether, most notably funding for the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program. If that program is eliminated, the burden of \nprocessing and incarcerating criminal aliens will fall entirely on \nthinly stretched State law enforcement budgets.\n  I believe that bipartisan cooperation is crucial to the Federal \nbudget process, and such cooperation requires both sides to forgo \ncertain new spending initiatives and new tax cuts.\n  In an attempt to bridge the gap, I cosponsored a bipartisan amendment \noffered with Senators Carper, Chafee, Lincoln, and Landrieu.\n  Unlike the final resolution being voted on today, our substitute \nbudget included significant tax relief for low- and middle-income \nfamilies that is paid for over a 10-year period by freezing future tax \ncuts for taxpayers in the two highest income tax brackets.\n  That budget would have balanced the budget in 2009, 3 years before \nthe underlying resolution.\n  That budget would have required tough choices with regard to \ndiscretionary spending, but it would have been entirely revenue neutral \nover the 10-year budget period and would not have added any new debt \nwhatsoever.\n  When faced with the choice between supporting a bad budget and no \nbudget at all, I must choose the latter.\n  I support a budget which faces our fiscal needs head on, even when an \neconomic downturn forces us to make tough choices, and which resists \nthe temptation to further increase the debt burden on future \ngenerations of taxpayers. Mr. President, this is not that budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the fiscal year 2004 budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is sadly ironic that at the same time \nwe are asking our young people to fight a war for our security, \nRepublicans are passing a budget that will force those same young \npeople to pay the bill for the reckless fiscal policies of this \nadministration and the Republican Congress. Democrats are proud that we \nwere able to make an irresponsible budget a little less irresponsible. \nBut by showering the most privileged among us with hundreds of billions \nof\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\ndollars in tax breaks and running up more than a trillion dollars in \ndebt, this amended budget still poses a serious threat to the long-term \neconomic well-being of the Nation.\n  Month after month, more American families are suffering from the \nfailure of this administration's irresponsible economic strategy. With \nthe economy hemorrhaging jobs from every sector, an increasing number \nof Americans are losing faith that they will ever find a job. With this \nbudget, Republicans have turned their backs on the problems of American \nfamilies. Instead of offering new ideas and fresh solutions, the \nadministration continues to push a tired ideology that has turned our \neconomy into a job-destroying machine. This budget will hang more than \na trillion dollars of debt around the necks of our children and \ngrandchildren. They will be paying for this mistake for decades to \ncome. The President's own chief economist, in his academic writings, \nagrees that the chronic deficits perpetuated by this budget will raise \ninterest rates and cut off economic growth for the future.\n  And though all Americans' thoughts are with our armed forces today, I \nwould ask that they take a moment to ask, why is this Republican \nCongress saddling our children with record-breaking deficits and \nmassive debt? It's not to fund the war or the rebuilding of Iraq that \nwill follow.\n  It is not to honor our men and women in uniform. Republicans voted \nagainst funding for health care for reservists.\n  It is not to strengthen our homeland defense. Republicans continue to \nshortchange the police and firefighters who need our help to prevent or \nrespond to a terrorist attack in their own communities, and continue to \noppose funding to better secure our borders, ports, and vulnerable \ninfrastructure.\n  It is not to get our economy moving again. Like the President's \nbudget, the Republican resolution before us contains very little to \nstimulate the economy now.\n  This budget is not about meeting the challenges of the moment or the \nfuture. Its focus is on more new tax breaks for the very wealthy at the \nexpense of everyone else. At the expense of deep cuts in domestic \npriorities. At the expense of record deficits that will be imposed on \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Democrats have been able to restore a small measure of sanity to this \nbudget. And we are going to keep fighting to make sure that \ngovernment's resources are used responsibly to meet the fundamental \nneeds of our country. We are going to keep fighting to get our economy \nmoving today with a broad-based tax cut that stimulates job creation; \nto fund homeland security; to provide a real Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, and to honor our commitment to our students and teachers. This \nis not a time to shrink from our responsibilities to one another.\n  We need to meet the test of this demanding moment in our history. \nThis Congress should be producing a fiscally responsible budget that \nreflects the very best of our Nation, the spirit that our soldiers \nexemplify, the spirit of honor, community and duty in the service of a \nbetter future for us all.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are now coming to an end in our debate \non this year's budget resolution.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nNickles for producing this resolution and reporting it from his \ncommittee in an expedited manner. We are doing the Nation's business on \ntime.\n  I know that this resolution has put extraordinary pressure on the \ncommittee and floor staff, and I want them to all know my appreciation \nfor their long hours of work. We are not done, but we will take a major \nstep forward with the passage of this resolution today.\n  I also want to thank the ranking member, Senator Conrad, who, while \ncertainly not supporting this resolution, did cooperate in the \nscheduling of this resolution both in the committee and here on the \nfloor.\n  Having been a member of the Budget Committee my first 8 years here in \nthe Senate, I know how difficult it is to craft a budget resolution.\n  These are challenging times for our great country--certainly \nchallenging on the international front and equally as challenging in \nsetting a fiscal path for the future. Clearly how the war unfolds with \nIraq can impact our economic outlook. But as we move forward on this \nbudget resolution, we are also confronted with longer-term challenges \nof slow economic growth and the increasing demands of an aging \npopulation.\n  In the near term we will provide whatever resources are necessary to \nour troops in Iraq to bring that conflict to a quick, expeditious, and \nvictorious end. I also believe that the completion of that conflict and \nthe liberation of the Iraqi people from its dictator will not only \nprovide freedom and economic growth for that country but also lift this \ncloud of uncertainty that has hung over our economy and depressed \ninvestment, growth, and job creation here at home.\n  For the long term, economic growth remains the key to an expanding \neconomy. Real economic growth will provide the resources necessary to \naddress the demographic changes that confront us both in the Social \nSecurity and Medicare programs. We should never forget that for these \ntwo programs, it is not the size of their trust fund that matters, it \nis the size of the economy that matters.\n  It is for this reason that the President's economic growth and job \ncreation proposal is critical to setting a path toward future economic \ngrowth. I will continue to press for the largest growth package \npossible that will allow us to fully consider the growth legislation \nlater this spring. But for now this is just the beginning, not the end \nof the process.\n  S. Con. Res. 23, as amended, and before us today is a blueprint. It \nis the start of the process. Once adopted later today in the Senate and \nconferenced with the House, this budget blueprint will guide the fiscal \npolicy for the remainder of this first session of the 108th Congress. \nUnfolding events over the next many months may require modifications to \nthe resolution. I believe emergency provisions built into this \nresolution will allow it to be flexible and adjust to changing events.\n  The failure of the last Congress to even consider here in the Senate \nchamber a budget resolution undermined the budget process and created \nsignificant problems. The failure to even consider a budget left the \nprocess in shambles and resulted in the failure to complete action on \n11 of 13 annual must-do appropriations bills.\n  We all know the result. Less than 6 weeks ago, with one-quarter of \nthis fiscal year already over, we finally passed an omnibus spending \nbill for FY 2003.\n  We must not repeat that mistake of the last Congress. We must pass a \nbudget resolution and then get on with the business of enacting \nlegislation that follows the budget's outline.\n  Beyond making it possible for considering an economic growth package \nlater this spring, this resolution will provide resources requested by \nthe President to win the war on terrorism, to protect the homeland, to \nmodernize the Medicare program with a prescription drug benefit, \nincrease funding for both IDEA and Title 1 education programs, increase \nveterans health funding, and provide over $450 million next year for \nglobal AIDS programs.\n  Equally as important this resolution reinstates the tools we need \nhere in the Senate to provide fiscal discipline. It establishes \ndiscretionary spending caps for this year and the next two. It puts a \nlimit on the budgetary gimmick of advance funding. It extends the \ndiscipline of pay-go beyond its expiration date of April 15, and it \nreestablishes the supermajority points of order against spending that \nis not truly emergency spending.\n  Once again I congratulate the Chairman and the members of the Budget \nCommittee on all their work that has brought us to this point. We will \npass a budget and the legislative, budget and appropriation process \nwill go forth as it should.\n\n\n            local health emergency reimbursement act of 2003\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to briefly \naddress a health care issue of great importance to Arizona, all other \nsouthwest border States, and numerous other States. Hospitals in \nArizona and throughout the country incur uncompensated costs of over \n$1.5 billion annually to provide federally mandated emergency health \ntreatment to undocumented immigrants.\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\n  MTG Corporation, a Texas-based firm, and the Border Counties \nCoalition, through a congressionally directed study, determined that \nthe 24 counties along the Southwest border alone incur unreimbursed \ncosts of over $200 million per year to provide emergency health \ntreatment to undocumented aliens. Based on these estimates, MTG \nCorporation has concluded that nationwide hospitals, ambulances and \nother providers incur costs of over $1.5 billion per year.\n  Arizona, as an example, is indicative of the problems that all States \nand their providers are facing. The cost to Arizona and its providers \nfor providing these services might well be close to $200 million. These \nunreimbursed costs, and other health-related issues, have put hospitals \naround the country in a state of dire fiscal emergency. As a result of \nthese costs, many doctors are simply choosing to practice medicine in \nsuch a way that they do not have to provide emergency room treatment--\nin Phoenix, AZ, depending on the time of day, if you have a specific \nemergency a specialty doctor might not be available to treat you. Some \nemergency rooms have closed, or are in danger of having to close, their \nemergency rooms either temporarily or permanently because of these \ncosts.\n  I have introduced legislation, along with Senators McCain, Feinstein, \nDomenici, Cornyn, Hutchison, Clinton, and Schumer to provide $1.45 \nbillion in funding annually to reimburse providers for these federally \nmandated, but uncompensated, costs.\n  It is my understanding that there are resources in the budget for the \nFinance Committee to consider a measure to provide reimbursement \nfunding for health providers that currently provide federally mandated, \nbut uncompensated, emergency medical treatment to undocumented aliens, \nbe it in the Finance Committee allocation, its reserve fund for the \nuninsured, or any other appropriate funding stream.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct. I appreciate the important information \nthat Senator Kyl has brought to the attention of the Senate, and I will \nwork with Senator Kyl and other interested Members to address this \nissue.\n  Mr. KYL. I would ask the Finance Committee, in its consideration of \nlegislation dealing with welfare reform, Medicaid, and issues regarding \nuncompensated care, to work with me to provide for consideration of \nlegislation to provide for this reimbursement funding.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will work with both Senators and other interested \nMembers to provide for consideration of legislation to provide \nreimbursement to health providers who provide federally required, but \nuncompensated, emergency health treatment to undocumented aliens.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator for taking the time to help me clarify \nthis important issue.\n\n\n                          payment limitations\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Can the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \noffer me assurance that budget resolution agreement will leave policy \ndecisions regarding payment limitations to be resolved by the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I provide that assurance.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator for his cooperation.\n\n\n                               superfund\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am in support of Senator Lautenberg's \namendment to replenish the superfund trust fund, by reinstating the \nsuperfund taxes that expired in 1995. The trust fund is running \ndangerously low, and that is just not acceptable.\n  As I've stated before, I remember very clearly when Congress debated \nthe original superfund law, and I remember thinking what an incredible \nlegacy Congress could leave the Nation by enacting that historic \nlegislation.\n  Seeing how successful superfund has been over the last 25 years, \nparticularly in Libby, MT, reinforces my belief that we did the right \nthing for the people of this country when we created the superfund \nprogram.\n  The superfund program brought millions of dollars to Montana for \nclean up activities, to protect the health and well being of Montana's \ncitizens and create good paying jobs in the local communities left with \na contaminated site. For example, more than $34 million has been spent \nin Libby alone in an effort to remove asbestos contamination caused by \nthe now defunct WR Grace vermiculite mine, as well as to provide health \nscreenings for Libby residents. Hundreds of millions have been spent in \nthe Clark Fork basin to remedy decades of industrial pollution. \nMillions more will be spent to clean up the Berkeley Pit and other \nsites in the State.\n  Some of this money will come from an identifiable, solvent \nresponsible party, but much of it will not, as companies go out of \nbusiness or declare bankruptcy. And, Montana is not alone. That is why \nmaintaining the integrity of the superfund trust fund is so important.\n  I'm extremely concerned that the more we fall behind in securing the \nfunding necessary for clean-up activities at sites in Montana and \naround the country, the worse off we're going to be in future years. \nThis has serious implications for the future stability of the superfund \nprogram.\n  I don't believe it's fair to solve this problem by forcing the \naverage taxpayer to pick up the tab for the clean up of toxic sites \nthat were created by private entities, and which threaten our health \nand our children's health. That's why I strongly support reinstating \nthe superfund tax, and why I support Senator Lautenberg's amendment.\n  A Superfund designation is not a trivial event for the communities \ninvolved--it invokes real fear and uncertainty in people about the \nfuture, about the future economic health of their community, and about \nthe future effects of any contamination on their health or their \nchildren's health. These communities cannot shoulder the immense burden \nof cleaning up highly contaminated sites by themselves, or forcing a \nresponsible party to pay for the clean-up. The Federal Government is a \nnecessary and important partner in this effort through the Superfund \nprogram.\n  Superfund is a success; we should build on that success, not allow it \nto fall apart.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I express my strong opposition to a \nprovision in the budget resolution that proposes to shift $1.4 billion \nin mandatory spending over the next 10 years from agricultural \nprograms, budget function 350, to the Conservation Security Program, \nbudget function 300, compared to projected mandatory spending under the \nAgriculture Committee's jurisdiction under current law. I am pleased \nthat the budget resolution does not require the Agriculture Committee \nto report legislation reducing mandatory spending pursuant to a budget \nreconciliation instruction, nonetheless this proposal amounts to a \npolicy recommendation that the Agriculture Committee shift spending \naway from agricultural programs and towards the Conservation Security \nProgram.\n  More importantly, as I understand it, the $1.4 billion in \nagricultural program savings is to be achieved by reducing farm support \nprogram payment limitations below those that were agreed to as part of \nthe 2002 farm bill, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, \nFSRIA. Specifically, the proposal would reduce statutory payment \nlimitations for farm program payments to producers of covered crops--\nwheat, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, and rice--from $40,000 to $20,000 \nfor direct payments and from $65,000 to $30,000 for counter-cyclical \npayments. In addition, the proposal would include certificate \ntransactions and loan forfeitures under the marketing loan program's \npayment limitation.\n  I oppose this proposal for a number of reasons. First, the FSRIA, \nenacted less than a year ago, has already reduced farm program payment \nlimits compared to the 1995 farm bill. Second, the FSRIA, established a \nCommission on Application of Payment Limitations which is to analyze \nand make recommendations related to this issue to the President and to \nthe House and Senate Agriculture Committees in a report that is due on \nor before May 13, 2003. Clearly, the Senate should consider the \nCommission's findings before it endorses a further policy change in \nthis area. Third, the budget resolution should provide us with a broad \nplan for Federal revenues and expenditures but leave policy decisions \nwithin that budget framework to the Appropriations Committee, in the \ncase of discretionary spending, and to the various\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\nauthorizing committees such as the Agriculture Committee, in the case \nof mandatory spending. This proposal violates that principle by \nattempting to dictate policy to the Agriculture Committee without \nhaving any impact on the overall level of Federal expenditures. Fourth, \nbecause their crops cost more to produce, southern cotton and rice \nfarms tend to be larger, on average, than wheat, corn, and soybean \nfarms in other regions. The payment limit proposal would reduce \nGovernment payments to larger farms, hurting southern cotton and rice \nproducers the most. It is unclear, at best, what the proposal's changes \nto the marketing loan program would mean for our farmers. This is a \nprogram that has been highly successful in helping our farmers remain \ninternationally competitive without undue Government involvement in the \nmarketplace.\n  Taken together, the proposal's payment limitation changes could \nseriously undercut the farm safety net that was a principal goal of the \nFSRIA, particularly for southern producers of cotton and rice. I \nstrongly oppose this provision.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, our Nation is at war. Our Federal budget \nfaces unprecedented deficits. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, counting the cost of that war, the deficit will be $587 billion \nthis year alone. And we are on the threshold of a crisis in the funding \nof our Social Security system as the baby boom generation begins to \nretire in the next decade.\n  Yet this budget resolution calls for fully $850 billion in tax cuts, \nall of which will be borrowed from that Social Security system. In my \n30 year career in the Senate, I cannot recall a more reckless or \nirresponsible proposal.\n  Instead of a careful, conservative approach to our finances, instead \nof caution and a sense of responsibility in these dangerous times, this \nbudget throws caution to the wind and simply dumps the bill for our \nactions today on our children and grandchildren.\n  These are no ordinary times. We are now fully engaged in a war in \nIraq, a war that will not be truly over until the reconstruction of \nthat nation is accomplished. The $75 billion that the President has \njust requested is just the first installment on that commitment. We \ncannot know the full costs of that undertaking, which could take many \nyears to complete. At the same time, the global war on terrorism must \nbe fought here at home as well as in the farthest corners of the globe. \nThe costs of that commitment will be substantial and could well \nrepresent a permanent change in the way we do business.\n  This budget simply ignores those new realities and treats the Social \nSecurity system like a broken piggy bank, grabbing the savings the \nsystem will soon need for its own obligations to paper over the costs \nnot only of our new security responsibilities, but hundreds and \nhundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts as well. But those bills \nwill come due, as the baby boom generation retires, and this budget \nplants a time bomb in a Social Security system that already faces a \nserious future imbalance.\n  Beyond those profound problems, the massive loss of revenues called \nfor in this budget means that we do not have the funds available for \nsuch fundamental priorities as homeland defense, health care, or \neducation.\n  I was glad to see that we fixed some of the problems in this \nresolution. Senator Feingold's amendment rescued $100 billion from \nthose tax cuts to set aside to pay for the war now being fought in \nIraq. That will be just the beginning of the resources we will need to \nfully cover the cost of that conflict and the massive reconstruction \nthat will follow.\n  I am glad that we were able to reduce by half the size of the tax \ncuts that will be protected by a special budget fast-track procedure. \nWe need to stimulate our sagging economy and restore the growth and job \ncreation we have lost in the past 2 years. But at $350 billion, half \nthe original amount that was protected by budget rules, that tax cut is \nstill far too large given the other obligations that we face.\n  But on top of the $350 billion in tax cuts protected by special \nbudget rules, this resolution still contains an additional $500 billion \nin other tax cuts, for a total of $850 billion in revenue losses. \nCounting the additional interest we will have to pay on the debt we \nwill pile up, that is another trillion dollars that will not be \navailable for our national security and homeland security obligations, \nnot available for health care, for education, for law enforcement. Nor \nwill it be there when we need to restore balance to Social Security.\n  We have made some progress during this debate to restore funding in \nsome of those areas, but not enough to meet the needs and priorities of \nthe vast majority of Americans. This budget resolution is the first \nstep in our consideration of priorities this year, and it is a big step \nin the wrong direction, one that I fear we will regret.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in rejecting this resolution. We \ncan and must do better. We can hardly do worse.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support this budget resolution. In \nmy judgment, this budget, like the President's budget which it \nreflects, represents the wrong priorities. A close look reveals too \nmany ill-advised cuts in too many critical areas in order to help pay \nfor a tax cut which is too large, too inequitable, and which will \nworsen our fiscal situation without providing our economy the jump-\nstart it needs.\n  The proposed budget cuts in education are particularly troubling. \nWhile I am pleased that the Senate passed an amendment I introduced \nthat increased education funding by over $2 billion by proposing to \nclose down two egregious tax haven loopholes, that increase doesn't \ncome close to making up for the shortfalls.\n  Other priorities are similarly underfunded. The transportation \nrequest is less than what was allotted in 2002 and 2003. This year \nCongress plans to reauthorize TEA-21, the highway reauthorization bill, \nyet the budget resolution as proposed would limit our ability to \nincrease the program to meet our Nation's transportation needs. The \nbudget would provide inadequate funding for State sewer and water \nprograms, and would cut funding to the Community Oriented Policing \nServices, COPS, Pprogram, which has helped fund more than 3,300 police \nofficers in Michigan. The proposal provides no funding for the \ncommunity access program, which improves health care coordination for \nthe uninsured, or for extending unemployment benefits for those whose \nbenefits have expired, even though the number of unemployed in our \ncountry has increased by about 40 percent since January 2001.\n  While I am pleased that we were able to reduce the President's \nfiscally irresponsible tax cut proposal, the tax cut package in the \nexisting budget resolution is still too large, and likely will increase \nin conference committee with the President's party in charge of both \nHouses.\n  In January 2001, the Office of Management and Budget was projecting a \n10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. Now we are back into a huge deficit \nditch and will be for the foreseeable future. In fact, the President's \nproposed budget and tax cuts would lead to more than a trillion dollars \nin deficits over the next 5 years, including record deficits of over \n$300 billion this year and next. The right type of tax cuts could \nstimulate the economy by being effective in the short term and going to \nworking families and small businesses that will spend the money now \ninstead of mainly going to the wealthiest among us who don't need tax \ncuts. But tax cuts that drastically worsen our long-term fiscal \nsituation, that won't help out in the short term, and that would \nrequire cuts to many other priorities are not what our economy needs.\n  Surely, simple equity as well as economic stimulus needs suggest that \nif we are going to have tax cuts they should be broad-based tax cuts, \nproviding, for instance, every working family of four with an immediate \ntax cut of $1,200. And we should also extend unemployment benefits for \nthose whose benefits have expired and weren't previously extended, \nprovide short-term incentives for businesses to invest immediately, and \nprovide some assistance to our struggling States for education, \nhomeland security, Medicaid, and highway and other infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  These measures would be better for our economy today, our fiscal \nsituation in future years, and the many other challenges that lay \nahead. They also\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\nwould address today's problems today without passing the bills onto \nfuture generations.\n  In addition, the Senate is asked by the majority to pass a budget \nwithout including any estimated costs of the war in Iraq and its \naftermath, even though such estimates exist. Yesterday the President \nsent a $75 billion funding request regarding Iraq to Congress in the \nform of an emergency supplemental. That request is not included in the \ncurrent 2004 budget resolution before us. There is no reason that the \ncosts of the war and its aftermath after September 30, 2003, should be \nomitted. While there is no question that we will fully fund our troops, \nwe are asked to approve massive tax cuts and huge deficits while \ntotally ignoring the large additional expenditures which will be \nrequired by the war in Iraq. In my view, it is both reckless and \nirresponsible to intentionally keep those costs out of this budget \nresolution.\n  This budget emphasizes the wrong priorities, burrows us deeper into \nthe deficit ditch, continues our reliance on the Social Security \nsurplus, and fails to provide the stimulus needed to improve our \nsputtering economy. I cannot support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the administration's budget was wrong for \nthe Nation when the President proposed it in February. It is even worse \nfor the Nation now that we are at war. I will oppose it, and I hope \nthat reason and common sense will prevail in the remaining steps of the \nbudget process to prevent this package from doing lasting damage to the \neconomy and to our communities.\n  As incredible as it might seem, this budget plan would worsen the \nfiscal and economic harm done by the administration's 2001 economic \npackage, which, in one fell swoop squandered the hard-won budget \nsurpluses and converted them to ever-deepening deficits and debt. \nMaking matters all the worse, this budget would compound this \nsquandering while the Nation is at war.\n  Can anyone seriously argue, just for instance, that it makes fiscal \nor economic sense to borrow money to pay for a tax cut package which \nitself is steeply tilted to the wealthiest individuals?\n  This budget plan is misguided in its priorities. It severely \nunderfunds essential health, education and employment training \nprograms; it contains an enormous government giveaway to wealthy \ncorporations and the wealthiest individuals that will skyrocket our \nNation's debt; and it is wholly inadequate to meet the domestic \nsecurity needs of the first-responder agencies that are our first line \nof defense against terrorism.\n  Even before the war, when the President unveiled his budget proposal \nin February, his priorities were sharply out of kilter with the \nNation's needs. By severely underfunding education and other domestic \nneeds, and by making a nearly $700 billion tax package the focus of his \nbudget, the President compounds the irresponsible polices of the last 2 \nyears that have traded record surpluses for record deficits.\n  Let me cite just a few examples of how bad the President's budget is \nfor Vermont: The $6.7 million cut in afterschool programs that will \nleave 9,566 children in my State without afterschool activities; the \n$2,405,259 cut in Clean Water Act funding, at a time when Vermont has \nnine toxic waste sites on the National Priorities List; the $524,673 \ncut in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that \nhelps Vermonters who need assistance with the electricity and heating \nbills; the $793,220 cut in the Community Services Block Grant that \nprovides local organizations in Vermont with funds to help reduce \npoverty, revitalize low-income communities, and offer families the help \nthey need to become fully self-sufficient; and the elimination of the \nCOPS police-hiring program that has put 245 officers on our streets. \nAnd I could go on and on.\n  In 2001, I voted against the Bush tax package because it was too \nskewed toward the wealthiest Americans and it was fiscally \nirresponsible. Since then, we have gone from record surpluses to red \nink, and the economy is still floundering. Leading economists have \nrepeatedly made clear that the elimination of taxes on dividends paid \nto investors, the centerpiece of the President's tax-cut proposal, will \ndo little if anything to spur economic growth or to reduce the Nation's \njobless rate.\n  As Congress shapes an economic package, fiscal responsibility needs \nto be a priority. We need to be smart about how we proceed, and we need \nto be fair about it. The tax cuts the President has proposed not only \nwill worsen our Federal deficit, but it will also eliminate $16 million \nin revenue from the State of Vermont. Congress now has the \nresponsibility to bring stability and sensible fiscal policies back \ninto the budget process. We must work to reestablish a balanced budget \nand to restore our country's economic health.\n  Our Nation is at war. We have nearly a quarter of a million troops in \nthe Middle East. We have five carrier battle groups in the region. And \nwe have National Guard units being called up all across the country. \nYet the President has only recently submitted an estimate to Congress \nabout the cost of this war. The $75 billion he requested on Monday does \nnot adequately address our country's homeland security needs and is \nlikely just a start in funding all of the United States operations in \nIraq.\n  I was disappointed that the Senate did not adopt my amendment to \nboost funding for first responders. We are in a two-front war, overseas \nand here at home, and we need to fund both. First responders are on the \nfront lines in defending against and preparing for terrorist attacks. \nThe White House has refused to adequately fund homeland security, and \nthese added responsibilities have become unfunded Federal mandates that \nare severely straining our police, fire and rescue agencies. Every time \nthe alert level is raised, it costs our communities and states millions \nmore. Everyone recognizes the vital role of first responders, but the \nWhite House is overdue in acting accordingly. The sooner we help first \nresponders help us in the war on terrorism, the better.\n  In his State of the Union Message, the President was right when he \nsaid we should not pass on our problems to other Congresses, other \nPresidents and future generations. Unfortunately, that is exactly what \nthis budget plan would do. The White House's own documents predict the \ndeficit will hit highs of $304 billion this year and $307 billion in \n2004. Over the next 5 years, deficits would total $1.08 trillion. Even \nthese staggering numbers are short of the real mark because the \nadministration will surely need hundreds of billions of dollars more in \nIraq-related spending that is not counted here.\n  This administration has been in a rush to war, but it has been in no \nhurry to substantively deal with the poor economy that millions of \nAmericans are coping with today.\n  This budget was a bad plan for the Nation before the war began. It is \nan even worse plan now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial by Emerson Lynn that \nappeared in the March 21 edition of the St. Albans Messenger be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            It's Wrong To Tie Patriotism to Massive Tax Cut\n\n       There is the distinct sense that the American people cannot \n     do two things at once, that we cannot separate our thoughts \n     of the war with our thoughts of how the government spends and \n     collects our taxpayer dollars. Worse, there is the conviction \n     that one should be labeled unpatriotic if the attempt is made \n     to draw the distinction.\n       This contradiction was played out yesterday in the House of \n     Representatives which passed largely along party lines the \n     president's proposed budget, including his budget busting tax \n     cuts. The cuts were thought to be in jeopardy a month ago, \n     particularly with the Congressional Budget Office's \n     assessment of unending budget deficits as far as the eye can \n     see.\n       Why the miraculous turnaround? Because, as partisan \n     Republicans said, it would be wrong to embarrass the \n     president just as war is being waged in Iraq. In other words, \n     one's budget sense should be placed at the mercy of the \n     president's polling numbers.\n       Hmmm. If there is a sense of discomfort in having the \n     budget resolution being debated while war is being waged, \n     then why not delay discussion of the budget? If the \n     president's experts are to be believed, the war will be over \n     in less than a week or so. Why the hurry?\n       Was the pressure applied because the Republican leadership \n     (and the White House) are concerned about conflicting \n     messages of domestic support, or is it because they saw the \n     opening moments of the war as the most propitious time to \n     push the president's $726\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\n     billion in tax cuts, a proposal most Republicans a month ago \n     thought would be beyond their reach?\n       Guess.\n       Today, the same arm-twisting efforts will be applied in the \n     U.S. Senate. Again, it was thought only a week or so ago that \n     the entire tax cut proposal had no chance of being approved, \n     particularly with several moderate Republicans proposing a \n     plan to shave the tax cut in half. The ground has shifted, \n     Senate insiders now believe the president has a good chance \n     of winning it all. Again, it's the war and the pushed thought \n     that a good American supports whatever the president wants \n     right now. We must stand together.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are smart enough to distinguish \n     between a necessary war and an unnecessary tax cut. Too, our \n     patriotism remains intact; in fact, it is with ease that we \n     can argue that being opposed to the $726 billion in tax cuts \n     is utterly patriotic. How else to avoid an endless string of \n     swollen budget deficits? How else to protect the integrity of \n     legislative branch's responsibility to be acting on behalf of \n     its constituents?\n       We find it incredible that we have a president who lost the \n     popular vote and today rules as if it was his divine right, \n     as did the kings in Shakespeare's time. And, yet, we are \n     impressed. Highly impressed. In terms of sheer \n     accomplishment, he has achieved more in two years than Bill \n     Clinton did in eight. An it was thought that the balance of \n     power between the Democrats and the Republicans would largely \n     result in legislative stalemate. The Democrats could only \n     wish.\n       What is most upsetting, however, is understanding how \n     completely backwards the argument before congress is. The \n     primary focus is on the war and stalwart Republicans are \n     using the emotion of the moment to wash away all other \n     thoughts. In truth, what happens in Iraq, while terribly \n     important, pales in comparison to the long-term effects of \n     the president's decision to essentially strip this Congress \n     and all future Congresses of the resources needed to address \n     essential issues such as health care, Social Security, \n     Medicaid and Medicare. The war will not last long, and even \n     the rebuilding efforts after-wards will be short in duration \n     when compared to huge tax cuts that keep on taking, and \n     taking, and taking.\n       So you say, just elect a Democrat as president. A year from \n     now the primaries will be in full swing. We could have a \n     change in leadership within 24 months.\n       Think again.\n       Politically, it is almost impossible for Congress to raise \n     taxes. Our representatives can oppose the cuts to begin with, \n     which is what we hope happens, but once they are in place, \n     good luck turning back the clock.\n       That's why today's vote in the United States Senate is so \n     important. Although it is a budget resolution and does not \n     have the effect of law, it does pave the way for acceptance \n     later. Let's hope common sense prevails and that our \n     legislators act as if they are capable of distinguishing \n     between what needs to happen in Iraq and what needs to happen \n     here.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to day to discuss several issues \nrelated to agriculture funding in the budget resolution proposed by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  While there are no specific reconciliation instructions for \nagriculture in this proposal, the summary documents issued by the \ncommittee indicate an assumed savings of $80 million from the crop \ninsurance program.\n  I have been one of the strongest defenders of this program in the \nCongress, and I have fought hard to improve the program for producers \nthroughout the country.\n  Simply put, cutting $80 million from this program is exactly the \nwrong thing to do at this time. As budgets continue to tighten, both \nthe administration and Members of this congress have said that \nproducers must do more to rely on crop insurance as their primary risk \nmanagement tool and decrease reliance on emergency disaster assistance \nprograms.\n  Last fall we also saw the collapse of the largest seller of crop \ninsurance in the country. This was the result of several factors, but \nthe significant drought we have suffered took its toll as indemnity \npayments to producers added up. And, several other companies are not in \nstrong financial positions for the same reason.\n  Finally, the entire insurance industry has struggled with reinsurance \nsince 9/11. This is also true in the crop insurance industry, and the \ndifficulties of obtaining reinsurance have been compounded by the \ndrought.\n  The bottom line is this: We have worked hard to make crop insurance \nthe primary risk management tool for producers. But, crop insurance is \nstruggling along with the entire insurance industry, and this cut many \nbe something it can not recover from. It could put several of the \nsmaller companies out of business and lead to further consolidation in \nthe industry and concentration in agriculture.\n  I urge the chairman to omit this specific cut in any reconciliation \ninstructions that may come out of the conference with the House.\n  Finally, I understand that an amendment was offered during committee \ndiscussion of the resolution that shifted funds from commodity programs \nto the conservation budget. I am not going to discuss the merits of the \nproposal that accomplished this shift. I think that is a discussion \nbest conducted within the Agriculture Committee.\n  However, if we are going to shift funds to the conservation program, \nI believe they should go to our well-established programs that benefit \nproducers throughout the United States. These include the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program, the Conservation Reserve Program, the \nWetlands Reserve Program, and the Farmland Protection Program.\n  I do not think these funds should go to the Conservation Security \nProgram--a program that will divert the largest potion of the funds to \nonly a couple States that can undertake farming practices that simply \ndo not work in regions of the country where the land is not on the \nriver bottom and the rain comes down sideways with a 50-mile-per-hour \nwind.\n  Lets put the money where it will actually work and achieve real \nconservation benefits.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening to my views on these issues, and \nI hope they will continue to consider them as this process toward a \nfinal budget agreement progresses.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it does not seem like all that long ago \nthat efforts were under way to reauthorize the 1996 farm bill. Many of \nyou know that we spent over 2 years listening to ideas and formulating \nthe model for this legislation. I am pleased that I was able to be a \npart of yet another farm bill that provides planting flexibility, price \nstability, and allows producers to receive a decent return on their \ninvestments.\n  The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is a balanced 6-\nyear farm bill which met specified budget requirements and was adopted \nby Congress. The farm bill provides an adequate financial safety net in \ntimes when prices are depressed. This safety net allows crops to be \npriced competitively in the domestic and world markets.\n  The farm bill is less than 1 year old. The United States Department \nof Agriculture, USDA, is still working to fully implement some of the \nremaining provisions. However, the actions taken by the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa during the markup of this budget resolution was an \neffort to unravel this carefully drafted legislation. I am referring to \na provision that was adopted in the Senate Budget Committee which \nshifts the Senate Agriculture Committee's mandatory spending, totaling \n$1.4 billion, from agriculture programs, budget function 350, to the \nConservation Security Program, budget function 300.\n  I want to express my strong opposition to this provision as it \nnegates the carefully crafted payment provision during the farm bill. \nThe Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 contains specific \nlimitations on program benefits and adds an adjusted gross income test \nthat makes participants with substantial nonfarm income ineligible for \nprogram benefits. In addition, program participants are required to \nmeet detailed eligibility requirements regarding contributions of \nmanagement and/or labor requirements. My colleague's further efforts to \nmake these limitations even more restrictive only adds additional \ntransitional costs which producers must absorb and creates additional \nadministrative costs for USDA.\n  As a result of this provision, my distinguished colleague ultimately \ndiscriminates against southern crops which are more expensive to \nproduce. Farms in the South tend to be larger than those in the Midwest \nand other areas of the country where the cost of production is much \nless. Further restrictions on payment limitations only hurt southern \ncommodity producers.\n  The farm bill has been debated in the Senate Agriculture Committee, \npassed by Congress, and signed into law by the President of the United \nStates. This provision reopens the farm bill--the farm bill should not \nbe reopened during\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\nthe budget process--that results in bad farm policy. And it should not \nbe reopened during the appropriations process--that results in bad farm \npolicy. Therefore, I strongly oppose this provision in the Senate \nbudget resolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the American people recognize the \nimportance of the family farmer to our Nation and the need to provide \nan adequate safety net for family farmers. In recent years, however, \nassistance to farmers has come under increasing scrutiny.\n  Critics of farm payments have argued that the largest corporate farms \nreap most of the benefits of these payments. What's more, farm payments \nthat were originally designed to benefit small- and medium-sized family \nfarmers have contributed to their own demise. Unlimited farm payments \nhave placed upward pressure on land prices and have contributed to \noverproduction and lower commodity prices, driving many family farmers \noff the farm.\n  Last year, the Senate agreed, by an overwhelming vote of 66 to 31, to \na bipartisan amendment sponsored by Senators Dorgan and myself to \ntarget Federal assistance to small-and medium-sized family farmers. The \namendment would have limited direct and counter-cyclical payments to \n$75,000. It would have limited gains from marketing loans and LDPs to \n$150,000, and generic certificates would have been included in this \nlimit. That would have limited farm payments to a combined total of \n$275,000.\n  That amendment was critical to family farmers in Iowa and indeed \nfarmers across the Nation. I feel strongly the farm bill failed Iowa \nand failed all of our farmers when it failed to effectively address the \nissue of payment limitations.\n  A solid majority in the Budget Committee voted last week in favor of \na payment limitation provision to limit total payments of all kinds to \na combined limit of $300,000. This is more than I think is necessary. \nIt is $25,000 more than the limit that won over two-thirds of the \nSenate. But in the interests of compromise it seems like a fair \napproach. The most important thing is that loopholes in the payment \nlimitation law be closed so that the limitation at whatever level is \nactually the real, effective level.\n  The Budget Committee voted to apply the savings from this reasonable \npayment limit proposal against the reductions suffered by the \nConservation Security Program, CSP, during consideration of the \nagricultural disaster package in the fiscal year 2003 omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  This new conservation initiative from the 2002 farm bill will reward \nfarmers and ranchers who voluntarily implement effective conservation \non their working lands. Farmers and ranchers will receive public \nsupport as they provide public benefits to the Nation's natural \nresources and environment. This program allows family farmers to solve \ncritical resource problems, with graduated rewards for increasing \nefforts. The CSP is an innovative new program in the Federal \nagricultural conservation toolbox and its full funding should be \nrestored as soon as possible.\n  The Budget Committee endorsed payment limitation reform including a \ncombined maximum cap of $300,000 and endorsed restoring funds to the \nConservation Security Program. Payment limitation reform is long \noverdue, a fact reflected in the vote of the Budget Committee. If cuts \nshould be ordered in the final budget resolution emerging from \nconference, payment limitations would be the most logical place to look \nfor savings. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes equally divided between myself and the ranking member for \nclosing debate on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe resolution. I thank all of our colleagues. We have conducted a \nnumber of rollcall votes. By the time we have final passage, there will \nhave been 51 rollcall votes; we will have had 29 voice votes, for a \ntotal of 80 votes on this resolution. That may be an all-time high, one \nI hope we don't repeat next year.\n  The budget process, in my opinion, is somewhat flawed. It is not easy \nto pass a budget. That is one of the reasons I wanted to compliment my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Domenici, because he did it year after \nyear. It is not easy to do. I understand we didn't get it done last \nyear. I don't want to be too critical, but we didn't pass a budget last \nyear. And because we didn't pass a budget, we didn't get appropriations \nbills done. We didn't do a prescription drug bill, a Medicare bill. We \ndidn't do anything to help grow the economy. The budget does lay the \nblueprint for the next Congress, certainly for the rest of the year. So \nwe need to pass a budget. I have told my colleagues, we need to pass a \nbudget regardless of the size of the growth package.\n  I readily admit this growth package is not what I wanted. It is about \nhalf a loaf. That is better than none.\n  We could have done better. We didn't; we tried. We let the \nlegislative process work. With 80 votes, the legislative process did \nwork. The Senate did speak.\n  I thank my colleagues for their participation. I happen to believe \nthe level of debate was good. I think it was a healthy debate. I thank \ncolleagues on all sides for their cooperation in making that happen.\n  I also especially thank my friend and colleague, Senator Conrad, and \nhis staff. They have been a pleasure to work with in a very challenging \nenvironment, particularly on Friday evening. Also, I thank our staff as \nwell, Hazen Marshall and Stacey Hughes and our entire staff. They \nworked very hard to put together a budget process that will work, a \nbudget that will lead us to a balanced budget, a budget that will have \ndeficits declining, substantially declining in the next couple of \nyears, the percentage of GDP substantially.\n  We need to be in balance. We will work to do that. That is not easily \ndone since we have inherited a situation where revenues have declined \nsubstantially in the last 2 years. We need to figure out ways to grow \nthe economy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to try to \nmake that happen. I appreciate very much their cooperation and support \nthroughout the challenging last several days. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first let me thank the outstanding staffs \non both sides. Hazen Marshall, staff director for Senator Nickles, and \nhis able staff, thank you for the really good attitude that you all \nbrought to this task and challenge. I thank also on our side my staff \ndirector, Mary Naylor, who has done such a superb job holding us all \ntogether. I think part of the reason this was well organized was \nbecause of Mary's talents. And to Jim Horney and Sue Nelson and Lisa \nKonwinski and all of the other staff members of the Budget Committee, \nthank you.\n  Special thanks to the chairman of our committee. Thank you for the \neffort to organize these votes in a way that was comprehensive and that \nwas understandable to people. Thanks, too, for the attitude and the \ntone you brought to the debate because we have had significant \ndifferences. But I think we have conducted ourselves in the way that \nour forefathers intended the Senate to be conducted--real debate on \nreal differences without personal rancor of any kind.\n  While this budget resolution has been substantially improved, we have \nnow reduced the President's proposed tax cut of $1.6 trillion to $850 \nbillion. Still I believe it is fatally flawed. I don't believe we can \nafford $850 billion of tax cuts that will add in this budget resolution \nover a trillion dollars of deficit to our country when we are already \nin record deficit and when we are right on the brink of the retirement \nof the baby boom generation.\n  That does not make sense to me. I believe it threatens the long-term \neconomic security of our country. I don't believe it will grow the \neconomy. That view is buttressed by the report of the Congressional \nBudget Office today. They applied dynamic scoring and what they said \nis, the one thing that is going to grow under this budget is the \ndeficits and the debt of our country. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator's time has expired. All \ntime has expired.\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today with great honor and pride \nto pay tribute to the men and women of our Armed Forces, tens of \nthousands of whom are deployed right now in the Middle East in military \naction against Iraq. I encourage all my colleagues in the Senate, and \nin the Congress, that we take a few moments out of each and every one \nof our days we are engaged in this conflict to come to the floor and \nspeak to our constituents, speak to the American people, and speak to \nthe servicemen and servicewomen who are so valiantly out there \ndefending our freedoms and this great country that we believe in. We \nare going to take a few moments here today to talk about how important \nare these men and women in service to our country. We would like to \nencourage, again, all Members of Congress to come to the floor and \nspend a few minutes out of their day or out of their week to talk about \nthe incredible lives of these individuals who are there on our behalf, \ndefending our freedom.\n  Over the course of the last week, since hostilities began in earnest \non March 19, our troops have made tremendous progress toward the \nobjectives of their mission. At the same time, we have seen a few \nsetbacks, but these do not detract from what has been accomplished. For \nthat, we have no one to thank but the courageous, hard-working men and \nwomen of the American service arm and the coalition of Armed Forces.\n  We hear a great deal about the technology behind this war--missiles, \naircraft, telecommunications devices, weaponry, and other equipment of \nbattle. But we should all remember that even the best equipment and the \nbest technology is of little value without the best soldiers and \ncommanders to make it useful.\n  Today we have over 230,000 troops representing air, sea, and land \nforces in the theater, with our allies in the coalition contributing an \nadditional 45,000. These young men and women are serving in a wide \nvariety of capacities but with a unifying mission--to liberate the \nIraqi people from the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein, and to destroy \nhis weapons of mass destruction which threaten our globe. They are \nseparated from their families and their friends, placing themselves in \ngreat personal danger in order to provide for a safer, more secure \nworld for all of us.\n  I myself have a young man from my staff who is serving in the Middle \nEast.\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nHe was called up on a Tuesday, left here on Friday, and I just recently \nheard from his mother. He is in Baghdad. Our thoughts and prayers go \nout to him. We want him to know we are thinking about him and that we \nare looking forward to his safe return to us here at home.\n  We are all deeply grateful for the sacrifices our service men and \nwomen are making and the risks they are taking on all of our behalf. \nThose sacrifices and those risks will not be forgotten.\n  In addition, I remind my colleagues that a large number of these \ntroops come from the National Guard and the Reserve, nearly 217,000 at \nour last count. Over 2,000 of these guardsmen and reservists come from \nmy home State of Arkansas. One of those soldiers is Major Stephen \nWilson, of Rogers, AK.\n  Major Wilson, who is 38 years old, is the operations officer for an \nApache attack helicopter unit, the 2nd Squadron, 6th Cavalry of the \n11th Aviation Regiment. We have all seen in recent days the difficult \nodds our attack helicopter crews work under. They are vulnerable to \nsmall arms fire from the ground, not to mention difficult weather \nconditions that we have all been seeing on the television. In spite of \nthese difficulties, Major Wilson and his colleagues persevere in an \nextremely challenging but extremely necessary mission.\n  He is a proud representative of our State and our Nation, and we are \nextremely proud of him for his service to this country.\n  If there were a way to thank each and every soldier by name, I would \ndo it. I would take the necessary time to make sure that each of them \nknows how important they are in this conflict and in our resolve. Since \nit is not possible for me to recognize who is serving today, allow me \nat least to give a sense of where these units come from all across our \ngreat State of Arkansas: Little Rock, North Little Rock, Fort Smith, \nVan Buren, Siloam Springs, West Memphis, Ozark, Charleston, Marked \nTree, Fayetteville, Pine Bluff--and the list could go on.\n  Furthermore, these units are comprised of individuals from all over \nthe State, meaning that we have soldiers serving from virtually every \ncommunity in our great State of Arkansas. It is a reminder that even \nfrom thousands of miles away, Arkansans have a very serious stake in \nthis war.\n  On behalf of the people of Arkansas, I wish to say we are proud of \nall of our troops, and we look forward to welcoming them back home soon \nand safely.\n  It is also true that as of today we have suffered casualties, and we \nshould not turn away from this fact. It is believed that up to 14 of \nour troops from both the U.S. and our broader coalition are missing or \ncaptured by enemy forces. Our prayers are that they will be returned to \ntheir units safely and timely.\n  We also had a number of our troops wounded in battle, and we wish \nthem the best in a speedy, full recovery from all of their injuries.\n  Most tragically of all, over 40 troops from the U.S. and from Great \nBritain have been killed in action or in accidents. We extend our \ndeepest sympathies to their families, their friends, their loved ones, \nand we vow that we will honor their service and their memories by \nfinishing this great task in which they have given their lives. Those \nlives will not have been lost in vain.\n  In the days and weeks to come, we will no doubt discover that others \nof our troops will have been captured, wounded, or cut down, but we \nmust remain firm in our resolve that Operation Iraqi Freedom will \ncontinue to move forward.\n  My own father, who passed away last October, was a veteran of the \nKorean war, and he taught me always to respect the great commitment \nmade by our troops in fighting to protect our freedoms. He taught me \nbetter to understand the mind of a soldier when he shared with me the \nstories and experiences he had on the front lines of Korea. And also, \nsitting at the foot of the chair of my grandfather, who served in World \nWar I--both of my grandfathers did--I listened to stories of his \ntravels on trains from Helena, AR, west to Little Rock, to catch \nanother train to boot camp, and then on to France.\n  To better understand the minds of the men and women who serve us in \nthe armed services, each of us must take the time to reflect on the \npersonal stories of the family members, the neighbors, the friends, the \nstaff, all of those who are so critically involved in this conflict in \nwhich we now find ourselves.\n\n  I again encourage all of my colleagues to take those few moments out \nof their day, out of their week, to think about what these generous \nsouls are giving on our behalf to be there, to defend so many of the \nfreedoms we in this great country take for granted, to remember them \nand their families in our thoughts and prayers.\n  Our troops of today's generation deserve the same respect for the \nwork they do as when we look back at many of our family members who \nhave served in previous wars.\n  As I reflect today with my colleagues in the Senate, there is no one \nI think of more at this moment than one of my colleagues here in the \nSenate, who I would like to share my time with, someone who has a son \noverseas in the Middle East.\n  I have to say, as a mother of twin boys who are now in the first \ngrade, it is amazing to imagine how quickly our children grow up. The \nquestions that I get at night from my children--Where they are going? \nWhat they are doing? What is our country involved in? Where will they \nbe in 10 or 15 years from now?--it is so important for each of us to \nreflect on this as we lift up the service men and women who are there \nvaliantly now defending our freedoms.\n  They and their families will be in our hearts and in our minds and in \nour prayers in the coming weeks. We wish them Godspeed, God's safety, \nand a timely return home to this country and this land that we all love \nso much.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. And I want to again tell my colleague, \nSenator Johnson, how much I appreciate him and his family for the \nincredible contribution they make with his son serving in the Middle \nEast right now. It is an unbelievable gift, and we are all truly \nindebted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am honored to have an opportunity to \ntake part in this tribute to our American troops this evening here on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I express a special commendation to my colleague and good friend, \nSenator Lincoln of Arkansas, for her comments and for her leadership in \nhelping to put together this tribute, as well as my South Dakota \ncolleague, Senator Daschle, for all his support of our troops and his \nsuggestion that we go ahead with a regular tribute and acknowledgement \nof the contributions our American military personnel are making.\n  This is a matter of particular personal importance to me with my own \noldest son Brooks serving in the 101st Airborne in Iraq today. But \nthere are thousands of others from South Dakota--Reserve, National \nGuard, Active Duty, Ellsworth Air Force Base in our case in South \nDakota--and around the Nation who each are making profound \ncontributions to the security and freedom of this country and for \nstability in that troubled part of the world.\n  We owe so much to each and every one of them, not only to honor the \nmen and women who put on our Nation's uniform and jeopardize their \nlives by doing so but their families who suffer mightily from the \nsacrifices that are made, and from the prospect of death, injury, \ncaptivity--all that to which our military personnel subject themselves.\n  In our own family's case, we recognize this is a voluntary military \nin this day and age. Our son Brooks chose to enter the military. It was \nnot my encouragement, particularly. It was his choice. All the credit \ngoes to him. And that young man, with so many others, has served in \nfour conflicts in the last 5 years: Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, now \nAfghanistan. And we in South Dakota, and many around the country, do \nwhat we can to demonstrate our pride and support. In South Dakota, we \nhave revived an old World War I tradition of wearing the blue star if \nwe have a family member in the war. We have banners on our front door \nand at my offices around the State and here in Washington with that \nsame blue star. We recognize that as the tradition goes, some of those \nblue stars will eventually become gold stars, and that is the symbol \nworn by parents who have lost a loved one.\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\n  We keep a map of Iraq in our family kitchen, as I am sure, in some \nsimilar way, the hundreds of thousands of other parents do all across \nthis country, trying to keep track, as best we can, where our son is, \nas others keep track of where their sons and daughters are, their \nhusbands and wives.\n  The communication, of course, at this time is just spotty. Initially, \nwe were able to get a couple e-mails. A short time ago, I received a \nnote from our son Brooks on the back of a beef stew box, a piece of \ncardboard. They had no paper anywhere, and they had to make do as they \ncould. We will keep this forever.\n  We sent, obviously, notes and cards to them. There are organizations \nthat have encouraged this to go on, and I am sure that builds morale, \nas these troops suffer through incredible circumstances, both \nmilitarily as well as just the sandstorms and all that goes with living \nout in a desert and in a troubled place.\n  One of the things Barbara and I recognize, that all the other parents \nshare in a way that is more profound than could possibly be the case \nunless you have had a loved one in a circumstance like this, is that \nevery glance at the television, every glance toward the radio could \nconvey to you at any moment some catastrophic news. There are many who \nfollow the conflict, have an interest in it, but the families recognize \nmore so than anyone the very real nature of what is happening.\n  These are not video games. There is a tendency sometimes in the media \nto talk about collateral damage and casualties, and you see numbers on \nthe maps and colored diagrams going in one direction or another. But \nthe families recognize that each one of those represents real people \nand real hopes and the love of real families. We in this body \nunderstand the sacrifices that need to be made. But it goes almost \nbeyond understanding how much we owe to these men and women and all \nthat they do.\n  This past week, Barbara and I were listening at our home to some \nreports, and there was a report of casualties and deaths in our son's \ndivision. I went to tell Barbara about it, and it was almost impossible \nfor me to even speak. She had been following the news herself and knew \nthat in this instance it involved a different brigade than where our \nson was; our son had left Kuwait for Iraq the day before. We breathed a \nsigh of relief as parents will when their own son or daughter has \nescaped harm, but we recognized more than ever because of our \ncircumstances that while our son in that case was safe, the losses were \nvery real. Someone else's son, someone else's husband was injured, was \nkilled, somewhere else families are devastated.\n  We will win this war. We have the greatest military in the world. The \nworld will be a better place when we are victorious. But it is \nimportant for us to take stock of the men and women who make this \npossible. It is important for us to express our honor for what they do \nand who they are. It is important for us to share our prayers that this \nconflict is a short and decisive conflict with the fewest losses of \nlife possible on either side.\n  We as a people owe more to these men and women than words can \npossibly convey. It is my hope that as we follow this conflict and pray \nthat it is a short one, we in the Senate will do all we can, obviously, \nto express our honor and our praise for these people, but also that we \nwill go beyond that to take the steps necessary so when they come home, \nthey will come home to a country where there is opportunity, where \nschools for their children are good, where the environment is clean, \nthe economy is growing, where there are jobs available that are \nchallenging and meaningful to them, and that so long as they remain in \nthe military, their pay, their housing, their quality of life is what \nit deserves to be.\n  Every night when we go home and live in relative comfort, I hope we \nkeep in mind these hundreds of thousands of our troops, who this very \nnight, many of them, are sleeping in a hole in the sand 2 or 3 feet \ndeep to protect themselves from shrapnel during the course of the \nevening, blowing sand, horrible weather, fear of snipers, bombs, \nbiological, chemical warfare that could arise at any moment, and \nappreciate the quality of these troops and how we as a free people \ncould not possibly sustain our freedoms were it not for the willingness \nof these troops, these men and women, to voluntarily step into this \nkind of circumstance and fight this war.\n  I yield to our leader, Senator Daschle. Again, I acknowledge my \ngratitude to him for helping to organize this tribute to our American \ntroops.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am sure everyone can appreciate the \ndifficulty that our Senator from South Dakota has experienced in coming \nto the floor to talk, as he has with pride and enormous appreciation, \nof the commitment made by a member of his own family.\n  On a regular basis, we want to come to the Chamber with our \nRepublican colleagues and call attention to all those who, like Brooks \nJohnson, are now serving in the Persian Gulf. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas for agreeing to help organize today's colloquy \nand reiterate my deep gratitude to my dear friend and colleague, \nSenator Johnson. We thought it would be appropriate today, as we begin \nthis practice, to call the Senate's attention to the fact that Senator \nJohnson is the only Member of this Congress who has a child serving in \nIraq.\n  As he has noted, Brooks, his son, is a staff sergeant with the Army's \n101st Airborne Division. He is 31 years old. I know him, and I can see \nwhy his parents are as proud of him as they are. He is remarkable. He \nhas turned down offers to attend recruiter's school because he said he \nwants to be close to the men he leads.\n  He is 6'1\", 215 pounds, almost all shoulders and biceps. He loves the \nrough-and-tumble of the outdoors. But he also enjoys gourmet cooking \nand Broadway musicals. He is a very thoughtful man, an eloquent \nspeaker. He loves to read the classics. When he was serving in \nAfghanistan, he was reading the history of the Peloponnesian wars.\n  He has known since he was a very young man that he wanted to serve \nand protect our country. He missed his own high school graduation \nbecause he was attending Marine Corps Reserves basic training at Parris \nIsland. He went to college at the University of South Dakota, and \nduring college, Brooks served first in the Marine Corps Reserve, then \nthe Army Reserve, then the Army National Guard.\n  The reason he served in so many branches is that he was looking for a \nunit that was close to college. He wanted to be able to learn and to \nserve at the same time. When he decided to make a life of the military, \nhe chose the Army. He has now been on active duty for 8 years.\n  This is Staff Sergeant Johnson's fourth war in 5 years. He served in \nBosnia. He served in Kosovo. He arrived in Afghanistan in December of \n2001, 2 months after the terrorist attack on America. He served in \nAfghanistan for 6 months.\n  Like so many family members who have loved ones in this war, Tim and \nBarb aren't exactly sure where Brooks is detailed, but they do know his \ndivision has been moved into Iraq.\n  The other day, Tim came to the floor and he shared something with me. \nI hope he doesn't mind if I share it with our colleagues. Brooks sent \nhim a postcard, but this isn't a normal postcard. This is a postcard \ncarved out of the box of an MRE, one of these portable meals that they \ntake with them. I have eaten them myself. They are a box about like \nthis. Well, Brooks carved out one side of an MRE, brown, cardboard box. \nOn one side of that postcard box he wrote a message to his parents. On \nthe other side was the address to his parents and his return address. \nUp in the right-hand corner, instead of a postage stamp, it said \n``free.'' There are a lot of connotations to the word ``free'' on that \npostcard.\n  So we think of Brooks and the freedom he fights for, the freedom he \nhas, and all the things that we cherish as Americans, recognizing that \nBrooks Johnson learned those values from two extraordinary parents.\n  A quarter of a million Americans and several thousand South Dakotans \ntoday serve in the Persian Gulf. We are in awe of their courage. Their \ndedication. Their sacrifice. We are grateful to every one of them and \ntheir families.\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nWe are resolved to ensure they have everything they need so they can be \nsuccessful and return home safely.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems only yesterday that Senator Johnson \nand I were sharing stories about our sons, the athletes. They both were \nback here with their parents in the East while we were in the Congress. \nThey were little boys then. Then they got to where they were in high \nschool, and they were bigger boys, but they were boys. So it is hard to \nimagine now our two boys are grown up. They are adults.\n  Barbara and Tim's son, though, is really grown up. This young man is \nfighting in the deserts, in the sands of Iraq so that we can continue \nto enjoy our freedoms in America.\n  I had to call Tim at home this past Sunday to talk about some of the \nissues we were working on legislatively. I hated to call Tim because I \nam sure he and Barbara at this stage do not like to get phone calls on \nSunday afternoons, during nonworking hours. I am sure Tim and Barbara \nevery night pray for their boy and probably a few times during the day.\n  All of us should recognize that we, too, can join in a prayer for the \nJohnson's son Brooks. We need to do that because you see, what is going \non in Iraq is more than just numbers. We hear numbers such as 250,000 \npeople over there, and we hear talk about skirmishes that have taken \nplace. I pray that Brooks Johnson will return home safely to his \nparents, Tim and Barbara.\n  I received a message yesterday, as we are notified as Senators, when \nsomething happens to someone from our States. Yesterday I received a \nmessage about a young man from Tonopah, NV. It used to be a big booming \ntown where heavyweight prize fights were held, and at the turn of the \nlast century it was a great mining community. Now it is a relatively--\nnot relatively, it is a small place.\n  A man by the name of Frederick Pokorney came there. His parents moved \naround a lot. He wanted to finish high school. He was a sophomore. He \nwas able to stay with the sheriff. Wade Lieseke took in this young man. \nIt was great for Tonopah High School because he was large--6 foot 7, \nvery athletic; he was a linebacker, a center for the basketball team. \nHe was a great young man, quiet and kept to himself.\n  To make a long story short, he went into the military. He was in the \nmilitary for 11 years. He was just made a second lieutenant. He was one \nof the seven who was taken down in an ambush and killed.\n  People who serve in the Iraqi conflict are in harm's way--every one \nof them. My heart goes out to Senator Johnson. Through Tim Johnson, we \nall recognize the ultimate sacrifice that young men and women are \nmaking in Iraq. He represents, in effect, the Congress. He is the only \nMember I am aware of who has a family member serving in that conflict.\n  I congratulate Tim and Barbara for raising such a wonderful son. As I \nsaid, Brooks sets a great example for other young men and women in this \ncountry. I again say I hope that we all celebrate with the Johnsons \nwhen he returns home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nwords. We came to Congress together with Tim Johnson many years ago and \nfeel a special kinship and friendship with Tim and Barbara and the \nfamily.\n  I was fortunate enough to be walking past the Chamber and saw Senator \nTim Johnson speaking and stopped to hear the words he had to say about \nhis son. I thought he showed remarkable composure when he talked about \nhis son who is currently with the Army in Iraq in the midst of this \nbattle. Obviously, he has a great deal of pride and, of course, a great \ndeal of concern, natural concern of any parent.\n  And then to hear Senator Daschle's special tribute to Brooks Johnson \ntold us a little more about this young man, an extraordinary young man \nwho has done so many things in his short life of 31 years and has tried \nover and over to continue to serve his country.\n  What a great reminder of the men and women who are serving their \ncountry overseas today. I am glad this Senate went on record today with \nan incredible vote of 100 to 0 to increase combat pay and the family \nseparation allowance of those who are serving. That is something that \nshould be done, and I am glad we said it today and said it decisively, \nand I hope we move quickly to change the law to help those families.\n  I also wish to say before I yield to my great friend and colleague \nfrom West Virginia, that I thank the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. \nLincoln, who has brought us to the floor now several times to talk \nabout our men and women in uniform. It is important we continue on a \ndaily basis to remind America that this Senate, as well as the \nCongress, is very sensitive to the fact that what is happening on the \nscreens of the television just a few feet away involves real lives and \nreal Americans and that our commitment is to them.\n  The vote in the Senate just last week, 99 to 0 in support of those \nmen and women in uniform, I think shows the current state of affairs in \nAmerica transcends our political differences. We may disagree on \nforeign policy, we may disagree on what led up to this war, but when \nthe first shot was fired, 99 Senators, everyone voting stood up and \nsaid: At this point, make no mistake; we are standing behind our men \nand women in uniform.\n  I have been surprised and disappointed by some of the comments I have \nreceived in my office from a few people, some by e-mail and some by \ntelephone, who have taken exception to that vote. They said: We thought \nyou voted against the use-of-force resolution, and now what are you \ndoing, hedging your bet by saying you support the men and women in \nuniform?\n  What I have said to them and I say on the floor of the Senate is: You \nbetter draw a clear and bright line between the debate on foreign \npolicy and whether or not we stand up for these young men and women who \nhave volunteered to serve their country to risk their lives in battle.\n  I lived through the Vietnam war and remember it as one of the most \nformative experiences in my life and one of the saddest chapters in \nAmerican history, the fact that many people channeled their hatred for \nthe war toward the men and women in uniform. That was unfair. It was \nunfortunate. It should never be repeated.\n  Political leaders make decisions about foreign policy, committing our \ntroops in various parts of the world, and those men and women who are \nsworn to serve the leaders and our Nation meet their call of duty, and \nwe should never forget they did not make the foreign policy decision. \nThey are serving their Nation as we asked them to serve. We should \nnever ever compromise our commitment to them. That is why I think the \nresolution we have adopted, the vote today when it comes to combat pay \nand the tribute on the floor, is a reminder that we stand as one, \nshoulder to shoulder in unity, with these men and women in uniform.\n\n  In the congressional family of 100 Senators and 435 Members of the \nHouse, it turns out we have, to my knowledge, only one son, and that is \nTim Johnson's son, Brooks, who is in our Senate congressional family \nserving our Nation.\n  We are going to be mindful of him. I ask Tim every day: Have you \nheard anything from Brooks? We will be mindful of him, as we are \nmindful of people from my town of Springfield, IL, or my State of \nIllinois who may be in harm's way. It is part of an expanding American \nfamily that we come together in times of fear and in times of crisis.\n  To those who oppose the war, to those who favor peace, please draw \nthat clear bright line: We should never take it out on the men and \nwomen in uniform, no matter how much we may disagree with the policy. \nAnd I think most Americans who feel that way, even those with \nmisgivings with the events that led up to this war, feel this \ncommitment should be singular.\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\n  I mentioned Senator Byrd. Today there is a front-page story in the \nWashington Post about a family in West Virginia--and I imagine he will \nbring our attention to that in his remarks which follow. It, too, tells \nthe story of a young woman, in this case, who made an extraordinary \nsacrifice and is in an usual, unpredictable situation perhaps being \ncaptured in Iraq.\n  I take the floor today to thank Senator Lincoln and Senator Johnson. \nI urge my colleagues, if you can, spare a few moments each day to come \nand tell a story of those you know who are serving this war and serving \nthis Nation so well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, just an hour or so ago, barely 50 feet out \nthis door, many remaining members of the Delaware Army and National \nGuard were gathered. Coincidentally, it was a day that had long been \nscheduled for them to be on the Hill. National Guard associations from \nall over the country have converged on Washington, DC.\n  In the last several weeks, many of their colleagues in the Army and \nNational Guard have since deployed to the Middle East, to the area \naround Iraq, and some to Iraq. On Sunday night, at a National Guard \nheadquarters hangar in Wilmington, DE, at the airport we said goodbye \nto almost 100 of the members of the 166th Military Airlift Command as \nthey set off to join their colleagues and their aircraft on the other \nside of the world. They are the maintainers of the C-130s which are \npart of the air bridge from the United States to Iraq.\n  It starts here with a very large C-5 aircraft and includes the C-17s, \nand at the end of the delivery system, the end of the air bridge, the \nC-130s, the smaller sort of rangers. The maintainers, the members of \nthe 166th who have gone to join their colleagues, are the folks who \nmake sure the landing gear works, the radio works, the hydraulic works, \nthe avionics systems work. Without them we would not have C-130s that \nfunction, and without C-130s we would not have the kind of air bridge \nthat we need to be successful in this war.\n  I was privileged to be there to salute them and send them on their \nway, as were our former Governor, former commander in chief of the \nDelaware National Guard, Mike Castle, our Congressman, and our \nGovernor, our current commander in chief of the Delaware National \nGuard, Ruth Ann Minner. I was privileged to be their commander in chief \nfor much of the last decade when I served as Governor of Delaware.\n  As we said goodbye to the men and women of the 166th, we also had \nimportant words for the families of those who stayed behind, the wives \nand the husbands, the children, the parents of those whose loved ones \nare climbing on to that C-5 and getting prepared to fly thousands of \nmiles from home. In some cases--and I say this as one who deployed on \nseveral occasions as a naval flight officer in the Navy back during the \nVietnam war--the deployment is tougher not on the one being deployed \nbut on the ones who stay behind. To those families we owe a lot because \nthey have shared their loved ones with us, and in many cases they put \ntheir families in difficult straits at a tough time.\n  We voted today on several amendments to the budget resolution which \nare designed to lighten the load a little bit for those who are being \ndeployed, particularly those who are being put into a hazardous place \nto perform their duties. I am grateful for that and would express on \nbehalf of not just the families of the 166th whose loved ones deployed \nthis Sunday but on behalf all the members of the Delaware National \nGuard who are now serving in this war, thank you on their behalf and on \nbehalf of their families for thinking of them, for remembering them \nalong with the other Guard and Reserve men and women who are being \ncalled to active duty around this country.\n  During the time I served on active duty in Southeast Asia, we would \nfrom time to time receive a Reserve air crew that came in usually from \nthe west coast, but flying their P-3 aircraft for 3 years hunting for \nRed October, tracking Soviet nuclear submarines, but also flying low-\nlevel missions along the coast of Vietnam and Cambodia.\n  In those days, back in the early 1970s, when we had a tough and \ndangerous job to do, we would never turn it over to a reserve air crew. \nThe Active-Duty crews would take care of that, and we would be careful \nto send the Reserve air crews on a job where they could not get in \ntrouble or could not get hurt. That was 30-some years ago. Today it is \nsuch a different world. We have guards men and women, activated, \ndeployed, reservists called to active duty who are serving alongside \nfull-time soldiers, sailors, and airmen. They are doing the very same \njobs, dangerous jobs, tough dirty jobs in some cases, and to them we \nowe an enormous debt of gratitude.\n  A closing word to my friend Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota whose \nson is over in Iraq, and I am sure a matter of great concern to him and \nto Barbara, his wife, a concern that is shared by literally tens of \nthousands of families across this country. I say a special prayer for \nBrooks and for the Johnson family, and remember them and all who have \nbeen deployed and serve our Nation at this tough and challenging time.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4426-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4426-S4429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I come to the floor on very sad \nbusiness, both for this body, for my State, and my country. We have \njust received word that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has passed \naway. For those of us who were privileged to know him, to work with \nhim, to admire and respect him, this is a loss beyond my capacity to \nexpress.\n  Senator Moynihan for decades represented the highest ideals and \nvalues of the United States of America. A son of Hell's Kitchen in New \nYork City, he rose to be a confidante and adviser to Presidents. He is \nresponsible for many of the most important ideas and legislative \nprograms that have improved the lives of people in New York, people \nhere in Washington, DC, and our country and around the world.\n  I am very honored to hold the seat that Senator Moynihan held for so \nlong and so well. Along with his wonderful wife Liz Moynihan, they have \nbeen great counselors and advisers to me personally. I will miss him \ngreatly.\n  Sometimes when I sit here on the floor of the Senate, I wish that \nSenator Moynihan could be here in spirit as well as body, that his wise \ncounsel could influence our decisionmaking, that he would remind us \nthat what we do, what we say, what we vote for is not just for today, \nit is for all time. It goes down into the history books. It represents \nthe judgments that we make. It truly displays the values that we claim \nto hold.\n  He understood that being a U.S. Senator was a precious trust. Anyone \nwho ever heard him speak knows the experience of learning more than you \never thought possible in a short period of time. He could explain and \nexpound on such a range of subjects that it took my breath away. I \nremember riding with him through western New York on a bus during the \n1992 campaign and hearing the most exquisite disposition about the \nhistory of the Indian nations, the Revolutionary War, the geological \nformations. The love he had for New York and America was overwhelming \nand so obvious to anyone who spent more than a minute in his company.\n  He also held high standards about what we should expect from this \ngreat country of ours. He wanted us to keep looking beyond the short \nterm, looking beyond the horizon, thinking about the next generation, \nunderstanding the big problems that confront us, having the courage to \ntackle what is not immediately popular, even not immediately \nunderstandable, because that is what we are charged to do in this \ndeliberative body.\n  Senator Moynihan's scholarly undertakings also will stand the test of \ntime.\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nHe sometimes was ahead of his time. In each of his writings or his \nspeeches, whether you agreed with him or not, you were forced to think \nand think hard. He certainly opened my eyes to a lot of difficult \nissues.\n  I could not have had a stronger, more helpful adviser during my \ncampaign than Senator Moynihan. I started my listening tour of my \nexploration of whether or not to run for this office at Pinders Corner, \nhis farm in upstate New York, a place that he loved beyond words.\n  I met him in a little schoolhouse, a 19th century schoolhouse that \nwas on the property where he wrote. He would walk down the road from \nhis house to that little schoolhouse every day where he would think \ndeeply and write about the issues that he knew would be important, not \njust for tomorrow's headline but for years and years to come.\n  There is not any way that anyone will ever fill his place in this \nSenate, not just in the order of succession definition but in the \nintellectual power, the passion, the love of this extraordinary body \nand our country. He will be so missed.\n  On behalf of myself and my family and the people I represent, I \nextend my condolence and sympathy not only to his wonderful family and \nnot only to New Yorkers who elected him time and time again, increasing \nmajorities from one end of the State to the next, but to our country. \nWe have lost a great American, an extraordinary Senator, an \nintellectual, and a man of passion and understanding about what really \nmakes this country great.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in abject sadness on the \nhorrible news that Senator Moynihan has passed from our midst. When it \nwas announced in our caucus that this terrible event had occurred, you \ncould just see the energy come out of the room and the sadness come on \neverybody's face. Senator Moynihan was a unique individual. He wasn't \njust another Senator. He wasn't just another human being. He was very \nspecial.\n  Rarely has one man changed society so with his ideas, the idea that \none man can change society for the better. Senator Moynihan's life was \ntestament to that fact. His life was testament to the fact that one man \nwho just thinks can make an enormous difference. He was truly a giant--\na giant as a thinker, as a Senator, and as a human being. He was a kind \nand compassionate person, a loving husband. Liz, our thoughts go out to \nyou and to all of the Moynihan children and family. I have known him \nfor a very long time.\n\n  When I was a student at Harvard College, I audited his course. I got \nto know him a little bit then. As I went through my congressional \ncareer, we used to have lunch every so often. He was a complete joy to \njust sit down and have lunch with and exchange ideas.\n  He looked out for people. He cared about people. He had real courage. \nWhen he disagreed with the conventional wisdom, nothing would stop Pat \nMoynihan from making his view heard and making it heard in such an \ninteresting and intellectually and thoughtful way.\n  Again, he changed our world for the better. There are hundreds of \nmillions of human beings in this country who do not know it, but he \nmade their lives better. There are billions of people in the world, and \nthrough his work he made their lives better.\n  Senator Moynihan was loved in my home State of New York from one end \nof the State to the other. We are a big, broad, diverse State. It is \nvery hard to find consensus with 19 million New Yorkers, but just about \neverybody loved Pat Moynihan. He did it through a big heart and a great \nmind.\n  He is now with his Maker. I know I will be looking up to the heavens \nfor inspiration, as I looked to Senator Moynihan's office when he was \nstill with us.\n  I very much regret his passing. I pray for the Moynihan family and \nfor the children. I hope God gives us a few more Pat Moynihans in this \nSenate and in this country. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York for his eloquence and his empathy for the family \nespecially of our departed colleague, Pat Moynihan.\n  The Senator from New York used the term ``giant,'' and, indeed, in \nthis case, I can think of no better word to describe the man, the \nmagnitude, the depth, the history, the persona of Pat Moynihan.\n  ``The Almanac of American Politics'' called Pat Moynihan the Nation's \nbest thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician \namong thinkers since Jefferson. Scholar, educator, statesman, adviser \nto four Presidents--Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford--Pat \nMoynihan was the only person in American history to serve in a Cabinet \nor sub-Cabinet position in four successive administrations.\n  As my colleagues have noted, he represented the State of New York for \n24 years in the Senate with unique vision, imagination, intelligence, \nand integrity. In many respects, Pat Moynihan was larger than life, \nwhether on the streets of New York or in the corridors of this Capitol. \nHe was a beloved father, grandfather, friend, and colleague to so many \nof us.\n  I, too, extend my condolences on behalf of the entire Senate to his \nwife Liz, to his children, Tim, Maura, and John, his grandchildren, \nZora and Michael Patrick. New York and the Nation have lost a giant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I was very sorry to learn of the passing \nof our good friend and great Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan. I \nwanted to come and extend condolences on behalf of myself and a lot of \nother Senators to the family, the children, the grandchildren, and the \npeople of New York, and to America because we have lost truly a great \nman in Senator Pat Moynihan.\n  Sometimes people do not realize the types of relationships we do \nbuild in this Chamber across the broad philosophical and partisan \ndivide. But Pat Moynihan was not that kind of man. He was always \nwilling to work with Senators, no matter where they were from or what \ntheir views were, to try to do the right thing.\n  Since I have been watching the Senate over the last 30 years up close \nand personal, as a House Member and a Senator, I have not known a more \nbrilliant and more erudite Senator than the distinguished Senator Pat \nMoynihan of New York. He served his country in so many different \ncritical roles.\n  He studied, wrote papers, and made us realize problems we would just \nas soon not talk about--problems with the children in America, the \nproblems of poverty, the importance of the world community.\n  He did so many exceptional things for Democratic administrations and, \nyes, Republican administrations, and in the majority and in the \nminority in the Senate. I grew to admire him and appreciate him, to \nseek his advice, and even try to get his vote on occasion, and on \noccasion he gave it because I was able to convince him that maybe it \nwas the right thing to do.\n  He also had a sense of humor I learned to appreciate. But more than \nanything, I will remember my encounters with Senator Moynihan in the \nlittle dining room downstairs. About once a week--sometimes not that \noften, maybe once a month--I would go down to get a bite to eat and he \nwould be there. He always ate strange orders of food, I might say, but \nI just loved his knowledge. It became an opportunity for me to learn \nabout the world. I would pick a country: Tell me about India. An hour \nlater he was still talking.\n  I remember one time, I said: I do not quite understand what is going \non in East Timor, and he corrected my pronunciation and told me what \nwas going on in that part of the world, what had happened \nhistorically--such a wealth of knowledge--all the players involved, the \nreligious considerations, what the solutions could have been, what the \nsolutions might be, what the future would hold. More than once--I would \nsay at least three times--before I got back to my office, before the \nafternoon\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\nwas out, a book would arrive that he had written or that I should read \nto understand what was going on in the world. What a special touch.\n  Senator Pat Moynihan tried to help educate this Senator, one who \nneeded a lot of help, but he gave me a greater appreciation of our \nrelationship with countries and people all over the world.\n  This was a giant of a man, a giant of a Senator, a humble man, in \nmany respects. I have missed him since he left the Senate, and we will \nall miss him now that he has gone on to his great reward.\n  I had to come to the floor and express my personal feelings about the \ngreat Senator from New York and how much he meant to me personally, to \nthe Senate, and to the country.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have just heard the saddening news that \nour former colleague, Senator Moynihan of New York, has passed away. \nThis is a great loss for the State of New York, but it is also a great \nloss for the people of the United States. He was one of the truly \noutstanding public servants of his time and one of the intellectual \ntowers of this body.\n  I first met Pat Moynihan when I served in the Nixon administration \nworking at the Department of Transportation. I can say with some \naccuracy that the name Pat Moynihan filled us all with dread and fear \nbecause he was the President's counselor on domestic issues. We were \nafraid he would come to the Department of Transportation and expose all \nof our weaknesses; that with his intellect he could discover very \nquickly where we were doing things wrong.\n  I met him at the White House as we would go over and discuss various \ntransportation issues. On one occasion, Secretary Volpe invited Mr. \nMoynihan to come to the Department and address all of the Department's \nsenior management. We had a program of management dinners where all of \nthe senior officials of the Department would gather together and we \nwould have a speaker come in and talk with us. Mr. Moynihan was the \nfirst of those speakers, along with Bryce Harlow, who came at my \ninvitation, a little later. That was my moment in the sun with \nSecretary Volpe, that I was able to call Bryce Harlow and get him to \ncome over and give the address. I still remember very clearly what Pat \nMoynihan said to us on that occasion and the lesson he gave us.\n\n  Being the student of history that he was, he went back to relatively \nrecent history in describing pivotal events in America. He made this \npoint: Political scientists assume that President Kennedy and President \nJohnson were activist Presidents, whereas President Eisenhower is \nalways described as a passive President, or a pacifist kind of \nPresident. He said that particular characterization is given by their \nopponents, as well as their defenders, people defending Eisenhower's \npassive attitude toward Government, as well as those attacking it, and \nso on with Kennedy and Johnson.\n  However, he said, history will show that President Eisenhower \naffected life in the United States more than all of the things done by \nKennedy and Johnson put together. Why? Because President Eisenhower was \nresponsible for the creation of the interstate highway system.\n  Recognize again, he was addressing a group of officials at the \nDepartment of Transportation. He had done his homework and focused on a \ntransportation issue. He outlined for us the changes in American life \nthat came from the interstate highway system, how cities that were left \noff the system more or less withered and died and other cities that \nfound themselves on the system had tremendous growth; how the system \ncreated efficiency for the transportation of goods and people all over \nthe United States.\n  I remember one statistic, when I worked at the Department of \nTransportation, that said 95 percent of intercity trips took place on \nthe interstate highway system. We focused on travel as being a \ncompetition in those days between air travel and rail travel, and \nindeed in the industrial age, going back to Abraham Lincoln's time and \nafter the Civil War, almost all intercity trips were by rail. Then the \nairlines came in and we talked about the airlines cutting into the rail \nindustry.\n  He pointed out it was not the airline industry that destroyed \nrailroad passenger traffic; It was the interstate highway system and \nthe convenience that came with the opportunity to take one's own \nautomobile and go from one city to the other and then have local \ntransportation while there. They did not have to catch a cab when they \ncame out of the train station. They brought it with them.\n  It was this ability to see beyond the specifics of conventional \nwisdom, step back and see the overall picture that defined Pat \nMoynihan. He did it for us in that particular speech, but he did it \nthroughout his entire career.\n\n  I remember as we became acquainted that he talked with me about the \nwork he did with my father when my father was in the Senate and he was \nin the Nixon administration. They were talking about programs that the \nNixon administration tried to put into place which, for one reason or \nanother, the Congress did not accept. He said to me, if we had \nprevailed in that program that Wallace Bennett was for, we wouldn't \nhave many of the urban problems that we have today.\n  I won't try to imitate his accent because it was distinctly his and \nwas part of his charm.\n  One of the things that I had not understood but that I came to know \nwhile Pat Moynihan was in the Senate was the role he played in the \nrejuvenation of Washington, DC. The story is told and accepted as \nconventional wisdom that when John F. Kennedy went in his inaugural \nparade from the Capitol to the White House, he noticed how rundown \nPennsylvania Avenue was--and it was. Those of us who remember \nPennsylvania Avenue in the 1960s remember it as a place of rundown \nseedy shops and disreputable buildings that were badly in need of \nreplacement. The conventional wisdom is that John F. Kennedy noticed \nthat as he went by in his limousine and said, We have to do something \nabout that. And the rejuvenation of Pennsylvania Avenue began in the \nKennedy administration.\n  In fact, that is not true. It was not John F. Kennedy who noticed it; \nit was Pat Moynihan who noticed it and called it to the attention of \nJohn F. Kennedy, who, then, in the spirit of all of us in politics, \ntook his staffer's advice and put it forward as his own.\n  Pat Moynihan, as chairman of what we used to call the Public Works \nCommittee--now it is the Environment and Public Works Committee--Pat \nMoynihan, of what we used to call the Public Works Committee, presided \nover the public works that saw to it that Pennsylvania Avenue was \nturned into the kind of memorial avenue that the world's greatest power \ndeserves; that it changed from what it had been to become the \narchitectural delight that it is today.\n  I had not realized that until I read Pat Moynihan's memos. He shared \nthem with me, in another circumstance, and going through the memos I \nrealized he was personally the driving force behind that kind of an \neffort. That demonstrates how much of a renaissance man he was. He was \ninterested in architecture. He was interested in art. He was one of \nthose who helped create the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Yes, as a legislator he was interested in public issues and public \npolicy, but as a renaissance man he remained interested in just about \neverything else.\n  I can't think of any career covering a wider number of opportunities \nthan his: Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador to India, \nserving Presidents regardless of party, regardless of ideology, with \nwisdom, clarity, and again the ability to see the big picture, the \noverall historical circumstance, and not just the issue directly in \nfront of him.\n  I remember when he was chairman of the Finance Committee and we were \nlocked in this Chamber in a bitter battle over health care. He did his \nduty. He was the good soldier. He did his best to carry the water for \nthe administration. But in private conversations with him he would \ncandidly share some of\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\nthe same concerns that the rest of us had. While he was the good \nsoldier all the way to the end, I know he gave the administration Dutch \nuncle advice as to what they should be doing.\n  I remember sitting in the Cabinet Room of the White House when \nPresident Clinton had a group of us down to talk about what we needed \nto do to get trade authority, to get fast track. All of us were being \nappropriately respectful of the President, as you are in that kind of \ncircumstance. All of us were trying to put forward our opinions in as \ntender and gingerly expressed a way as we could because we were with \nthe President. Pat Moynihan sat at the President's left and the \nPresident said; ``What do we need to do to get trade authority \npassed?''\n  He said; ``Sir, you need to get more Democrats.''\n  That warmed my heart. The Republicans were in favor of fast track. We \ndidn't want to say it. And Pat Moynihan summarized it: ``Sir, you need \nto get more Democrats.''\n  The President looked at him and said; ``Pat, you are absolutely \nright. How do we do that?''\n  Then they had a very candid discussion.\n  He was not overly awed by anyone, regardless--with respect to their \nposition. But he was always awed by any human being who had something \nto tell him. His attitude was that he could learn from anyone.\n  His health was not the best. His passing is not unexpected. But this \nis a time for us to rejoice in the opportunity of having known him, \nhaving worked with him in this body and having been blessed by his \nintellect, his humor, his humility, and his great understanding. We \nshall miss him, and we express our great condolence to his wife Liz and \nto all of the members of his family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I had the opportunity to hear \nthe Senator from Utah talk about our friend Pat Moynihan because in \n1969 the Senator from Utah and I had different jobs. I was working for \nBryce Harlow in the White House and he was working for Secretary Volpe, \nboth of us in the Nixon administration.\n  One of the things I think many people will look at, about the Nixon \nadministration, is what an extraordinarily diverse group of individuals \nthe President was able to attract. The Senator from Utah and I were \nyoung persons. I am not talking about us at that time. But I am talking \nabout Henry Kissinger and Arthur Burns and Bryce Harlow and foremost \namong them was Pat Moynihan.\n  Particularly when we look at a Washington, DC, where so many issues \nare so divisive and so partisan--and there was a lot of partisanship \nback then. Look back at 1969. Here was Pat Moynihan, a Harvard \nprofessor, Kennedy Democrat, who became the Republican President's \ndomestic policy adviser. He was an extraordinary person. He was, as the \nSenator from Utah pointed out, a man who could see a long distance.\n  In the 1960s he coined the phrase ``benign neglect,'' when he talked \nabout the breakdown of the American family and the effect it might have \non African-American families. He was courageous enough to talk about \nthat. He predicted at that time that if the rate of breakdown of \nfamilies that was then occurring among African-American families were \nto occur among all families, it would be a catastrophe for America. \nThat percentage has long since passed. Pat Moynihan was willing to talk \nabout it.\n  He was a great teacher. He attracted into the White House at that \ntime a cadre of young Moynihan devotees who are still around today--for \nexample, Checker Finn, a young Harvard graduate who is a leading \neducation expert; and Chris DeMuth, who has had a distinguished career \nhere. All of those young people were attracted by his intellect and his \nsense of public service.\n  He had an ability even then to be a person who crossed party lines. \nHe was one of the old Democratic liberals such as Al Shanker--some of \nthem are now called neoconservatives today--who saw our country in a \nvery accurate and clear way.\n  He believed in America. He was an immigrant, a great immigrant, an \nIrish immigrant, with all the characteristics that we think of when we \nthink of great Irish immigrants, but he was an American first. He was \nproud of where he came from but he was prouder of the country to which \nhe came.\n  He loved politics. His favorite character was George Washington \nPlunkett, the boss of Tammany Hall. He wrote a forward for a book on \nPlunkett. Plunkett's favorite comment was:\n\n       I seen my opportunities and I took them.\n\n  He went to the United Nations where he pounded the desk. He went to \nIndia as Ambassador. He ran for the Senate. Think of this. He ran in \n1976, a Republican from the then-disgraced Nixon administration. I know \nwhat that was like. I was in that administration. I had been a \ncandidate myself in 1974--lost; and here was Pat Moynihan in New York \nState, a Democratic State, running for the Senate as a Democrat, able \nto be elected because of the respect people had for him.\n  I watched him during his whole career. When I was Education Secretary \nhe came down and lectured me from this body because he wanted me to be \nmore aggressive on standards. But he was always such a gentle person.\n  As I have gone along in life, I have especially appreciated people \nwho are well known and famous who take time for people who are not so \nwell known and famous. I can remember when my wife and I, in our early \n30s--I was, she was younger--went to Harvard, to the John F. Kennedy \nSchool of Government, where Pat had gone in the early 1970s. He was a \nfamous man, a great professor, a former adviser to Presidents. Everyone \nknew him. No one knew us. But he saw us and he spent 45 minutes or an \nhour with us. He was a teacher and we were his students.\n  I am glad to be on the floor today to hear my friend from Utah speak \nof such a distinguished American. We need more Senators, more public \nleaders, with the breadth and the intellect and the understanding of \nAmerican history that Pat Moynihan had. We need more who have the \ncapacity to work across party lines, to solve tough problems such as \nSocial Security, which he helped to solve, and to enjoy politics, to \nlove George Washington Plunkett, and the rough and tumble of Tammany \nHall politics, but at the same time, when the Nation's issues are \nforemost, to put them first.\n\n  So I rise today to salute a great American, a real patriot, and \nperhaps a person who most of us--Senators or students--will remember as \na great teacher.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4429-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4429-S4430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we passed the budget resolution 56 to \n44. I want to end what has been a very productive week on this budget \nresolution--the debate and the vote earlier this afternoon--by \ncongratulating the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, \nfor doing an outstanding job in terms of leadership, in terms of \nkeeping this train moving on time, so that legislative process will be \nable to go forward in a timely way.\n  In addition, there are so many others to thank, but in particular I \nthank Senator Judd Gregg from New Hampshire, who spent so much time on \nthe floor debating the various amendments and supporting the budget \nresolution and its ultimate passage today.\n  In addition, on that committee, there are seven new Republican \nmembers. I thank them. The budget process is one that I had the \nopportunity to address first through that committee in my first 8 years \nin the Senate. I know it has been an eye-opening experience for them. \nThey did a tremendous job in supporting their leader, their chairman in \naccomplishing this resolution passage today.\n  In addition--and it has been mentioned on the floor several times \nthis afternoon since we voted on the bill--we have had a very \ncooperative spirit. People have been able to express their\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nopinions, to debate, to articulate their views as to what is \nappropriate to establish their priorities. But at the end of today--\nthis afternoon, shortly after 4 o'clock--I think we can all be proud, \non both sides of the aisle, for developing a product that reflects that \ndebate, that reflects the will of the Senate.\n  I congratulate Members on the other side of the aisle, the ranking \nmember, Senator Kent Conrad, the assistant Democratic leader, Harry \nReid, and Minority Leader Daschle for their cooperation in moving this \nresolution to a conclusion today.\n  I thank the staffs. It has been done on the floor already today, but \nI thank the staffs, under the direction of Hazen Marshall and Mary \nNaylor, for their long hours and dedication to the process. We saw \ntheir participation here on the floor. And in addition to that time on \nthe floor, they have spent many hours developing this budget, they and \ntheir staff. I thank them because without their hard work, their \ntremendous dedication, what we have accomplished today simply would not \nhave been possible.\n  Today, we did accomplish a lot in passing this budget resolution. I \nsay that because it was on the backdrop of last year, where we were \nunable even to bring a budget to the floor of the Senate. We were \nunable to ever see the conclusion that we saw today in this vote.\n  I understand--and we all understand--this is the first step, the next \nis the conference, and then the reconciliation. But what we have done \ntoday is to establish the framework for that legislative process. It \nhas taken a lot of cooperation on both sides of the aisle.\n  The resolution today, in terms of the jobs and growth package, is, \nindeed, less than what I had preferred as we come forward. But the \nmajority of people in this body did speak today. I do want to tell the \nMembers on our side of the aisle that I will continue to work to \nachieve the growth in this resolution because I think it is important. \nIn fact, it is incumbent upon us to address those jobs and growth \nissues to stimulate the economy, both in the short term, midterm, and \nlong term.\n\n  Again, that process has just begun. The resolution today accomplishes \na lot. I am not going to go through the various priorities that were \nplaced, but it establishes fiscal discipline on the spending side. It \ndoes that through what we call pay-go and certain spending caps. But it \nis important the American people understand that what we have done is \nslowed that growth of spending, which is absolutely critical to do in \nthis environment of deficits.\n  It strengthens and improves Medicare. That is our health care system \nand program for our seniors and our individuals with disabilities. It \ntakes a major step forward to strengthen and improve that program so \nthat we can better serve our seniors, so they will have more security \nin terms of their health in the future.\n  In terms of our national defense and homeland security needs, it sets \nthose parameters to accommodate that necessary funding, as spelled out \nby the Budget Committee, by the priorities in the Senate, and the \nCommander in Chief, the President of the United States.\n  Fourthly, it increases funding for that much broader spectrum of \neducation in an unprecedented way. It includes education K-12, IDEA--\nthat is the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act--for title I, \nand then there is veterans health and an initiative that is important \nto this body, global HIV/AIDS.\n  But you wrap all that together and, most importantly, I think what we \naccomplished today is that we allow this legislative process to \ncontinue in an orderly, systematic way, to accomplish our \nresponsibilities in this institution of the Senate.\n  We are on course to finish the conference report of this budget by \nApril 11. The law says that we do it by April 15. I think, just as we \nhave today, we will be able to pass that in advance, not just on time, \nbut in advance a few days.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Nickles for being so instrumental in this \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4430-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise with sadness on the word we heard \nthis evening with regard to the death of one of our most notable former \nMembers this afternoon.\n  Daniel Patrick Moynihan served in the Senate over a period from 1977 \nto 2001. But he served our country in so many different roles over the \npast half century, as we have heard through other tributes tonight. \nRising from the depths of Hell's Kitchen in New York, he became one of \nAmerica's true leading intellectuals whose foresight and whose ability \nbrought to public attention a mass of critical issues long before \nothers even realized these issues existed. From identifying the \nstresses and challenges of urban America to spearheading the \nreformation of Pennsylvania Avenue, from President Nixon's welfare \nreform plan to Y2K, from Soviet spying to bringing our national \nsecurity state into the sunshine, Pat Moynihan was at the center of \nmost of our public policy challenges in the last half of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Pat Moynihan, a confidant and essential aide to Presidents of both \nparties, came to Washington's attention in the early 1960s as a steward \nof President Kennedy's effort to bring Pennsylvania Avenue back to \nlife. His ability brought him to President Nixon's Cabinet as head of \nthe Domestic Policy Council, and he later became Ambassador to India \nand Gerald Ford's Ambassador to the United Nations, where he served so \nwell defending the West against totalitarian regimes.\n  Elected to the Senate in a notable class, he quickly became a leading \nvoice on an extensive range of public policy. While the Senate \nrecognized his ability as chairman of both the Finance Committee and \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, his contributions to our \nwork were broad and deep.\n  For example, at a time when Social Security was reeling and near \ninsolvency, Pat Moynihan stepped forward and, with Senator Dole, Alan \nGreenspan, and President Reagan, rescued the system for the benefit of \nmillions of Americans. In that role, he bridged partisan differences \nand rose above petty politics to forge a successful solution that \nbrought stability and security to that system. He did that conscious of \nthe need to be responsible not only to the current recipients but to \nthe future beneficiaries who at the time were not even born.\n  This spirit animated his observations and animated his work, not just \non Social Security but other great domestic programs, such as Medicaid, \nMedicare, and welfare.\n  Daniel Patrick Moynihan served not only as a Senator from New York, \nhe was one of our leading lights and innovative thinkers. He never \nhesitated to offer a timely observation, a useful insight, or a \nhistorical analogy that not only demonstrated his vast knowledge but \nwas truly useful in analyzing the challenges ahead. His contributions \nto public policy and his influence in this Chamber will echo for \ndecades to come.\n  Indeed, our condolences go out to his family and to loved ones, as \nwell as to his many friends and former staff members. We are a better \ninstitution, and we are all better public servants for having known Pat \nMoynihan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4430-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4430-S4431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NAVY LIEUTENANT THOMAS MULLEN ADAMS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to pay tribute to another American--and another Californian--\nkilled in the line of duty. His name: LT Thomas Mullen Adams, of La \nMesa. He was only 27.\n  Yesterday, I spoke of LCpl Jose Gutierrez, a young immigrant from \nGuatemala who was struck down trying to liberate the Iraqi port city of \nUmm al Qasar. Corporal Gutierrez was an orphan who first settled in a \nhomeless shelter in Hollywood, before being taken in by foster parents.\n  Lieutenant Adams, on the other hand, grew up in comfort, in the \nsuburbs, as a member of a family that traces its roots directly to John \nAdams, one of America's most important Founding Fathers.\n  On the surface, there seems little in common with Corporal Gutierrez \nand Lieutenant Adams. But together, they embody the depth and breadth \nof America's Armed Forces--men and women from all walks of life, \nwilling to give their lives to defend our freedoms.\n  Lieutenant Adams graduated from Grossmont High School in 1993 and the \nUnited States Naval Academy in 1997.\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\n  He received flight training in Pensacola, FL, and inherited his love \nof flying from his father, John, an architect who helped design the \nAerospace Museum in San Diego.\n  Promoted to lieutenant in the year 2000, Adams won two National \nDefense Service Medals, three Sea Service Deployment Ribbons and other \nawards.\n  ``He's one of these amazingly clean-cut, all-American kids,'' his \naunt, Elizabeth Hansen, told the San Diego Union Tribune newspaper. \n``He's the kind of kid that if you had a very special daughter, you \nwould hope that she would snag him. He was just amazingly bright, funny \nand kind.''\n  In October of 2002, Lieutenant Adams was assigned as an exchange \nofficer with the British Royal Navy's 849 Squadron, now on the aircraft \ncarrier Ark Royal.\n  An avid soccer fan who had volunteered to go to Japan with the \ncarrier Kitty Hawk in time for the World Cup finals last summer, he \njoined a local team near his base in Helston, England. Lieutenant \nAdams' family said that he particularly enjoyed his time with the Royal \nNavy for two reasons: every ship had a pub on board, and he was allowed \na weekly 20-minute phone call home.\n  ``This is an extremely close family, and none of us will ever be the \nsame,'' said his aunt, Elizabeth Hansen. ``All of us just remember him \nas a fun-loving guy with a wry sense of humor and we can't imagine \ngoing forward without him.''\n  I can only hope that they do go forward. And it is to his family--to \nhis parents, John and Marilyn, and his younger sister, Cari--that I \nextend my deepest sympathies.\n  All Americans owe an enormous--an almost incalculable--debt to LT \nThomas Mullen Adams, who accepted great risk and was willing to \nsacrifice his future for the future of the country he so clearly loved, \nso that we, as a people, might be safe and free. His sacrifice will \nnever be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4431-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA SERVICEMAN KILLED IN IRAQ\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we pray for all those who are in harm's \nway, I rise to pay tribute to a Californian who was killed in the Iraqi \nwar.\n  Marine Corps Cpl Randal Kent Rosacker, age 21, of San Diego, CA, was \nkilled on Sunday, March 23, when he encountered Iraqi troops pretending \nto surrender. He graduated in 2000 from San Diego's Junipero Serra High \nSchool where he was a star baseball player.

Mr. President, on March 20, President Bush ordered U.S. \nforces to begin attacking Iraqi installations. There are currently \n225,000 American service men and women in the Persian Gulf region. Two \nhundred thousand members of the Reserves and National Guard have been \ncalled to active duty. Several thousand Connecticut residents are doing \ntheir part--1,500 members of Connecticut's National Guard; 750 deployed \nto the Middle East and another 750 activated to participate in homeland \nsecurity related responsibilities. There are also 2,778 of \nConnecticut's sons and daughters serving in the Navy--active members \nand reservists, 532 in the Army, and 310 in the Air Force. Dozens of \nConnecticut's police officers and firefighters have been called up for \nactive duty. I thank each and every one of them. And say to them that I \nam proud and honored to represent them in the United States Senate.\n  As is always the case, these young men and women stand ready to obey \nthe orders of the Commander in Chief--the President of the United \nStates--to take up arms and risk their lives in defense of all \nAmericans and the values of freedom, liberty, and democracy. I greatly \nadmire the courage and professionalism of our service men and women who \nare now engaged in this dangerous conflict far away from home and loved \nones. Americans stand as one in support of these brave individuals. I \nalso want to express my gratitude to the family members of our \nsoldiers. They more than anyone understand the sacrifices involved in \nthe service of our country. War is a treacherous endeavor, and we will \nall pray for their safe return. I am confident that in the days and \nweeks to come, America and the U.S. Congress will continue to provide \nour service men and women with all the support they need and deserve.\n  Over the last several months, my colleagues and I have engaged in an \nongoing dialog about when and under what circumstances the U.S. should \ncommence military action in Iraq. I have been a participant in these \nimportant debates, as have many others in this Chamber. And across the \ncountry, in cities and towns, Americans have also been discussing these \nissues with their families and neighbors. Many have voiced strong \nopinions. It is right and appropriate that this has occurred--that is \nwhat living in a free country is all about.\n  Last Fall, I supported President Bush's decision to go the United \nNations and seek the support of U.N. members to resolve the threat \nposed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. I supported the deployment \nof U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq to verify its peaceful disarmament. \nAs much as anyone, I wanted those diplomatic efforts to succeed. I \nbelieve that President Bush did as well. Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein \nobviously did not.\n  While there may have been differing opinions on some aspects of our \npolicy toward Iraq, there has been no disagreement that Saddam Hussein \nis anything but a cruel and murderous tyrant. At every critical \njuncture, Saddam Hussein chose to impede the work of the inspectors. At \nevery fork in the road, he chose to squander opportunities for peaceful \ndisarmament presented to him by the international community. Finally \ntime has run out.\n  And now, Saddam Hussein must bear full responsibility for what is \nabout to befall him. He brought it upon himself. I have no sympathy for \nhis plight. The real tragedy is that others may have to suffer for his \nsins--although I am confident that American soldiers will make every \neffort, use every means of intelligence, and employ all available \ntechnology to minimize civilian casualties.\n  Would that Saddam Hussein had shown the same regard for his people \nthat our forces will. His record has been the opposite. This murderous \ntyrant has routinely had his own people tortured, raped, beaten, and \nexecuted. In 1988, he ordered the use of chemical weapons against the \nIraqi people, killing 5,000 men, women, and children in a single day. \nNow, he may be ordering his elite troops to use the city of Baghdad as \na fortress--a human fortress--endangering the lives of countless Iraqi \ncivilians.\n  It is my hope that United States military action will not only free \nthe world of the dangers posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction, but provide an opportunity for the Iraqi people to free \nthemselves from 30 years of tyranny and oppression, to begin a new \nchapter in the history of their country.\n\n  The current military action may only last a few days or a few weeks. \nBut in the end, I have not doubt that our American service men and \nwomen will prevail in this conflict. However, after we emerge \nsuccessfully from our military conflict with Saddam Hussein, another \nchallenge will face us--the task of establishing a free and stable \nIraq. In many ways this is an even more important battle then the one \ncurrently ongoing in the deserts of Iraq. And it is a battle that we \nshould not ``wage'' alone. An international coalition of friends, \nallies, and U.N. humanitarian organizations must be mobilized to share \nthe costs and responsibility for providing humanitarian relief to the \nIraqi people, and the larger and more complex reconstruction of Iraqi \nsociety.\n  The United States is not the only nation that has a stake in \nrebuilding Iraq. The entire world has a huge stake in getting this \nright. For only an Iraq that is strong, free, and democratic--only an \nIraq that respects the rights of all its citizens--only an Iraq that \nrespects the territorial integrity of its neighbors--can be counted on \nto contribute to building a Middle East that is stable and prosperous. \nThat is why I\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\nam confident that whatever our past differences may have been, our \nfriends and allies at the United Nations will join with us in this \neffort.\n  Once again let me express my thanks to the American men and women who \nhave put themselves at risk for each one of us. Let me also thank the \nservice members from other nations who have joined with our forces in \nthis endeavor. And let me offer one more prayer for their swift and \nsafe return home once their mission is complete.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4432-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 16, \n2001, in Eagan, MN. An Indian-American woman left a grocery store \nfollowed by three teenage boys. One of them pushed her against her car. \nWhen she turned, another punched her in the stomach and then elbowed \nher in the back. As they left, the assailants said, ``This is what you \npeople deserve.''\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today to ask my colleagues to \nsupport the nomination of Mr. Harold Damelin, whom President Bush has \nnominated to serve as the next Inspector General, IG, of the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration, (SBA). Mr. Damelin's extensive experience in \nand out of government makes him very well suited to this important \nposition, and I look forward to working closely with him and his \noffice.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, the IG post at any Federal agency is \na critical one--assigned by Congress the duties of protecting taxpayer \nmoney, ensuring that laws are upheld, and investigating abuses within \nan agency. This is no less true at the SBA, which has played a vital \nrole in helping to develop and foster small businesses and small \nbusiness initiatives for the past 50 years.\n  The role of the IG is unique: someone who is above the political fray \nof other appointees, and someone who may even be called upon to \ninvestigate them. By their very nature, IG's must function \nindependently and with a distinct authority, so it is no small amount \nof trust the President and the Congress must place in any IG. \nAdditionally, an IG must possess not only managerial and policy \nexperience, but should possess investigative experience as well. Fining \nsuch a candidate can be a difficult task.\n  Phyllis Fong, the former IG for the SBA, was recently confirmed as \nthe IG for the Department of Agriculture, where I am sure she will \ncontinue to perform her official duties in a skillful, competent, and \nefficient manner. However, because of a delay in her confirmation, the \nIG position at the SBA was only recently vacated. Given this delay, \ncoupled with the importance of the IG position, Senator Snowe, the \nChair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and I \nhave agreed to seek unanimous consent that Mr. Damelin's nomination be \ndischarged from the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nand considered immediately by the full Senate.\n  In my capacity as ranking member, I have thoroughly reviewed Mr. \nDamelin's employment and educational experience, his FBI background \ncheck and the Committee questionnaire. Mr. Damelin has fully answered \nall questions put before him. As Mr. Damelin clearly possesses the \nnecessary skills and experience to serve as the next SBA IG, I support \nmoving forward with his nomination at this time.\n  Mr. Damelin, if confirmed by the Senate, will come to the SBA from \nthe private sector, where he most recently worked as a lawyer for the \nfirm of Powers, Pyles, Sutter and Verville in Washington, DC. Prior to \njoining the private sector, Mr. Damelin had a long and illustrious \ncareer as a public servant, holding such positions as the branch chief \nfor the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division, Fraud Section, \nGovernmental Fraud Branch and the senior counsel to the majority for \nthe Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs' Special Investigation \nCommittee. I believe these experiences and others uniquely qualify Mr. \nDamelin to serve as the SBA's IG.\n  Mr. Damelin was born in Malden, in my home State of Massachusetts, \nalthough he now resides in Virginia. He attended Boston College and \nearned his JD from Boston College Law School, also my alma mater. Mr. \nDamelin was also a member of the Armed Forces, serving as a 2nd \nLieutenant after college and attaining the rank of Captain in the Army \nReserves before being honorably discharged with the rank of Captain. I \nam always pleased to see a fellow Bay Stater, and Eagle, dedicate his \nenergies toward public service, and this is no exception.\n  Mr. Damelin's nomination also has the support of Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee Chair Olympia Snowe.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to vote in favor of Mr. Damelin's \nnomination to be the next Inspector General of the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4432-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        NORWICH UNIVERSITY CADETS, ICE HOCKEY NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

Norwich is a school of honor and tradition, \nqualities well-reflected in their champion ice hockey team. The Cadets \nplay with discipline, energy, and confidence.

Mr. President, I have the honor of rising today \nto recognize Ms. Elizabeth Namusoke Kizito of Louisville, KY. Earlier \nthis month, Ms. Kizito was named Woman Business Owner of the Year by \nthe Louisville chapter of the National Association of Women Business \nOwners.\n  Ms. Kizito is being honored for demonstrating smart business \npractices that have led to the success of Kizito Cookies located in \nLouisville. Almost 20 years ago, Ms. Kizito began her entrepreneurial \nexperience by selling cookies as a way to pay for her son's birthday \npresent. Shortly thereafter, she had enough business to begin selling \ncookies from a street cart. Within a few years she traded her cart for \na bakery on Bardstown Road. What sets Kizito Cookies apart from other \nbusinesses are Ms. Kizito's superior marketing skills. Dressed in \ntraditional garb from her native country of Uganda, she sells cookies \nfrom a basket\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nplaced atop her head. Many Louisvillians affectionately refer to her as \nthe ``Cookie Lady.''\n  Her African heritage plays a dominant part in her life and business. \nBorn in Uganda during the 1950s, she moved to America to attend school. \nUnfortunately, civil unrest resulting in a civil war prevented her from \nreturning to Uganda. She moved to Louisville in 1978 and began making \ncookies for coworkers, a skill she learned from her father who ran a \nbakery in Uganda. Each year she travels to her home country and even \nprovides financial assistance to her relatives. Ms. Kizito continues \nhonoring her roots by passing along to the people of Louisville a piece \nof her culture.\n  Ms. Kizito's hard work and dedication are inspiring. She has created \na great deal from very little, and in the process made an entire \ncommunity her friend. Please join me in congratulating Ms. Elizabeth \nNamusoke Kizito on this much deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4433-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4433-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4433-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:18 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 7401 West 100th Place in Bridgeview, \nIllinois, as the ``Michael J. Healy Post Office Building''; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to name \nthe U.S. Post Office at 7401 W. 100th Place in Bridgeview, IL after \nPostal Police Officer Michael Healy.\n  On June 21, 1981, while guarding the Chicago Main Post Office at \nHarrison Avenue and Canal Street, Officer Healy's life was senselessly \ncut short by a random act of violence. Officer Healy was murdered by \nthree assailants in a foiled robbery attempt. Sadly, Michael Healy \nbecame the first officer of the Postal Inspection Service to be killed \nwhile on duty.\n  Shortly after his murder, the Postal Inspection Service retired \nMichael's badge, number 3972. Subsequently, Michael's name was added to \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, DC as well as the \nLaw Enforcement Memorial in Springfield, IL.\n  In 2001, the Northern Illinois Division of the United States \nInspection Service honored the 20th anniversary of Michael's death. The \nFraternal Order of Police, FOP, has tried for two years to rename the \nlocal post office after Officer Healy.\n  In protecting others, Officer Healy made the ultimate sacrifice. I \nbelieve it is fitting to pay tribute to him by designating the postal \nfacility in honor of Michael J. Healy. I think that it is the most \nappropriate way to recognize and remember a man who gave so much to his \nfamily, his friends, the Postal Inspection Service, and his community \nof Hometown, IL.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Levin):\n  S. 710. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide that aliens who commit acts of torture, extrajudicial killings, \nor other specified atrocities abroad are inadmissible and removable and \nto establish within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice \nan Office of Special Investigations having responsibilities under that \nAct with respect to all alien participants in war crimes, genocide, and \nthe commission of acts of torture and extrajudicial killings abroad; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased today to introduce the Anti-Atrocity Alien \nDeportation Act of 2003, a bill intended to close loopholes in our \nimmigration laws that have allowed war criminals and human rights \nabusers to enter and remain in this country. Senator Hatch has joined \nme in offering this bill, along with Senators Lieberman and Levin. In \nthe other body, Representatives Mark Foley and Gary Ackerman today \nintroduce identical legislation.\n  Our bill would update the charter of the Justice Department's Office \nof Special Investigations, OSI, which for years has investigated and \nhas sought justice in the cases of Nazi war criminals who have sought \nrefuge on our shores. It is time to renew the OSI charter to take into \naccount the new generations of war criminals who try to escape justice \nby living among us.\n  This bill closely mirrors legislation I had offered that was reported \nunanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, and which \npassed the Senate during the 106th Congress. I hope and expect that, \nwith the help of Senator Hatch and others, this bill will become law \nduring this Congress.\n  As we introduce this bill, our armed forces are fighting to replace \nan Iraqi regime that has been marked by its utter disregard for the \nhuman rights of its people. We must not fight this war on the one hand, \nand let human rights abusers from around the world enter our Nation \nwith impunity on the other.\n  When they learn it is so, the American people are appalled to learn \nthat our country has become a safe haven for those who exercised power \nin foreign countries to terrorize, rape, murder and torture innocent \ncivilians. A report issued last year by Amnesty International claims \nthat nearly 150 alleged human rights abusers have been identified \nliving here and warns that this number may be as high as 1,000. \nMeanwhile, an article in the New York Review of Books stated that \n``hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign nationals who have been \nplausibly accused of the most heinous human rights crimes, including \ntorture and assassination, either have lived or still live freely in \nthe U.S.'' [William Schulz, ``The Torturers Among Us,'' New York \nReview, p. 22, April 25, 2002.]\n  I introduced a similar version of this bill on May 10, 2001, and the \nJudiciary Committee reported the bill with a Leahy-Hatch managers' \namendment on April 18, 2002. Unfortunately, the bill was subject to an \nanonymous hold on the Senate floor.\n  I introduced similar legislation in the 106th Congress and was \npleased when the proposal garnered bipartisan support in both the House \nand the Senate. The legislation passed the Senate on November 5, 1999, \nas part of S. 1754, the Hatch-Leahy ``Denying Safe Havens to \nInternational and War Criminals Act,'' but unfortunately it was not \nacted on by the House before the end of the 106th Congress. \nNevertheless, Representatives Foley and Ackerman have provided \nconsistent leadership in moving this legislation in the House, by \nintroducing the measure in the l06th Congress as H.R. 2642 and H.R. \n3058, in the 107th Congress, as H.R. 1449, and again today.\n  The problem of human rights abusers seeking and obtaining refuge in \nthis country is real, and requires an effective response with the legal \nand enforcement changes proposed in this legislation.\n  For example, three Ethiopian refugees proved in an American court \nthat\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nKelbessa Negewo, a former senior government official in the military \ndictatorship that ruled Ethiopia in the 1970s, engaged in numerous acts \nof torture and human rights abuses against them when they lived in that \ncountry. Negewo oversaw and participated in the torture of opposition \npolitical figures in Ethiopia, and then moved to the United States only \nto work at the same Atlanta hotel as one of his own victims. The \ncourt's descriptions of the abuse are chilling, and included whipping a \nnaked woman with a wire for hours and threatening her with death in the \npresence of several men. The court's award of compensatory and punitive \ndamages in the amount of $1.5 million to the plaintiffs was \nsubsequently affirmed by an appellate court. [See Abebe-Jira v. Negewo, \n72 F.3d 844 (11th Cir. 1996).] Yet during the pendency of his appeal of \nthe civil verdict, the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted \nNegewo citizenship.\n  This situation is an affront both to the foreign victims of torture \nwho fled here to escape their persecutors, and to the American victims \nof such torture and their families. As Professor William Aceves of \nCalifornia Western School of Law has noted, this case reveals ``a \nglaring and troubling limitation in current immigration law and \npractice. This case is not unique. Other aliens who have committed \ngross human rights violations have also gained entry into the United \nStates and been granted immigration relief.'' [20 Mich. J. Int'l.L. at \n657.]\n  Indeed, another case actually involves American victims. In 1980, \nfour American churchwomen were raped and murdered by the Salvadoran \nNational Guard. Two former Salvadoran government officials who \nallegedly covered up the murders currently reside in Florida.\n  Unfortunately, criminals who wielded machetes and guns against \ninnocent civilians in countries like Haiti, Chile, Yugoslavia and \nRwanda have been able to gain entry to the United States through the \nsame doors that we have opened to deserving refugees. We need to lock \nthat door to human rights abusers who seek a safe haven in the United \nStates. To those human rights abusers who are already here, we should \npromptly show them the door out.\n  We have unwittingly sheltered the oppressors along with the oppressed \nfor too long. We should not let this situation continue. We waited too \nlong after World War II to focus prosecutorial resources and attention \non Nazi war criminals who entered this country on false pretenses, or \nworse, with the collusion of American intelligence agencies. Thousands \nof declassified CIA documents were made public last year, as a result \nof the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act that I was proud to help enact in \n1998. These documents made clear the extent to which the United States \nrelied upon and helped Nazi war criminals. As Eli M. Rosenbaum, the \nhead of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, \nnoted at the time, ``These files demonstrate that the real winners of \nthe Cold War were Nazi criminals.'' We should not repeat that mistake \nfor other aliens who engaged in human rights abuses before coming to \nthe United States. We need to focus the attention of our law \nenforcement investigators to prosecute and deport those who have \ncommitted atrocities abroad and who now enjoy safe harbor in the United \nStates.\n\n  When I first introduced this bill, the Rutland Daily Herald in \nVermont editorialized that:\n\n       For the U.S. commitment to human rights to mean anything, \n     U.S. policies must be strong and consistent. It is not enough \n     to denounce war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo or elsewhere and \n     then wink as the perpetrators of torture and mass murder slip \n     across the border to find a home in America. (October 31, \n     1999)\n\n  The Clinton Administration recognized the deficiencies in our laws. \nOne Clinton Administration witness testified in February 2000 that:\n\n       The Department of Justice supports efforts to enhance our \n     ability to remove individuals who have committed acts of \n     torture abroad. The department also recognizes, however, that \n     our current immigration laws do not provide strong enough \n     bars for human rights abusers. . . . Right now, only three \n     types of human rights abuse could prevent someone from \n     entering or remaining in the United States. The types of \n     prohibited conduct include: (1) genocide; (2) particularly \n     severe violations of religious freedom; and (3) Nazi \n     persecutions. Even these types of conduct are narrowly \n     defined. [Hearing on H.R. 3058, ``Anti-Atrocity Alien \n     Deportation Act,'' before the Subcomm. on Immigration and \n     Claims of the House Comm. On the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 2d \n     Sess., Feb. 17, 2000 (Statement of James E. Costello, \n     Associate Deputy Attorney General).]\n\n  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would provide a stronger bar \nto human rights abusers and close loopholes in our current laws. The \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) currently provides that (i) \nparticipants in Nazi persecutions during the time period from March 23, \n1933 to May 8, 1945, (ii) aliens who engaged in genocide, and (iii) \naliens who committed particularly severe violations of religious \nfreedom, are both inadmissable to the United States and removable. [See \n8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(2)(G) & (3)(E) and Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D).] This bill \nwould expand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to: (1) \nadd new bars for aliens who have engaged in acts, outside the United \nStates, of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial killing,'' and (2) remove \nlimitations on the current bases for ``genocide'' and ``particularly \nsevere violations of religious freedom.''\n  The definitions for the new bases of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial \nkilling'' are derived from the Torture Victim Protection Act, which \nimplemented the United Nations' ``Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.'' These \ndefinitions are therefore already sanctioned by the Congress. The bill \nincorporates the definition of ``torture'' codified in the federal \ncriminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340, which prohibits:\n\n     an act committed by a person acting under the color of law \n     specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental \n     pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to \n     lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or \n     physical control.'' [18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340(1).]\n\n  ``Severe mental pain or suffering'' is further defined to mean:\n\n     prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from (A) the \n     intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe \n     physical pain or suffering; (B) the administration or \n     application, or threatened administration or application, of \n     mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to \n     disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and (C) the \n     threat of imminent death; or (D) the threat that another \n     person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical \n     pain or suffering, or the administration or application of \n     mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to \n     disrupt profoundly the senses or personality. [18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2340(2).]\n\n  The Torture Victim Protection Act also included a definition for \n``extrajudicial killing.'' Specifically, this law establishes civil \nliability for wrongful death against any person ``who, under actual or \napparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation . . . \nsubjects an individual to extrajudicial killing,'' which is defined to \nmean ``a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment \npronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial \nguarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. \nThis term, however, does not include any such killing that, under \ninternational law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a \nforeign nation.''\n  The bill would not only add the new grounds for inadmissibility and \ndeportation, it would expand two of the current grounds. First, the \ncurrent bar to aliens who have ``engaged in genocide'' defines that \nterm by reference to the ``genocide'' definition in the Convention on \nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. [8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(3)(E)(ii).] For clarity and consistency, the bill would \nsubstitute instead the definition in the federal criminal code, 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 1091(a), which was adopted pursuant to the U.S. obligations \nunder the Genocide Convention. The bill would also broaden the reach of \nthe provision to apply not only to those who ``engaged in genocide,'' \nas in current law, but also to cover any alien who has ordered, \nincited, assisted or otherwise participated in genocide. This broader \nscope will ensure that the genocide provision addresses a more \nappropriate range of levels of complicity.\n  Second, the current bar to aliens who have committed ``particularly \nsevere violations of religious freedom,'' as defined in the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA), limits its \napplication to foreign government officials who engaged in such conduct \nwithin the last 24 months, and also bars from admission the \nindividual's\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nspouse and children, if any. This bill would delete the reference to \nprohibited conduct occurring within a 24-month period since this \nlimitation is not consistent with the strong stance of the United \nStates to promote religious freedom throughout the world. As Professor \nAceves has written:\n\n       This provision is unduly restrictive . . . The 24-month \n     time limitation for this prohibition is also unnecessary. A \n     perpetrator of human rights atrocities should not be able to \n     seek absolution by merely waiting two years after the \n     commission of these acts. [William J. Aceves, supra, 20 Mich. \n     J. Int'l L., at 683.]\n\n  In addition, the bill would remove the current bar to admission for \nthe spouse or children of a violator of religious freedom. This is a \nserious sanction that should not apply to individuals because of \nfamilial relationships that are beyond their control. The purpose of \nthese amendments is to make those who have participated in atrocities \naccountable for their actions. That purpose is not served by holding \nthe family members of such individuals accountable for the offensive \nconduct over which they had no control.\n  Under current law, most aliens who are inadmissible may receive a \nwaiver under section 212(d)(3) of the INA to enter the nation as a \nnonimmigrant, where the Secretary of State recommends it and the \nAttorney General approves. Participants in Nazi persecutions or \ngenocide, however, are not eligible for such a waiver. Our bill retains \nthat provision. It does not, however, ban waivers for those who commit \nacts of torture or extrajudicial killings. I would hope that such \nwaivers are used sparingly and only under the most compelling of \ncircumstances.\n  Of course, changing the law to address the problem of human rights \nabusers seeking entry and remaining in the United States is only part \nof the solution. We also need effective enforcement. As one expert \nnoted:\n\n     [s]trong institutional mechanisms must be established to \n     implement this proposed legislation. At present, there does \n     not appear to be any agency within the Department of Justice \n     with the specific mandate of identifying, investigating and \n     prosecuting modern day perpetrators of human rights \n     atrocities. The importance of establishing a separate agency \n     for this function can be seen in the experiences of the \n     Office of Special Investigations. 20 Mich. J. Int'l L., at \n     689.\n\n  Our country has long provided the template and moral leadership for \ndealing with Nazi war criminals. The Justice Department's specialized \nunit, OSI, which was created to hunt down, prosecute and remove Nazi \nwar criminals who had slipped into the United States among their \nvictims under the Displaced Persons Act, is an example of effective \nenforcement. Since OSI was created in 1979, more than 60 Nazi \npersecutors have been stripped of U.S. citizenship, almost 50 such \nindividuals have been removed from the United States, and more than 150 \nhave been denied entry.\n  OSI was created almost 35 years after the end of World War II and it \nremains authorized only to track Nazi war criminals. Specifically, when \nAttorney General Civiletti, by a 1979 Attorney General order, \nestablished OSI within the Criminal Division of the Department of \nJustice, that office was directed to conduct all ``investigative and \nlitigation activities involving individuals, who prior to and during \nWorld War II, under the supervision of or in association with the Nazi \ngovernment of Germany, its allies, and other affiliated governments, \nare alleged to have ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise \nparticipated in the persecution of any person because of race, \nreligion, national origin, or political opinion.'' (Attorney Gen. Order \nNo. 851-79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that Attorney \nGeneral Order.\n  I believe it is time to reward the tremendous work that OSI has done \nby expanding its mission to ensure effective enforcement against war \ncriminals of all stripes.\n  Little is being done about the new generation of international human \nrights abusers and war criminals living among us, and these delays are \ncostly. As any prosecutor knows instinctively, such delays make \ndocumentary and testimonial evidence more difficult to obtain. Stale \ncases are the hardest to make. We should not repeat the mistake of \nwaiting decades before tracking down war criminals and human rights \nabusers who have settled in this country. War criminals should find no \nsanctuary in loopholes in our current immigration policies and \nenforcement, and should never come to believe that they will find safe \nharbor in the United States.\n  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would amend the INA, 8 U.S.C. \nSec.  1103, by directing the Attorney General to establish an Office of \nSpecial Investigations (OSI) within the Department of Justice with \nauthorization to denaturalize any alien who has participated in Nazi \npersecution, torture, extrajudicial killing or genocide abroad. Not \nonly would the bill provide statutory authorization for OSI, it would \nalso expand its jurisdiction to deal with any alien who participated in \ntorture, extrajudicial killing and genocide abroad not just Nazis.\n  The success of OSI in hunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the \neffectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. \nThe knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular \nregimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary \nfor effective prosecutions of these cases and would best be \naccomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather \nthan in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have \nmore diverse missions.\n  These are the sound policy and practical reasons that experts in this \narea recommend that the United States ``establish an office in the \nJustice Department similar to the one that has tracked Nazi war \ncriminals, with an exclusive mandate to carry out the task of \ninvestigation [of suspected human rights abusers].'' [William Schulz, \nsupra, at p. 24.]\n  I appreciate that this part of the legislation has in the past proven \ncontroversial within the Department of Justice, but others have \nconcurred in my judgment that the OSI is an appropriate component of \nthe Department to address the new responsibilities proposed in this \nbill. Professor Aceves, who has studied these matters extensively, has \nconcluded that the OSI's ``methodology for pursuing Nazi war criminals \ncan be applied with equal rigor to other perpetrators of human rights \nviolations. As the number of Nazi war criminals inevitably declines, \nthe OSI can begin to enforce U.S. immigration laws against perpetrators \nof genocide and other gross violations of human rights.'' 20 Mich. J. \nInt'l. 657.\n  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice \nremains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from \nthe OSI's current mission instead, additional resources are authorized \nin the bill to cover the costs of the Office's expanded duties.\n  Significantly, the bill further directs the Attorney General, in \ndetermining what action to take against a human rights abuser seeking \nentry into or found within the United States, to consider whether a \nprosecution should be brought under U.S. law or whether the alien \nshould be deported to a country willing to undertake such a \nprosecution. Despite ratifying the Convention Against Torture in 1994 \nand adopting a new law making torture anywhere in the world a crime, \nfederal law enforcement has not used this authority. In fact, one \nrecent observer noted that ``the U.S. has never prosecuted a suspected \ntorturer; nor has it ever extradited one under the Convention Against \nTorture, although it has surrendered one person to the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda.'' [William Schulz, supra, at p. 23 - 24.]\n  As one human rights expert has noted:\n\n       ``The justifiable outrage felt by many when it is \n     discovered that serious human rights abusers have found their \n     way into the United States may lead well-meaning people to \n     call for their immediate expulsion. Such individuals \n     certainly should not be enjoying the good life America has to \n     offer. But when we ask the question `where should they be?' \n     the answer is clear: they should be in the dock. That is the \n     essence of accountability, and it should be the central goal \n     of any scheme to penalize human rights abusers.'' [Hearing on \n     H.R. 5238, ``Serious Human Rights Abusers Accountability \n     Act,'' before the Subcomm. on Immigration and Claims of the \n     House Comm. On the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 2d Sess., Sept. \n     28, 2000 (Statement of Elisa Massimino, Director, Washington \n     Office, Lawyers Committee For Human Rights).]\n\n  Finally, the bill directs the Attorney General to report to the \nJudiciary Committees of the Senate and House on implementation of the \nnew requirements in the bill, including procedures for referral of \nmatters to the OSI, any\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\nrevisions made to immigration forms to reflect amendments made by the \nbill, and the procedures developed, with adequate due process \nprotection, to obtain sufficient evidence and determine whether an \nalien is deemed inadmissible under the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate again to give their approval to \nthis bill, and for the House to help us finally make it law.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naward the Congressional Gold Medal to The Right Honorable Tony Charles \nLynton Blair, Prime Minister of Great Britain, First Lord of the \nTreasury and Minister for the Civil Service.\n  For more than two centuries, Congress has expressed public gratitude \non behalf of the Nation for the notable contributions of individuals \nand of groups through the Congressional Gold Medal. Congress created \nthis honor as its highest expression of national appreciation for \ndistinguished achievement and contributions.\n  Originally bestowed upon military leaders, the first Congressional \nGold Medal was awarded to George Washington by the Continental Congress \non March 25, 1776, for his heroic service in the Revolutionary War. In \nthe two centuries since the medal was first awarded, Congressional Gold \nMedal recipients have transcended nationality, country and politics. In \naddition to modern military leaders including General Douglas MacArthur \nand General Colin Powell, this award has recognized the extraordinary \ncharacter and efforts of such world leaders as Mother Teresa, Pope John \nPaul II, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, another British wartime \nleader.\n  In the year and a half since September 11, 2001, and particularly \nover the course of recent weeks, Prime Minister Blair has exhibited \nextraordinary courage in the war against terror. With steadfast and \nunwavering resolve, he has held firm to his principles without regard \nto, indeed in spite of, the shifting political winds. Again and again, \nhe has been called on to demonstrate his recognition that tyrannical \ndictators cannot be allowed to terrorize their citizens and neighbors, \nor the world community.\n  In the process, Prime Minister Blair has proven to be one of the \nstrongest and most distinguished allies of the United States in our \nefforts to rid the world of terrorists, and to bring to justice the \ncorrupt regimes that support them. Great Britain has long been a \ntrusted ally of our Nation; however,\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nPrime Minister Blair has gone beyond friendship to demonstrate true \nleadership for his nation and for Europe.\n  In the 18th century, English philosopher Edmund Burke once said, \n``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to \ndo nothing.'' How poignant and how true that remains today.\n  It is clear that Prime Minister Blair understands the truth in these \nwords, and that true leaders often hold lonely positions when they \nforgo the political expedient to stand for what is right.\n  Last week, a British newspaper editorialized about Prime Minister \nBlair's lonely struggle. ``Mr. Blair has not shrunk from debate,'' said \nThe Independent, a newspaper that has frequently and loudly criticized \nthe Prime Minister in the past. ``He has taken the argument to all \nquarters of his restive party. He has allowed the Commons its say. And \ndespite all the doubts about this war, Mr. Blair has shown himself in \nthe past few days to be at once the most formidable politician in the \ncountry and the right national leader for these deeply uncertain \ntimes.''\n  These are uncertain, but defining, times. America suffers with Great \nBritain during the struggles in Iraq. And we mourn together the loss of \nthe brave individuals who dedicate their lives to defending freedom. \nThe courage of the coalition forces in the theater, their skill and \nbravery on the front lines, the dedication and patriotism of their \nfamilies at home, all extends back to their leaders.\n  Prime Minister Blair has had the vision to see that Saddam Hussein is \na dangerous man who continues to pose a threat to the region's \nstability, to his own people, and to the world through his sponsorship \nof terror.\n  The liberation of Iraq will be the beginning, not the end, of our \ncommitment to the people of Iraq. We will work together to supply \nhumanitarian relief and strive for the long-term recovery of Iraq's \neconomy.\n  In this effort to bring freedom to a nation of people who have \nthirsted for relief from terror, Prime Minister Blair has taken a \ncourageous and principled stand before the world. The simple lesson \nlearned, the lesson Prime Minister Blair personifies, is that evil must \nbe checked.\n  History will be a kind judge of Tony Blair, for great leaders are \nremembered well when they stand by their convictions, especially when \nthose stands are tested in the face of adversity, during times of \nconflict and strife. In such times of testing, we take the measure of \nour leaders, our institutions, and ourselves.\n  Prime Minister Blair's character has proven strong and he deserves \nnothing less than our highest accolades.\n  That is why I am proud and honored today to introduce legislation to \naward the Congressional Gold Medal to Prime Minister Blair, and to \nthank him, on the floor on this Chamber, for his steadfast stand \nagainst evil.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize Prime Minister Blair for the \ncourage of his convictions by joining in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDING.\n\n       Congress finds that Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United \n     Kingdom has clearly demonstrated, during a very trying and \n     historic time for our 2 countries, that he is a staunch and \n     steadfast ally of the United States of America.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of a small parcel of \nBureau of Land Management land in Douglas County, Oregon, to the county \nto improve management of and recreational access to the Oregon Dunes \nNational Recreation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today, with my friend and colleague \nSenator Smith of Oregon, to introduce legislation to improve the \nmanagement of and recreational access to the Oregon Dunes National \nRecreation Area in Douglas County, OR.\n  For the small, rural, coastal community of Winchester Bay in Douglas \nCounty, OR, this piece of legislation is critical. Hit first in the \nearly 90's with a steep downturn in the timber economy, closely \nfollowed by a near shut-down of the fishing industry, this community \nfound itself on the brink of economic ruin. The final blow came in \nMarch of 2000 when the major employer, International Paper, closed its \npaper mill, putting 300 residents out of work and sending an economic \nshockwave through the community that impacted the city, the school \ndistrict, the hospital district, and literally every resident in the \narea.\n  Yet, since that time, Winchester Bay, OR has adopted a ``never give \nup'' attitude, changed its long term outlook, and focused its efforts \non developing a thriving tourist industry. The bill I introduce today \ndirects the Secretary of the Interior to convey approximately 68.5 \nacres from the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, in Douglas County, OR, \nto Douglas County to be managed for open space and for recreational \npurposes. The acreage is located just west of tourist and recreational \narea developments already owned and run by Douglas County. The County \nwill use the land to provide a staging area for off-highway vehicles, \nthereby improving management of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation \nArea. The land transfer also facilitates the policing of unlawful \ncamping and parking along Salmon Harbor Drive and adjacent areas. This \nland transfer will improve tourism on Oregon's economically challenged \nSouth Coast, as well as improve public safety and reduce traffic \ncongestion along Salmon Harbor Drive.\n  This legislation is supported by the entire Oregon delegation. It is \nalso supported by the BLM, Douglas County Commissioners, and the \ncommunity of Winchester Bay. An identical bill was introduced in the \nlast Congress by Representative DeFazio, though the 107th Congress \nended before both houses could pass it. Representative DeFazio \nreintroduced this land transfer legislation in the 108th Congress, H.R. \n514, in the House of Representatives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT LAND IN \n                   DOUGLAS COUNTY, OREGON.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Conveyance.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     convey, without consideration, to Douglas County, Oregon \n     (referred to in this section as the ``County''), all right, \n     title, and interest of the United States in and to the parcel \n     described in paragraph (2) for use by the County for \n     recreational purposes.\n       (2) Parcel.--The parcel referred to in paragraph (1) is the \n     parcel of real property consisting of approximately 68.8 \n     acres under the administrative jurisdiction of the Bureau of \n     Land Management in the County, as depicted on the map \n     entitled ``Umpqua River Lighthouse and Coast Guard Museum \n     Master Plan Study'', dated April 17, 2002.\n       (b) Purposes of Conveyance.--The purposes of the conveyance \n     under subsection (a) are to improve management of and \n     recreational access to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation \n     Area by--\n       (1) improving public safety and reducing traffic congestion \n     along Salmon Harbor Drive (County Road No. 251) in the \n     County;\n       (2) providing a staging area for off-highway vehicles; and\n       (3) facilitating policing of unlawful camping and parking \n     along Salmon Harbor Drive and adjacent areas.\n       (c) Reversionary Interest.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     parcel conveyed under subsection (a) is not being used by the \n     County for a recreational purpose--\n       (A) all right, title, and interest in and to the parcel, \n     including any improvements on the parcel, shall revert to the \n     United States; and\n       (B) the United States shall have the right of immediate \n     entry onto the parcel.\n       (2) Determination on the record.--Any determination of the \n     Secretary under this subsection shall be made on the record \n     after an opportunity for an agency hearing.\n       (d) Survey.--The exact acreage and legal description of the \n     parcel to be conveyed under subsection (a) shall be \n     determined by a survey--\n       (1) that is satisfactory to the Secretary; and\n       (2) the cost of which shall be paid by the County.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under subsection (a) as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n        Chambliss):\n  S. 715.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to improve the \nelectricity transmission system of the United States; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Federal Power \nAct Amendment of 2003.'' This bill is intended to ensure for the future \nthe two things that matter most to all electricity customers: \naffordable electricity and reliable electricity.\n  Electricity users, my constituents and your constituents, wake up in \nthe morning, flip a switch and expect their lights to turn on. They \nalso expect that each month when their electricity bill arrives in the \nmail that they'll pay a reasonable price for that service. Customers \ndon't care where the electrons come from or what new scheme the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has in mind for the electricity industry \nor really much of anything else. And frankly, as a representative of \nnearly four and a half million people in my home State of Louisiana, \naffordable and reliable electricity are my primary concerns when it \ncomes to electricity policy, and that is the purpose for which I offer \nlegislation today.\n  Electricity prices in Louisiana, and throughout the Southeast for \nthat matter, are some of the lowest in the nation. According to the \nNorth American Electric Reliability Council's most recent reliability \nassessment report, the Southeast region is expected to enjoy, at least \nfor the near term, ``adequate delivery capacity to support forecast \ndemand and energy requirements under normal and contingency \nconditions.'' In other words, electricity customers in the Southeast \nshould expect to continue to enjoy reliable electric service over the \nshort run. My concern, however, is about the future of retail \nelectricity service in my State.\n  There are several specific areas of concern that I have and that I \nattempt to address in the legislation being offered today.\n  First, the current balance between State and Federal jurisdiction, \nwhich has worked exceedingly well in my home State to provide low-cost \nand reliable electric service, is in jeopardy. Retail transactions, \nregulated by State public utility commissions, have historically \ncomprised 90 percent of most utilities' transactions and continue to do \nso in a majority of States that have not restructured their electricity \nmarkets. In fact, there is not a single State in the Southeast with the \nexception of Virginia that has authorized retail competition. Yet, \ncustomers in our region of the country enjoy some of the lowest priced \nelectricity service.\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC, however, has issued \na proposed rule that would strip States of much of their current \njurisdiction over retail electric service, including the transmission \ncomponent of bundled retail sales. In so doing, FERC would dramatically \nimpair the ability of States to use retail ratemaking to attain local \npolicy goals and to continue to ensure low costs for retail customers. \nIt would also prohibit States from ensuring that retail customers are \ngiven a priority for electricity service. As a result, in the event \nthat supplies are tight, retail customers could lose the right to \npriority service.\n  FERC's proposed plan is a one-size-fits-all scheme on the entire \ncountry based on a model that closely resembles the one in place in New \nJersey, much of Pennsylvania and Maryland. This model may work well in \nthe Northeast, but it has never been tested or proven viable in any \nother part of the country. In fact, in a study performed by the \nconsulting firm, Charles River Associates, it was concluded that there \nis ``considerable uncertainty as to whether [the FERC's proposed plan] \nwould provide greater benefits to the southeast than the implementation \ncosts.'' In Louisiana, and I'm sure in many other States throughout the \nSoutheast and across the country, customers are happy with their \nelectric service. So I ask, what's wrong with the current \njurisdictional division between the State and Federal government? If a \nState or region wants to adopt a new approach, they should be free to \ndo so. But we should not allow a Federal agency to make fundamental \npolicy decisions that are best left to State officials who are \naccountable to local interests. We know what happened out West when \nCalifornia regulators attempted to institute a sweeping, new plan for \nits electricity markets. I hope to avoid importing those problems into \nLouisiana.\n  To address this jurisdictional concern, Section 2 of my bill would \nclarify the Federal-State arrangement under the Federal Power Act by \nexplicitly stating that States shall have jurisdiction over the retail \nsale of electric energy, including all component parts of a bundled \nretail sale. In addition, Section 7 would enable States to continue to \nallow utilities to reserve transmission capacity for retail customers. \nThis is current law and the current practice in a large number of \nStates, including States with some of the lowest average retail rates \nand the best history of reliability. As contemplated by Congress when \nthe Federal Power Act was enacted, FERC will retain jurisdiction over \nthe wholesale sales of electric energy and States will retain \njurisdiction over retail.\n  My second concern for retail customers is the potential for increased \nrates caused by the costs of accommodating the ``merchant generation'' \nthat, over the past several years, have been seeking to connect to the \nelectric grid in the Southeast. Though new generation is important to \nwholesale competition, it is a strain on the transmission system. To \naccommodate the new generation, new transmission facilities and \nupgrades to existing facilities are needed. However, customers in \nLouisiana would be forced to pay for the facilities needed to \naccommodate the merchant generators, even though most of their \ncustomers are out-of-region customers. State regulatory commissioners, \nunderstandably, are reluctant to pass transmission construction and \nupgrade costs off to local customers who are not benefitting from the \nelectricity. Meanwhile energy dependent regions of the country are \ndenied cheap and reliable electricity.\n  A reason they choose to site in Louisiana is because we are blessed \nwith abundant reserves of natural gas--the currently favored fuel \nsource for electric generation. Merchant generators are siting their \nfacilities to gain access to these resources as cheaply as possible, \nand then are delivering electricity to regions where they can sell \nelectricity at a higher cost. If enough transmission is built to export \njust a portion of the new generation that is planned to come on-line in \nLouisiana--10,000 megawatts--the estimated cost would impose a retail \nrate increase of 5 to 11 percent.\n  Surely, there must be a more equitable way to allocate cost while \nsimultaneously enhancing our transmission capacity. It is not fair to \nexpect customers in energy generating States to keep paying for \ntransmission expansion when this increased transmission is primarily \nbeing developed for out-of-region use. In Sections 3 and 4 of this \nbill, I have attempted to provide a more equitable system. Section 3 \nwould allow for ``voluntary participant-funding'' in which a regional \ntransmission organization may choose to establish a system in which \nmarket participants pay for expansions to the transmission network in \nreturn for the transmission rights created by the expansion investment. \nThis approach gives proper economic incentives for new generator \nlocation and transmission expansion decisions.\n  Similarly, Section 4 of my bill would require the FERC to initiate a \nproceeding to establish rules for interconnecting new generation to \ntransmission facilities. As in Section 3, any costs made necessary by \nthe interconnecting generator would be funded by the generator, or \ncost-causer, in return for a right to use such facilities funded by the \ninvestment.\n  The third problem that I see is the lack of new investment in \ntransmission facilities. FERC noted in its Electric Transmission \nConstraint study that transmission congestion costs retail\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\ncustomers across the country millions of dollars every year. Over the \npast 10 years, demand for electricity has increased by 17 percent while \ntransmission investment during the same period has continuously \ndeclined about 45 percent.\n  What is even more troubling is that current demand for electricity is \nprojected to increase by 25 percent over the next 10 years with only a \nmodest increase in transmission capacity. In the short term, this lack \nof transmission investment and the corresponding lack of transmission \ncapacity, adversely affects the ability of retail customers to realize \nthe benefits of wholesale competition. Over the long term, and if this \ntrend continues, the reliability of the bulk power system could be \ncompromised. In the summer of 2000, transmission constraints limited \nthe ability to sell low-cost power from the Midwest to the South during \na period of peak demand, causing higher costs for customers. In the \nsummer of 2001 during the California electricity crisis, transmission \nconstraints along the Path 15 transmission route were a significant \ncause of the blackouts experienced by customers in the northern parts \nof that State.\n  To help spur this needed investment in the transmission sector, \nSection 5 of the legislation would provide further guidance to FERC in \nestablishing transmission rates in two ways. First, Section 5 would \namend Section 205 of the Federal Power Act to clarify that the cost \ncauser is responsible for paying the costs of new transmission \ninvestment and that all users of the transmission facilities are \nrequired to pay an equitable share of the costs such facilities. These \nprovisions will help ensure that users of the transmission system have \nproper economic price signals and encourage investment where it is \nneeded most. Second, Section 5 would add a new section to the Federal \nPower Act, Section 215, that would require the FERC to initiate a \nrulemaking to establish transmission pricing policies and standards to \npromote investment in transmission facilities. Although the Commission \nmay have sufficient authority under current law to initiate such \npolicies, our Nation's transmission system has been neglected too long \nand I believe that the FERC could benefit from more specific guidance \nfrom Congress.\n  Finally, customers are not realizing all of the potential benefits of \nwholesale electricity markets because of its balkanization. The likely \nresult is higher electricity prices. In different parts of the country, \nelectric utilities are in various stages of joining together to form \nlarge regional markets, or in the terms used by FERC--regional \ntransmission organizations. In addition, public power entities, \nincluding municipal utilities, cooperatives, and federal and State \npower marketing associations have been willing or resisting, to varying \ndegrees, to contribute to the efforts to establish regional markets. \nExacerbating this problem is the underlying fact that FERC does not \nhave the same jurisdiction over public power utilities as it does over \nelectric utilities.\n  Properly functioning regional markets for electricity can bring about \nsignificant benefits to customers in all parts of the country. More \ncompetitive wholesale generation, for example, will allow retail \nsellers greater opportunities to purchase generation from independent \npower producers. Improperly functioning markets, or one-size-fits all \nproposals that do not take into consideration regional differences, can \nbe devastating. Current law and policy at FERC has been insufficient in \nachieving the proper balance between the need for robust regional \nmarkets, the reality of regional differences and the legitimate efforts \nof utilities.\n  Therefore, in Section 6 of the bill, the FERC would be required to \nconvene regional discussions with State regulatory commissions to \nconsider the development and progress of regional transmission \norganizations. It would further provide for specific topics of \ndiscussion between FERC and the States including the need for regional \norganizations, the planning process for facilities, the protection of \nretail customers, and the establishment of proper price signals to \nensure the efficient expansion of the transmission grid. Section 6 \nwould also help reduce the balkanization of the electric grid by \nauthorizing the federal utilities such as the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority and the Bonneville Power Administration to join regional \ntransmission organizations. Also, in an attempt to help expand \nwholesale markets, Section 8 would provide for FERC to require that \npublic power entities provide a limited form of access to their \ntransmission facilities. This provision would give wholesale generators \nincreased access to markets and ensure that competitors pay only the \nfair and reasonable price to use the transmission grid owned by public \npower.\n  In conclusion, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and \nconsider its affect on retail electricity customers in their States. \nAffordable and reliable electricity should be our objective for all \ncustomers, in all parts of the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 717. A bill to require increased safety testing of 15-passenger \nvans, ensure the compliance of 15-passenger vans used as schoolbuses \nwith motor vehicle safety standards applicable to schoolbuses, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to enhance the safety of large passenger vans, which are \nhighly susceptible to rollovers and have been associated with more than \n500 fatalities since 1990.\n  It was under the most tragic circumstances that this issue came to my \nState's attention last year. On September 12th, 2002, 14 migrant \nforestry workers were killed when their 15-passenger van rolled off a \nbridge over the Allagash Wilderness Waterway in northern Maine. The \nsole survivor of this catastrophe escaped when he kicked out the rear \nwindow of the sinking van in what was the single worst motor vehicle \naccident in Maine's history.\n  I quickly learned that this was the latest in a long line of deadly \ncrashes involving the popular vans, which were initially designed to \ncarry cargo rather than passengers and are highly prone to rollovers, \nespecially when fully loaded. There are more than 500,000 of these vans \non the road today, and they are frequently used for a wide variety of \npurposes, from van pools and church outings, to transportation to and \nfrom airports, to transporting college athletics teams or workers.\n  In response to the spate of fatal accidents involving the vans in the \npast few years, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nNHTSA, conducted a study in 2001 to analyze the vans' propensity to \nrollover. In May 2001, after concluding the study, NHTSA issued a \nnational warning to users of such vehicles that they have an increased \nrisk of rollovers under certain conditions. They issued a similar \nwarning in April 2002. The results of the NHTSA study are dramatic, \nfinding that rollover risks rise sharply as the number of van occupants \nincreases. With 10 or more occupants, the rollover rate is nearly three \ntimes the rate of vans that are lightly loaded. And with more than 15 \noccupants, the risk of a rollover is almost six times greater than if \nthe van only has five occupants.\n  Following up on NHTSA's work, and as the deadly march of van \naccidents continued, last year both the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, NTSB, and the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen issued a \nnumber of safety recommendations on the issue. Given the increasing use \nof 15-passenger vans in transporting larger groups, I believe it is \ntime to move beyond warnings and for Congress to take action to address \nthe safety of these vans.\n  The bill I am introducing today would require NHTSA to include 15-\npassenger vans in their dynamic rollover testing program. While NHTSA \nis currently developing this program, as mandated by The Transportation \nRecall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation, TREAD, Act of \n2000, it does not include 15-passenger vans. Given the demonstrated \npropensity of these vans to roll, and the deadly effects of a rollover \nin fully loaded passenger vans, it is vital that we subject them to the \nsame safety standards that NHTSA plans to apply to passenger cars and \nsport utility vehicles, SUVs.\n  My bill would also require NHTSA to include 15-passenger vans in \ntheir New Car Assessment Program, NCAP, rollover resistance ratings, \nand to test them at various load conditions. The\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nNCAP, which provides consumers with a measure of the relative safety \npotential of vehicles in frontal crashes, was expanded recently to \ninclude the rollover risk of passenger cars and light trucks. However, \nthe expansion does not extend to vehicles that carry more than 10 \npassengers. I believe that before churches or colleges or employers \npurchase one of these vans, they should have access to NCAP information \nabout their rollover propensity relative to other vehicles.\n  In addition, the bill requires NHTSA to work with van manufacturers \nto evaluate and test the potential of technological systems to help \ndrivers in maintaining control of the vans. Specifically, NHTSA would \nlook at electronic stability control, ESC, systems that some high-end \nSUVs are already equipped with and rear-view mirror-based rollover \nwarning systems. ESC systems are computer-controlled systems that \nattempt to stabilize the vehicle by monitoring a vehicle's movement and \nthe direction the driver is steering. I am also aware of rollover \nwarning systems under development, attachable to the rear-view mirror, \nthat will warn a driver if his speed or driving maneuvers risk a \nrollover. In short, technology can help us to greatly reduce the \ntendency of these vans to roll, and in the process save lives.\n  These vans are also in widespread use for commercial purposes like \nairport shuttles and vanpools. Therefore, my legislation would require \nthe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, to finish their \nrulemaking on the application of federal motor carrier safety \nregulations to 15 passenger vans used for commercial purposes. Both the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, and the Motor \nCarrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 directed FMCSA to promulgate \nregulations on the commercial use of the vans. While they initiated \nrulemaking in 1999, to date, FMCSA applies no operating regulations \nwhatsoever to these vans.\n  Finally, this bill addresses the use of 15-passenger vans to \ntransport schoolchildren. Under current law, schools are prohibited \nfrom purchasing these vans new to transport schoolchildren because they \ndo not meet the same safety standards as schoolbuses do. However, \ncounter-intuitively, Federal law is silent about the purchase of used \nvans, or the use of rental vans.\n  My bill addresses this loophole by incorporating language introduced \nduring the 107th Congress by Representative Mark Udall of Colorado to \nextend the ban from the sale of vans to leasing, renting and buying of \nvans. This is intended to make the buyers accountable as well as the \nseller. At a recent Senate Commerce Committee hearing, I asked NHTSA \nAdministrator Jeffrey Runge about this disparity in current law, and he \nagreed that when we're talking about transporting schoolchildren, \nwhat's good for new vans should be good for used and rented vans.\n  Also, to make it worth NHTSA's while to pursue violators, my bill \nwould raise the maximum penalty for violations of the prohibition on \nthe sale or rental of these vans to schools from $5,000 to $25,000.\n  I truly believe that this legislation will cut down on the number of \nfatal accidents involving 15-passenger vans by subjecting them to \nfederal rollover standards, providing consumers with adequate safety \ninformation and making sure that our schoolchildren are driven to \nschool in safe vehicles. I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong \nshow of support for this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. \n        Graham of South Carolina):\n  S. 721.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to provide refunds for \nunjust and unreasonable charges on electric energy in the State of \nCalifornia; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, released documents substantiating evidence of market \nmanipulation during the California electricity crisis.\n  At the same time, I am stunned that FERC took no action today on \nordering the companies that cheated California to pay refunds. Nor did \nFERC order renegotiation of the long-term electricity contracts that \nwere entered into when prices were artificially inflated. The documents \nreleased provide absolute and irrefutable evidence of market \nmanipulation by power generators and wholesale traders during \nCalifornia's electricity crisis. I believe it is long past due to end \nthe discussions and deliberations and time to start sending the refund \nchecks.\n  FERC should use its authority to order full refunds and order them \nimmediately. To make sure that happens, I am introducing legislation to \nguarantee that the people of California get back the money they are \nowed.\n  When the crisis first began in 2000, I introduced my first bill to \norder refunds. The bill that I am introducing today would require \nenergy companies to pay full refunds in the minimum amount of $8.9 \nbillion. In addition, my bill requires the FERC to order the \nrenegotiation of long-term contracts.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. We must not let \nthese companies get away with thievery.\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4436-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4436-S4445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Fitzgerald):\n  S. 708. A bill to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 7401 West 100th Place in Bridgeview, \nIllinois, as the ``Michael J. Healy Post Office Building''; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to name \nthe U.S. Post Office at 7401 W. 100th Place in Bridgeview, IL after \nPostal Police Officer Michael Healy.\n  On June 21, 1981, while guarding the Chicago Main Post Office at \nHarrison Avenue and Canal Street, Officer Healy's life was senselessly \ncut short by a random act of violence. Officer Healy was murdered by \nthree assailants in a foiled robbery attempt. Sadly, Michael Healy \nbecame the first officer of the Postal Inspection Service to be killed \nwhile on duty.\n  Shortly after his murder, the Postal Inspection Service retired \nMichael's badge, number 3972. Subsequently, Michael's name was added to \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, DC as well as the \nLaw Enforcement Memorial in Springfield, IL.\n  In 2001, the Northern Illinois Division of the United States \nInspection Service honored the 20th anniversary of Michael's death. The \nFraternal Order of Police, FOP, has tried for two years to rename the \nlocal post office after Officer Healy.\n  In protecting others, Officer Healy made the ultimate sacrifice. I \nbelieve it is fitting to pay tribute to him by designating the postal \nfacility in honor of Michael J. Healy. I think that it is the most \nappropriate way to recognize and remember a man who gave so much to his \nfamily, his friends, the Postal Inspection Service, and his community \nof Hometown, IL.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Levin):\n  S. 710. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide that aliens who commit acts of torture, extrajudicial killings, \nor other specified atrocities abroad are inadmissible and removable and \nto establish within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice \nan Office of Special Investigations having responsibilities under that \nAct with respect to all alien participants in war crimes, genocide, and \nthe commission of acts of torture and extrajudicial killings abroad; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased today to introduce the Anti-Atrocity Alien \nDeportation Act of 2003, a bill intended to close loopholes in our \nimmigration laws that have allowed war criminals and human rights \nabusers to enter and remain in this country. Senator Hatch has joined \nme in offering this bill, along with Senators Lieberman and Levin. In \nthe other body, Representatives Mark Foley and Gary Ackerman today \nintroduce identical legislation.\n  Our bill would update the charter of the Justice Department's Office \nof Special Investigations, OSI, which for years has investigated and \nhas sought justice in the cases of Nazi war criminals who have sought \nrefuge on our shores. It is time to renew the OSI charter to take into \naccount the new generations of war criminals who try to escape justice \nby living among us.\n  This bill closely mirrors legislation I had offered that was reported \nunanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, and which \npassed the Senate during the 106th Congress. I hope and expect that, \nwith the help of Senator Hatch and others, this bill will become law \nduring this Congress.\n  As we introduce this bill, our armed forces are fighting to replace \nan Iraqi regime that has been marked by its utter disregard for the \nhuman rights of its people. We must not fight this war on the one hand, \nand let human rights abusers from around the world enter our Nation \nwith impunity on the other.\n  When they learn it is so, the American people are appalled to learn \nthat our country has become a safe haven for those who exercised power \nin foreign countries to terrorize, rape, murder and torture innocent \ncivilians. A report issued last year by Amnesty International claims \nthat nearly 150 alleged human rights abusers have been identified \nliving here and warns that this number may be as high as 1,000. \nMeanwhile, an article in the New York Review of Books stated that \n``hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign nationals who have been \nplausibly accused of the most heinous human rights crimes, including \ntorture and assassination, either have lived or still live freely in \nthe U.S.'' [William Schulz, ``The Torturers Among Us,'' New York \nReview, p. 22, April 25, 2002.]\n  I introduced a similar version of this bill on May 10, 2001, and the \nJudiciary Committee reported the bill with a Leahy-Hatch managers' \namendment on April 18, 2002. Unfortunately, the bill was subject to an \nanonymous hold on the Senate floor.\n  I introduced similar legislation in the 106th Congress and was \npleased when the proposal garnered bipartisan support in both the House \nand the Senate. The legislation passed the Senate on November 5, 1999, \nas part of S. 1754, the Hatch-Leahy ``Denying Safe Havens to \nInternational and War Criminals Act,'' but unfortunately it was not \nacted on by the House before the end of the 106th Congress. \nNevertheless, Representatives Foley and Ackerman have provided \nconsistent leadership in moving this legislation in the House, by \nintroducing the measure in the l06th Congress as H.R. 2642 and H.R. \n3058, in the 107th Congress, as H.R. 1449, and again today.\n  The problem of human rights abusers seeking and obtaining refuge in \nthis country is real, and requires an effective response with the legal \nand enforcement changes proposed in this legislation.\n  For example, three Ethiopian refugees proved in an American court \nthat\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nKelbessa Negewo, a former senior government official in the military \ndictatorship that ruled Ethiopia in the 1970s, engaged in numerous acts \nof torture and human rights abuses against them when they lived in that \ncountry. Negewo oversaw and participated in the torture of opposition \npolitical figures in Ethiopia, and then moved to the United States only \nto work at the same Atlanta hotel as one of his own victims. The \ncourt's descriptions of the abuse are chilling, and included whipping a \nnaked woman with a wire for hours and threatening her with death in the \npresence of several men. The court's award of compensatory and punitive \ndamages in the amount of $1.5 million to the plaintiffs was \nsubsequently affirmed by an appellate court. [See Abebe-Jira v. Negewo, \n72 F.3d 844 (11th Cir. 1996).] Yet during the pendency of his appeal of \nthe civil verdict, the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted \nNegewo citizenship.\n  This situation is an affront both to the foreign victims of torture \nwho fled here to escape their persecutors, and to the American victims \nof such torture and their families. As Professor William Aceves of \nCalifornia Western School of Law has noted, this case reveals ``a \nglaring and troubling limitation in current immigration law and \npractice. This case is not unique. Other aliens who have committed \ngross human rights violations have also gained entry into the United \nStates and been granted immigration relief.'' [20 Mich. J. Int'l.L. at \n657.]\n  Indeed, another case actually involves American victims. In 1980, \nfour American churchwomen were raped and murdered by the Salvadoran \nNational Guard. Two former Salvadoran government officials who \nallegedly covered up the murders currently reside in Florida.\n  Unfortunately, criminals who wielded machetes and guns against \ninnocent civilians in countries like Haiti, Chile, Yugoslavia and \nRwanda have been able to gain entry to the United States through the \nsame doors that we have opened to deserving refugees. We need to lock \nthat door to human rights abusers who seek a safe haven in the United \nStates. To those human rights abusers who are already here, we should \npromptly show them the door out.\n  We have unwittingly sheltered the oppressors along with the oppressed \nfor too long. We should not let this situation continue. We waited too \nlong after World War II to focus prosecutorial resources and attention \non Nazi war criminals who entered this country on false pretenses, or \nworse, with the collusion of American intelligence agencies. Thousands \nof declassified CIA documents were made public last year, as a result \nof the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act that I was proud to help enact in \n1998. These documents made clear the extent to which the United States \nrelied upon and helped Nazi war criminals. As Eli M. Rosenbaum, the \nhead of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, \nnoted at the time, ``These files demonstrate that the real winners of \nthe Cold War were Nazi criminals.'' We should not repeat that mistake \nfor other aliens who engaged in human rights abuses before coming to \nthe United States. We need to focus the attention of our law \nenforcement investigators to prosecute and deport those who have \ncommitted atrocities abroad and who now enjoy safe harbor in the United \nStates.\n\n  When I first introduced this bill, the Rutland Daily Herald in \nVermont editorialized that:\n\n       For the U.S. commitment to human rights to mean anything, \n     U.S. policies must be strong and consistent. It is not enough \n     to denounce war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo or elsewhere and \n     then wink as the perpetrators of torture and mass murder slip \n     across the border to find a home in America. (October 31, \n     1999)\n\n  The Clinton Administration recognized the deficiencies in our laws. \nOne Clinton Administration witness testified in February 2000 that:\n\n       The Department of Justice supports efforts to enhance our \n     ability to remove individuals who have committed acts of \n     torture abroad. The department also recognizes, however, that \n     our current immigration laws do not provide strong enough \n     bars for human rights abusers. . . . Right now, only three \n     types of human rights abuse could prevent someone from \n     entering or remaining in the United States. The types of \n     prohibited conduct include: (1) genocide; (2) particularly \n     severe violations of religious freedom; and (3) Nazi \n     persecutions. Even these types of conduct are narrowly \n     defined. [Hearing on H.R. 3058, ``Anti-Atrocity Alien \n     Deportation Act,'' before the Subcomm. on Immigration and \n     Claims of the House Comm. On the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 2d \n     Sess., Feb. 17, 2000 (Statement of James E. Costello, \n     Associate Deputy Attorney General).]\n\n  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would provide a stronger bar \nto human rights abusers and close loopholes in our current laws. The \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) currently provides that (i) \nparticipants in Nazi persecutions during the time period from March 23, \n1933 to May 8, 1945, (ii) aliens who engaged in genocide, and (iii) \naliens who committed particularly severe violations of religious \nfreedom, are both inadmissable to the United States and removable. [See \n8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(2)(G) & (3)(E) and Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D).] This bill \nwould expand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to: (1) \nadd new bars for aliens who have engaged in acts, outside the United \nStates, of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial killing,'' and (2) remove \nlimitations on the current bases for ``genocide'' and ``particularly \nsevere violations of religious freedom.''\n  The definitions for the new bases of ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial \nkilling'' are derived from the Torture Victim Protection Act, which \nimplemented the United Nations' ``Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.'' These \ndefinitions are therefore already sanctioned by the Congress. The bill \nincorporates the definition of ``torture'' codified in the federal \ncriminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340, which prohibits:\n\n     an act committed by a person acting under the color of law \n     specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental \n     pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to \n     lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or \n     physical control.'' [18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340(1).]\n\n  ``Severe mental pain or suffering'' is further defined to mean:\n\n     prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from (A) the \n     intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe \n     physical pain or suffering; (B) the administration or \n     application, or threatened administration or application, of \n     mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to \n     disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and (C) the \n     threat of imminent death; or (D) the threat that another \n     person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical \n     pain or suffering, or the administration or application of \n     mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to \n     disrupt profoundly the senses or personality. [18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2340(2).]\n\n  The Torture Victim Protection Act also included a definition for \n``extrajudicial killing.'' Specifically, this law establishes civil \nliability for wrongful death against any person ``who, under actual or \napparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation . . . \nsubjects an individual to extrajudicial killing,'' which is defined to \nmean ``a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment \npronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial \nguarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. \nThis term, however, does not include any such killing that, under \ninternational law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a \nforeign nation.''\n  The bill would not only add the new grounds for inadmissibility and \ndeportation, it would expand two of the current grounds. First, the \ncurrent bar to aliens who have ``engaged in genocide'' defines that \nterm by reference to the ``genocide'' definition in the Convention on \nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. [8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(3)(E)(ii).] For clarity and consistency, the bill would \nsubstitute instead the definition in the federal criminal code, 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 1091(a), which was adopted pursuant to the U.S. obligations \nunder the Genocide Convention. The bill would also broaden the reach of \nthe provision to apply not only to those who ``engaged in genocide,'' \nas in current law, but also to cover any alien who has ordered, \nincited, assisted or otherwise participated in genocide. This broader \nscope will ensure that the genocide provision addresses a more \nappropriate range of levels of complicity.\n  Second, the current bar to aliens who have committed ``particularly \nsevere violations of religious freedom,'' as defined in the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA), limits its \napplication to foreign government officials who engaged in such conduct \nwithin the last 24 months, and also bars from admission the \nindividual's\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nspouse and children, if any. This bill would delete the reference to \nprohibited conduct occurring within a 24-month period since this \nlimitation is not consistent with the strong stance of the United \nStates to promote religious freedom throughout the world. As Professor \nAceves has written:\n\n       This provision is unduly restrictive . . . The 24-month \n     time limitation for this prohibition is also unnecessary. A \n     perpetrator of human rights atrocities should not be able to \n     seek absolution by merely waiting two years after the \n     commission of these acts. [William J. Aceves, supra, 20 Mich. \n     J. Int'l L., at 683.]\n\n  In addition, the bill would remove the current bar to admission for \nthe spouse or children of a violator of religious freedom. This is a \nserious sanction that should not apply to individuals because of \nfamilial relationships that are beyond their control. The purpose of \nthese amendments is to make those who have participated in atrocities \naccountable for their actions. That purpose is not served by holding \nthe family members of such individuals accountable for the offensive \nconduct over which they had no control.\n  Under current law, most aliens who are inadmissible may receive a \nwaiver under section 212(d)(3) of the INA to enter the nation as a \nnonimmigrant, where the Secretary of State recommends it and the \nAttorney General approves. Participants in Nazi persecutions or \ngenocide, however, are not eligible for such a waiver. Our bill retains \nthat provision. It does not, however, ban waivers for those who commit \nacts of torture or extrajudicial killings. I would hope that such \nwaivers are used sparingly and only under the most compelling of \ncircumstances.\n  Of course, changing the law to address the problem of human rights \nabusers seeking entry and remaining in the United States is only part \nof the solution. We also need effective enforcement. As one expert \nnoted:\n\n     [s]trong institutional mechanisms must be established to \n     implement this proposed legislation. At present, there does \n     not appear to be any agency within the Department of Justice \n     with the specific mandate of identifying, investigating and \n     prosecuting modern day perpetrators of human rights \n     atrocities. The importance of establishing a separate agency \n     for this function can be seen in the experiences of the \n     Office of Special Investigations. 20 Mich. J. Int'l L., at \n     689.\n\n  Our country has long provided the template and moral leadership for \ndealing with Nazi war criminals. The Justice Department's specialized \nunit, OSI, which was created to hunt down, prosecute and remove Nazi \nwar criminals who had slipped into the United States among their \nvictims under the Displaced Persons Act, is an example of effective \nenforcement. Since OSI was created in 1979, more than 60 Nazi \npersecutors have been stripped of U.S. citizenship, almost 50 such \nindividuals have been removed from the United States, and more than 150 \nhave been denied entry.\n  OSI was created almost 35 years after the end of World War II and it \nremains authorized only to track Nazi war criminals. Specifically, when \nAttorney General Civiletti, by a 1979 Attorney General order, \nestablished OSI within the Criminal Division of the Department of \nJustice, that office was directed to conduct all ``investigative and \nlitigation activities involving individuals, who prior to and during \nWorld War II, under the supervision of or in association with the Nazi \ngovernment of Germany, its allies, and other affiliated governments, \nare alleged to have ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise \nparticipated in the persecution of any person because of race, \nreligion, national origin, or political opinion.'' (Attorney Gen. Order \nNo. 851-79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that Attorney \nGeneral Order.\n  I believe it is time to reward the tremendous work that OSI has done \nby expanding its mission to ensure effective enforcement against war \ncriminals of all stripes.\n  Little is being done about the new generation of international human \nrights abusers and war criminals living among us, and these delays are \ncostly. As any prosecutor knows instinctively, such delays make \ndocumentary and testimonial evidence more difficult to obtain. Stale \ncases are the hardest to make. We should not repeat the mistake of \nwaiting decades before tracking down war criminals and human rights \nabusers who have settled in this country. War criminals should find no \nsanctuary in loopholes in our current immigration policies and \nenforcement, and should never come to believe that they will find safe \nharbor in the United States.\n  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would amend the INA, 8 U.S.C. \nSec.  1103, by directing the Attorney General to establish an Office of \nSpecial Investigations (OSI) within the Department of Justice with \nauthorization to denaturalize any alien who has participated in Nazi \npersecution, torture, extrajudicial killing or genocide abroad. Not \nonly would the bill provide statutory authorization for OSI, it would \nalso expand its jurisdiction to deal with any alien who participated in \ntorture, extrajudicial killing and genocide abroad not just Nazis.\n  The success of OSI in hunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the \neffectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. \nThe knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular \nregimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary \nfor effective prosecutions of these cases and would best be \naccomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather \nthan in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have \nmore diverse missions.\n  These are the sound policy and practical reasons that experts in this \narea recommend that the United States ``establish an office in the \nJustice Department similar to the one that has tracked Nazi war \ncriminals, with an exclusive mandate to carry out the task of \ninvestigation [of suspected human rights abusers].'' [William Schulz, \nsupra, at p. 24.]\n  I appreciate that this part of the legislation has in the past proven \ncontroversial within the Department of Justice, but others have \nconcurred in my judgment that the OSI is an appropriate component of \nthe Department to address the new responsibilities proposed in this \nbill. Professor Aceves, who has studied these matters extensively, has \nconcluded that the OSI's ``methodology for pursuing Nazi war criminals \ncan be applied with equal rigor to other perpetrators of human rights \nviolations. As the number of Nazi war criminals inevitably declines, \nthe OSI can begin to enforce U.S. immigration laws against perpetrators \nof genocide and other gross violations of human rights.'' 20 Mich. J. \nInt'l. 657.\n  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice \nremains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from \nthe OSI's current mission instead, additional resources are authorized \nin the bill to cover the costs of the Office's expanded duties.\n  Significantly, the bill further directs the Attorney General, in \ndetermining what action to take against a human rights abuser seeking \nentry into or found within the United States, to consider whether a \nprosecution should be brought under U.S. law or whether the alien \nshould be deported to a country willing to undertake such a \nprosecution. Despite ratifying the Convention Against Torture in 1994 \nand adopting a new law making torture anywhere in the world a crime, \nfederal law enforcement has not used this authority. In fact, one \nrecent observer noted that ``the U.S. has never prosecuted a suspected \ntorturer; nor has it ever extradited one under the Convention Against \nTorture, although it has surrendered one person to the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda.'' [William Schulz, supra, at p. 23 - 24.]\n  As one human rights expert has noted:\n\n       ``The justifiable outrage felt by many when it is \n     discovered that serious human rights abusers have found their \n     way into the United States may lead well-meaning people to \n     call for their immediate expulsion. Such individuals \n     certainly should not be enjoying the good life America has to \n     offer. But when we ask the question `where should they be?' \n     the answer is clear: they should be in the dock. That is the \n     essence of accountability, and it should be the central goal \n     of any scheme to penalize human rights abusers.'' [Hearing on \n     H.R. 5238, ``Serious Human Rights Abusers Accountability \n     Act,'' before the Subcomm. on Immigration and Claims of the \n     House Comm. On the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 2d Sess., Sept. \n     28, 2000 (Statement of Elisa Massimino, Director, Washington \n     Office, Lawyers Committee For Human Rights).]\n\n  Finally, the bill directs the Attorney General to report to the \nJudiciary Committees of the Senate and House on implementation of the \nnew requirements in the bill, including procedures for referral of \nmatters to the OSI, any\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\nrevisions made to immigration forms to reflect amendments made by the \nbill, and the procedures developed, with adequate due process \nprotection, to obtain sufficient evidence and determine whether an \nalien is deemed inadmissible under the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate again to give their approval to \nthis bill, and for the House to help us finally make it law.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naward the Congressional Gold Medal to The Right Honorable Tony Charles \nLynton Blair, Prime Minister of Great Britain, First Lord of the \nTreasury and Minister for the Civil Service.\n  For more than two centuries, Congress has expressed public gratitude \non behalf of the Nation for the notable contributions of individuals \nand of groups through the Congressional Gold Medal. Congress created \nthis honor as its highest expression of national appreciation for \ndistinguished achievement and contributions.\n  Originally bestowed upon military leaders, the first Congressional \nGold Medal was awarded to George Washington by the Continental Congress \non March 25, 1776, for his heroic service in the Revolutionary War. In \nthe two centuries since the medal was first awarded, Congressional Gold \nMedal recipients have transcended nationality, country and politics. In \naddition to modern military leaders including General Douglas MacArthur \nand General Colin Powell, this award has recognized the extraordinary \ncharacter and efforts of such world leaders as Mother Teresa, Pope John \nPaul II, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, another British wartime \nleader.\n  In the year and a half since September 11, 2001, and particularly \nover the course of recent weeks, Prime Minister Blair has exhibited \nextraordinary courage in the war against terror. With steadfast and \nunwavering resolve, he has held firm to his principles without regard \nto, indeed in spite of, the shifting political winds. Again and again, \nhe has been called on to demonstrate his recognition that tyrannical \ndictators cannot be allowed to terrorize their citizens and neighbors, \nor the world community.\n  In the process, Prime Minister Blair has proven to be one of the \nstrongest and most distinguished allies of the United States in our \nefforts to rid the world of terrorists, and to bring to justice the \ncorrupt regimes that support them. Great Britain has long been a \ntrusted ally of our Nation; however,\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nPrime Minister Blair has gone beyond friendship to demonstrate true \nleadership for his nation and for Europe.\n  In the 18th century, English philosopher Edmund Burke once said, \n``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to \ndo nothing.'' How poignant and how true that remains today.\n  It is clear that Prime Minister Blair understands the truth in these \nwords, and that true leaders often hold lonely positions when they \nforgo the political expedient to stand for what is right.\n  Last week, a British newspaper editorialized about Prime Minister \nBlair's lonely struggle. ``Mr. Blair has not shrunk from debate,'' said \nThe Independent, a newspaper that has frequently and loudly criticized \nthe Prime Minister in the past. ``He has taken the argument to all \nquarters of his restive party. He has allowed the Commons its say. And \ndespite all the doubts about this war, Mr. Blair has shown himself in \nthe past few days to be at once the most formidable politician in the \ncountry and the right national leader for these deeply uncertain \ntimes.''\n  These are uncertain, but defining, times. America suffers with Great \nBritain during the struggles in Iraq. And we mourn together the loss of \nthe brave individuals who dedicate their lives to defending freedom. \nThe courage of the coalition forces in the theater, their skill and \nbravery on the front lines, the dedication and patriotism of their \nfamilies at home, all extends back to their leaders.\n  Prime Minister Blair has had the vision to see that Saddam Hussein is \na dangerous man who continues to pose a threat to the region's \nstability, to his own people, and to the world through his sponsorship \nof terror.\n  The liberation of Iraq will be the beginning, not the end, of our \ncommitment to the people of Iraq. We will work together to supply \nhumanitarian relief and strive for the long-term recovery of Iraq's \neconomy.\n  In this effort to bring freedom to a nation of people who have \nthirsted for relief from terror, Prime Minister Blair has taken a \ncourageous and principled stand before the world. The simple lesson \nlearned, the lesson Prime Minister Blair personifies, is that evil must \nbe checked.\n  History will be a kind judge of Tony Blair, for great leaders are \nremembered well when they stand by their convictions, especially when \nthose stands are tested in the face of adversity, during times of \nconflict and strife. In such times of testing, we take the measure of \nour leaders, our institutions, and ourselves.\n  Prime Minister Blair's character has proven strong and he deserves \nnothing less than our highest accolades.\n  That is why I am proud and honored today to introduce legislation to \naward the Congressional Gold Medal to Prime Minister Blair, and to \nthank him, on the floor on this Chamber, for his steadfast stand \nagainst evil.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize Prime Minister Blair for the \ncourage of his convictions by joining in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDING.\n\n       Congress finds that Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United \n     Kingdom has clearly demonstrated, during a very trying and \n     historic time for our 2 countries, that he is a staunch and \n     steadfast ally of the United States of America.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of a small parcel of \nBureau of Land Management land in Douglas County, Oregon, to the county \nto improve management of and recreational access to the Oregon Dunes \nNational Recreation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today, with my friend and colleague \nSenator Smith of Oregon, to introduce legislation to improve the \nmanagement of and recreational access to the Oregon Dunes National \nRecreation Area in Douglas County, OR.\n  For the small, rural, coastal community of Winchester Bay in Douglas \nCounty, OR, this piece of legislation is critical. Hit first in the \nearly 90's with a steep downturn in the timber economy, closely \nfollowed by a near shut-down of the fishing industry, this community \nfound itself on the brink of economic ruin. The final blow came in \nMarch of 2000 when the major employer, International Paper, closed its \npaper mill, putting 300 residents out of work and sending an economic \nshockwave through the community that impacted the city, the school \ndistrict, the hospital district, and literally every resident in the \narea.\n  Yet, since that time, Winchester Bay, OR has adopted a ``never give \nup'' attitude, changed its long term outlook, and focused its efforts \non developing a thriving tourist industry. The bill I introduce today \ndirects the Secretary of the Interior to convey approximately 68.5 \nacres from the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, in Douglas County, OR, \nto Douglas County to be managed for open space and for recreational \npurposes. The acreage is located just west of tourist and recreational \narea developments already owned and run by Douglas County. The County \nwill use the land to provide a staging area for off-highway vehicles, \nthereby improving management of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation \nArea. The land transfer also facilitates the policing of unlawful \ncamping and parking along Salmon Harbor Drive and adjacent areas. This \nland transfer will improve tourism on Oregon's economically challenged \nSouth Coast, as well as improve public safety and reduce traffic \ncongestion along Salmon Harbor Drive.\n  This legislation is supported by the entire Oregon delegation. It is \nalso supported by the BLM, Douglas County Commissioners, and the \ncommunity of Winchester Bay. An identical bill was introduced in the \nlast Congress by Representative DeFazio, though the 107th Congress \nended before both houses could pass it. Representative DeFazio \nreintroduced this land transfer legislation in the 108th Congress, H.R. \n514, in the House of Representatives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT LAND IN \n                   DOUGLAS COUNTY, OREGON.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Conveyance.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     convey, without consideration, to Douglas County, Oregon \n     (referred to in this section as the ``County''), all right, \n     title, and interest of the United States in and to the parcel \n     described in paragraph (2) for use by the County for \n     recreational purposes.\n       (2) Parcel.--The parcel referred to in paragraph (1) is the \n     parcel of real property consisting of approximately 68.8 \n     acres under the administrative jurisdiction of the Bureau of \n     Land Management in the County, as depicted on the map \n     entitled ``Umpqua River Lighthouse and Coast Guard Museum \n     Master Plan Study'', dated April 17, 2002.\n       (b) Purposes of Conveyance.--The purposes of the conveyance \n     under subsection (a) are to improve management of and \n     recreational access to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation \n     Area by--\n       (1) improving public safety and reducing traffic congestion \n     along Salmon Harbor Drive (County Road No. 251) in the \n     County;\n       (2) providing a staging area for off-highway vehicles; and\n       (3) facilitating policing of unlawful camping and parking \n     along Salmon Harbor Drive and adjacent areas.\n       (c) Reversionary Interest.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     parcel conveyed under subsection (a) is not being used by the \n     County for a recreational purpose--\n       (A) all right, title, and interest in and to the parcel, \n     including any improvements on the parcel, shall revert to the \n     United States; and\n       (B) the United States shall have the right of immediate \n     entry onto the parcel.\n       (2) Determination on the record.--Any determination of the \n     Secretary under this subsection shall be made on the record \n     after an opportunity for an agency hearing.\n       (d) Survey.--The exact acreage and legal description of the \n     parcel to be conveyed under subsection (a) shall be \n     determined by a survey--\n       (1) that is satisfactory to the Secretary; and\n       (2) the cost of which shall be paid by the County.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under subsection (a) as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \n        Chambliss):\n  S. 715.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to improve the \nelectricity transmission system of the United States; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Federal Power \nAct Amendment of 2003.'' This bill is intended to ensure for the future \nthe two things that matter most to all electricity customers: \naffordable electricity and reliable electricity.\n  Electricity users, my constituents and your constituents, wake up in \nthe morning, flip a switch and expect their lights to turn on. They \nalso expect that each month when their electricity bill arrives in the \nmail that they'll pay a reasonable price for that service. Customers \ndon't care where the electrons come from or what new scheme the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has in mind for the electricity industry \nor really much of anything else. And frankly, as a representative of \nnearly four and a half million people in my home State of Louisiana, \naffordable and reliable electricity are my primary concerns when it \ncomes to electricity policy, and that is the purpose for which I offer \nlegislation today.\n  Electricity prices in Louisiana, and throughout the Southeast for \nthat matter, are some of the lowest in the nation. According to the \nNorth American Electric Reliability Council's most recent reliability \nassessment report, the Southeast region is expected to enjoy, at least \nfor the near term, ``adequate delivery capacity to support forecast \ndemand and energy requirements under normal and contingency \nconditions.'' In other words, electricity customers in the Southeast \nshould expect to continue to enjoy reliable electric service over the \nshort run. My concern, however, is about the future of retail \nelectricity service in my State.\n  There are several specific areas of concern that I have and that I \nattempt to address in the legislation being offered today.\n  First, the current balance between State and Federal jurisdiction, \nwhich has worked exceedingly well in my home State to provide low-cost \nand reliable electric service, is in jeopardy. Retail transactions, \nregulated by State public utility commissions, have historically \ncomprised 90 percent of most utilities' transactions and continue to do \nso in a majority of States that have not restructured their electricity \nmarkets. In fact, there is not a single State in the Southeast with the \nexception of Virginia that has authorized retail competition. Yet, \ncustomers in our region of the country enjoy some of the lowest priced \nelectricity service.\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC, however, has issued \na proposed rule that would strip States of much of their current \njurisdiction over retail electric service, including the transmission \ncomponent of bundled retail sales. In so doing, FERC would dramatically \nimpair the ability of States to use retail ratemaking to attain local \npolicy goals and to continue to ensure low costs for retail customers. \nIt would also prohibit States from ensuring that retail customers are \ngiven a priority for electricity service. As a result, in the event \nthat supplies are tight, retail customers could lose the right to \npriority service.\n  FERC's proposed plan is a one-size-fits-all scheme on the entire \ncountry based on a model that closely resembles the one in place in New \nJersey, much of Pennsylvania and Maryland. This model may work well in \nthe Northeast, but it has never been tested or proven viable in any \nother part of the country. In fact, in a study performed by the \nconsulting firm, Charles River Associates, it was concluded that there \nis ``considerable uncertainty as to whether [the FERC's proposed plan] \nwould provide greater benefits to the southeast than the implementation \ncosts.'' In Louisiana, and I'm sure in many other States throughout the \nSoutheast and across the country, customers are happy with their \nelectric service. So I ask, what's wrong with the current \njurisdictional division between the State and Federal government? If a \nState or region wants to adopt a new approach, they should be free to \ndo so. But we should not allow a Federal agency to make fundamental \npolicy decisions that are best left to State officials who are \naccountable to local interests. We know what happened out West when \nCalifornia regulators attempted to institute a sweeping, new plan for \nits electricity markets. I hope to avoid importing those problems into \nLouisiana.\n  To address this jurisdictional concern, Section 2 of my bill would \nclarify the Federal-State arrangement under the Federal Power Act by \nexplicitly stating that States shall have jurisdiction over the retail \nsale of electric energy, including all component parts of a bundled \nretail sale. In addition, Section 7 would enable States to continue to \nallow utilities to reserve transmission capacity for retail customers. \nThis is current law and the current practice in a large number of \nStates, including States with some of the lowest average retail rates \nand the best history of reliability. As contemplated by Congress when \nthe Federal Power Act was enacted, FERC will retain jurisdiction over \nthe wholesale sales of electric energy and States will retain \njurisdiction over retail.\n  My second concern for retail customers is the potential for increased \nrates caused by the costs of accommodating the ``merchant generation'' \nthat, over the past several years, have been seeking to connect to the \nelectric grid in the Southeast. Though new generation is important to \nwholesale competition, it is a strain on the transmission system. To \naccommodate the new generation, new transmission facilities and \nupgrades to existing facilities are needed. However, customers in \nLouisiana would be forced to pay for the facilities needed to \naccommodate the merchant generators, even though most of their \ncustomers are out-of-region customers. State regulatory commissioners, \nunderstandably, are reluctant to pass transmission construction and \nupgrade costs off to local customers who are not benefitting from the \nelectricity. Meanwhile energy dependent regions of the country are \ndenied cheap and reliable electricity.\n  A reason they choose to site in Louisiana is because we are blessed \nwith abundant reserves of natural gas--the currently favored fuel \nsource for electric generation. Merchant generators are siting their \nfacilities to gain access to these resources as cheaply as possible, \nand then are delivering electricity to regions where they can sell \nelectricity at a higher cost. If enough transmission is built to export \njust a portion of the new generation that is planned to come on-line in \nLouisiana--10,000 megawatts--the estimated cost would impose a retail \nrate increase of 5 to 11 percent.\n  Surely, there must be a more equitable way to allocate cost while \nsimultaneously enhancing our transmission capacity. It is not fair to \nexpect customers in energy generating States to keep paying for \ntransmission expansion when this increased transmission is primarily \nbeing developed for out-of-region use. In Sections 3 and 4 of this \nbill, I have attempted to provide a more equitable system. Section 3 \nwould allow for ``voluntary participant-funding'' in which a regional \ntransmission organization may choose to establish a system in which \nmarket participants pay for expansions to the transmission network in \nreturn for the transmission rights created by the expansion investment. \nThis approach gives proper economic incentives for new generator \nlocation and transmission expansion decisions.\n  Similarly, Section 4 of my bill would require the FERC to initiate a \nproceeding to establish rules for interconnecting new generation to \ntransmission facilities. As in Section 3, any costs made necessary by \nthe interconnecting generator would be funded by the generator, or \ncost-causer, in return for a right to use such facilities funded by the \ninvestment.\n  The third problem that I see is the lack of new investment in \ntransmission facilities. FERC noted in its Electric Transmission \nConstraint study that transmission congestion costs retail\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\ncustomers across the country millions of dollars every year. Over the \npast 10 years, demand for electricity has increased by 17 percent while \ntransmission investment during the same period has continuously \ndeclined about 45 percent.\n  What is even more troubling is that current demand for electricity is \nprojected to increase by 25 percent over the next 10 years with only a \nmodest increase in transmission capacity. In the short term, this lack \nof transmission investment and the corresponding lack of transmission \ncapacity, adversely affects the ability of retail customers to realize \nthe benefits of wholesale competition. Over the long term, and if this \ntrend continues, the reliability of the bulk power system could be \ncompromised. In the summer of 2000, transmission constraints limited \nthe ability to sell low-cost power from the Midwest to the South during \na period of peak demand, causing higher costs for customers. In the \nsummer of 2001 during the California electricity crisis, transmission \nconstraints along the Path 15 transmission route were a significant \ncause of the blackouts experienced by customers in the northern parts \nof that State.\n  To help spur this needed investment in the transmission sector, \nSection 5 of the legislation would provide further guidance to FERC in \nestablishing transmission rates in two ways. First, Section 5 would \namend Section 205 of the Federal Power Act to clarify that the cost \ncauser is responsible for paying the costs of new transmission \ninvestment and that all users of the transmission facilities are \nrequired to pay an equitable share of the costs such facilities. These \nprovisions will help ensure that users of the transmission system have \nproper economic price signals and encourage investment where it is \nneeded most. Second, Section 5 would add a new section to the Federal \nPower Act, Section 215, that would require the FERC to initiate a \nrulemaking to establish transmission pricing policies and standards to \npromote investment in transmission facilities. Although the Commission \nmay have sufficient authority under current law to initiate such \npolicies, our Nation's transmission system has been neglected too long \nand I believe that the FERC could benefit from more specific guidance \nfrom Congress.\n  Finally, customers are not realizing all of the potential benefits of \nwholesale electricity markets because of its balkanization. The likely \nresult is higher electricity prices. In different parts of the country, \nelectric utilities are in various stages of joining together to form \nlarge regional markets, or in the terms used by FERC--regional \ntransmission organizations. In addition, public power entities, \nincluding municipal utilities, cooperatives, and federal and State \npower marketing associations have been willing or resisting, to varying \ndegrees, to contribute to the efforts to establish regional markets. \nExacerbating this problem is the underlying fact that FERC does not \nhave the same jurisdiction over public power utilities as it does over \nelectric utilities.\n  Properly functioning regional markets for electricity can bring about \nsignificant benefits to customers in all parts of the country. More \ncompetitive wholesale generation, for example, will allow retail \nsellers greater opportunities to purchase generation from independent \npower producers. Improperly functioning markets, or one-size-fits all \nproposals that do not take into consideration regional differences, can \nbe devastating. Current law and policy at FERC has been insufficient in \nachieving the proper balance between the need for robust regional \nmarkets, the reality of regional differences and the legitimate efforts \nof utilities.\n  Therefore, in Section 6 of the bill, the FERC would be required to \nconvene regional discussions with State regulatory commissions to \nconsider the development and progress of regional transmission \norganizations. It would further provide for specific topics of \ndiscussion between FERC and the States including the need for regional \norganizations, the planning process for facilities, the protection of \nretail customers, and the establishment of proper price signals to \nensure the efficient expansion of the transmission grid. Section 6 \nwould also help reduce the balkanization of the electric grid by \nauthorizing the federal utilities such as the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority and the Bonneville Power Administration to join regional \ntransmission organizations. Also, in an attempt to help expand \nwholesale markets, Section 8 would provide for FERC to require that \npublic power entities provide a limited form of access to their \ntransmission facilities. This provision would give wholesale generators \nincreased access to markets and ensure that competitors pay only the \nfair and reasonable price to use the transmission grid owned by public \npower.\n  In conclusion, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and \nconsider its affect on retail electricity customers in their States. \nAffordable and reliable electricity should be our objective for all \ncustomers, in all parts of the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 717. A bill to require increased safety testing of 15-passenger \nvans, ensure the compliance of 15-passenger vans used as schoolbuses \nwith motor vehicle safety standards applicable to schoolbuses, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to enhance the safety of large passenger vans, which are \nhighly susceptible to rollovers and have been associated with more than \n500 fatalities since 1990.\n  It was under the most tragic circumstances that this issue came to my \nState's attention last year. On September 12th, 2002, 14 migrant \nforestry workers were killed when their 15-passenger van rolled off a \nbridge over the Allagash Wilderness Waterway in northern Maine. The \nsole survivor of this catastrophe escaped when he kicked out the rear \nwindow of the sinking van in what was the single worst motor vehicle \naccident in Maine's history.\n  I quickly learned that this was the latest in a long line of deadly \ncrashes involving the popular vans, which were initially designed to \ncarry cargo rather than passengers and are highly prone to rollovers, \nespecially when fully loaded. There are more than 500,000 of these vans \non the road today, and they are frequently used for a wide variety of \npurposes, from van pools and church outings, to transportation to and \nfrom airports, to transporting college athletics teams or workers.\n  In response to the spate of fatal accidents involving the vans in the \npast few years, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nNHTSA, conducted a study in 2001 to analyze the vans' propensity to \nrollover. In May 2001, after concluding the study, NHTSA issued a \nnational warning to users of such vehicles that they have an increased \nrisk of rollovers under certain conditions. They issued a similar \nwarning in April 2002. The results of the NHTSA study are dramatic, \nfinding that rollover risks rise sharply as the number of van occupants \nincreases. With 10 or more occupants, the rollover rate is nearly three \ntimes the rate of vans that are lightly loaded. And with more than 15 \noccupants, the risk of a rollover is almost six times greater than if \nthe van only has five occupants.\n  Following up on NHTSA's work, and as the deadly march of van \naccidents continued, last year both the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, NTSB, and the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen issued a \nnumber of safety recommendations on the issue. Given the increasing use \nof 15-passenger vans in transporting larger groups, I believe it is \ntime to move beyond warnings and for Congress to take action to address \nthe safety of these vans.\n  The bill I am introducing today would require NHTSA to include 15-\npassenger vans in their dynamic rollover testing program. While NHTSA \nis currently developing this program, as mandated by The Transportation \nRecall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation, TREAD, Act of \n2000, it does not include 15-passenger vans. Given the demonstrated \npropensity of these vans to roll, and the deadly effects of a rollover \nin fully loaded passenger vans, it is vital that we subject them to the \nsame safety standards that NHTSA plans to apply to passenger cars and \nsport utility vehicles, SUVs.\n  My bill would also require NHTSA to include 15-passenger vans in \ntheir New Car Assessment Program, NCAP, rollover resistance ratings, \nand to test them at various load conditions. The\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nNCAP, which provides consumers with a measure of the relative safety \npotential of vehicles in frontal crashes, was expanded recently to \ninclude the rollover risk of passenger cars and light trucks. However, \nthe expansion does not extend to vehicles that carry more than 10 \npassengers. I believe that before churches or colleges or employers \npurchase one of these vans, they should have access to NCAP information \nabout their rollover propensity relative to other vehicles.\n  In addition, the bill requires NHTSA to work with van manufacturers \nto evaluate and test the potential of technological systems to help \ndrivers in maintaining control of the vans. Specifically, NHTSA would \nlook at electronic stability control, ESC, systems that some high-end \nSUVs are already equipped with and rear-view mirror-based rollover \nwarning systems. ESC systems are computer-controlled systems that \nattempt to stabilize the vehicle by monitoring a vehicle's movement and \nthe direction the driver is steering. I am also aware of rollover \nwarning systems under development, attachable to the rear-view mirror, \nthat will warn a driver if his speed or driving maneuvers risk a \nrollover. In short, technology can help us to greatly reduce the \ntendency of these vans to roll, and in the process save lives.\n  These vans are also in widespread use for commercial purposes like \nairport shuttles and vanpools. Therefore, my legislation would require \nthe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, to finish their \nrulemaking on the application of federal motor carrier safety \nregulations to 15 passenger vans used for commercial purposes. Both the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, and the Motor \nCarrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 directed FMCSA to promulgate \nregulations on the commercial use of the vans. While they initiated \nrulemaking in 1999, to date, FMCSA applies no operating regulations \nwhatsoever to these vans.\n  Finally, this bill addresses the use of 15-passenger vans to \ntransport schoolchildren. Under current law, schools are prohibited \nfrom purchasing these vans new to transport schoolchildren because they \ndo not meet the same safety standards as schoolbuses do. However, \ncounter-intuitively, Federal law is silent about the purchase of used \nvans, or the use of rental vans.\n  My bill addresses this loophole by incorporating language introduced \nduring the 107th Congress by Representative Mark Udall of Colorado to \nextend the ban from the sale of vans to leasing, renting and buying of \nvans. This is intended to make the buyers accountable as well as the \nseller. At a recent Senate Commerce Committee hearing, I asked NHTSA \nAdministrator Jeffrey Runge about this disparity in current law, and he \nagreed that when we're talking about transporting schoolchildren, \nwhat's good for new vans should be good for used and rented vans.\n  Also, to make it worth NHTSA's while to pursue violators, my bill \nwould raise the maximum penalty for violations of the prohibition on \nthe sale or rental of these vans to schools from $5,000 to $25,000.\n  I truly believe that this legislation will cut down on the number of \nfatal accidents involving 15-passenger vans by subjecting them to \nfederal rollover standards, providing consumers with adequate safety \ninformation and making sure that our schoolchildren are driven to \nschool in safe vehicles. I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong \nshow of support for this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. \n        Graham of South Carolina):\n  S. 721.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to provide refunds for \nunjust and unreasonable charges on electric energy in the State of \nCalifornia; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, released documents substantiating evidence of market \nmanipulation during the California electricity crisis.\n  At the same time, I am stunned that FERC took no action today on \nordering the companies that cheated California to pay refunds. Nor did \nFERC order renegotiation of the long-term electricity contracts that \nwere entered into when prices were artificially inflated. The documents \nreleased provide absolute and irrefutable evidence of market \nmanipulation by power generators and wholesale traders during \nCalifornia's electricity crisis. I believe it is long past due to end \nthe discussions and deliberations and time to start sending the refund \nchecks.\n  FERC should use its authority to order full refunds and order them \nimmediately. To make sure that happens, I am introducing legislation to \nguarantee that the people of California get back the money they are \nowed.\n  When the crisis first began in 2000, I introduced my first bill to \norder refunds. The bill that I am introducing today would require \nenergy companies to pay full refunds in the minimum amount of $8.9 \nbillion. In addition, my bill requires the FERC to order the \nrenegotiation of long-term contracts.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. We must not let \nthese companies get away with thievery.\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4445-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4445-S4447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 98--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n   PRESIDENT SHOULD DESIGNATE THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 12, 2003, THROUGH \n    OCTOBER 18, 2003, AS ``NATIONAL CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Grassley, Mr. DeWine, \nMr. Biden, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Bunning, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \nInhofe, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Specter, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Craig) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 98\n\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis, characterized by digestive \n     disorders and chronic lung infections, is a fatal lung \n     disease;\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis is one of the most common fatal \n     genetic diseases in the United States and one for which there \n     is no known cure;\n       Whereas more than 10,000,000 Americans are unknowing \n     carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene;\n       Whereas 1 out of every 3,500 babies born in the United \n     States is born with cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas approximately 30,000 people in the United States, \n     many of whom are children, have cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas the average life expectancy of an individual with \n     cystic fibrosis is 33 years;\n       Whereas prompt, aggressive treatment of the symptoms of \n     cystic fibrosis can extend the lives of those who have this \n     disease;\n       Whereas recent advances in cystic fibrosis research have \n     produced promising leads in gene, protein, and drug therapies \n     beneficial to persons afflicted with the disease;\n       Whereas this innovative research is progressing faster and \n     is being conducted more aggressively than ever before, due in \n     part to the establishment of a model clinical trials network \n     by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; and\n       Whereas education of the public on cystic fibrosis, \n     including the symptoms of the disease, increases knowledge \n     and understanding of cystic fibrosis and promotes early \n     diagnoses: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONAL CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should designate the week of October 12, \n     2003, through October 18, 2003, as ``National Cystic Fibrosis \n     Awareness Week''.\n       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests the President to \n     issue a proclamation--\n       (1) designating the week of October 12, 2003 through \n     October 18, 2003, as ``National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness \n     Week''; and\n       (2) calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n       (c) Additional Action.--The Senate commits to increasing \n     the quality of life for individuals with cystic fibrosis by \n     promoting public knowledge and understanding in a manner that \n     will result in earlier diagnoses, more fund-raising efforts \n     for research, and increased levels of support for those with \n     cystic fibrosis and their families.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nrecognizing October 12, 2003, through October 18, 2003, as National \nCystic Fibrosis Awareness Week. I am pleased to be joined by thirteen \nof my colleagues who are original cosponsors of the bill. We are \nhopeful that greater awareness of cystic fibrosis (CF) will lead to a \ncure.\n  The resolution is similar to one which I introduced in the 107th \nCongress, S. Res. 270, which was agreed to by unanimous consent on \nOctober 3, 2002. Since then, I have received input from the National \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the National Cystic Fibrosis \nAwareness Committee (NCFAC) and have updated the information \naccordingly. Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common fatal genetic \ndiseases in the United States and there is no known cure. It affects \napproximately 30,000 children and adults in the United States. As \nrecently as 25 years ago, most children born with cystic fibrosis died \nin early childhood and few survived to their teenage years. Today, most \ncan expect to live past 30. The difference stems from productive \nresearch which has led to an understanding of the way cystic fibrosis \ncauses life-threatening damage and to the development of preventive \ntechniques and treatments.\n  While there is no cure, early detection and prompt treatment can \nsignificantly improve and extend the lives of those with CF. My home \nstate of Colorado was one of the first states to require CF screening \nfor newborns. Happily, more states are now performing this simple test.\n  And, since the discovery of the defective CF gene in 1989, CF \nresearch has greatly accelerated. I am proud that Colorado is home to \nthe University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, including the \nChildren's Hospital, the National Jewish Medical and Research Center \nand the Anschutz Centers for Advanced Medicine, all of which are \nactively involved in CF research and care. The Children's Hospital is \none of fourteen innovative Therapeutics Development Centers nationwide \nperforming cutting edge clinical research to develop new treatments for \nCF.\n  Currently, the CF Foundation oversees more than 27 potential CF \nproducts in its drug development pipeline, including dozens in clinical \ntrials. In addition, small pilot trials and large clinical studies are \ncarried out in the 119 CF Foundation-accredited care centers across the \nUnited States. Organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Research, Inc. \nalso sponsor studies for treatment of the disease. Efforts such as \nthese throughout the nation are providing a greater quality of life for \nthose who have CF. We applaud these efforts.\n  While I am encouraged by the CF research in Colorado and elsewhere, \nmore needs to be done. I believe we can increase the quality of life \nfor individuals with Cystic Fibrosis by promoting public knowledge and \nunderstanding of the disease in a manner that will result in earlier \ndiagnoses, more fund raising efforts for research, and increased levels \nof support for those who have CF and their families.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to act on this resolution so we can \nmove another step closer to eradicating this disease.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 99--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, \n         FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF NEW YORK\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Frist, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nLott, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nBreaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, \nMs. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nColeman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, \nMr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \nFeingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. \nGraham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, \nMr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nLieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Miller, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \nWarner, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 99\n\n       Whereas Daniel Patrick Moynihan served in the United States \n     Navy from 1944 to 1947;\n       Whereas Daniel Patrick Moynihan held cabinet or sub-cabinet \n     positions under Presidents John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, \n     Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford from 1961 to 1976;\n       Whereas Daniel Patrick Moynihan served as Ambassador to \n     India from 1973 to 1975;\n       Whereas Daniel Patrick Moynihan served as the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1975 to \n     1976;\n       Whereas Daniel Patrick Moynihan served the people of New \n     York with distinction for 24 years in the United States \n     Senate; and\n       Whereas Daniel Patrick Moynihan was the author of countless \n     books and scholarly articles which contributed enormously to \n     the intellectual vigor of the nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan, former member of the United States \n     Senate.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate \n     these resolutions to the House of Representatives and \n     transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the \n     deceased;\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 100--RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR OF THE \n FOUNDING OF THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY, WHICH HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PART \nOF THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND CULTURAL HERITAGE OF THE UNITED STATES AND \n     MANY OTHER NATIONS, AND A REVOLUTIONARY INDUSTRIAL AND GLOBAL \nINSTITUTION, AND CONGRATULATING FORD MOTOR COMPANY FOR ITS ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Allen, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \nBunning, Mr. Miller, Mr. Chambliss, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Warner) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 100\n\n       Whereas on June 16, 1903, then 39 year-old Henry Ford and \n     11 associates, armed with little cash, some tools, a few \n     blueprints, and unbounded faith, launched the Ford Motor \n     Company by submitting incorporation papers in Lansing, \n     Michigan;\n       Whereas the Ford Motor Company began operations in a \n     leased, small converted wagon factory on a spur of the \n     Michigan Central Railroad in Detroit;\n       Whereas the first commercial automobile emerged from the \n     Ford Motor Company in 1903 and was the original 8-horsepower, \n     2-cylinder Model A vehicle, which was advertised as the \n     ``Fordmobile'' and had a 2-speed transmission, 28-inch wheels \n     with wooden spokes, and 3-inch tires;\n       Whereas between 1903 and 1908, Henry Ford and his engineers \n     developed numerous models named after the letters of the \n     alphabet, with some of the models being only experimental and \n     not available to the public;\n       Whereas on October 1, 1908, the Ford Motor Company \n     introduced its ``universal car'', the Model T (sometimes \n     affectionately called the ``Tin Lizzie''), which could be \n     reconfigured by buyers to move cattle, haul freight, herd \n     horses, and even mow lawns, and Ford produced 10,660 Model T \n     vehicles its first model year, an industry record;\n       Whereas the Ford Motor Company inaugurated the first \n     automotive integrated moving assembly line in 1913, changing \n     the old manner of building 1 car at a time through moving the \n     work to the worker by having parts, components, and \n     assemblers stationed at different intervals, and beginning a \n     new era of industrial progress and growth;\n       Whereas Henry Ford surprised the world in 1914 by setting \n     Ford's minimum wage at $5.00 for an 8-hour day, which \n     replaced the prior $2.34 wage for a 9-hour day and was a \n     truly great social revolution for its time;\n       Whereas, also in 1914, Henry Ford, with an eye to \n     simplicity, efficiency, and affordability, ordered that the \n     Model T use black paint exclusively because it dried faster \n     than other colors, allowing cars to be built daily at a lower \n     cost, and Ford said the vehicle will be offered in ``any \n     color so long as it is black'';\n       Whereas, Ford's self-contained Rouge manufacturing complex \n     on the Rouge River, completed in 1925, encompassed diverse \n     industries, including suppliers, that allowed for the \n     complete production of vehicles from raw materials processing \n     to final assembly, was an icon of the 20th century, and, with \n     its current revitalization and redevelopment, will remain an \n     icon in the 21st century;\n       Whereas, in 1925, the company built the first of 196 Ford \n     Tri-Motor airplanes, nicknamed the ``Tin Goose'' and the \n     ``Model T of the Air'';\n       Whereas consumer demand for more luxury and power pushed \n     aside the current model, and, on March 9, 1932, a Ford \n     vehicle with the pioneering Ford V-8 engine block cast in 1 \n     piece rolled off the production line;\n       Whereas, while Ford offered only 2 models through 1937 \n     (Ford and Lincoln), due to increased competition, in 1938 \n     Ford introduced the first Mercury, a car with a distinctive \n     streamlined body style, a V-8 engine with more horsepower \n     than a Ford, and hydraulic brakes, thus filling the void \n     between the low-priced Ford and the high-priced Lincoln;\n       Whereas the United Automobile Workers (UAW), one of the \n     largest labor unions in the Nation, was formed in 1935 and, \n     after a rather tumultuous beginning, won acceptance by the \n     auto industry, becoming a potent and forceful leader for auto \n     workers with Ford, which built a strong relationship with the \n     union through its policies and programs;\n       Whereas, by government decree, all civilian auto production \n     in the United States ceased on February 10, 1942, and Ford, \n     under the control of the War Production Board, produced an \n     extensive array of tanks, B-24 aircraft, armored cars, \n     amphibious craft, gliders, and other materials for the World \n     War II war effort;\n       Whereas Ford dealers rallied to aid the Ford Motor Company \n     in its postwar comeback, proving their merit as the public's \n     main point of contact with the Company;\n       Whereas on September 21, 1945, Henry Ford II assumed the \n     presidency of Ford, and on April 7, 1947, Ford's founder, \n     Henry Ford passed away;\n       Whereas a revitalized Ford met the postwar economic boom \n     with Ford's famed F-Series trucks making their debut in 1948 \n     for commercial and personal use, and the debut of the 1949 \n     Ford sedan, with the first major change in a Ford body since \n     1922, the first change in a chassis since 1932, and the first \n     integration of body and fenders which would set the standard \n     for auto design in the future;\n       Whereas these new models were followed by such well-known \n     vehicles as Ford ``woodies'', the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, \n     the retractable hardtop convertible Ford Skyliner, the high \n     performing Ford Thunderbird (introduced in 1955), the Ford \n     Galaxy (introduced in 1959), and the biggest success story of \n     the 1960s, the Ford Mustang, which has been a part of the \n     American scene for almost 40 years;\n       Whereas, in 1953, President Dwight D.

We call \n     upon the United Nations Security Council to take the \n     necessary and appropriate action in response to Iraq's \n     continuing threat to international peace and security.'';\n       Whereas many of the supporters of the January 30, 2003, and \n     February 5, 2003, declarations have provided important \n     support to the United States in addition to their political \n     declarations; and\n       Whereas in addition to the supporters of the January 30, \n     2003, and February 5, 2003, declarations, important \n     diplomatic and strategic support to the United States-led \n     Coalition to Disarm Iraq have been provided by such nations \n     as Afghanistan, Angola, Australia, Azerbaijan, Colombia, \n     Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Eritrea, \n     Ethiopia, Georgia, Honduras, Iceland, Japan, Kuwait, \n     Macedonia, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Mongolia, the \n     Netherlands, Nicaragua, Palau, Panama, the Philippines, \n     Rwanda, Singapore, the Solomon Islands, South Korea, Tonga, \n     Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends and expresses the gratitude of the United \n     States to the nations participating in and contributing to \n     the Coalition to Disarm Iraq, including--\n       (A) the supporters of the January 30, 2003, declaration \n     issued by the Prime Ministers of Denmark, Hungary, Italy, \n     Poland, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, and the Presidents \n     of the Czech Republic and the Spanish Government;\n       (B) the supporters of the February 5, 2003, declaration \n     issued by the Foreign Ministers of Albania, Bulgaria, \n     Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia; and\n       (C) other allies of the United States who are participating \n     in or contributing to the Coalition;\n       (2) expresses sincere gratitude to Australia, Denmark, \n     Poland, and the United Kingdom, whose military forces have \n     joined United States Armed Forces to disarm and liberate \n     Iraq;\n       (3) expresses sincere gratitude to the Prime Minister of \n     the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of \n     Australia, John Howard, and the President of the Spanish \n     Government, Jose Maria Aznar, for their courageous support \n     and strong commitment to the Coalition to Disarm Iraq;\n       (4) expresses sincere gratitude to other allied nations, \n     including nations in the Persian Gulf region, for their \n     military support, logistical support, and other assistance in \n     the current campaign against the regime of Saddam Hussein in \n     Iraq;\n       (5) welcomes and encourages the active involvement and \n     participation of these countries, other nations, and key \n     international organizations in the reconstruction and \n     administration of Iraq after the current conflict in Iraq; \n     and\n       (6) commends and expresses the gratitude of the United \n     States to the military personnel and civilians of the member \n     states of the Coalition to Disarm Iraq who are serving in \n     operations against the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and \n     to the family members of such personnel and civilians who \n     have borne the burden of sacrifice and separation from their \n     loved ones during the current conflict in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4447-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 428.

Mr. President, I wish to share a few thoughts on the \npassing of the remarkable Daniel Patrick Moynihan, one of America's \nmost brilliant people. He graced this Senate and served this country in \ninnumerable ways.\n  He, of course, was a great scientist, a person able to study complex \ndata and make serious judgments. I remember being in the subway at a \npoint not too long before he left the Senate. Some numbers had come out \nthat indicated we were doing a little better in marriage, a little less \nnumber of children were being born out of wedlock. We were standing \nthere and somebody said something about that point. With great \nintensity and passion, he said: That's nothing. In the history of the \nworld, no Nation has ever seen a collapse of marriage like we are \nseeing in this country.\n  It just hit me he was giving us a scientific analysis of a very \nserious social problem with which we needed to deal, and he took it \nvery seriously.\n  Another incident I recall was being in this small dining room. We \nwere working late one night and voting. I went in with the majority \nleader, Trent Lott, and was talking to Trent about Colombia, the \nrevolutionaries there, the Marxist group, the drug dealing group and \nwanted to do some things better for Colombia. We sat down and Senator \nMoynihan was there. Trent said: Pat, tell me about Colombia; what's \ngoing on in Colombia.\n  We just sat in rapt attention as he described the last 50 years in \nColombia in detail--how this country had developed a history of \nviolence, how they were having revolutionary problems, and how it was \ngoing to be very difficult to eliminate those problems. I was stunned \nat the encyclopedic knowledge he displayed.\n  As we left, Trent said: I love to ask him those questions. He always \nknows those kinds of things. He said: I do it frequently just to see \nwhat he will share with us.\n  I remember asking about serving as Ambassador to India. He told a \nstory, a complex story, that gave such great insight into the good \npeople of India.\n  Pat Moynihan was an extraordinary person. He operated on a higher \nlevel. He benefited this country in many ways. He served Republican \nPresidents and Democratic Presidents, and he served in this body. He \nhelped point out the problems with welfare and helped us move toward \nreform. He served on the commission that courageously gave insight into \nhow we may improve Social Security. He, in many\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\nways, on those two issues with Nixon going to China had the ability and \nthe credibility to move the country in a way that some lesser Senator \nmay not have been able to do.\n  I wanted to take a moment before we adjourned to express my thoughts \nabout Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, one of the most brilliant people \nto ever grace this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/26/senate-section/article/S4455-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
