Mr. President, I welcome everyone back for the final \nwrapup of the 108th Congress. I was just speaking with the Democratic \nleader, and we were remarking that we have a lot to do in a short \nperiod of time over the course of the week.\n  There is a lot going on in terms of orientation of new Senators who \nwill not officially take office until January, but there are also \nleadership elections occurring today and tomorrow. I expect that in \nthis brief session, which will bring the 108th Congress to a close, we \nwill finish before Thanksgiving for sure. And as we sort out both the \nagenda and work that has been accomplished over the last several weeks, \nwe will have a much better and clearer idea as to when we will finish \nthis brief session.\n  I know everybody is anxious to get back to their families after this \nweek or week and a half and to spend time with constituents and begin \nenjoying the eventual holidays and planning for the year ahead.\n  I look forward to working with the new Senators as they come onboard, \nand the leadership, as the leadership elections occur. I think we will \nall join with a renewed commitment to working together, working across \nthe aisle, working with civility and respect for the traditions of the \nSenate. I think we will be able to build effectively on the \naccomplishments we have achieved to date in the 108th Congress.\n  Over the next several days, we have a lot of business, with three \nessential pieces of business that must be addressed. The nine remaining \nspending bills for fiscal year 2005 are currently being addressed in \nwhat is called an omnibus bill. It is a bipartisan bill. There has been \nhuge progress over the last several weeks as staff and Senators have \nbeen working together on this very important bill.\n  Second, we have intelligence matters and an authorization bill for \nthe Intelligence Committee that is currently being addressed, as well \nas legislation that is currently in conference that addresses the 9/11 \nCommission reform recommendations, an effort we began to aggressively \naddress in late July once the 9/11 Commission Report was released, and \nimmediately Senator Daschle and I set a course that has been followed \npretty much as we intended. That is, following hearings, we would \ndiscuss and write a bill in the Senate and pass that bill, and the \nHouse likewise.\n  Conferees were appointed several weeks ago, and the conferees have \nbeen working constantly to generate and produce a bill that I am very \nhopeful we will be able to bring to the floor later this week.\n  The third issue is the debt limit. Secretary Snow informs us that we \nhave a short window of opportunity to get the debt limit accomplished. \nThe Treasury Department estimates that Congress must take action by \nThursday in order to prevent the Federal Government from defaulting on \nthe debt. Discussions have been underway in the last several days and \nwill be underway today as to how best we accomplish that.\n  We have some scheduling challenges that will occur over the course of \nthis week, a little bit later in the week. It obviously is an issue we \nwill be addressing. I am confident we will be able to take \nthe necessary steps to avoid even any consideration of default.\n\n  In addition, there are a number of other issues that we will be \naddressing, such as nominations that we would like to settle in this \n108th Congress. Those discussions are underway. We have the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. The House and Senate conferees \nwill be meeting on Wednesday to approve the negotiated language. So I \nexpect we will be able to pass that bill by the end of the week and \nhave it on the President's desk before we adjourn.\n  Briefly, with respect to the schedule today, we will be recessing at \n12:30 p.m. in order for the Democratic policy luncheon to meet. This \nside of the aisle will be conducting our leadership elections in a \npolicy meeting tomorrow.\n  Today, we will reconvene at 2:15 p.m. to begin consideration of the \nnomination of Francis Harvey to be Secretary\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\nof the Army. The order provides for up to 3 hours of debate, and if all \nthat time is used, we will be voting at approximately 5:15 p.m. today. \nWe will be updating Members this afternoon as it becomes clear how much \nof that debate time will be necessary.\n  We will be having discussions with leadership over the course of the \nday on the debt extension bill as to how we will plan that out in terms \nof voting so people will be able to have their schedules accommodated \nfor especially Thursday. As all of our colleagues know, the Clinton \nLibrary will be inaugurated at that point in time, and we will be \nmaking appropriate accommodations for voting.\n  I mentioned the appropriations process. I do think we are going to be \nable to carry out closure on those negotiations quickly and that we \nwill have something for action sometime this week.\n  We in all likelihood will remain here this week and finish our work \non the appropriations bill--hopefully this week, obviously very late \nthis week. We will keep Senators notified as to the schedule.\n  I mentioned the Intelligence reform bill is still in conference. \nMembers were working late last night and are in through today. As I \nmentioned, it has been nonstop. I am very hopeful we will be able to \ncomplete that bill as well.\n  In short, in closing, there are a very few days remaining. We have a \nlot of scheduling challenges. I will be looking forward to working with \nour counterparts on the other side of the aisle in addressing the \nbusiness with the expectation, if at all possible, that we will be able \nto complete work this week, which would be the objective. Again, that \nis a lot to accomplish in the next several days.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11336-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the work the \nmajority leader has clearly laid out as an agenda that I think both \nsides wish and hope we can accomplish this week. There is a lot to be \ndone but a lot has been done.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee has worked \ndiligently these past weeks to reach a point where we have agreement, \nas I understand it, on all but one of the bills. That will allow us to \nexpedite consideration of the appropriations process this week.\n  A lot of work has been done on the\n9/11 Commission. Even though we still have not resolved some of the \nremaining questions, I hope Senators--and House Members especially--\nwould refrain from extraneous issues because that only complicates our \nability to complete our work.\n  There is a lot of effort that has been made now on the nominations \npackage that has been the subject of a great deal of discussion and \nnegotiation for many weeks. As the distinguished majority leader has \nnoted, there is a possibility that we could also do IDEA. I think that \nwould be a great culmination of the effort that has been made \nthroughout the last several weeks as we have looked to completing that \nwork before the end of the year.\n  So much remains. Much has been done. We hope to work very closely \nwith our Republican friends to make this as productive a week as we \ncan.\n  We are also appreciative of the majority leader's willingness to \naccommodate the schedule for many of us to allow for the travel to \nLittle Rock to attend the dedication ceremonies for the new \nPresidential library, the Clinton Library.\n  It will be an exciting week, a very busy week, and one that I hope, \nat the end of the day, will be a very productive one as well. I look \nforward to working with the majority leader in that regard and will \nhave more to say on many of these bills as the week unfolds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11336-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will be very brief. I just want to make a \nfew more comments since we have a few minutes before 12:30 and I see we \ndo have another Senator in the Chamber who is desiring to speak.\n  Over the 108th Congress, we have worked hard to move America forward. \nIndeed, we have gotten results. We have an economy now that is \nrebounding with job growth that is robust; 2.4 million jobs have been \ncreated since August of last year with 14 straight months of job gains. \nWe have unemployment down from its 6.3 percent peak last year. \nUnemployment rates have fallen across categories of race and age and \nall levels of education. Inflation remains low. Interest rates remain \nlow. Our tax cuts clearly have had a huge effect on the economy. \nAmericans today enjoy more of their hard-earned money to spend, to \nsave, to invest as they choose. We have home ownership at an all-time \nhigh including among African Americans, where it is at an all-time \nhigh. Health care security has made huge advances.\n  We have a lot more to do. Many of these issues played out in the \nrecent elections. I think, as we all begin to plan for the next \nCongress, clearly health care will remain high on that agenda. We have \na lot to be proud of in this Congress in addressing health care \nsecurity for seniors, addressing Medicare modernization, strengthening \nof Medicare with the biggest reform package in the last 40 years. All \nthis translates down to better health care security for seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  For the first time, Medicare will cover the most powerful tool we \nhave in medicine today and that is prescription drugs. That is a huge \nservice to seniors to give them the health care security they deserve. \nThat is a good first step. Again, we have to come back and look and \nmake sure we continue to strengthen Medicare over time.\n\n  Over the last week, as I traveled around the country, I have taken \nthe opportunity to ask about these drug discount cards we have made \navailable through Medicare. Indeed, 4 million seniors today have these \nMedicare discount cards that give them discounts of 10 percent to 25 \npercent, which they simply did not have before we passed that \nlegislation.\n  I do want to remind low-income seniors who have not yet signed up for \none of those prescription drug cards that if you sign up for one of \nthose cards, it has, in addition to those discounts, $1,200 of value on \nit and $600 of that value will go away after January 1 of next year. So \nI encourage you to sign up for those cards. If you have any questions, \nas most seniors know, you can call 1-800-MEDICARE and have those \nquestions answered.\n  Health savings accounts--a lot is being written about them in the \nnewspapers today. In fact, in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan, medical savings accounts for the first time will be made an \noption for us in the Senate and for the 8 or 9 or 10 million Federal \nemployees around the country. Indeed, I look forward to signing up for \na health savings account myself here as we reenroll in the next several \nweeks.\n  The President's agenda for the upcoming Congress is going to be \nvigorous. I had the opportunity to meet with the President yesterday, \nand with the Speaker of the House. Although we focused mainly on \nfinishing the work over the course of this week, as I mentioned in my \nopening statement, I am very excited about the agenda, the vision that \nis laid out for next year.\n  As I also said in my opening comments, I look forward to working \naggressively across the aisle, with civility, in a bipartisan way, as \nwe address this agenda that the American people really deserve. The \nissues are many.\n\n[[Page S11337]]\n\nWe will have the opportunity to discuss those in the future.\n  Mr. President, we are back for a short period of time. It is real \nclear, in terms of what we have to accomplish. We are not going to be \ndoing a lot of new business because we have much unfinished business to \ndo.\n  I do welcome my colleagues back. Over the next several days there \nwill be opportunity for tributes for Senators who are retiring and \nleaving this body. The Democratic caucus just had their leadership \nelections and I want to congratulate each one of those new leaders and \nwill do so formally, not quite now but a little bit later, in phone \ncalls to them. We have our leadership elections tomorrow. I look \nforward, leadership to leadership, to working in a vigorous, robust way \nto accomplish the agenda before the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no unanimous consent required. \nThe Senator is authorized to speak for 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11337-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FINDING COMMON GROUND\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened closely to the comments made by \nthe majority leader, Senator Frist, a man whom I respect and with whom \nI have worked over the past several years and look forward to working \nwith again in this new Congress.\n  The Presidential election is completed. The people have spoken. A few \nmoments ago the Democratic Senators gathered just a few feet from this \nChamber in the Old Senate Chamber where we had an election of our new \nleaders for the upcoming Congress. In that meeting was Senator John \nKerry, who was our standard-bearer in the last election. We are all \nextremely proud of the job he did. Both he and Senator Edwards covered \nthe United States, crisscrossed it from every corner, taking their \nmessage to the American people. The outcome was very close. When it was \nall said and done, President Bush had emerged the clear winner. The day \nafter the election Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards conceded to the \nPresident and Vice President.\n  We now have a question before us as to which direction this Nation is \nheaded. It is a question that is going to be dramatized even more by \nthe recent resignations of key members of President Bush's Cabinet. It \nwill now be up to the President and his close advisers to decide the \nteam that he will put on the field for the next 4 years to serve and \nrepresent the American people.\n  The President will also have an opportunity and responsibility to \ndevelop an agenda, an agenda of issues to bring before the Congress.\n  At an early point the President will have to make threshold \ndecisions. Will he make decisions in terms of his leadership team, an \nagenda where we will try to find a bipartisan approach to solving our \nproblems, or will we separate as we have in the past? I sincerely hope \nthe President chooses the former and not the latter. It will be a \nbetter service to our country if we sit down on a bipartisan basis and \naddress some of the serious issues we face.\n  On foreign policy, we can't escape the stubborn realities. We still \nhave the ongoing threat from terrorists. The war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is far from over. We face a nuclear North Korea. Our \nmilitary concerns stretch across the world from Saudi Arabia to the \nPhilippines. Our military is stretched to the limit, and our resources \nare constrained by record deficits which we have seen during the last \nseveral years in the Bush administration.\n  On the home front, the President's policies raise questions about the \nfuture of Social Security and whether we can trust it to continue to \npay as it has in the past, and our ability to invest in America and the \nmany freedoms we value which Senator Frist talked about earlier. That \nis an issue that is front and center in my State of Illinois.\n  As I traveled across the Nation, I heard concern about the cost of \nhealth insurance from business leaders, families, and individuals \nalike. In the last 4 years absolutely nothing has been proposed from \nthe administration to deal with the cost of health insurance. I hope \nthe President will come forward with a good, sensible plan. A good \nstarting place might be the Federal Employees Benefit Health Plan, a \nplan that covers millions of Federal employees and which offers them an \nenormous variety of options for health insurance at reasonable costs. \nThat is a model we should use to offer the same insurance to small \nbusinesses and the American people.\n  Senator Frist spoke of the Medicare prescription drug plan. This plan \nhas been very coldly received by seniors across America. They cannot \nunderstand why Congress couldn't pass something that was understandable \nand which would truly help them. The Medicare prescription drug plan as \npassed by the Congress is so bad that we postponed its effective date \nuntil after this election. Those who wrote it knew if seniors saw \nexactly what we had proposed, they would rise up in opposition to it. \nThey are learning that when you give everything to the pharmaceutical \ncompanies and you don't protect the seniors, you don't solve the \nproblem.\n  We have a lot to do in the months and years ahead. I hope we can do \nthis on a bipartisan basis. It would be a value to this country to see \nus come together. But it will start with leadership from the White \nHouse, and decisions by the President which can bring us together.\n  We have stood together, Democrats and Republicans, on the declaration \nof the Afghanistan war, No Child Left Behind, intelligence reform, \nSarbanes-Oxley, a bill to reform corporate governance, and also the \napproval of 201 of the President's proposed 211 judicial nominees. \nThere has been good cooperation in many areas. If the President's party \nexpects Senate Democrats to walk away from their basic values, I don't \nthink that is going to occur.\n  I listened in this caucus we left and I wondered if some of the \nwriters who said since the election the Democrats were adrift listened \nto the Democratic Senators. We understand their values. They are \nAmerican values, and they are values which we take to the American \npeople in each of our own States.\n  I look forward to working with our friends on the Republican side of \nthe aisle in trying to find common ground, which is so important. We \nbelieve that on critical matters of personal responsibility and freedom \nwe should have an honest resolution. We also believe that caring for \nthe less fortunate is a moral value and most major religions should be \nrespected. I look forward to the upcoming Congress and I hope we can \nfind the common ground.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11337-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11337-S11338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       APPRECIATION OF PAUL NITZE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a very few minutes \nto recognize and reflect on the extraordinary career in public service \nof Paul Nitze who died on October 21, since the Congress recessed.\n  Paul Nitze was probably the paragon of the private citizen rendering \npublic service at the request of his government. His service was \nrendered to Democratic and Republican Presidents alike.\n  Paul Nitze was first summoned to Washington in 1940 by James V. \nForrestal, his former boss at the New York investment bank where both \nhad worked. Once in Washington, Nitze became involved in a variety of \nactivities leading up to and supporting America's efforts in World War \nII. He helped draft the Selective Service Act. He served as chief of \nthe Metals and Minerals Branch of the Board of Economic Warfare. He \noversaw foreign procurement of goods and services for the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  From 1944 to 1946, Nitze served as vice-chairman of the U.S. \nStrategic Bombing Survey, which studied the impact of U.S. bombing in \nEurope and Japan after we had dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and \nNagasaki. This office applied rigorous analytical methods to assess the \neffectiveness of weapons and tactic in World War II. It was the \nforerunner of today's Program Analysis and Evaluation Office on the \nPentagon.\n  After the war, the scope of Paul Nitze's contributions continued to \nexpand. He headed a billion-dollar global\n\n[[Page S11338]]\n\nrelief program to feed those left homeless and without food by World \nWar II. Perhaps his most far-reaching contribution was as the head of \nthe State Department's policy planning staff in the Truman \nadministration. Working under Dean Acheson and along with other \ninfluential thinkers such as Charles Bohlen and George Kennan, Nitze \nwas the principal author of the National Security Council document, \nentitled ``United States Objectives and Programs for National \nSecurity,'' but more commonly known as NSC-68, that provided the \nstrategic outline for the conduct of deterrence during the Cold War.\n  Key insights from NSC-68 still ring true today.\n  For example, NSC-68 situated our strategy towards the former Soviet \nUnion in a broader world context. It stated, in part:\n\n       Our overall policy at the present time may be described as \n     one designed to foster a world environment in which the \n     American system can survive and flourish. It therefore \n     rejects the concept of isolation and affirms the necessity of \n     our positive participation in the world community. This broad \n     intention embraces two subsidiary policies. One is a policy \n     which we would probably pursue even if there were no Soviet \n     threat. It is a policy of attempting to develop a healthy \n     international community. The other is the policy of \n     ``containing'' the Soviet system. These two policies are \n     closely interrelated and interact on one another. \n     Nevertheless, the distinction between them is basically valid \n     and contributes to a clearer understanding of what we are \n     trying to do.\n\n  Paul Nitze continued to make significant contributions to out \nnational security through the 1960s, as Secretary of the Navy under \nPresidents Kennedy and Johnson and Deputy Secretary of Defense under \nPresident Johnson.\n  President Nixon appointed Nitze to the U.S. delegation to the \nStrategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviet Union in 1969, and he \nplayed an important role in negotiating the ABM Treaty with Moscow \nduring that time. Under Presidents Nixon and Ford, he served as \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for International Affairs.\n  During the term of President Carter, Nitze played a seminal role as \nan external critic of national security policy. His stature was such \nthat his opposition to the SALT II Treaty negotiated by President \nCarter was an important factor in its failure to garner support in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Yet, his reputation as a hard-liner on defense was too simplistic a \ncharacterization for his formidable intellect and ability to respond to \nnew realities with new strategies to maintain U.S. security.\n  The most famous example, perhaps, of this characteristic was Paul \nNitze's famous ``walk in the woods'' with his Soviet counterpart in \narms control negotiations, Yuli Kvitsinsky. His informal proposal to \nput drawdowns in intermediate-range nuclear missiles in a broader \ncontext of arms reductions was considered too radical at the time, and \nwas rejected by both sides. Yet, only a few years later, a more \ncomprehensive approach is precisely what both sides agreed to, for in \n1987 the United States and the Soviet Union signed the so-called \n``double zero'' agreement that limited all medium-range missiles in \nEurope as shorter-range missiles as well.\n  But perhaps the most important lessons we can learn is from the \npattern of Paul Nitze's life and contributions. At this time, when the \nnews headlines are dominated with stories of transitions and \nresignations from the Executive Branch, covered like a sports story of \nwho's won and who's lost, the tendency is to think of those leaving \npublic service as persons who have had their shot, and are not likely \nto be heard from ever again. I think that the example of Paul Nitze \nshows how much the United States stands to lose if we were to fall into \nsuch an unfortunate way of thinking with respect to public service.\n  I for one hope some of those who are now leaving public service will \nin the future find additional ways to serve their country, as Paul \nNitze found ways to serve his country over many decades. I hope Paul \nNitze's life and career will inspire all of us to a vision of how our \nNation can benefit from the extraordinary expertise of its citizens who \nare willing to respond to the call to public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11338-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

HARVEY TO BE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session for consideration of Executive Calendar \nNo. 915, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Francis J. \nHarvey, of California, to be Secretary of the Army.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the President's \nnomination of Dr. Francis J. Harvey to be Secretary of the U.S. Army. \nDr. Harvey was nominated by the President to be Secretary of the Army \non September 15, this year. The Armed Services Committee conducted a \nhearing on Dr. Harvey's nomination on October 6. The committee voted \nfavorably on the nomination on October 7. At that meeting there was \nsome expression in opposition by members of the committee, but the \nmajority of the committee voted in favor.\n  At the hearing, there was a fair exchange of viewpoints, recognizing \nthat Dr. Harvey is coming to this position from outside of the \nDepartment of Defense and has, during the course of his distinguished \ncareer, not a specific opportunity to form opinions about some of the \nkey issues that confront the U.S. Army today.\n  No one should underestimate the challenges that have been faced by \nthe Army and in large measure have been met by the Army under the \ndistinguished leadership of the Acting Secretary of the Army and the \ncurrent Chief of Staff of the Army. I commend both of them, who are \ndaily meeting the new challenges as they arise.\n  There will be today in the course of this debate, and I shall await \nother Members coming to the floor, expressions of opinion different \nfrom what I am providing the Senate today so I will wait until such \ntime as they may appear and then seek under my time the opportunity to \nrebut their views.\n  At the hearing of the committee on October 6, I indicated that Dr. \nHarvey has had an extraordinary career--and I underline very \nextraordinary career--as a business executive with extensive experience \nleading and managing very large corporate enterprises, particularly \nprogram-based organizations involved in the development and deployment \nof technology and systems.\n\n  As the Army goes through its transformation, he will have the \nopportunity to provide unique decisionmaking ability given his \nexperience in those areas.\n  Dr. Harvey has a solid record of achievement in the private sector in \nareas related to transformation, financial management, and contracting \nwhich, as I said, will serve him very well if confirmed by the Senate \nas Secretary of the Army.\n  At the nomination hearing, as those in attendance will recall, I went \nto some length to emphasize that there is another side to the Army and \nthat is the human side. I was privileged at one time in my lifetime to \nbe in the Department of Defense and to be Secretary of the Navy. It is \nnot all contracts and negotiations and things of that nature; there is \na very strong family side to each of the military departments. I \nreferred to it in that hearing as the human side. That reflects the \nhopes and aspirations and patriotism of soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nmarines, and their families.\n  The family today has an ever increasing role in the life of the \nuniformed member of that family, be he male or female. Families now are \ninstrumental in the decision process by which members of the military \nat the time they are up for consideration elect continuing service, to \nretire, or otherwise step aside and join the private sector. It is \noften the decision of the family that controls that sailor, airman, \nmarine, as he or she makes that decision.\n\n[[Page S11339]]\n\n  I urged Dr. Harvey to travel as soon as possible to Iraq, \nAfghanistan, the Republic of Korea, in order to gain firsthand \nappreciation for the sacrifice being made by the soldiers and the \nstress being placed upon them and their families. Soldiers must be \nconfident that the civilian leader of the department he represents is \ntruly aware of their specific meanings and the emphasis on the family \nrole.\n  The Army is facing a great challenge today for which there are few \nprecedents in a long, distinguished history. Dr. Harvey assured the \ncommittee on October 6 he would undertake this mission of familiarizing \nhimself with the people who make up the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, \nand the National Guard. It is extraordinary, with over 400,000 who have \nbeen in this particular cycle of conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq from \nthe Guard and Reserve.\n  At the hearing, Dr. Harvey committed that he would put people first. \nHe emphasized that even as the Army carries out its responsibilities in \nthe near term, it must also develop a future force that is better able \nto meet the challenges of this dangerous security environment by \nimplementing the key element of defense strategy. He is committed to \nthis transformation that has been laid down in the years previous by \nthe Secretary of Defense, whom I commend for his undertaking and \ntransforming the Army, and the Chief of Staff who currently serves and, \nindeed, the accomplishments to date by the distinguished Acting \nSecretary, Secretary Brownlee.\n  Before I yield, I will say a few words about Secretary Brownlee. I \nwas privileged to have the services of Secretary Brownlee on my \npersonal staff and as a member of the committee staff. I note that he \nserved as the senior member of the Armed Services Committee staff, \nchief of that staff, at the time our distinguished late colleague Strom \nThurmond was chairman. He was a superb combat soldier. He brought to \nhis work on behalf of the Senate an extraordinary record of a highly \ndecorated officer. He had a tremendous inner confidence in his ability \nto understand the men and women in the Armed Forces and to understand \nparticularly those who are experiencing the stress of combat, wherever \nthat may be in the world--an extraordinary man: Two Silver Stars, three \nBronze Stars, and the Purple Heart. He was a marvelous staff director \nnot only for Senator Thurmond but to me. He is highly revered and \nrespected and always will be by the Senate as a whole.\n\n  Many colleagues came up to me during the course of the vacancy at the \nSecretary of the Army position in expressing hopes that he would be \nconsidered. Indeed, I talked to the Secretary of Defense on several \noccasions about it. On behalf of myself, most particularly, and other \ncolleagues, I advocated consideration be given to him, but the \nSecretary and the President made a decision. I am urging the Senate to \ngo forward with that decision today and to confirm the nomination of \nDr. Harvey.\n  I will yield the floor as I see the presence of my distinguished \nranking member and the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me first suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Army's current situation is approaching \ncrisis proportions. The Army is bearing the largest burden of the war \nin Iraq and of the larger war on terror worldwide as well as \nmaintaining forward-deployed forces to deter a possible conflict in \nKorea. The intense operations and personnel tempo are having a severe \nimpact on both people and equipment, and relief is currently not in \nsight.\n  There are nearly 270,000 soldiers deployed overseas in 120 countries. \nSoldiers make up 90,000 of the 135,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and 15,000 \nof the 20,000 in Afghanistan. The 495,000 active-duty soldiers have \nbeen stretched to the limit. The Army National Guard and Army Reserve \nsoldiers have been called upon to shoulder the ever-increasing burden.\n  For instance, the first rotation in Iraq consisted of 75-percent \nactive and 25-percent reserve component soldiers. In the current \nrotation, the Active Force has dropped to 61 percent and the Reserve \nForce has risen to 39 percent and the next rotation is projected to \ncontinue that trend, with about 57,000 percent active and 43 percent \nreserve.\n  This trend is simply not sustainable. Many reserve component soldiers \nare approaching their 24-month limit on active duty and many more will \nreach that limit as the war in Iraq drags on. The stress on reserve \ncomponent soldiers, family members, and civilian employees will only \ngrow worse, as Senator Reed has pointed out to this body on many \noccasions and in the Armed Services Committee, has already had an \nadverse effect on reserve component recruitment, and greater problems \nare predicted for the future.\n  Further, as reserve component units have been mobilized, personnel \nand equipment shortages have been addressed by tasking other units to \nfill those shortfalls. This is a snowballing effect as those units that \nwere tasked to provide personnel and equipment are then alerted and \ndeployed to subsequent rotations and have to fill ever-increasing \npersonnel and equipment shortfalls.\n  Ultimately, units lose cohesion and effectiveness as they are cobbled \ntogether from disparate pieces with people who do not know each other, \nhave not trained together, and are short of required equipment, or \nunfamiliar with the equipment provided.\n  This could have disastrous consequences, as evidenced by the \nleadership and performance failures witnessed in the 800th MP Brigade, \na brigade formed in that manner during the Abu Ghraib incidents.\n  The Active component is and will be under increasing stress as the \nReserve component commitments become unsustainable. The Army's 33 \nactive combat brigades have all been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan \nsince those two operations began. Some units, including the 3rd \nInfantry, which led the initial attack into Iraq, have been alerted or \ndeployed for a second 12-month combat tour. Two of these combat \nbrigades had Iraq combat tours extended to 15 months last April during \nthe Shiite uprising instigated by Moqtada Sadr. I understand that \ncontingency plans exist to extend the combat tours of other Army \nbrigades currently in Iraq to similarly build up troop levels prior to \nthe Iraqi elections.\n  Army policy is that soldiers should have at least 12 months between \ncombat rotations or 1 month for each month deployed. However, there are \nalready soldiers who are returning to Iraq or Afghanistan, having left \nthere only 9 to 10 months ago. And during those 9 to 10 months, the \nsoldiers are working long hours to repair equipment and spending \nseveral months away from their families as they train in preparation \nfor their unit's return to combat.\n  The Army is creating 10 additional combat brigades in an attempt to \naddress the problems created by the high rotation rate. However, as the \nArmy creates those additional brigades, it is reorganizing all of its \nbrigades into brigade combat teams which are somewhat smaller than \ncurrent brigades with respect to direct combat maneuver forces. \nAlthough the Army asserts that these brigade combat teams are more \nlethal because they have added artillery and reconnaissance assets that \nwere previously located at the division level, it is not at all certain \nthat the increased effectiveness that the Army expects from these \nredesigned brigades will make up for fewer combat troops on the ground. \nIf more brigades than are currently deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan \nare then required to make up for the fewer number of combat troops in \nthe new brigade structure, the operation and personnel tempo of the \nActive Force will not be much improved.\n  The Army is also addressing the personnel problem by imposing a stop-\nloss policy on soldiers in units alerted to deploy on combat rotations, \nforcing many to remain in the service well beyond their contracted time \nin the service. Additionally, the Army has had to recall over 5,600 \nmembers of the individual Ready Reserve, soldiers who have already \nserved their contracted\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\nActive-Duty time, for involuntary tours of duty. Clearly, many of the \nsoldiers in the ``All-Volunteer Army'' are no longer volunteers. As \nseveral critics have pointed out, this can be considered tantamount to \na ``backdoor'' draft.\n  The Army has also been suffering from the failure of the Department \nof Defense requirements generation and planning processes. The \nDepartment of Defense and the Army greatly underestimated the \nrequirements for up-armored high-mobility multipurpose wheeled \nvehicles--Humvees--and individual body armor for the war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and have continually lagged behind in meeting those \nrequirements, as well as requirements for armor for the entire truck \nfleet.\n  Similarly, the Army has had to implement a crash program to equip its \nhelicopters with aviation survivability equipment. For instance, the \nrequirement for individual body armor was originally limited to combat \narms soldiers only, even though for years the Army has been predicting \na battlefield where there would be no distinct front and rear areas and \nwhere support soldiers would also find themselves in combat situations.\n\n  The Army similarly failed to anticipate the need for armor for its \ntrucks, again even though it had been predicting such a fluid \nbattlefield. The Central Command requirement for up-armored Humvees was \noriginally set at only 253. That requirement has been continually \nincreased throughout the last year from 253 to 1,233 to 1,407 to 2,957 \nto 4,149 to 4,388 to 4,454, and now to 8,105. The Army and Congress \nhave poured over a billion dollars in the last year into armor for \ntrucks, but as of last month, the Army was still reporting a shortfall \nof $380 million to meet its requirement for armored trucks, and that is \nsimply unconscionable. There is no one in this Congress who would deny \nthe Army the funding needed to meet its requirements for force \nprotection.\n  However, force protection items are not the only funding shortfalls. \nThe Army has had $1.6 billion in equipment combat losses, $1.4 billion \nof which are aviation losses. Much of that loss occurred in fiscal year \n2003, and much of it has not been addressed in any of the supplemental \nappropriations bills to date because the Department of Defense did not \nchoose to include all of those combat losses in its requests. This does \nnot bode well for the Army as it continues its heavy engagement in \nIraq.\n  Similarly, Army equipment repair and replacement is not keeping up \nwith the increased wear and tear induced by such a high operations \ntempo. The Army's requirement for fiscal year 2003 was $4.4 billion, of \nwhich none was funded. The cumulative requirement in fiscal year 2004 \nwas $11.1 billion, of which only $3.4 billion was funded. If this trend \ncontinues at those emerging requirements and anticipated funding rates, \nby fiscal year 2007 the Army cumulative equipment repair and \nreplacement requirement will be $28.8 billion, of which only $12.1 \nbillion will have been funded. At that point, the Army will face a \n$16.7 billion maintenance backlog. This may have a severe impact on the \nArmy's ability to sustain combat operations in the future.\n  Several months ago, the Army estimated that it would cost over $20 \nbillion to create the additional 10 combat brigades and reorganize the \nexisting 33 in the Active Force into the new modular design. No \nestimate was provided Congress for the cost of similarly reorganizing \nthe Reserve component. The Army expects the new and reorganized \nbrigades for the Active Force to be completed by the end of fiscal \nyears 2006 and 2007 respectively, and paid for through supplemental \nfunding. It is my understanding that the Army, having received $15 \nbillion from the initial $25 billion fiscal year 2005 supplemental \nappropriation provided by Congress, will send the Department of Defense \na request for an additional $45 billion, a fiscal year 2005 \nsupplemental total of $60 billion. Of this amount, only $10 billion is \nexpected to be for equipment. How far that will go toward meeting the \nArmy's requirement is not clear at this time. Nor is it clear the \nDepartment of Defense will actually request that larger supplemental \nfor the Army alone. Past history does not bode well for the Army in \nthat regard either.\n\n  The challenges for the Army are huge, and the civilian leadership in \nthe Department of Defense has certainly not been supportive of the \nArmy's uniform leadership. In fact, it has often been hostile and \nvindictive. When General Shinseki, the former Chief of Staff, in \nanswering my prewar hearing question concerning the troop level \nrequired for postwar stability and support, opined that it would take \nseveral hundred thousand troops, he was publicly ridiculed by the \nSecretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense and effectively sidelined. \nWhen Army Secretary White defended the Chief of Staff, he was fired.\n  Dr. Harvey, the nominee for Secretary of the Army, appears to have a \nwealth of industry experience but appears to have virtually no \nexperience with regard to Army issues. In responding to questions for \nthe record on his nomination before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Dr. Harvey answered one question concerning whether the Army \nhad enough authorized Active-Duty end strength to sustain its \ncommitments by saying he would use his ``independent judgment and past \nexperience'' to determine the viability of Army initiatives to increase \ncombat power and to ``reach conclusions and make recommendations \naccordingly.''\n  I have no reason to question his ability to make an independent \njudgment. I am concerned as to whether his past experience qualifies \nhim to reach appropriate conclusions, under the circumstances which I \nhave just outlined, with an Army which is under so much stress and \nstrain. I also question whether he would be willing to make \nrecommendations contrary to the known positions of the Department of \nDefense leadership given the treatment received by his predecessors \nwhen they did so.\n  In answering a question concerning the problems in the Army's \nrequirements generation and planning processes that resulted in such a \nlarge shortfall in individual body armor, armor for trucks, and \naviation survivability equipment, Dr. Harvey said that his ``current \nunderstanding is that the underestimation of the total requirement for \narmor protection for our Nation's service members was not the result of \nproblems with the requirements generation process. The primary cause of \nthe initial underestimation was a change in the hostile conditions \nunder which military forces are now operating in Iraq.''\n  Dr. Harvey apparently did not realize that is exactly the kind of \nhostile conditions which the Army for several years has been predicting \nfor the future operational environment. It is an example of why I am \nconcerned about Dr. Harvey's lack of experience as to whether he would \nbe in a position to ask the hard questions and arrive at the \nappropriate recommendations under the very extraordinary and difficult \ncircumstances in which the Army finds itself.\n  There are numerous challenges that the Army faces, and it would be \npreferable that the Secretary of the Army be one more knowledgeable of \nthe service that he will lead.\n  Finally, I wish to comment on the comments of my good friend, Senator \nWarner, about Les Brownlee. I thoroughly and totally concur with \nSenator Warner's thoughts and feelings about Les Brownlee. He has \nserved this Nation extremely well. He served our committee well before \nhe went over to be the Under Secretary and then the Acting Secretary of \nthe Army. I add my support for his service and for him personally on \nthe Record today, as his former boss and employer has already done so \neloquently and thoughtfully. I want to let Les Brownlee know, if he is \nlistening, but more importantly let my friend, Senator Warner, know \nthat he was right on the mark when he expressed the thoughts he did \nabout Les Brownlee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will yield the floor momentarily, but I \ndo thank my colleague for his comments with regard to Les Brownlee.\n  I remember the privilege I had introducing him at the confirmation \nhearing before our committee as Under Secretary of the Army. I went \nback and reread that introduction. I said he represented a tower of \nstrength, dedication, and expertise that few could match. And, indeed, \nhe has shown that in his exemplary manner in handling\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\nthe very difficult challenges that have been presented by the conflicts \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. I thank my colleague for those remarks.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member and I are trying to \nadvise our leadership with regard to a procedural matter. So at this \ntime, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that it be charged to \nboth sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Warner for his \nconsideration in arranging this opportunity to discuss the nomination \nof Dr. Harvey to be the Secretary of the Army. First, let me say it is \nobvious Dr. Harvey is an admirable person with experience and skill. In \nmy view, this debate is less about Dr. Harvey and more about the United \nStates Army; whether he is prepared to take the necessary steps to \nrespond to severe crises that affect the Army today. The Army is \nextended across the globe. The Army is engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I just returned from a trip to both Iraq and Afghanistan. I have seen \nthese magnificent soldiers serve us with distinction and courage, but \nit is a very stressful and demanding responsibility that each day they \ndischarge, and, indeed, for the Army the stresses are beginning to \nbuild.\n  I think we have to recognize affirmatively that the Army must be \nbigger, not on a temporary basis but on a permanent basis. I think we \nalso need to recognize the Army needs additional resources. Senator \nLevin, in his comments, pointed out the shortfall between the money the \nArmy has estimated is necessary to recoup and repair their equipment \nand the actual funds they have available. If we do not address these \nissues, I believe we will begin to expose the Army to irreversible \ndamage which certainly no one here in this body wants to see happen.\n  One inescapable conclusion of my trip to Afghanistan and Iraq is that \nwe will be in these countries for years; not months but for years. The \ncost, the human cost and the financial cost to the country and to the \nArmy particularly, will be substantial.\n  I have no doubt Dr. Harvey is a consummate professional. He is very \nskilled in managing organizations. I know he is committed to doing his \nbest as Secretary of the Army, but I believe the Army needs a leader, \nnot necessarily a manager. Also, I think we need an aggressive advocate \nfor the Army. I hope that perhaps the result of this debate, if Dr. \nHarvey is confirmed, is that he will become that aggressive advocate \nfor the Army. I know advocacy has to be appropriate. He has to be loyal \nto his civilian superiors. But he has to be someone who will take the \ncase of the Army to the Secretary and, if necessary, beyond. Also, I \nbelieve any Secretary of the Army has to be cooperative with this \nCongress. He has to respond candidly and directly to our questions and \nour comments.\n  One of the issues we all have as leaders is the necessity to speak \ntruth to power on occasion. One of the observations I would make is \nthat we have seen, in the experiences of General Shinseki and Secretary \nTommy White, occasions where they gave us their best opinion and they \neffectively were punished for those views.\n  I think that is wrong. I think that attitude has to be corrected. \nThat is another responsibility of the Secretary of the Army, to ensure \nthat uniformed officers have the opportunity to express themselves \nappropriately and not fear retribution. All of us will benefit from the \nadvice the uniformed officers of this country can so wisely give to us.\n  Secretary White was discharged many months ago as Secretary of the \nArmy. It took a very long time for the Secretary of Defense and the \nPresident to nominate Dr. Harvey. In the interim we were extremely well \nserved by Acting Secretary Les Brownlee. I don't have to add more than \nwhat the chairman and the ranking member have said about the qualities \nof that individual. I just had the privilege about 10 days ago to be \nwith Secretary Brownlee up in West Point where he represented the Army \nat the Board of Visitors meeting. He is a consummate professional, \nsomeone who has rendered extraordinary service to the Army and to the \nNation. But one of the issues I find somewhat disturbing is that even \nthough we were well represented by Secretary Brownlee, it took so long \nfor the Secretary of Defense to nominate a permanent Secretary. I think \nthat I can put it this way: I find that doesn't suggest the importance \nthe job must bear. That is another reason I found it somewhat unusual, \nat the very end of our session, before the election, there was a sudden \nrush to confirm Dr. Harvey.\n\n  I had the occasion to speak with Dr. Harvey.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the interest of accuracy, I wonder if \nthe Senator will yield?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I know you want to be accurate. You are known on the \ncommittee as being a very accurate person, but you know the Secretary \nof Defense did forward the name of Secretary Roche, Secretary of the \nAir Force, to the Senate. Therein we discovered other situations that \ndictated in good, common sense that nomination should be withdrawn. But \nit did show action by the Secretary, and I wanted that part of the \nrecord.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the chairman. I reclaim my time, and I thank him \nfor that important and accurate input. I think, though, we have been so \nmany months without a Secretary, and even when the nomination of \nSecretary Roche seemed to be in doubt, there was not the kind of \nresponse I thought necessary to show we had a permanent Secretary in \nplace.\n  Then, of course, Dr. Harvey was nominated in July. The chairman is \nabsolutely right. After it became apparent that Secretary Roche would \nnot lead the Air Force--but, July until, again, September or October, \nthere was no movement to get someone confirmed in an office that is \nvital. The chairman is correct. He is entirely accurate and I accept \nthat gratefully.\n  One of the real issues that we have to deal with is the situation in \nthe Army, and I think there are three areas that are of critical \nimportance. First is end strength. Senator Levin has spoken to that. \nSecond is the recapitalization issue, how do we repair this equipment \nand how do we buy new equipment. Again, Senator Levin has talked to \nthat. Finally, there is this issue of leadership, of making sure that \nthe Army is accountable to its peers in the legislative branch, \naccountable to Congress, and accountable to the values that we have all \nseen as the hallmark of the military.\n  These are critical issues that the next Secretary will have to \naddress.\n  On the issue of end strength, during the last several months it has \nbecome increasingly clear to me, at least, that the Army needs to \nincrease defense. It needs more Active-Duty soldiers in its ranks.\n  Since 1989, the Army military end strength has been cut by more than \n34 percent, and civilian end strength by more than 45 percent, while \nundergoing a 300-percent increase in mission rate. That is not \nillogical.\n  At the end of the Cold War--1989-1990--with the vanishing of the \nSoviet threat, the notion that we needed a heavy-armored corps in \nEurope to stop the potential thrust into Central Europe was no longer \noperative. So the Army was reduced. That logic was apparent.\n  Then mission rate began to increase not just a few years ago but \nthrough Somalia, Haiti, and the Balkan threat. Just as there was logic \nin the early 1990s to reduce the size of our Army, I believe there is a \ncompelling logic today to increase the size of our Army.\n  For the past several years, the Army end strength has been virtually \nconstant at 418,400. In December 2001, for example, with the 482,400 \nend strength, there were about 100,000 Army personnel stationed abroad. \nToday, there are about 330,000 Army personnel stationed abroad.\n  You can see the tremendous increase in demand for these troops to be \ntaken from home stations and deployed overseas.\n  Similarly, in 2004, 26 of the Army's 33 active combat brigades were \ndeployed overseas at least once, and in 2003 and 2004 all 33 of the \nactive Army combat brigades will have been deployed.\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\n  We all recognize that our operations in Iraq were conducted by \nextraordinarily brave troops, and extraordinarily effectively in the \nopening phases. In a matter of days, the Iraqi military was destroyed. \nSaddam was toppled from power. Then we began what in retrospect was the \nmost critical part of the campaign--the occupation and reestablishment \nof civil society in Iraq.\n  One of the aspects of this phase is the growing recognition that it \nwas not well planned. And we are indeed paying for that in terms of \nAmerican military on the ground. Mistakes were made in the planning \nprocess.\n  According to a recent article in the Philadelphia Inquirer, when a \nlieutenant colonel briefed war planners and intelligence officers about \nphase 4-C--not the combat but the occupation operations, both civilian \nand military operations after the battle is won--he was briefing them \nin March 2003. But he was a little bit reticent because the slide he \nhad simply said this: ``To be provided.''\n  We did not have good plans to occupy the country of Iraq. Today, we \nare paying for that lack of planning.\n  The same Philadelphia Inquirer article pointed out that it is not \nbecause we didn't recognize there were potential problems in Iraq, but \nin the words of the article, there was a ``foot high stack of \nmaterial'' discussing the probability of stiff resistance in Iraq. A \nformer senior intelligence official stated, ``It was disseminated. And \nignored.''\n  But we see at least some indication of the difficult path ahead when \nthe office referred to the comments General Shinseki made in February \n2003. Senator Levin asked him how many troops it would take. He said, \n``Something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers.'' He was \nimmediately castigated by Secretary Rumsfeld, saying this estimate was \n``far from the mark.'' Secretary Wolfowitz called it ``outlandish.''\n\n  And, once again, it raises another challenge for the next Secretary \nof the Army to deal with.\n  How do we ensure that military officers will give their best advice \nand not suffer adverse consequences when they are asked by the \nCongress? We have a role to play. In fact, I think when many of us \nlooked back, we hoped we had played a more significant role, \nparticularly about the postwar occupation of Iraq.\n  I think it is important for this next Secretary to develop a \nsituation where these officers feel confident of being candid with \ntheir superiors in uniform and with Members of Congress.\n  I know it has been pointed out that General Shinseki already had \nannounced his plans to retire, or the Secretary had announced his plans \nfor him. But, nevertheless, I think the treatment he received after his \ncandid response to the committee was shabby and not comparable with the \nservice this gentleman rendered the U.S. Army and the Nation.\n  We understand, given the occupation unanticipated in many respects, \nwe are going to require a significant number of soldiers in Iraq. This, \nagain, should not come as a surprise to many people.\n  This chart is illustrative. It basically compares the ratio of \nsoldiers in Iraq with historical records. The first line--the blue \nline--is the occupation of Germany. Again, we had huge numbers of \nsoldiers on the ground in Germany. The red line shows the troop level \nfor Japan. The next is the Somalia level, then Haiti, and noticeably \nthe successful operations in the Balkans. This horizontal line \nrepresents our troop levels in Iraq today, 142,000.\n  History should have shown us that we would need a much larger Army to \ncarry off this occupation in Iraq.\n  You might say, Well, we succeeded in Japan. But we succeeded by \nessentially preempting the entire Japanese Government. Once the Emperor \nmade his fateful visit to General MacArthur and bowed to him, our \nproblems with insurgency and rehabilitation of the Japanese were all \nbut over. It took years but not militarily successful; again, in \nSomalia and Haiti. In Somalia, we left abruptly without a great deal of \ngrace despite the courage of soldiers who performed magnificently \nthere. Haiti might be a special case. But it should be clear that we \nneed more troops on the ground.\n  If you need more troops on the ground, then you just simply need a \nlarger Army.\n  That is something that we have to confront. That is just one.\n  Last summer, Secretary Rumsfeld asked the Defense Science Board, an \nindependent group of experts, to study the transition from hostilities. \nDo we need more troops or less? Can we rely on technology or troops? \nThey took a comprehensive look at missions and initiatives to reduce \nstrain on the Army. Again, these are very sophisticated individuals \nselected by Secretary Rumsfeld. Their conclusion:\n\n       A smaller force may be needed to defeat opponents than that \n     needed for stabilization and reconstruction operations. \n     Technology has not had the same leverage in stabilization \n     sales and reconstruction that it has in conflict. Warfighting \n     transformation is not likely to save manpower needed for \n     stabilization and reconstruction.\n\n  Consistent with history, consistent with what military officers tell \nus and presumably telling the Department of Defense, we need more \ntroops for operations such as stabilization operations.\n  We also understand that there are roughly 138,000 troops stationed in \nthe country today. And in anticipation of the election, in January the \nPentagon announced they were going to try to increase that size.\n  Again, I think the inescapable conclusion from history and from \nuniformed military leaders candidly telling us their best judgment and \nfrom the result of the Defense Science Board is that we need more \ntroops. We need a larger Army for these missions.\n  But there are other issues that should suggest to us that we could \nuse more troops effectively. We recently heard about a huge ammo dump \nthat was discovered. It was apparently looted, and apparently unguarded \nfor many months.\n  When I was in Iraq traveling with the chairman and ranking member in \nJuly, we were in Kirkuk. I was amazed to hear a general of the 4th \nInfantry Division talk about the hundreds and hundreds of unsecured \nAmerican ammo dumps. I don't believe they were unsecured because we \nbelieved there was no danger. It is simply because they did not have \nsufficient forces then to guard every ammo dump. They didn't have loyal \nIraqi forces to support their efforts.\n  Again, we have seen a situation in the last few days where we have \nconducted very successful and very difficult operations in Fallujah. \nOnce again, the courage of the marines and the soldiers has been \nextraordinary--house-to-house fighting, difficult fighting. They have \nendeavored and succeeded in many respects not only in taking valuable \nterrain but also sparing innocent civilians with extraordinary \ndemonstration of courage and skill.\n  But as they reduce Fallujah, the insurgents again move operations \ninto Mosul and Bogoba. They span out and spread out and hit us. \nFrankly, one of the reasons they were successful in Mosul was because \nthere was no significant American forces there. And the local police--\nsome fought valiantly and a few others disappeared. Over a period of \ntime, the whole town was under the control of the insurgents.\n  When we went into Mosul and started injecting American forces and \nmore reliable Iraqi forces, they now hit Bogoba and other parts of the \nSunni triangle. That is another strong suggestion that more American \nforces might be useful in country.\n  Finally, the borders of Iraq remain very porous. Smuggling is a \nvenerable tradition in that part of the world, and the smuggling trade \ncontinues to operate.\n  Could we use more troops? Yes. The administration and the Department \nof Defense have said that our future and our salvation is with the \nIraqi security forces. I believe they are right, but that is the long \nterm. That is years from now. We are training an Iraqi national army \nforce. And, frankly, the training is at the level of squads and \nplatoons. They haven't reached the level of companies or battalions \nthat can effectively replace American units. They do not have the kind \nof equipment we have. The prospect of reliable, well-trained and well-\ndisciplined Iraqi forces is many months if not years away.\n  We have a large number in Iraq already. Some might say: Goodness \ngracious, you have a bigger army than the\n\n[[Page S11343]]\n\n130,000 troops that are there right now--140,000 troops. But I don't \nthink people recognize that the troops that are deployed are just, if \nyou will, the tip of the spear. They are behind in administration, \nbehind in troops that are training there, and there are troops that are \nrecovering from being there.\n  It is important to recognize that even though there are roughly \n140,000 troops in Iraq, it is clearly tasking our Army.\n  An observer of the scene, former Army officer Phillip Carter, tried \nto put this in perspective. Even the simplest military task, such as \nmoving a unit from point A to point B, requires a Herculean logistical \neffort. Planes have to be scheduled; trains have to be contracted and \nloaded; ships must be diverted and filled with equipment. Just consider \nwhat it takes to move a single tank company from Fort Stewart to \nFallujah. Soldiers have to spend days inspecting and packing their \nvehicles before loading them onto trains to take them to port. The \ntrains will be met by more soldiers at dockside, who will work with \nlongshoremen and contractors to put the tanks on a ship. Then the ship \nhas to sail across to Kuwait where it will be met by more troops and \ncontractors. Only then can they roll them north to Iraq. Moving one \ntank company costs a fortune and requires hundreds of people.\n  Now imagine you want to move an entire unit such as the 3rd Infantry \nDivision with hundreds of tanks and thousands of other vehicles. The \nsize and complexity of the task is staggering. It may cost as much as \n$1 billion to send a division to Iraq. And it can't be done quickly.\n  Major bases in the United States have a finite ``throughput'' \ncapacity, meaning that they can only squeeze so many pieces of \nequipment out the door any given day.\n  The tip of this spear is in Iraq. But whatever we have there, we need \nmany more back here, again raising, I think, the obvious need for \nadditional end strength for our Army.\n  In January 2004, LTG John Riggs, in charge of the Army of the future, \nstated:\n\n       I have been in the Army 39 years, and I've never seen the \n     Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today.\n\n  In July, LTG Jay Garner, who was the Bush administration's first \ngeneration in postwar Iraq, stated:\n\n       I think people are worn out, equipment is run down, and \n     we've overstressed the reserves. We're drastically short [of] \n     infantry and MPs because the Army is too small.\n\n  But all of this seems to have not made an impression on the \nDepartment of Defense with respect to the need to increase the size of \nthe Army.\n  I think it is not just a question of numbers. It is a question of the \nstress being borne by soldiers and their families.\n  Approximately 16,000 Active-Duty soldiers have had two tours in Iraq, \nand if they stay in the service longer, they will have another.\n  That is a very significant statement.\n  In June of 2004, DOD projected that over the next 3 to 5 years it \nwill continuously have 100,000 to 150,000 Reserve component members \nmobilized.\n  It has been estimated that if we do not increase the Army size, \nforces that have already been deployed to Iraq will have to return two \nmore times. Mr. President, 3,600 troops normally stationed in Korea to \nprotect us against North Korea, a country that arguably is a dangerous \nthreat to us with their nuclear weapons and their mentality, have been \nredeployed to Iraq.\n  On July 6, the Defense Department stated it was calling up 5,674 \nmembers of the Individual Ready Reserve soldiers who have completed \nactive duty, were in an 8-year period to be recalled, and they are \nbeing recalled, but they do not drill on a regular basis and some have \nnot put on a uniform in 3, 4, 5, 6 years.\n  The DOD also implemented a series of stop-loss policies, what some \nmight call a backdoor draft. Since September 11, DOD has announced six \nstop-loss policies for the Army, two for the Navy, five for the Air \nForce, and two for the Marine Corps. Only the Army still has a stop-\nloss policy, which means, effectively, once the unit is alerted, until \n90 days after they return, that individual soldier cannot leave the \nArmy even if his enlistment is up. These tours are increasingly longer. \nIt is not just 12 months in-country; it is also the training beforehand \nand the demobilization after.\n  As many have pointed out, a great burden is falling on our Reserve \nand National Guard units. Men and women who have full-time jobs, men \nand women who have families far away from their mobilization point. \nToday, frankly, we cannot meet our requirements in the Army without the \nGuard and Reserve. These are extraordinarily talented, consummate \nprofessionals. The citizen soldiers have done a remarkable job for us, \nbut the strain is immense on the Reserve and National Guard, once again \nsuggesting we need a larger regular force. We have adopted all sorts of \nmeasures, stop-loss, relying heavily on the Reserves, but the \nunderlying point which has to be confronted by the next Secretary is \nhow do we increase permanently, with regular budget authority, the \nRegular Forces of the United States. The average mobilization for \nmembers of the Reserves and National Guard has increased to 342 days \nthis year from 156 during the Persian Gulf, again corresponding to the \nincreased reliance we are placing on the Reserve soldiers.\n  As we pointed out previously, the DOD mobilization authority states \nthat the members of the Reserve component can be mobilized for no more \nthan 24 months. Currently, 30,000 Reserve component members are up \nagainst this 24-month cap. But in 2005, indeed, a large portion next \nyear will bump up against this cap. So we are using the Reserves and \nNational Guard, and they are performing well, but this underscores the \nneed for a large regular force. A larger regular force is included in \nthe budget, but not funded by emergency provisions through supplemental \nappropriations.\n  We are beginning to see, as a result of the stress on the Guard \nparticularly, an erosion in terms of recruitment and retention. The \nArmy National Guard ended fiscal year 2003 approximately 7,800 soldiers \nbelow the recruiting goal. Last month, the Army National Guard \nannounced it expected to fall 5,000 short of the goal of 56,000 \nsoldiers. A survey by the Army Research Institute for Behavioral and \nSocial Sciences reported to us that more than one in three Army \nreservists plan to leave or transfer to the inactive reserve when the \ncurrent enlistment ended; only a quarter will reenlist.\n\n  The Active Army made the reporting goal, but they did this by pulling \nforward one-half of the delayed entry program. Each year, they sign up \nyoung men and women who do not expect to report until the next year. In \norder to make the goal, they counted those soldiers in this year's \naccounting. So they start off essentially in a hole for this year \nbecause they cannot double-count those soldiers.\n  The other factor I see potentially damaging in the longer run, for \nthe first time in a very long time, a small fraction of soldiers is \nbeing led into the Army who are normally rejected because of lower \nqualifications. It is roughly 2,000 out of 100,000, but that is a trend \nthat certainly we do not want do see grow or continue, and it is \nillustrative of the need to make the totals because of the stress our \nmilitary is under.\n  The other aspect is we are committed to making sure that the Army is \nthere and we are trying to do that through incentives and bonuses, \nwhich puts additional financial stress on the budget of the Army. \nAgain, this is something we can't avoid. That is the way we have to \nfund and maintain a volunteer force, but it is an issue in terms of \nlong-term ability of the Army to find the resources so that they can \npay these bonuses, they can pay the benefits, they can enlist the \nforce.\n  One other final aspect of this issue of reliance upon a force which I \nbelieve is too small. We have seen, for the first time in a notable way \nin Iraq, reliance and overreliance on contractors--not contractors who \ndo the mess halls. By the way, they are doing a magnificent job over \nthere. The quality of life of soldiers is first-rate. But I am taken \naback when I see private contractors providing security. We all recall \nthat even Ambassador Bremer's security was provided not by military \npeople but by private civilian contractors. That is another indication \nto me that we have to increase the Regular Army.\n  Part of this was a result of a plan that did not anticipate a long-\nterm, intensive involvement in Iraq. As mentioned before, this has been \npointed out\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\nby others. In December of 2003, Jeffrey Record, of the Army's own \nStrategic Studies Institute, published a report that stated the ground \nforce requirements in Iraq have forced the U.S. Army to the breaking \npoint. He says the Army appears incapable of sustaining a commitment of \n16 of its 33 active-duty combat brigades in Iraq absent a reduction \nelsewhere or expansion of its force structure.\n  Again, the Defense Science Board stated that current and projected \nforce structure will not sustain our current projected globalization. \nThere are inadequate total numbers of troops and a lack of long-term \nendurance. The board recommended adding troops or cutting back \nmissions. It is very difficult to cut back missions.\n  I should point out that the board was aware of the attempts to reform \nthe military, the modularity that is going on within the military. \nAgain, this is a very positive development. I commend the Chief of \nStaff, General Schoomaker, and those who are trying to reforge the Army \nto be more efficient, but the Defense Science Board recognized these \nefficiencies and still stated that we need more troops.\n  We have in the Senate, with the cooperation of the chairman and \nranking member, tried to do this. Again, going back a year or so ago, \ntogether with Senator Hagel, we introduced legislation that would \nincrease the Army by 10,000. It passed this Senate, but the Department \nof Defense objected to it, and it fell out of the conference report. We \nwere successful in the last authorization to include an increase of \n20,000 end strength, but once again the Department of Defense insisted \nthat these troops be paid through emergency procedure.\n\n  We have to have a situation where the end strength is increased but \nit is also paid for through the regular budget process. My fear is that \neventually it will get more difficult to pass supplementals. Senator \nLevin pointed out how the Army will rethink the demand of a significant \namount of money next year in the supplemental for 2005. Yet even with \nthat money they might not be able to sustain all their needs, \nequipment, or otherwise.\n  Unless we have an authorized end strength that is paid for through \nthe regular budget process, we may end up leaving the Army in the lurch \nin the years ahead. When the budget comes down, the supplementals are \nnot as robust, and they still have the missions and the troops they \nneed to conduct those missions. That is a critical issue that the \nSecretary must address. I raised these issues with Dr. Harvey. He \ncertainly listened attentively, but I received no commitment that he \nwas going to move aggressively to do this.\n  The other issue of equipment, which has been addressed by the ranking \nmember, is the Army has sustained 1.6 billion in equipment battle \nlosses in Afghanistan and Iraq. Presently it has an unfunded \nrequirement of 1.3 billion for ammunition. The Army estimates a third \nof the equipment is either already in Southwest Asia or en route. In \nfiscal year 2005, approximately 1.6 million pieces of Army equipment \nwill be sent back to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan for \nrepairs, upgrade, or replacement. The Army expects to need $7 billion \nfor this effort.\n  We have an extraordinary demand to keep Army equipment going, and the \nrequests, so far, the supplemental requests have not met those demands. \nI personally believe we have to have a robust, dedicated fund from \nsources outside the Army so we can fund the simple recapitalization of \nthe equipment needs of the military.\n  There is another aspect of the equipment demand. We have taken a \ngreat deal of equipment from the National Guard and forces in the \nUnited States, moved it overseas, leaving our National Guard back here \nwith a fraction of their critical equipment. As my colleagues \nrecognize, the National Guard plays a critical role in homeland \nsecurity, a critical role in aiding States and localities with disaster \nassistance, and they are not only deployed overseas but many of the \nguardsmen left behind do not have the full complement of equipment--\nanother issue we have to deal with.\n  I could go on at great length talking about recurring equipment \nneeds. There are other examples that are critically important. Nearly \nall the equipment, for example, in our stockpiles in Southwest Asia has \nalready been deployed forward. We do not have those robust stockpiles \nof equipment necessary if there is another contingency in the area. The \nonly area where stocks appear to be untouched is Korea, which I think \nis a very prudent decision. This is another example of the issues we \nare facing in terms of equipment.\n\n  As we go forward, we have endeavored to provide the resources to our \nmilitary to conduct the important operations overseas. In the past 17 \nmonths, President Bush has requested and Congress has appropriated $187 \nbillion for Afghanistan and Iraq. We also anticipate an additional \nrequest of $70 billion in the next few weeks or months. We are spending \na great deal of money, but still the needs of the Army are unmet. We \nhave to provide for the needs. We have to provide for the necessary \nequipment.\n  We have a crisis in end strength. We have a crisis in \nrecapitalization of equipment, and we also have an issue of leadership. \nI have stressed this before so I will be brief.\n  We have had two individuals serving the Army in this administration. \nGeneral Shinseki and Secretary White were called upon to give their \nbest views to the Congress. They did, and essentially they were \npunished for those views. That, to me, is not an effective way to use \nthe offices of the Army or to get the kind of cooperation within the \nexecutive branch and the kind of cooperation between the Congress and \nthe military service that is so necessary. Again, I feel the \ninhibitions that resulted from that very dramatic public behavior might \nhave prevented individuals from appropriately sharing with us \ninformation about the planning problems for postwar Iraq, about the \nneed for additional forces, about the need for recapitalization of \nequipment. In the long run, it is a very destructive and corrosive \nforce. The next Secretary has to deal with that on an individual basis \nand on a collective basis in the Army and within the Department of \nDefense.\n  Also, too, an issue that has concerned many, and one that we were \nshocked by, was the scenes of the Abu Ghraib prison, where individual \nsoldiers have been held accountable, enlisted people, E-5s, E-6s, E-4s, \nbut anyone who has read the reports and anyone who has been in the area \nin which the chairman has conducted it in a very professional and very \ncourageous fashion has to understand that accountability does not stop \nhere.\n  We have had numerous reports by the IG, by General Taguba, by General \nKern, and by others which suggests at least people at ranks beyond \nnoncommissioned officer have to be held accountable. Yet to date there \nhas been no accountability, in my mind.\n  I was curious as to just simply who had the responsibility to press \ncourt-martial charges against some of the individuals notified in the \nreport by General Karpinski. Now, that is, I am told no general officer \ncan go before a court-martial without an IG report. The IG has \nconducted a report. I found out that the IG, General Mikolashek, is \nscheduled to retire in a few days. I don't know what the status of his \nreport is, whether he forwarded it to the convening authority and \nwhether the convening authority is taking steps. The convening \nauthority is General Helmsley, who is the Reserve component commander. \nColonel Pappas, who is out of the 5th Military Intelligence Brigade, \nand General Sanchez was originally the convening authority--he decided \nbecause of appearances, and I think appropriately, that he shouldn't be \ninvolved. It was then sent to General Bell, the USAREUR commander, and \nnow it has been delegated to General Benny Williams. It seems to me in \nthe course of trying to establish responsibility beyond the company \ngrade level that we have not made much progress.\n  I believe the next Secretary of the Army has to deal with this issue \ndirectly because it would be unfortunate--more than unfortunate--if \nindividual soldiers were punished and it appeared that seniors who \nmight be culpable--not directly involved in brutality but for \ndereliction of duty or for failure to follow the law of warfare--simply \nwalked away or were lost in the shuffle of paperwork and reports. That \nis the challenge this Secretary has to deal with because the essence, \nin my\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\nmind, of a military officer is accountability and responsibility, and \nyou do not get that by pushing reports and pushing paper and suddenly \ntrying to make it go away.\n  Maybe I am just premature in my demands for some type of finality to \nthis situation. I don't think so. Again, I believe the next Secretary \nof the Army has to establish a very simple rule: Soldiers are \nresponsible for what they do and commanders are responsible for their \ncommands. I hope that is done because, if not, all the issues I have \ntalked about--the lack of troops, the need for new equipment and \nrefurbishment of equipment--will pale in comparison if people can draw \nthe lesson that only soldiers are punished and superiors are somehow \nable to escape, at least the opportunity to be held accountable.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield? He brings up a subject of great \nimportance to the committee. Indeed, I commend the committee as a whole \nfor the manner in which it pursued its look into this situation. We are \nawaiting what is described as maybe the final report--the Senator is \naware of that--which is to be a compendium analysis of previous reports \nand such other factors deemed relevant.\n  There is also an outstanding request that I put to General Kern and \nhis group in the course of the hearing that we would like to have them, \nonce again, assess the full meaning of accountability as they use that.\n  I thank the Senator for raising the question. I assure him it is \nsomething I will continue as chairman in the coming Congress. This is a \nmatter which the committee will once again address.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I reclaim my time. Let me, once again, \ncommend the chairman because he took a position that was very \ndifficult.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator. The ranking member was \na full working partner, together with all Members of the committee.\n  Mr. REED. Let me add, honestly, without his sensitivity to the \nimportance of this issue, to the long run values of the military, it \nwould not have received any attention. I commend the chairman for \ncontinuing his efforts.\n  I just point out, all this might be coincidental. General Kern \nretired on Saturday, I believe. I hope the report and response is ready \nand en route to the chairman. I hope he, too, agrees with me that this \nis not an issue that we can ignore.\n  I must say also this is not just an Army issue. I think there was a \ntendency initially to portray this as the aberrant behavior of young \nsoldiers. As we now know, there was much more complicated and high-\nlevel involvement. What involvement is still unclear, but we cannot \nwalk away from this issue. And because the next Secretary of the Army \nwill have so much authority with respect to reports, with respect to \nreviewing at least court-martial proceedings or involved in these \ndecisions, this issue has to be addressed. And that is one of the major \nchallenges I think Dr. Harvey will address, I hope, if he is confirmed.\n  Let me again conclude by thanking the chairman not only for his \nleadership but for the gracious way he has helped today to illustrate \nthese issues and to assist me in my presentation. I thank him. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before recognizing the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, I would like to respond to two issues raised by \nour colleague from Rhode Island in the course of what I think has been \na very constructive debate today.\n  The first is on the issue of end strength.\n  Senator Reed has argued that the Regular Army--the active duty \nforce--needs to be larger, and I would agree with him.\n  In the Ronald Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 2005, signed by the President on October 28, Congress required \nthat the Army increase its active-duty strength by 20,000 soldiers over \nfiscal year 2004 levels.\n  The conference report, while noting that in a time of national \nemergency the President may direct even higher levels, specifically \nauthorized an increase of 30,000 soldiers between 2005 and 2009.\n  These increased numbers reflect the recommendations of General Peter \nSchoomaker, the Chief of Staff of the Army, who is a great soldier. He \nhas proven to be a superb Chief of Staff of the Army.\n  In the committee hearing on General Schoomaker's nomination last \nyear, I recall very well the questions asked of him as to whether he \nthought that the Army needed to have more soldiers. General Schoomaker \nresponded candidly that his intuition told him that he thought the Army \nneeded to be larger.\n  He was right. Following his confirmation and appointment in August \n2003, he has testified on several occasions about the end strength \nissues and communicated his views about what needs to be done to ensure \nthe Army is prepared and ready in all respects for its current \nmissions.\n  The Army laid out a plan to temporarily increase end strength by \n30,000 over the next 5 years as it was transforming to ``modular units \nof action.''\n  General Schoomaker, for example, testified on November 19, 2003, in a \nfull committee hearing on ``Current Army Issues.'' I questioned him \nabout the force level of the Army, asking General Schoomaker about \nwhether we need additional troops.\n  His response was that as a result of stop-loss and stop-movement, \nwhich currently serves to ensure unit manning and cohesion, the Army \nwas operating with 20,000 more soldiers in the regular Army than in \n2002. He went on to emphasize that\n\n     the greatest move we can make is to get the proper \n     utilization of the soldiers within the Army that we have \n     authorized and we are paying for right now. This is going to \n     require significant active-Guard and Reserve rebalancing and \n     significant restructuring of policies that will give us \n     access to more of the force that we are paying for and \n     have on hand right now.\n\n  General Schoomaker reiterated this point in February 2004 when he \ntestified with the Secretary of Defense on the President's fiscal year \n2005 budget. General Schoomaker shared his ``rain barrel'' and \n``spigot'' analogy with us in which he noted that because of the Army's \ncurrent organization and composition, the Army cannot make use of the \nbulk of its manpower.\n  General Schoomaker has called for transformational changes in Army \npersonnel planning, such as conversion of billets from military to \ncivilian employees; he has advocated rebalancing of reserve and active \nskills to improve readiness; he has called for greater numbers of \nsoldiers with essential occupational skills, and implementation of new \ntechnology. In doing so, he consistently has argued throughout the past \nyear that precipitous increases in end strength were not the answer to \nthe Army's readiness challenges.\n  In a recent interview last month, General Schoomaker stated:\n\n       We all agree the Army should grow. The issue is how to pay \n     for it. Right now we have supplemental funding to increase \n     numbers we're bringing in and retaining. . . . We are growing \n     through increased accessions and retention. We have grown to \n     495,000 on active duty, up from 480,000 last year. We are \n     making the Army as big as we can, as fast as we can. But \n     paying for it is another issue.\n\n  In summary then, three points need to be made:\n  First, the Army is increasing in size. The Army active-duty strength \non September 30 of this year was 499,530. That was about 17,000 above \nthe authorized end strength for fiscal year 2004. The Army is \nprojecting that it will meet the requirement to expand by 20,000 \nsoldiers by the end of fiscal year 2005.\n  Second, while all agree that the Army is stretched, the Department of \nDefense has been clear that if the combatant commander in U.S. Central \nCommand calls for more troops, he will receive them.\n  And, third, the cost of 10,000 additional active-duty soldiers has \nbeen estimated to be $1.2 billion. It is essential that budgeting \nrealities be taken into account and that the Army not be required to \nabsorb additional soldiers ``out of hide.'' To do otherwise would \nundermine General Schoomaker's critically important transformational \nvision.\n  I draw to my colleagues' attention that General Schoomaker, the \ncurrent Chief of Staff of the Army, has addressed this issue. I \nquestioned him in the course of the hearing on November 19 about the \nforce level of the Army. I asked him how he felt about the need for \nadditional troops. His response was that as a result of the stop-loss \nand\n\n[[Page S11346]]\n\nstop-movement which currently serves to ensure unit manning and \ncohesion, the Army was operating with 20,000 more soldiers in the \nRegular Army than in 2002.\n  In a subsequent interview last month, he stated:\n\n       We all agree that the Army should grow. The issue is how to \n     pay for it.\n\n  The Senator from Rhode Island raised that point.\n  General Schoomaker went on to say:\n\n       Right now we have supplemental funding to increase numbers \n     we're brining in and retaining. . . .\n\n  I think he has looked at this in a very responsible way, recognizing \nthat the supplemental, hopefully, has cared for the immediate needs of \nthe Army and will provide funds to implement the legislation the \ncommittee incorporated in the Ronald Reagan Defense Act of 2004 that we \nput through.\n  Also, the Senator raised a question about General Shinseki, and that \nis one in which I have been increasingly interested through the years. \nAnd actually, on this floor, I stated to the Senate that so much has \nbeen said about this distinguished officer's career and how he \nconcluded, which I always thought was the regular way, that the Chief \nof Staff would step down at the conclusion of his term. But others have \nviews about that, and I am not going to get into that.\n  I would like to put in the Record the colloquy between Senator Levin \nand General Shinseki on February 25, 2003, when he addressed this \nquestion of the forces that could be used or required. It is \ninteresting to go back and read it because I think people have seized \non this so often to refer to it as a basis for their observations. But \nhere is what he said. Senator Levin asked the question:\n\n       General Shinseki, could you give us some idea as to the \n     Army's force requirement for an occupation of Iraq following \n     the successful completion of the war?\n\n  Bear in mind, the operation had not even started at that time, and \nthis question was put to General Shinseki after all the chiefs had made \nopening statements. General Shinseki had put into the record his full \nstatement and then testified in open session to most of that statement.\n  General Shinseki said: ``In specific number, I would have to rely on \ncombatant commanders' exact requirements,'' which is much what the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have said each time this issue \nis up. If the combatant commanders made requests, indeed he, the \nPresident, would consider it and, in all probability, meet those \nrequests.\n  Then he went on. It is very interesting. He is a most distinguished \nofficer, and I share the Senator's views about him. There are moments \nin our Senate career that we never forget, but I remember in the course \nof the confirmation of General Shinseki, our distinguished colleague \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Inouye, rose and gave one of the most magnificent \nspeeches on the floor of the Senate I have ever heard about any \nindividual in the 26 years I have been privileged to serve here. I \nshare in the full respect for this officer.\n  Here is what he said again to Senator Levin:\n\n       I would say that what has been mobilized to this point, \n     something in the order of several hundred thousand \n     soldiers, is probably a figure that would be required.\n\n  In other words, it was not a finite statement. It was more or less a \ngeneralized statement. He continued:\n\n       We are talking about post-hostilities control over a piece \n     of geography that is fairly significant with the ethnic \n     tensions that could lead to other problems.\n\n  That is showing a lot of foresight.\n\n       It takes a significant ground presence to maintain a safe \n     and secure environment to make sure that people are fed, that \n     water is distributed, all with the responsibilities that go \n     along with administering a situation like this.\n\n  But he makes no reference at that point that he ever anticipated the \nlevel of insurgency, the infiltration of these terrorists from other \nnations to come in and fuel this fight.\n  In fairness to him, I think the exact text that he responded to that \nquestion, which, again, was referred to by my distinguished colleague, \nthe ranking member, and myself today should be made a part of this \nRecord.\n  I inquire of the Presiding Officer as to the time remaining under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 40 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the distinguished ranking member, I believe, has \nroughly an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ranking member has 56 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I notice the presence on the floor momentarily of our \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina and, indeed, the current \njunior Senator from South Carolina. I know the Senate is anxious to \nhear from both our colleagues with regard to the forthcoming retirement \nof our distinguished colleague, Senator Hollings.\n  I also see my colleague from Colorado who desires to speak to the \nmatter before the Senate. I say to the Senate that I think this debate \nand discussion among the members of the committee as relating to the \nnomination is about to come to a close, and subject to the ranking \nmember's views, which I ask he provide the Senate at this time, I would \nlike to give--how much time would the Senator from Colorado desire?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I request from the chairman 10 minutes. I probably will \nnot use that amount, but if there is a minute or two, I will yield that \nback.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, wants \nabout 5 minutes. Perhaps 15 minutes on this side, I say to my \ncolleagues, is the remainder of the time we would seek on this \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a unanimous \nconsent request first. I am glad the Senator put in the Record the \nremarks of General Shinseki. I think they fully support what Senator \nReed was saying and what I was saying. I also ask unanimous consent at \nthis point in the Record that the reaction of Secretary Wolfowitz to \nthose remarks be printed. We will provide those for the Record, to the \neffect General Shinseki was widely off the mark and that it is hard to \nbelieve it would take more troops to occupy a country than it would be \nto win the war. I ask those remarks be made part of the Record. We will \nsupply those remarks to the clerk, if that meets with the agreement of \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I certainly would not impose any objection to a colleague \nwishing to expand the remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe Statement of U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz Before \n            the House Budget Committee on February 27, 2003\n\n       If I might digress for a moment, Mr. Chairman, from my \n     prepared testimony, because there's been a good deal of \n     comment, some of it quite outlandish, about what our post-war \n     requirements might be in Iraq. . . .\n       But some of the higher-end predictions that we have been \n     hearing recently, such as the notion that it will take \n     several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in \n     post-Saddam Iraq, are wildly off the mark.\n       First, it is hard to conceive that it would take more \n     forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would \n     take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of \n     Saddam's security forces and his army. Hard to imagine.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I call to the attention of my colleague \nthat this issue of General Shinseki's remarks has been and perhaps will \ncontinue to be debated and discussed.\n  But actually, on the floor of the Senate--and my recollection is it \nwas last fall from this fall in connection with the conference report--\nI said to the Senate that I had asked repeatedly of the Army, of \nmembers of the Army: Was there any staff work done on this issue of the \ntroop levels required in a post-conflict situation, either in the \nDepartment of the Army or in the joint staff? I urged that that be \nforthcoming and that information be given to the committee.\n  To the best of my knowledge, no one has come forward to show any \nstaff workup that provided the basis for the General's reply. As I \npoint out, the General did not, in the course of these opening remarks, \nin a prepared statement, make any reference to that. As a matter of \nfact, he was supportive of the figure that was in the budget.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, though, again, for a comment on \nthat.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If there was no staff workup on that issue, it would be \nshocking. There surely should have been staff work on the question of \nhow many troops it would take to secure a country after its occupation. \nThere\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\nhave been a number of press reports to the effect that there in fact \nwere some assessments as to how many troops, but I have never seen that \nassessment. If it did not exist, it would be pretty serious \nmismanagement, it seems to me, and if it does exist, we ought to get a \ncopy of it.\n  Either way, I think General Shinseki was mistreated. He was the \nsubject of calumny, almost, inside the civilian part of the Defense \nDepartment, for expressing an opinion.\n  I know my friend, the chairman, would agree with me that when a \nmilitary officer is asked a question, he is required by a commitment \nthat he makes to us when he is before us for confirmation to give us \nhis honest professional judgment, and he was pressed by me to give us \nthat judgment. He said he couldn't be specific, and then I pressed him \nto give us a range and he said: Several hundred thousand. The reaction \nto that amongst the civilians is that is widely off the mark. He paid a \nprice he never should have paid for giving an honest opinion to a \ncongressional committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. You address this thing in a very broad context, which you \nare free to do. I was very specific. When he said several hundred \nthousand, I inquired as to whether there is any document, either in the \nDepartment of the Army or the joint staff, which supported that several \nhundred thousand individuals would be needed in a post-conflict \nsituation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there a document that supports 130,000 would be needed? \nI would like to see a document that supports any analysis of what would \nbe needed. That is the problem with the failure to plan for the \naftermath. It is that there was no plan for the aftermath. If there is \na document that says 130,000--and maybe my good friend from Rhode \nIsland has the document we are referring to?\n  Mr. REED. I don't have the document, but an article in the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer of October 17, 2004 made several references. \nFirst:\n\n       Franks' Central Command did have an extensive plan to \n     restore order and begin rebuilding the country, called \n     Operation Desert Crossing, said retired Marine Gen. Anthony \n     Zinni, who drew up the plan and updated it continuously when \n     he led Centcom until 2000. It was never used.\n\n  Further in the story:\n\n       Central Command originally proposed a force of 380,000 to \n     attack and occupy Iraq. Rumsfeld's opening bid was about \n     40,000, ``a division-plus,'' said three senior military \n     officials who participated in the discussions. Bush and his \n     top advisers finally approved the 250,000 troops the \n     commanders requested to launch the invasion. But the \n     additional troops that the military wanted to secure Iraq \n     after Hussein's regime fell were either delayed or never \n     sent.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 17, 2004]\n\n                The Iraq War: Miscalculation and Misstep\n\n       Washington.--In March 2003, days before the start of the \n     U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, American war planners and \n     intelligence officials met at Shaw Air Force Base in South \n     Carolina to review the Bush administration's plans to oust \n     Saddam Hussein and implant democracy in Iraq.\n       Near the end of his presentation, an Army lieutenant \n     colonel who was giving a briefing showed a slide describing \n     the Pentagon's plans for rebuilding Iraq after the war, known \n     in the planners' parlance as Phase\n     4-C. He was uncomfortable with his material--and for good \n     reason. The slide said: ``To Be Provided.''\n       An Inquirer Washington Bureau review of the Iraq policy and \n     decisions of the administration has found that it invaded \n     Iraq without a comprehensive plan in place to secure and \n     rebuild the country. The administration also failed to \n     provide about 100,000 additional U.S. troops that American \n     military commanders originally wanted to help restore order \n     and reconstruct a country shattered by war, a brutal \n     dictatorship, and economic sanctions.\n       In fact, some senior Pentagon officials had thought they \n     could bring most American soldiers home from Iraq by \n     September 2003. Instead, more than a year later, 138,000 U.S. \n     troops are still fighting insurgents who slip easily across \n     Iraq's long borders, diehards from the old regime, and Iraqis \n     angered by their country's widespread crime and unemployment \n     and the United States' sometimes heavy boots.\n       ``We didn't go in with a plan. We went in with a theory,'' \n     said a veteran State Department officer who was directly \n     involved in Iraq policy.\n       The military's plan to defeat Hussein's army worked \n     brilliantly and U.S. troops have distinguished themselves on \n     the battlefield.\n       However, the review found that the President and many of \n     his advisers ignored repeated warnings that rebuilding Iraq \n     would be harder than ousting Saddam Hussein, and they tossed \n     out years of planning about how to rebuild Iraq, in part \n     because they thought pro-American Iraqi exiles and Iraqi \n     ``patriots'' would quickly pick up the pieces.\n       The CIA predicted up until the war's opening days that the \n     Iraqi army would turn against Hussein, which never happened.\n       This report is based on official documents and on \n     interviews with more than three dozen current and former \n     civilian and military officials who participated directly in \n     planning for the war and its aftermath. Most still support \n     the decision to go to war but say many of the subsequent \n     problems could have been avoided.\n       Every effort was made to get those who were interviewed to \n     speak for the record, but many officials requested anonymity \n     because they didn't want to criticize the administration \n     publicly or because they feared retaliation.\n       President Bush and top officials in Secretary of Defense \n     Donald H. Rumsfeld's office did not respond to repeated \n     requests for interviews. They have publicly defended their \n     plans for the invasion and its aftermath, and now some top \n     officials are blaming the CIA for failing to predict the \n     messy aftermath of Hussein's fall.\n       The United States and interim Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad \n     Allawi are now taking steps to defeat the Iraqi insurgency \n     and will have national elections in January. They have \n     negotiated an agreement to disarm some of the militia led by \n     radical Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and are pressing \n     an offensive against Sunni rebels. After more than a year of \n     internal squabbling, U.S. military commanders, intelligence \n     officers, and diplomats in Baghdad are acting as a team.\n       But the hole created by the absence of an adequate plan to \n     rebuild Iraq, the failure to provide enough troops to secure \n     the country, the misplaced faith in Iraqi exiles, and other \n     mistakes made after Baghdad fell is a deep one.\n       ``We've finally got our act together, but we're all afraid \n     it may be too late,'' said one senior official who is engaged \n     daily in Iraq policy.\n       The Bush administration's failure to plan to win the peace \n     in Iraq was the product of many of the same problems that \n     plagued the administration's case for war, including wishful \n     thinking, bad information from Iraqi exiles who said Iraqis \n     would welcome U.S. troops as liberators, and contempt for \n     dissenting opinions.\n       However, the administration's planning for postwar Iraq \n     differed in one crucial respect from its erroneous prewar \n     claims about Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons \n     programs and links to al-Qaeda.\n       The U.S. intelligence community had been divided about the \n     state of Hussein's weapons programs, but there was little \n     disagreement among experts throughout the government that \n     winning the peace in Iraq could be much harder than \n     winning a war.\n       ``The possibility of the United States winning the war and \n     losing the peace in Iraq is real and serious,'' warned an \n     Army War College report that was completed in February 2003, \n     a month before the invasion.\n       Without an ``overwhelming'' effort to prepare for the U.S. \n     occupation of Iraq, the report warned, ``The United States \n     may find itself in a radically different world over the next \n     few years, a world in which the threat of Saddam Hussein \n     seems like a pale shadow of new problems of America's own \n     making.''\n       A half-dozen intelligence reports also warned that U.S. \n     troops could face significant postwar resistance. This foot-\n     high stack of material was distributed at White House \n     meetings of Bush's top foreign policy advisers, but there's \n     no evidence that anyone ever acted on it.\n       ``It was disseminated. And ignored,'' said a former senior \n     intelligence official.\n       The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency was particularly \n     aggressive in its forecasts, officials said. One briefing \n     occurred in January 2003. Another, in April 2003, weeks after \n     the war began, discussed Hussein's plans for attacking U.S. \n     forces after his troops had been defeated on the battlefield.\n       Similar warnings came from the Pentagon's Joint Staff, the \n     State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and \n     the CIA's National Intelligence Council. The council produced \n     reports in January 2003 titled ``Principal Challenges in \n     Post-Saddam Iraq'' and ``Regional Consequences of Regime \n     Change in Iraq.''\n       Unlike the 1991 Persian Gulf War, in which Iraqi troops \n     were trying to maintain their grip on Kuwait, ``they are now \n     defending their country,'' said a senior defense official, \n     summarizing the Joint Staff's warnings. ``You are going to \n     get serious resistance. This idea that everyone will join you \n     is baloney. But it was dismissed.''\n       Retired Army Lt. Gen. Jay Garner wasn't named to lead \n     Iraq's reconstruction until January 2003 and didn't oversee \n     the first major interagency conference on postwar Iraq until \n     Feb. 21, less than a month before the invasion.\n       At the Pentagon, the director of the Joint Staff, Army Gen. \n     George Casey, repeatedly pressed Gen. Tommy Franks, the head \n     of the Central Command, for a ``Phase 4,'' or postwar, plan, \n     the senior defense official said.\n\n[[Page S11348]]\n\n       ``Casey was screaming. `Where is our Phase 4 plan?' '' the \n     official said. It never arrived. Casey is now the commander \n     of U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq.\n       Franks' Central Command did have an extensive plan to \n     restore order and begin rebuilding the country, called \n     Operation Desert Crossing, said retired Marine Gen. Anthony \n     Zinni, who drew up the plan and updated it continuously when \n     he led Centcom until 2000. It was never used.\n       The same officials who saw no need for a plan to secure and \n     rebuild a defeated Iraq also saw no need to position \n     thousands of U.S. soldiers, including military police, \n     engineers, ordnance disposal teams, and civil affairs \n     specialists, to begin taking control in Iraq even before the \n     war against Hussein was over.\n       Long-standing Army doctrine calls for beginning \n     reconstruction in freed areas of a country while fighting \n     rages elsewhere. It also calls for a shift in military forces \n     from combat troops to civil affairs, military police and the \n     like.\n       ``Unfortunately, this did not occur despite clear guidance \n     to the contrary,'' Army Col. Paul F. Dicker wrote in an \n     assessment.\n       Bush, Rumsfeld, and other top officials insist that their \n     military commanders were given everything they requested, and \n     Franks wrote in his book, American Soldier, that Rumsfeld \n     supported his war plan.\n       Technically, that's accurate. However, three top officials \n     who served with Franks at the time said the plan was the \n     product of a lengthy and sometimes heated negotiation between \n     the Central Command and the Pentagon, in which Rumsfeld \n     constantly pressed Franks and other senior officers to commit \n     fewer troops to Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       At one point, Secretary of State Colin Powell, a former \n     chairman of the joint chiefs, weighed in on Franks' side and \n     helped persuade Rumsfeld to commit more troops, a senior \n     administration official said.\n       Rumsfeld and his aides wisely wanted to keep the U.S. \n     footprint in Iraq as small as possible, realizing that more \n     troops would likely breed more Iraqi resentment, and they \n     wanted a smaller, faster force that could overwhelm the Iraqi \n     military before it could torch the country's oil fields, \n     retreat into the cities and create a humanitarian disaster.\n       ``There were different motivations by different people in \n     this administration for going after Iraq, but they all came \n     together . . . in a way that blotted out prudence and \n     caution,'' said a senior intelligence official.\n       Central Command originally proposed a force of 380,000 to \n     attack and occupy Iraq. Rumsfeld's opening bid was about \n     40,000, ``a division-plus,'' said three senior military \n     officials who participated in the discussions. Bush and his \n     top advisers finally approved the 250,000 troops the \n     commanders requested to launch the invasion. But the \n     additional troops that the military wanted to secure Iraq \n     after Hussein's regime fell were either delayed or never \n     sent.\n       As a result, the two Army divisions that Centcom wanted to \n     help secure the country weren't on hand when Baghdad fell and \n     the country lapsed into anarchy, and a third, the First \n     Cavalry from Fort Hood, Texas, fell so far behind schedule \n     that on April 21 Franks and Rumsfeld dropped it from the \n     plan.\n       Moreover, one senior military official said, there was a \n     realization that fresh troops would eventually be needed to \n     replace worn-out units in Iraq.\n       ``We could not burn the candle on the Cav prematurely,'' he \n     said.\n       Others said that civilian officials in the Pentagon were so \n     convinced that these ``follow-on forces'' wouldn't be needed \n     in Iraq that they thought they could withdraw 50,000 troops \n     from Iraq in June 2003; 50,000 more in July; and a final \n     50,000 in August. By September 2003, Rumsfeld and his aides \n     thought, there would be very few American troops left in \n     Iraq.\n       Instead of providing a plan and enough troops to take \n     control of Iraq, officials, advisers and consultants in and \n     around the Pentagon and Vice President Dick Cheney's office \n     bet on Iraqi exiles such as Ahmed Chalabi of the Iraqi \n     National Congress, who assured them that Iraqis would welcome \n     U.S. troops as liberators.\n       Gen. John Keane, the vice chief of the Army staff during \n     the war, said some defense officials believed the exiles' \n     promises.\n       ``We did not see it [the insurgency] coming. And we were \n     not properly prepared and organized to deal with it. . . . \n     Many of us got seduced by the Iraqi exiles in terms of what \n     the outcome would be,'' Keane told a House committee in July.\n       Rumsfeld's office ``was utterly, arrogantly, ignorantly and \n     negligently unprepared'' for the aftermath of the war, \n     said Larry Diamond, who was a political adviser in Baghdad \n     from January to March of this year.\n       Douglas Feith, the Defense Department's number-three \n     official, and former Pentagon consultant Richard Perle both \n     acknowledged that their vision for post-Hussein Iraq included \n     putting pro-Western exiles in power.\n       ``We had a theme in our minds, a strategic idea, of \n     liberation rather than occupation, giving them [Iraqis] more \n     authority even at the expense of having things done with \n     greater efficiency'' by coalition military forces, Feith told \n     The Philadelphia Inquirer last month.\n       Perle, in an interview, said he and others had for years \n     advocated ``helping the Iraqis liberate themselves--which was \n     a completely different approach than we settled on.''\n       ``We'll never now how it would have come out if we did it \n     the way we wanted to do it,'' he said.\n       The CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the State \n     Department all warned that Chalabi was a charlatan, and the \n     uniformed military dragged its heels in training exiles to \n     join the fight against Hussein.\n       The battle over Chalabi was one of numerous bitter \n     interagency fights about Iraq that Bush and his national \n     security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, never resolved.\n       ``I'm not going to put my thumb on the scale,'' Bush said \n     at a White House meeting in which Chalabi's bona fides were \n     hotly debated, according to an official who was present.\n       That left Pentagon officials to plow ahead with their \n     attempt to position Chalabi and his militia, the Free Iraqi \n     Fighting Forces, to take power after Saddam's fall.\n       Within 48 hours of their arrival in Baghdad in April, some \n     of Chalabi's men, including members of his personal bodyguard \n     force, began taking cars, bank accounts and real estate, said \n     a senior military officer who received reports of the events. \n     It became evident almost as quickly that Chalabi and other \n     exiles had a larger political following in the Pentagon than \n     they did in Iraq.\n       Intelligence officials now charge that Chalabi or some of \n     his senior aides were paid agents of Iran's intelligence \n     service, and that Chalabi or his security chief provided \n     classified U.S. military information to Iran. Chalabi has \n     denied the allegation.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this point I further ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record testimony by General Franks in \nresponse to questioning by Senator Levin on this issue.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Levin. Could you give us just a range of troops? I \n     mean, would it be from 100-150,000 for many years? I'm not \n     asking for any kind of precise figure, but what's your \n     current best estimate?\n       General Franks. Senator Levin, that actually is not as hard \n     to answer as it might seem. We have about 145,000 troops in \n     there right now. As I have talked to commanders at every \n     level inside Iraq, one finds that that footprint appears to \n     us on the operational side to be about what that footprint \n     needs to look like. There has been suggestion that perhaps \n     there should be more troops, and, in fact, I can tell you in \n     the presence of this Secretary that if more troops are \n     necessary, this Secretary is going to say yes. We have talked \n     about this on a number of occasions, and when the tactical \n     commanders on the ground determine that they need to raise \n     force levels, then those forces in fact will be provided. The \n     Secretary may want to comment on that, but what we----\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That concludes the debate at this point. I wonder if \nSenator Allard and Senator Inhofe--I see Senator Sessions--we are \ntrying, if I might, to acquaint my colleagues who have arrived on the \nfloor--the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina desires to \nspeak to his forthcoming retirement. The senior Senator wishes to speak \nto that. Yet this issue has been fully debated by those who have been \non the floor. I judge my colleagues here wish to take some time.\n  If my colleague could indicate that to me, I would like to allocate \nthe time you would like to have.\n  First, Senator Allard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, if I might have 10 minutes. I am not sure I \nwould use that time, but I appreciate that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Other Senators?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I will be pleased--2 minutes will be \nsufficient to me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's say 5. He is the chairman on the subcommittee for \nthe Army and I think that is important.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I also have a 4 o'clock commitment I will need to be \nin.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator from Oklahoma----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Chairman, if there is 10 minutes, I would like to \nhave that. If not, I will downgrade that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will leave that to the Senator's judgment. For the \nmoment I will say 7 minutes. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is agreeable.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Senator from Colorado wish to allow our \ndistinguished colleague from Alabama to proceed?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from Colorado will \ngive me 2 to 3 minutes. I want to say a couple of things.\n  Mr. WARNER. For that purpose, I ask unanimous consent for the Senator \nfrom Alabama, to be followed by the Senator from Colorado, followed by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, to address the Senate in the confines of the \ntime allocated.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is all right with me. I yield 3 minutes.\n\n[[Page S11349]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was present when Dr. Harvey came \nbefore the Armed Services Committee for the nomination hearing on his \nappointment as Secretary of the Army. As the hearing went along, I \nbecame more and more impressed with this extraordinary man. This is not \nthe time to debate somebody's differing opinions about how General \nFranks and others should have handled the war in Iraq. They did a \ndadgum good job of it, as far as I am concerned, in achieving the \nvictory over there and in Afghanistan also. There will always be people \nto second-guess it.\n  But Dr. Harvey has extraordinary experience of remarkable breadth. He \nhas his B.S. from Notre Dame and Ph.D. from the University of \nPennsylvania in metallurgy and materials science. He has been CEO of \nsome of the country's largest corporations. He has been a COO of two \nhigh-tech startup companies in recent years. He is high-tech oriented. \nHe is management oriented. He will bring those skills to the Department \nof Defense.\n  As he goes through it, he will be able to help us decide how big the \nArmy should be and how the transformation should go forward to help us \ntransform our great Army, which is doing magnificent work this very \nmoment in a hostile environment in Iraq. He will help us make it \nbetter. I am convinced of that.\n  He is not a uniform man himself, nor should he be. He will bring his \ntalents to bear to that subject. I am excited by his nomination. I \nbelieve he will do an outstanding job.\n  I thank Senator Warner for his leadership and I yield the remainder \nof my time to Senator Allard and Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have the utmost confidence in Dr. \nFrancis Harvey and I do believe he will act on behalf of our men and \nwomen in the field. I think he has a sincere concern about what happens \nto them and that they have the adequate equipment and manpower and \nwhatnot to do their job. Frankly, it boils down to the fact that we can \nalways anticipate what the force size has to be. That has to be \ndetermined basically by the men in the field, the commanders in the \nfield. To try to run a war out of the Pentagon is a mistake. I happen \nto be rising in support of the nomination of Dr. Francis Harvey for the \npost of Secretary of the Army because I think he understands that.\n  I will say a few things here to comment on Dr. Harvey's \nqualifications.\n  In addition to the time Dr. Harvey spent with us in committee \nhearings, I spoke with him individually on a variety of Army issues, \ncritical not only to our overall national security but also the \ncitizens of Colorado. I believe Dr. Harvey to be fully qualified for \nthis post. My distinguished colleague from Alabama, I think, went over \nsome of his qualifications. I thank our distinguished chairman from \nVirginia for this timely debate and confirmation.\n  Let me first acknowledge the outstanding performance of the current \nActing Secretary of the Army, Les Brownlee. Secretary Brownlee, \ntogether with General Schoomaker, the Army Chief of Staff, has \nsuccessfully directed the Army through this time of challenge and \nchange. The Army is leading our Nation in the global war against \nextremist terrorists, and is making giant strides in transforming \nwarfighting, logistics, and business management capabilities.\n  Additionally, I know the Nation greatly appreciates the significant \nimprovements in the quality of life of our Active Duty, Reserve, and \nNational Guard soldiers. This includes our retirees, veterans, and \ndedicated spouses and families. I applaud Secretary Brownlee for these \nachievements and am thankful for his continued service to our country.\n  The challenges and pace of change in the Army remain steady and are \ntop national priorities. Based on my conversation with Dr. Harvey, I am \nconfident he has the right skills and experience to lead this next \nperiod of transformation. Dr. Harvey demonstrated a record of \nmanagement success in both public and private enterprise that will \nenable him to develop prudent choices and solutions for several \nstrategic Army outcomes. Among the key strategic evaluations are force \nstructure and force sizing reviews in pursuit of Army transformation \nobjectives; global posture and ``mission needs'' evaluations to improve \nArmy mobility and responsiveness regarding future demands at home and \nabroad; and, finally, manpower studies to assess and balance both the \nmilitary, civilian, and the Active-Reserve distribution of skills to \nensure we are optimally employing our military personnel and resources. \nThese critical activities will define the composition and capability of \nthe U.S. Army for the foreseeable future, and will improve the \nrecruitment, retention, and motivation of our men and women and \nfamilies throughout the Army family.\n  Another high priority I covered with Dr. Harvey is the Army's \ncommitment to, and funding for, our obligations to eliminate our \nchemical weapons stockpiles. The Army is the executive agent to carry \nout the chemical demilitarization and disposal program at various sites \nacross the country. Unfortunately, the program is falling behind \nschedule and costing more money than originally planned.\n\n  Dr. Harvey's qualifications and experience are well suited to address \nthe problems associated with the chemical demilitarization program. In \nmy personal conversations with the nominee, and again in public \ntestimony, I received Dr. Harvey's assurances and commitment for Army \nleadership to pay close attention to and fix the problems within the \ntechnology and demilitarization programs at all of our chemical weapons \nfacilities. I am convinced Dr. Harvey is as dedicated as I am to seeing \nthe United States fulfill our chemical weapons treaty obligations.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to speak in support of \nDr. Harvey's nomination. I believe Dr. Harvey is well qualified for the \nsignificant challenges facing him and I look forward to working with \nhim to keep our Army the greatest the world has ever known.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 minutes, of which 10 \nminutes has been allocated to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First of all, let me address some of the things that have been talked \nabout today. We have had a drawdown in the military, starting with the \nCold War. When it was over, all of us heard so many people say the Cold \nWar is over, we have no need to have the strength we had before. Then \nafter the 1991 gulf war, the drawdown continued. The Army is on the \nright track right now to regain the manpower they lost during that \ndrawdown. I agree with the Senator from Rhode Island, who has been \nconcerned about the end strength. I have joined him in that, and feel \nthe same way.\n  But I agree the drawdown in force that took place at the end of the \nCold War went too far. We cut 365,000 troops, too many for the force we \nhad. We should have stayed with the original number provided by General \nPowell during the first Bush administration.\n  During the Clinton administration, we took a procurement holiday that \ncost us dearly. Budgets were woefully inadequate to sustain our force. \nReadiness suffered. The euphoria was around the fact that ``the Cold \nWar is over,'' we no longer need this much military. We found out we \nwere wrong. From fiscal year 1994 to 2001, we did not keep up with \ninflation. Defense spending lost $430.2 billion in constant 2002 \ndollars. This was an average of $53.8 billion a year. We are talking \nabout a loss of that amount. The deterioration would have been $53.2 \nbillion greater if not for the Congress plus-up of the Clinton budget \nfrom fiscal year 1996 onward.\n  The Republicans gained control of both the House and the Senate in \n1994. To turn this positive from fiscal year 1996 onward, it would have \nbeen $58.1 billion or $9.7 billion a year average.\n  The Democratic Congress had even reduced the Clinton request from \n1994 to 1996 by $4.8 billion, or $2.4 billion a year average, and \nreduced the last fiscal 1993 year Bush budget request by a whopping \n$8.1 billion.\n\n[[Page S11350]]\n\n  The Republican Congress was able to flatten this trend by fiscal year \n1997 and turn the trend upward from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year \n2004 but never recovered the shortfall.\n  When George W. Bush took office, the military readiness was in \ndecline. We had not made the proper investment in modernization, \nreadiness, and standard of living for our soldiers.\n  I know it is true. I chaired the readiness subcommittee of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee during that timeframe. We desperately needed \nto reorganize the military to cope with this post-world war era.\n  Just short of 9 months after taking office, George W. Bush was faced \nwith 9/11. He was faced with mobilizing the military to protect the \nUnited States in a new kind of war, a new kind of war we never \nexperienced before, one not properly dealt with by previous \nadministrations, and one the military had not been funded to cope with.\n  We are now paying for that mistake. We have been playing catchup. We \nneed to put the Army back on the right track. And General Shoomaker and \nActing Secretary Brownlee have done just that. We are reorganizing the \nArmy to retrain soldiers from skills needed in today's threatened \nenvironment to skills more appropriate to those threats.\n  We are adding 30,000 soldiers to the force and turning many noncombat \njobs being performed by soldiers today into civilian positions.\n  We are stabilizing families and rotating units rather than individual \nsoldiers through Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We are accelerating equipment fielding to incorporate the latest \ninnovations to defend against EIDs, the threat that we really didn't \nknow about in years past.\n  We are committed to providing the Army with anything and everything \nthey need, but we can't waste resources by throwing money at the \nproblem. We have to respond to the requests of our leaders in the \nfield. I think we have done that, and I am committed to making sure we \ncontinue to do that.\n  I am confident that Secretary Harvey, as has been said by so many \npeople, will also continue to do that. I am confident he will be \nsuccessful because he understands industry. Today, we need industry to \ngive their best and as fast and as affordable as possible. It is \nimportant to have someone of Dr. Harvey's character and ability to \nprovide the guiding hand and make this partnership between Government \nand industry work for the maximum benefit of our soldiers.\n  You have to keep in mind that is one of the serious problems we face \nright now. The number of defense contractors is about one-fifth of what \nit was 20 years ago. It is important that we have someone who \nunderstands industry, and certainly Dr. Harvey will be such a person.\n  We are playing catchup in the world. It is changing daily before our \neyes. The Army must reorganize and modernize.\n  How many people in America know we are sending our troops out many \ntimes with equipment that is not as good as that of our potential \nadversaries? In the area of artillery, five countries make a better \nartillery piece than we have, including South Africa. We found out from \na very courageous general back in 1998 that in fact our best strike \nvehicles--F-15 and F-16--are not as good as some of the SU series being \nsold by Russia to many of our potential adversaries in the future. We \nmust mobilize our Guard and Reserve in ways we haven't seen since World \nWar II to fight this world war.\n  We have a great team to accomplish all of that. General Shoomaker and \nDr. Harvey and Les Brownlee and the brave men and women of our Army, \nboth uniformed and civilian. What a task they have and what a team we \nhave.\n  Senator Akaka and I are both veterans of the Army. We started the \nArmy Caucus. Up to that time they had not been given the proper \nattention as to how we are reliant on our Army for our ability to \nsustain this war against terrorism.\n  I look forward to the confirmation of Dr. Harvey as the next \nSecretary of the Army, and support the Army's advice to end this war.\n  We want to give, I believe, 10 minutes for the Senator from South \nCarolina. Is there more than 10 minutes remaining at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the majority has 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, does the Senator from Oklahoma desire \nadditional time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will take only maybe 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a lot of things have been said about the \ncondition of the soldiers in Iraq and about their attitudes. I can tell \nyou that I don't think there is any Member of this body who has spent \nmore time in Iraq and Afghanistan than I have. I hear statements of \nindividuals. They are proud of the mission. They are proud of what they \nare doing. They have a spirit I have never seen before.\n  I would like to quote Secretary Brownlee. He said:\n\n       Some in this country have charged that the situation in \n     Iraq is getting progressively worse. You who have been there \n     know the truth, and so do the people of Iraq. Things are \n     getting better, not worse. Though the insurgents have caused \n     immense pain and suffering and delayed reconstruction efforts \n     in some parts of Iraq, most Iraqis are looking at the future \n     with hope, hope they lacked under the former regime.\n\n  These successes constitute significant milestones of which the people \nof our Nation should be proud and hopeful. But the fight is by no means \nover to ensure that Afghanistan and Iraq attain stability and success \nand the transition into the democracies is very key.\n  I think we have seen this with the election in Afghanistan. I \npersonally was there when officials turned over to the Iraqis the \ntraining of the Iraqi National Army. I see the successes over there. \nThe media has not done a good job and I feel they need to spend more \ntime congratulating and talking about the great job we are doing.\n  As Mr. Brownlee said, the Army is decisively engaged in fighting \nterrorism. But our soldiers are also building alliances, training other \nmilitaries with tenets of democracy and civilian control, executing \ncounter drug operations and providing disaster relief and humanitarian \nassistance. These missions are equally important to our national \nsecurity. They help to increase mobile stability to prevent the \ndevelopment of serious crises and to demonstrate the goodwill of the \nAmerican people.\n  In light of the potential for terrorism to spread, the Army remains \ncommitted to participate. That is exactly what they are doing.\n  I just got back from eight countries in Africa. There is a concern \nthere. There is terrorism. As the squeeze comes in, terrorism is now \ninfiltrating into the continent of Africa, and we are in the process of \ndoing something with four brigades or five African brigades. So we will \nhave them trained to face this when that time comes.\n  I see other Senators waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nPresident's nomination of Dr. Fran Harvey to the post of Secretary of \nthe Army.\n  Our forces are deployed around the world as they have never been \nbefore. They are fighting hard and they are fighting well to defend \nAmericans in the war on terror, and the Army is at the front line of \nthat fight.\n  Gone are the days when massive and overwhelming force was all this \ncountry needed to ensure victory. The threats we face and the stresses \nthey cause on our force require visionary solutions. Fran Harvey is the \nvisionary we need at the head of our largest force.\n  Fran Harvey knows how to look at a large organization where the \nbureaucracy is an overwhelming force in its own right, and mold it to \nmeet future threats. Dr. Harvey is a successful executive who has \nextensive experience in leading and managing large organizations, \nparticularly program based organizations involved in the development \nand deployment of technology and systems.\n  He will bring a results oriented management approach to an \norganization where results matter more than anywhere else. As part of \nthis approach, Dr. Harvey places major emphasis on business \ntransformation through process improvement in combination with the \napplication of information technology.\n  Fran Harvey's broad base of experience has been multi-dimensional in\n\n[[Page S11351]]\n\nterms of industries, functions, and markets. His industrial experience \nis very diverse and includes aerospace and defense, environmental and \ninfrastructure, energy, government facilities management, \ncommunications and information systems and electronics.\n  Fran Harvey has the requisite experience to be Secretary of the Army, \nbut what is more important, he is a visionary where long-term vision is \nbadly needed. It is my great pleasure to support what I am sure will be \na successful tenure leading our Army.\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, due to a prior commitment, I will \nnot be able to vote in the Senate today on President Bush's nomination \nof Dr. Francis J. Harvey of California to be the next Secretary of the \nArmy.\n  I wish to state for the record that, had I been able to cast my vote \ntoday in the Senate, I would have voted in favor of Dr. Harvey. As he \nnoted in his appearance before the Senate's Committee on Armed \nServices, Dr. Harvey has experience in leading, managing and fostering \nchange in large organizations. In addition, I also appreciate that Dr. \nHarvey has experience in the defense industry, experience that should \nhelp him as he oversees the Army's important process of transforming to \nmeet 21st century threats.\n  On this last point, I hope that Dr. Harvey will devote considerable \ntime and effort to the Army's transformation initiative. If the Army is \nto be a relevant force in future combat operations, it must have the \nresources and the commitment from senior leadership necessary to \ntransform. This means that Dr. Harvey and others will need to fight for \ncritical science and technology funds to enable key transformational \nprograms, such as the Future Combat System, to succeed. While the Army \ndoes have current needs that require critical funds, it cannot \nsacrifice its future if it hopes to successfully transform.\n  In addition, transformation encompasses more than just equipment and \nweapons platforms. I am hopeful that Dr. Harvey will continue to make \nsure that we achieve the proper balance of skills located in the Active \nDuty with those located in the Reserve component. Too many Low Density/\nHigh Demand capabilities, such as military police and civil affairs, \nare found in Army's Reserve component. I am hopeful that the Army, \nunder Dr. Harvey's leadership, will be able to strike the right balance \nso that Operational Tempo problems--highlighted by the war on \nterrorism--are not exacerbated.\n  Again, had I been present in the Senate today, I would have voted in \nfavor of confirming Dr. Francis J. Harvey as the next Secretary of the \nArmy. I wish Dr. Harvey good luck on his new responsibilities and \nduties as Secretary of the Army.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Dr. Fran \nHarvey to be the next Secretary of the Army. I have met with Mr. Harvey \nand discussed the responsibilities of this position with him, and I \nbelieve he is well qualified to lead the Army during this critical \ntime.\n  As I stand here today, the U.S. Army is succeeding in the global war \non terrorism despite continued stress on and transformation of the \nforce. It is remarkable that the Army is succeeding to the extent that \nthey are while--at the same time--undergoing a significant reshaping of \nthe force. Many of my colleagues have suggested that a simple increase \nin the number of troops in the Army will solve the Army's challenges. \nWhile I believe that the Army does, at least in the near-term, need \nadditional troops, I believe the Army's largest and most promising \nchallenge is to continue transforming itself into a 21st century \nfighting force with 21st century tools and a 21st century management \nstructure. I believe that Francis Harvey will help lead the Army in \nthis direction.\n  As I see it, to relieve the stress on the force, we have to create a \nmore flexible force, and I commend Secretary Rumsfeld on the steps he \nhas taken to achieve this. To implement these reforms, the Army needs a \nleader who has experience with leading, managing, and reforming large \norganizations. Mr. Francis Harvey has that experience, and the \nnecessary business acumen and results oriented approach to get the job \ndone.\n  I have confidence in Mr. Harvey's ability to lead the men and women \nof the U.S. Army as they meet the challenges of the next decade. He \nwill be an effective, forward-thinking leader who will take the Army \nwhere it needs to go in the coming years.\n  In closing, I would also like to recognize the outstanding leadership \nand contribution of the Acting Secretary of the Army over the last 18 \nmonths, my good friend Les Brownlee. Les has led the Army during an \nextraordinary time in the Army's history and deserves to be commended \nfor his professionalism and his selfless service to our country and to \nthe men and women of the U.S. Army.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to conclude this debate on the \nnominee. The nomination will be voted on, I am told, at 5:15, subject \nto modifications at that time.\n  I say in conclusion that I think we have had a very good debate on \nthis nomination and also the serious issues affecting the Department of \nthe Army. I think it has been helpful in many respects.\n  I am prepared to yield back all the remaining time which I have in \nthe debate. I understand the distinguished ranking member is prepared \nto do likewise.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in that case, I yield the floor with the \nunderstanding that the distinguished colleague from South Carolina can \nnow proceed as he desires with regard to a very important set of \nremarks the Senate is anxious to receive. I say that in all sincerity.\n  I thank colleagues for their participation in this debate. I strongly \nurge Members of the Senate to vote for confirmation of the nominee. \nThis particular individual who is nominated to be Assistant Secretary \nof Defense came before the Armed Services Committee. He was reported \nout favorably to the floor and had been waiting for some period of time \nfor confirmation to that position. The Secretary of Defense made the \ndecision to resubmit his name in connection with the Secretary of the \nArmy.\n  I strongly urge colleagues to support this nominee. This is the \nnomination of the President of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and \nSenator Levin for allowing us to use the time, and I appreciate it very \nmuch.\n\n\n                      Farewell to Senator Hollings\n\n  Mr. President, the task at hand for me is a difficult one. I want to \ntake some time to talk about my senior Senator, Senator Hollings, who \nis retiring. Trying to do justice to his career is going to be a \ndifficult task for me, but I will do my best.\n  I want the people of South Carolina to understand that whatever \ndifferences I may have with Senator Hollings, they are political in \nnature. They have never been personal, and I cannot thank him enough \nfor the time he has dedicated to the transition from the House to the \nSenate for our office. Senator Hollings has been a tremendous benefit \nto me personally. He has made the transition from the House to the \nSenate very enjoyable. He has helped my staff. He has been \nindispensable in our getting started in the Senate. I want to thank him \npersonally and thank him for the kindnesses he has shown to me.\n  Trying to follow Senator Thurmond and Senator Hollings is a tough \nact. South Carolinians have relied on these two great gentlemen for \nliterally my entire lifetime. With the retirement of Senator Hollings, \nI think it is going to be hard to put in words how much he will be \nmissed by the Senate and South Carolina.\n  But when you start talking about a man, trying to give tribute to \nhim, I think the first thing you have to start with is what means most \nto that person, to the man himself, and to his family. His wife Peatsy \nis one of the most delightful people you ever hope to meet. She is \nbeloved by the colleagues in this Chamber and their spouses on both \nsides of the aisle. She is a joy to be with. She is a lot of fun, and \nshe has been a great soulmate to Senator Hollings for many years. I \nknow he is equally proud of his children. He lost a daughter. It is a \nterrible thing to have happen. He has four children and I think seven \ngrandchildren.\n\n[[Page S11352]]\n\n  For those people listening in South Carolina, the demands on one's \ntime in this job are immense, and your family sacrifices in a variety \nof ways, whether it is going back home on the weekend to try to say \nhello to constituents or to be in a parade. I don't think we stress \nenough how important families are to Members. Senator Hollings has \nenjoyed the support of a first-class group of family members who have \nrepresented South Carolina very well.\n  Wherever Peatsy Hollings goes, South Carolina goes, and there is no \nbetter way to be introduced in our State than to meet her.\n  Senator Hollings' time in the Senate will be coming to an end. He has \nchosen to retire. It is a lifetime of public service that I will try to \ntalk about in the next 10 or 15 minutes.\n  As his generation is noted for ``The Greatest Generation,'' the World \nWar II generation, he seems to have been there every time his State and \nhis country needed him. He was a graduate of the Citadel. He graduated \nin 1942.\n  As you can tell by his accent, which is the ultimate low country \naccent, he is from Charleston. If you had to create an image of a \nSenator, he would be my model. He looks like a Senator and he sounds \nlike a Senator, and he also acts like a Senator. I mean that in the \nhighest form of a compliment.\n\n  He has represented my State since 1996 in the Senate but that is not \nthe first time he has represented my State. It is not the first time he \nhas served this country. As I mentioned, in 1942 he graduated from the \nCitadel. That was the class that got their diploma in the morning, got \ncommissioned in the afternoon, and their orders the next day and they \nwent off to fight a war. He is very emblematic of that generation. They \nnever really had a chance to be young because the day they graduated \ncollege they went off to take on a vicious enemy.\n  People talk about 1-year tours and the stress it puts on families--\nthat is true--but in World War II you signed up for the duration. You \ndidn't know when you were coming home and you didn't know if you were \ncoming home. You were coming home when the war was over, when Berlin \nfell and when Tokyo fell. His generation never enjoyed the benefits of \ngetting out of college and being young men or young women because they \nhad a tough task at hand at an early age.\n  Let it be said for Senator Hollings and an entire generation, you \nhandled the job exceedingly well. You rose to the occasion. You made \nthe world free. If the Senator had done nothing else, that would have \nbeen a pretty good legacy for life. He went on to fight in north Africa \nand Europe. He fought the Nazis. He received the Bronze Star and seven \ncampaign ribbons. He was in the action. He did his job well. He \ncommanded troops in combat.\n  At the ripe old age of 26 he comes back to South Carolina, but a 26-\nyear-old back then is not like a 26-year-old in normal times. I would \nargue that the 26-year-olds who come back from Iraq are going to be a \nlittle bit different, too. I can only imagine how war matures and ages \nyou. It makes you able to put in perspective what is important. And his \nentire generation has had that perspective from the time they came back \nfrom the war and for the rest of their lives.\n  It was shown in Senator Thurmond's and Senator Hollings's life. Both \nare World War II veterans. When he came back to South Carolina, he was \nelected to the House of Representatives at the age of 26. Shortly \nthereafter, he became Speaker pro tempore. So his colleagues saw in him \nsomething of a leader at an early age. They saw what the rest of South \nCarolina has seen for decades: Somebody who will speak their mind. You \ncan be on the receiving end of speaking that mind--I have been on the \nreceiving end--but he is fair. He has been tough on everybody. But \npeople know he has a good heart. And he also has a good heart for South \nCarolina. That is why his colleagues put him at a young age in charge \nin the House.\n  In the Brown v. Board of Education litigation, one of the first cases \nthat came about was the South Carolina case involving Clarendon County. \nSenator Hollings participated in that case. It was a life-changing \nexperience.\n  In 1953, he became Lieutenant Governor. In 1958, he was elected \nGovernor, the youngest Governor in South Carolina history at that time. \nFrom 1959 to 1963, he was a young Governor who had served in World War \nII, participated in one of the greatest legal cases of our time, and he \ntook that experience and changed my State for the better.\n  From 1959 to 1963, if you open up any history book, particularly in \nthe South, these are tremendously troubling times. Social change is \nabounding. The old way of doing business is being challenged. People \nare fighting and sometimes dying throughout the South to bring about a \nnew way of doing business.\n\n  I never will forget Senator Hollings telling me about the court \nappearance in the Supreme Court when an African-American lawyer stood \nup and talked about fighting in the war, coming back home and being \ntold to go to the back of the bus. And Senator Hollings said, ``that \nended it for me. There was no way that I was going to be a voice for \nsegregation.'' It hit him like a ton of bricks.\n  One of his best legacies for my State and the Nation and the power of \nthe Governor from 1959 to 1963--no lives were lost in South Carolina--\nas he was leaving the office, there are all kinds of speeches going on \nin the South by Governors. Some people were standing in front of a \nschoolhouse and saying: You are not coming in; segregation now and \nsegregation forever. Senator Hollings said that in South Carolina we \nwill be a government of laws, not men. He challenged my State to accept \nthe inevitable. He challenged my State to respect the Supreme Court \ndecision. He led the way to the successful integration of Clemson \nUniversity in 1963.\n  The list goes on and on of what he has done to empower African \nAmericans in South Carolina. He has been a champion for racial fairness \nhis entire time. It is fashionable now. It is the politically correct \nthing to do now. But in 1963 it was not the politically correct thing \nto do in South Carolina or any other Southern State. But he chose the \npath less traveled. Our State is better off for it, and because of his \nleadership and others who followed, we were able to do things in South \nCarolina in a way of which we should all be proud. Hats off to you for \nthat, Senator Hollings.\n  During the time as Governor, he did some things economically that we \nhave the benefit of today. Our technical school program, for those who \nare not familiar with South Carolina, is No. 1 in the Nation. If you \nare looking at doing business in South Carolina, we have a technical \nschool system that will meet your needs. We will design a training \nprogram for your employees, specifically for your business. We have \nthousands of South Carolinians receiving college level education \nthrough our technical schools in an affordable manner. We have 16 \ncolleges now, over 160 career programs and high-tech professionals who \nhave made the Michelins, BMWs, and Fujis possible to come to our State. \nHe is the father of that legislation.\n  If he had done nothing else, that would have been a great tribute, \nbut there is a lot more that he has done. He created the South Carolina \npublic broadcasting system, one of the best in the Nation, if not the \nbest in the Nation. South Carolina ETV is known all over the world, \nreally.\n  As a young Governor, he took the road less traveled; he invested in \neducation in a new and different way that pays dividends today. That is \nsomething he should be proud of and I am proud of on his behalf.\n  In 1966, as a young man, he comes to the Senate. I don't have the \ntime to read his legislative accomplishments because it would take most \nof the afternoon. It is fair to say that since Senator Hollings has \nbeen in the Senate he has not let any grass grow under his feet. He has \nbeen one of the most proactive Senators I have ever known. Almost \nanything that has been done in South Carolina with Federal assistance \nhas been as a result of his efforts and that of Senator Thurmond.\n\n  Primarily, Senator Hollings has led the charge on the Appropriations \nCommittee in making sure South Carolina was as well taken care of in \nterms of Federal Government assistance as humanly possible. You will be \nmissed, Senator Hollings.\n  I will have, along with Senator DeMint, a very tough act to follow. \nWe will try our best. But the Senator has done some things that I don't \nthink\n\n[[Page S11353]]\n\nmost people know about but which have had a huge impact on who we are \nas a State and really the Nation.\n  The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 was Federal legislation for \nthe first time addressing the coastal areas of the United States. In \n1972, you were so far ahead of your time. The Costal Zone Management \nAct allowed Senator Hollings to be named Environmentalist of the Year \nby about every group in the Nation. Because of that act, we have come \nup with a plan to manage our coastline in terms of erosion.\n  The Senator has also contributed to the clean health of the ocean, in \n1976, with the Ocean Dumping Act and the Maritime Transportation Act, a \nseries of legislation that Senator Hollings offered that has changed \nthe way we treat our coastlines as a nation.\n  He probably has the most proactive environmental policy that we have \nhad as a nation dealing with our coastal areas. It was a result of his \nefforts. Long after he is gone, the coastline of South Carolina and \nevery other coast in the United States will be the beneficiary of his \ntime in the Senate.\n  He was talking about deficits before it was fashionable. Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings was an attempt in the 1980s to bring fiscal sanity to \nthe Congress. By the time the 1990s came along, it becomes the way we \ncampaign. About 10 years after his efforts--along with his colleagues, \nSenators Gramm and Rudman--it got to be the fashionable thing in \npolitics to talk about not running up the debt.\n  Senator Hollings was talking about the social integrity of Social \nSecurity before anyone else I have ever known. What are we talking \nabout today? We are going to save Social Security. I hope we do. It \nwould be wise to listen and learn from what he has been trying to \ninstruct us to do.\n  The first national park and only national park in South Carolina \nhappened a couple years ago, the Congaree Swamp. That will be a \nmonument to a balance between development and the environment for the \nrest of the time that South Carolina exists, long after we are gone. \nThe Congaree Swamp will be well taken care of.\n  There are so many things. The ACE Basin is probably one of the best \nmonuments to our Creator. God has been good to South Carolina. When you \ntravel through our State from the mountains to the sea, you will see \nsome nature that is beyond description. From the mountains to the sea, \nSenator Hollings has been integrally involved in preserving what God \nhas given us. The ACE Basin is a project he helped fund that has saved \nsome coastal areas and some waterways in South Carolina. The whole \nbasin is a monument to the environment. We worked together preserving \nover 30,000 acres in perpetuity in South Carolina. The Congaree Swamp \nis in the middle.\n  As we look back over Senator Hollings's time in the Senate, you can \nsee that he used his power in the Senate to make sure that future \ngenerations of South Carolinians would enjoy the things he has \nexperienced as a young man. What better legacy to leave than a State \nthat maintains its beauty.\n\n  He has been aggressive when it comes to changing the fabric of the \neducation climate in South Carolina with technical schools. One thing \nhe should be most proud of is the Hollings Cancer Institute at the \nMedical University of South Carolina. South Carolina has pockets of \nhealth care problems that are Third World in nature. One day we are \ngoing to conquer these problems, but we have a litany of health care \nproblems in South Carolina. My mother died of Hodgkin's disease. The \nHollings Cancer Institute and the Medical University of South Carolina \nis doing some research that will pay great dividends in the future in \nterms of conquering this disease called cancer.\n  My personal commitment to Senator Hollings is that I will continue to \nbuild upon what the Senator has started. It is my hope that the \nNational Cancer Institute will designate this and we will try our best \nto make sure this happens as a tribute to the Senator.\n  Again, I could go through legislative enactments, specific projects \nthat have helped South Carolina, but I would like to end by saying that \nlife is short. No matter how long it seems you have been around, it \nreally is a small time in the scheme of things. South Carolina has \nenjoyed two long-serving Senators: Senator Thurmond and Senator \nHollings. Both will have departed the Senate come next January. Let it \nbe said about Senator Hollings that his time in the Senate will be felt \nby South Carolinians as long as there is a South Carolina. What the \nSenator has been able to do with the power entrusted to him by the \npeople of South Carolina is to bring about a lot of good, Senator \nHollings. The Senator has made our State a better place to live. The \nSenator has preserved things that would have been lost without the \nSenator. The Senator has talked about the future in responsible terms. \nThe Senator has served our Nation during peace and war. The Senator has \nserved South Carolina and the Senate well.\n  I am honored to call you my senior Senator. It is my wish that you \nhave many more years to help my State, help our State, and help our \nNation. I hope that comes to pass.\n  As I try to go forward as a Senator from South Carolina, I hope I am \nsmart enough to draw upon what you have done and look at the model you \nhave created and build upon that model.\n  I am a Republican; Senator Hollings is a Democrat. That means \nsomething, but it really does not mean that much because we are both \nAmericans, and we both love South Carolina.\n  God bless, godspeed, and well done. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The senior Senator from South \nCarolina.\n\n\n                                Farewell\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague has been more \nthan generous, and I thank him not just for today but for the years to \ncome. I do so genuinely in the sense that his coming here as a Senator \nis like going over on the wall and turning on the lights. Here I had \nsomebody diligently working to get things done. That is why I came to \nthe Senate, to get things done for South Carolina. And Senator Graham \nhas not only worked hard--we all work hard; there is no lazy Senator in \nthe 100 Senators--but he has that secret of making friends. After all, \nthis is a political body, and you cannot get things done unless you \nmake friends.\n  He instantly came to the Chamber and started working with Democratic \nSenators, which was a surprise to me. Things are so confrontational at \nthe present time in politics, to see that occur, I said: That fellow is \ngoing to be here a long time. And I believe it. He is going to be here \na long time.\n  Just this past week, he got on to my crusade of trying to get jobs \nand industry. He's following in the footsteps of, our distinguished \nformer colleague, the senior Senator from Kentucky, Wendell Ford, who \nis on the floor and graces us. He makes me feel like old times when he \nwas our whip, and no one, as chairman of the Rules Committee, did a \nbetter job. But Lindsey Graham went out of his way to get things done.\n  This past week he has been taking around ambassadors from various \ncountries to prompt their interest in investing in South Carolina. As \nGovernor, I started going on trips in 1960 to encourage businesses to \nmove to South Carolina, and now we have 134 German industries in South \nCarolina. We have French Michelin, and we have Japanese Hitachi, Fuji, \nand others. Now, Senator Graham is working the beat. He is a realist, \nand he knows how to get things done.\n  I cannot thank him enough for being already distinguished, not just \nbecause we gave him the title, but because I have heard from colleagues \non both sides of the aisle: That fellow, Lindsey Graham, is really a \nfine fellow. He is working, and you really ought to be proud of him.\n\n  I address the distinguished Senator from South Carolina by saying \nthat the only way I can show my gratitude is to make sure he gets this \ndesk. I have the John C. Calhoun desk. You will laugh, Wendell. When I \ngot here I told Senator Russell, I would like to have this desk. He \nsaid: Colleague, colleague, colleague--you know how he talked--I guess \nyou would like to have this desk. My father sat at this desk, my mother \nsat at this desk, and I am sitting at this desk.\n  I said: Excuse me, I didn't know all three of them had been there.\n  He came to me the night before he left, and gave me the Calhoun desk, \nand I am going to make sure the Sergeant at Arms gets this desk to \nSenator Graham.\n\n[[Page S11354]]\n\n  This is my chance to thank my colleagues for putting up with me for \n38 years. I thank the distinguished staff, not just my staff and the \ncommittee staff, but particularly this afternoon the floor staff, Marty \nand Lula and everybody else. We couldn't get anything done without \ntheir wonderful help. And I thank the poor reporters. If you can \nunderstand what I am saying--\n  (Laughter.)\n  They are always asking later, Mr. President: What did he say and how \ndid he say it?\n  I will never forget politicking for President. I went up to \nWorcester, MA. I kept calling it Worcester. I knocked on the door and \nthe lady said: Who are you?\n  I said: Fritz Hollings. She thought it was a German trucking company.\n  I do thank the reporters who have done an outstanding job for me over \nthe many years.\n  I started my career as a trial lawyer, and I made enough as a good \ntrial lawyer to afford to come to Washington and be in the United \nStates Senate. Senators don't make enough money. You ought to double \ntheir pay, and I say that before leaving. I have said that along with \nTed Stevens for years. No little young fledgling lawyer, such as \nHollings, can afford to run, keep up two homes, and everything else. It \ncan't happen anymore. You all are just politically using the salary and \nnot really attracting the best of the best.\n  I don't leave with the idea that the Senate is not what it used to be \nin the sense of personnel. We have a way better group of Senators. We \nhad five drunks or six drunks when I came here. There is nobody drunk \nin the United States Senate. We don't have time to be drunk and, more \nthan that, we have the women. We had one woman. She was outstanding, \nbut she was outstandingly quiet. That was Margaret Chase Smith from \nMaine, a wonderful lady. Now we have 14, and you can't shut them up. \nThey keep on talking and talking and talking. If you get into a debate \nwith Barbara Mikulski or Barbara Boxer, they will take your head off, I \ncan tell you that. They know how to present a viewpoint, and that is \nvery valuable.\n  The Senators have done a wonderful job. The Senate itself is the \ngreatest of institutions, but I know we can do better. As a trial \nlawyer, I was overjoyed. When I came here, we had the proceeding to \nlearn the truth and we could hear the best of witnesses. I had better \nclients as a United States Senator, and obviously, I could make the \nfinal argument to the jury and then go in the jury room and vote. That, \nto me, is a trial lawyer. I had reached the ultimate.\n  Yet as I am leaving, I am very sensitive to the full docket of \nunfinished business. I am constantly being asked about legacy, legacy, \nlegacy. I am thinking the things we ought to have done long ago and \nhave not done because rather than seeking the truth--and I say this \nadvisedly--we have obscured it.\n  Take right now the issue that is going to confront us tomorrow \nafternoon or Thursday of raising the debt limit. I read the business \npage of the New York Times this morning. We are spending at the rate of \n$600 billion more than we are taking in. That is a deficit. Don't give \nme this doubletalk of on-budget deficit, off-budget, or Government debt \nand public debt. We are spending $600 billion more than we are taking \nin, which is 6 percent of our GNP.\n\n  In the European Union, if you exceed 3 percent of your gross national \nproduct, you are not eligible to be in the European Union. Here we are \ntelling the world what they ought to do in diplomacy, international \naffairs, defense affairs, and fiscal affairs, and we would not even be \neligible to be in the European Union.\n  We have, Mr. President, the economy on steroids. Add it up. Add up \nthe deficit of 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004--those 4 years--and you have \n$1.7 trillion that we have goosed into the economy with these tax cuts. \nWe have not increased spending on the war $1.7 trillion. No, no. We \nhave tax cut, tax cut, tax cut, and they still want more tax cuts. I am \ntalking bipartisan because both sides are guilty. I am not talking in a \npartisan fashion.\n  We have to do something about that deficit. I was here when we \nbalanced the budget without Social Security in 1968. President Clinton \ngot the Government back into the black when Bush came in. But he turned \na $6 trillion projected surplus, to a $5 trillion projected deficit, \nand now we have to increase the debt limit. Now the dollar is in a deep \ndive. Interest rates are going to have to go up. We are depending on \nfinancing our debt some $700 billion by the Japanese, $170 billion by \nthe Chinese, and $67 billion by Korea. Can you imagine going with a tin \ncup to Korea, begging: Please finance my debt because I need another \ntax cut?\n  What about Social Security? Let's tell the truth about it because \nthere isn't any question that we have been spending Social Security \nmoneys for any and everything but Social Security, in violation of the \nlaw.\n  And don't give me this thing about, oh, yeah, Lyndon Johnson used \nSocial Security. He did not. Look at the record. He balanced it, and we \ndid not spend Social Security moneys until the seventies when Wilbur \nMills, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee on the House side, \nstarted giving these inordinate COLAs. We started draining the fund.\n  We appointed the Greenspan Commission in 1983. The Greenspan \nCommission came out with an inordinately high tax to take care of the \nbaby boomers in the next generation. Don't misunderstand me. They act \nlike the baby boomers are coming along as a new problem. We foresaw \nthat in 1983. We said, as a result of this high tax, do not spend this \nmoney on anything but Social Security. I fought like a tiger, but we \nfinally got it into law. On November 5, 1990, George Herbert Walker \nBush signed into law section 13301 that says that the President and the \nCongress cannot use for budget purposes Social Security moneys.\n  I was talking a minute ago to my distinguished colleague from South \nCarolina. He is going to try, I guess, to raise taxes. I would support \nit so long as we are not raising taxes for anything and everything but \nSocial Security.\n  You are going to have to increase the age. You are going to have to \nget some revenues to make it fiscally sound. But if we started \nimmediately with the Social Security surplus going to just the Social \nSecurity trust fund, we immediately have $160 billion, and with that \n$160 billion in 7 years, we would have a trillion dollars and you \nwouldn't have to worry until 2045 or 2050, and there would not be any \ncrisis. We ought to study that.\n  It is the same with trade. Everywhere in the land people cry: Free \ntrade, free trade, free trade. There is no such thing; never has there \nbeen and never will there be free trade. I know about freer \ngovernmental restrictions, subsidies, and quotas, but that is not going \nto happen.\n  People ought to remember that we built this industrial giant and \npower, the United States of America, with protectionism. The Brits \ncorresponded with the Founding Fathers, and they said: Under David \nRicardo's comparative advantage, what needs to be done is we will trade \nwith you what we produce best and you trade back with us what you \nproduce best. Free trade, free trade, free trade.\n  Hamilton wrote the Report on Manufacturers. He said: Bug off, we are \nnot going to remain your colony. We are going to maintain our own \nmanufacturing capacity.\n\n  The second bill that ever passed this Congress in history, on July 4, \n1789, was a 50-percent tariff on articles and we started with \nprotectionism, linking the steel mills with protectionism. Roosevelt \ncame in with protective subsidies on agriculture. Our friend, President \nEisenhower, had import quotas on oil--protectionism. President Kennedy \ncame in with a 7-point program to protect textiles. More recently, our \ngood friend President Ronald Reagan, put in voluntary restraint \nagreements on automobiles, steel, handtools, and semiconductors.\n  Ask Andy Grove if he would have Intel today if President Reagan had \nnot put in that protectionist measure. There would not be any Intel.\n  We did that with Sematech and everybody knows it. But we were \ntreating trade as aid in the war of capitalism versus communism right \nafter World War II. We had the only industry. So we sent over, with the \nMarshall Plan, money, experts, equipment, and we started giving away my \ntextile industry--giving it away.\n\n[[Page S11355]]\n\n  Right now 70 percent of the clothing I am looking at is imported; 86 \npercent of the shoes on the floor are imported. It is all gone. All \nthat time they said: Don't worry. We are going to be a service economy.\n  My light bill in South Carolina is administered in Bangalore, India. \nSo we have lost the service economy. We have lost the manufacturing \neconomy and capacity.\n  What happens is your security is like a three-legged stool. You have \nthe one leg, your values as a nation. Around the world we stand for \nindividual freedom and democracy.\n  We have the second leg, unquestioned, as a superpower.\n  The third leg of the economy has been fractured intentionally and we \nare happy about it because capitalism has defeated communism in Europe, \nin the Soviet Union, and in the Pacific rim. And it is defeating it \nright now in China. Let's not disturb it and what have you, except to \nbegin to compete. As Akio Morita says: That world power that loses its \nmanufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power. What we need to \ndo is to rebuild.\n  We can begin to immediately rebuild by changing the culture, the \nmindset, the legislation. Around here we passed, 4 weeks ago, a $50 \nbillion tax cut bill that was supposed to represent foreign credit \nsales. Instead, it subsidized the export of jobs, the outsourcing of \njobs overseas.\n  We are still treating trade as aid. If you are going to open up \nSununu Manufacturing, before you open the door you have to have a \nminimum wage, clean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, plant closing notice, parental leave, OSHA, a safe working \nplace, safe machinery, and I can go all the way down. And in \nManchester, NH, your competition has moved to China because they can \noperate and produce there for 58 cents an hour and none of those \nrequirements. If you don't move to China yourself, you are going broke. \nYou will go bankrupt.\n  The policy of the crowd that is hollering and wailing and moaning \nabout the outsourcing of jobs is exactly the policy of the very crowd \nthat is causing that outsourcing. If you head up a multinational, you \nare supposed to compete and make a profit. We are supposed to create a \nstrong economy and produce jobs. The Congress of the United States, the \nSenate, we are the guilty parties. We have to put in a change of the \nculture. We need a Department of Trade and Commerce, and to put the \nSpecial Trade Representative over there and to do away with the \nInternational Trade Commission, because this is just a sop. The \nInternational Trade Administration--and not Commission should find the \npenalty rather than having that separate hearing and say there is \nno injury and everything else of that kind.\n\n  I have worked with the lawyers. We need a Deputy Attorney General for \nTrade in the Justice Department. We have one for antitrust. We have one \nfor civil rights. We have one for taxation. We don't have one for \ntrade. We need somebody enforcing those laws. We need, by gosh, to turn \naround and start competing the way they have done. We need more customs \nand--but that is a long story.\n  Let me just say what we need to do is get ahold of ourselves and \nrealize we have a problem.\n  I was at a meeting earlier today where one of the Senators was \ncounseling the new Senators: Don't take too many committees. They are \ngoing to take all the committees. Our time has come. We want it all. So \nwe want all the committees.\n  The rules ought to say a Senator should not be on any more than two \ncommittees. You can't keep up with it. I am on the Appropriations \nCommittee. They used to have 17 members; now they have 29 members. You \nknow, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense has 19 members. You \ncan't hardly get a quorum for the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense. We have a third of the Senate. Everybody wants to be on all \nthe committees, so you have your staffs doing all the work, because you \ncan't keep up.\n  But the main culprit, the cancer on the body politic, is money: \nMoney, money, money. When I ran 6 years ago, in 1998, I raised $8.5 \nmillion. That $8.5 million is $30,000 a week, every week, for 6 years. \nIf you miss Christmas week, you miss New Years week, you are $100,000 \nin the hole and don't you think we don't know it and we start to work \nharder at raising money.\n  As a result, the Senate doesn't work on Mondays and Fridays. We have \nlonger holidays. The policy committee is adjourned and we go over to \nthe campaign building because you can't call for money in the office. \nSo we go over to the building and call for money and obviously we only \ncan give attention to that. We don't have time for each other. We don't \nhave time for constituents, except for the givers. Somebody ought to \ntell the truth about that.\n  Unless and until we excise this cancer, the Congress and Government \nis going to languish alone because it has to be done.\n  When I helped write the Federal Election Campaign Practices Act in \n1973, we said each Senator would be limited to so much per registered \nvoter. That meant that Strom Thurmond and I were limited to $637,000. \nFast forward 25 years, add in inflation, and give me $2.5 million. \nQuadruple it, $2.5 million but not $8.5 or $10 million that you have to \nspend because all your time is on the campaign and not the country. I \ncan tell you right now we are in real, real trouble.\n  I worked with John McCain and Russell Feingold on the McCain-\nFeingold. I worked with Senator Biden on public finance. What really \nneeds to be done, and I tried 20 years ago, is to put in a \nconstitutional amendment that Congress is hereby empowered to regulate \nor control spending in Federal elections. Then we can go back to the \n1973 act: So much per registered voter. When you are limited to $2.5 \nmillion, you have limited the campaign. You have limited the time of \nthe campaign; you have limited the expenditures of the campaign. Then \nyou have time for constituents. Then you have time for problems.\n  When I came here, Mike Mansfield would have a vote at 9 o'clock just \nabout every Monday morning and we would work to Friday at 5 o'clock. We \nall stayed here on the weekends and we didn't have all of these long \nholidays we have now.\n  But if you want to limit campaigning and if you want to change--as \nAbe Lincoln said--disenthrall ourselves of the dogmas of the quiet past \nthat are inadequate for the stormy present of money grubbing, then we \nhave to think anew and act anew. We need to disenthrall ourselves from \nthis money grubbing and go to work finally for the country instead of \nthe campaign.\n\n  That is our situation. I have watched it. I have studied it. I have \nseen it. They don't have me going to meetings. They have me going to \nthe telephone and calling and calling, traveling all over the country \nfor money. Money is a cancer on the body politic.\n  Other than that, I have spoken seriously about trying to face up to \nsome of these problems that we have confronting us. There are a lot of \nopportunities.\n  They are talking now about immigration. Mexico is not a foreign \ncountry. They are our neighbor. All you have to do is put down the \nbillions that we spend: Give them a Marshall Plan, increase their \nstandard of living just like Canada. Then you don't have immigration.\n  I can tell you right now, the money spent on immigration, drugs, and \nborder patrol, and financing that government out of the banks in New \nYork and then refinancing it on us taxpayers, we could have a Marshall \nPlan and solve the problem.\n  There are a lot of problems that we can solve. But if there is a last \nword, it is one of gratitude. This has been the finest experience I \nhave ever had. When you come right down to it, I was always worried \nthat I couldn't make enough money to stay in Washington. Now I have \nlooked at my trial lawyer colleagues who made a lot of money. Most of \nthem are dead. Those who are alive are looking for a new golf course \nand a new drink and they don't know anything about what is going on and \nthey are not interested in anything going on. If you really want to be \nenriched in your life be a United States senator. The best postgraduate \ncourse is to run and be in this Senate.\n  It is with heartfelt gratitude I thank the colleagues for their \nindulgence this afternoon, particularly my colleague, Senator Graham. \nWe just have a fine time working together, and I know he\n\n[[Page S11356]]\n\nwill be representing us in the Senate for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quroum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that the vote is \nordered for 5:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, a vote will occur at \n5:15.\n\n\n                                Farewell\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to say that \nthis Senator is going to miss the booming voice and the southern drawl \nof the Senator from South Carolina who is one of a few who has \nrelentlessly, over a long period of time, talked about the issue of \ninternational trade. He has talked about how it relates to our \ncountry's economy. Very few come to the floor to talk about the \ndoctrine of comparative advantage and Adam Smith and the kind of things \nthat I have had the privilege of hearing from Senator Hollings.\n  As one who comes to the floor to talk about trade a lot, I am going \nto miss very much the work which has been done by Senator Hollings and \nwhich he has been doing for so many years. He is absolutely right about \nthese issues.\n  They will take a look at statements and say, well, he is a \nprotectionist. I don't view Senator Hollings as wanting to put up walls \naround this country. I think if the charge is that Senator Hollings or \nI or others want to protect the economic interests of the United \nStates, we ought to plead guilty quickly. That is why I am here and why \nhe has served this country for so many decades. We want to protect the \neconomic interests of this country.\n  I wanted to say, having heard the comments just offered by my \ncolleague from South Carolina, how proud I am to have served with him. \nBeing here when Senator Hollings was here and when Senator Byrd has \nbeen here and a few others is a very special privilege for someone like \nmyelf.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I yield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I wanted to thank the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota. He has been in the vanguard. He headed up our policy committee \nand we have learned more. I was on the original policy committee under \nSenator Mansfield. But it has been quite an education. He has really \nput the program so we can learn about the issues. I thank him for that. \nBut I particularly want to commend him for his leadership on trade \nbecause he has been leading the way on that score. I thank him very \nmuch.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my colleague from South Carolina and wish him \nwell.\n\n\n                    Sinking Of The ``Leopoldville''\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday I was privileged to be at a very moving \nceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n  Very few people will know of this issue, but I want to mention it \nbecause yesterday was the commemoration of the 60th year of the sinking \nof the SS Leopoldville, a troopship that was sunk in the English \nChannel on Christmas Eve 1944 by a torpedo shot by a German U-boat. \nSeven-hundred and sixty-three young American soldiers died in the \nfrigid waters of the English Channel on that Christmas Eve.\n  What was most interesting about this and in many ways the most tragic \nof this circumstance is that those young soldiers died in the waters of \nthe English Channel, and virtually no one knew of them.\n  On Christmas Eve of 1944, at a critical period, during the Battle of \nthe Bulge, the announcement that 763 young American soldiers had been \nkilled would have been devastating to the psyche of the American \npublic, according to the Defense Department. So the result was there \nwas no news. This was an enormous tragedy that occurred with virtually \nno one knowing of it.\n  Yesterday, we placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. I \nwas proud to have been a part of the ceremony. My uncle was on this \nship and was killed when it sunk. I walked down the aisle to place the \nwreath with Tony Martinez, one of the survivors from that night, and \nwith Lucy Ruggles, the widow of one of the fellows who was killed in \nthat event. I believe 20 survivors from this ship were there yesterday \nat Fort Myers and at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, along with more \nthan 100 family members and friends.\n  Let me say just a word about what happened.\n  The Leopoldville was a Belgium ship staffed by a Belgium crew. It was \nwithin 5 miles of the French coast. They could see the lights of the \nFrench coast when the German U-boat hit it with several torpedoes. Then \nthis ship sank. There were 2,300 soldiers on this ship, and 763 of them \ndied on Christmas Eve 1944.\n  There was no notice to anybody about the tragedy because the \nAmericans, the English, the Belgiums, the French, and others decided to \nkeep it silent. Sixty years later, we know much more about it largely \nthanks to a book that was written, by Allan Andrade.\n  Let me say thanks to Carmella LaSpada, who is the Executive Director \nof the White House Commission on Remembrance, for putting together a \nprogram yesterday that was extraordinarily moving. At that program, we \nheard from the survivors of the Leopoldville. They told us that the \nBelgium crew in most cases didn't speak English. When the ship was \ntorpedoed and began to sink, the Belgium crew got in the life boats, \nand by and large the young American soldiers were stranded on that \nship, and 763 of them died.\n  I was invited to be a speaker yesterday and to be at the Tomb of the \nUnknown Soldier as a part of the ceremony because my uncle, Allan \nDorgan, was one of the casualties that evening.\n  I have known a lot about this in recent years because there has been \na lot of investigation done.\n  I just wanted to say that yesterday was a very moving day with \ndiscussions and visits with those who survived this sinking, and also a \ntribute to the memory of those who perished in the sinking of the \nLeopoldville.\n  I hope America remembers that the young soldiers, 19, 20, 18, and 21 \nyears of age who died that night in the frigid waters of the English \nChannel did not die in vain. They were patriots.\n  There is an old saying that when the night is full of knives, the \nlightning is seen, and the drums are heard, the patriots are always \nthere ready to fight and die as necessary for their country. These 763 \npatriots died that evening, and the world didn't know it. But they know \nit now. Yesterday's ceremony was a tribute to their service to our \ngreat country.\n  I know we have a 5:15 vote. My colleague, I believe, wishes to speak. \nI wish to speak just for a moment about a trade issue. Might I ask my \ncolleague how much time he needs?\n  Mr. BURNS. I will only require about 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think as a courtesy to my colleague from \nMontana, I will not speak 5 or 6 minutes on trade. I will do that \ntomorrow because I think we have about 6 minutes before the vote.\n  But let me just say this in 1 minute.\n\n\n                                 Trade\n\n  My colleague from South Carolina has talked about trade. I just got \noff the telephone talking with some workers. They are concerned about \ntheir jobs going to China.\n  We just passed a bill in Congress that continues to provide \nincentives for businesses to move their jobs to China. I think job one \nfor us as we convene in a new Congress is to start deciding we need to \nstop the outsourcing of American manufacturing jobs. We especially \nought to decide that in the Tax Code of this country we ought not \nreward companies that move American jobs overseas. That is an outrage. \nThere is no one in Congress who ought to be voting for and supporting \nthe rewarding of companies that move their American jobs elsewhere.\n  I will come to the floor of the Senate tomorrow to talk more about \nwhat is happening with our manufacturing base that I think injures this \ncountry in an irrevocable way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank my colleague\n\n[[Page S11357]]\n\nfrom North Dakota for yielding. It will not take me long to make this \nstatement.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of S. 2987 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote now occurs \non the nomination.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \ncorrespondence from the Executive Office of the President be printed in \ntoday's Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, the United States \n           Trade Representative,\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2004.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     President Pro Tempore, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: In accordance with section 2104(a)(1) \n     of the Trade Act of 2002 (the Trade Act), and pursuant to \n     authority delegated to me by the President, I am pleased to \n     notify the Congress that the President intends to initiate \n     negotiations for a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United \n     Arab Emirates (UAE). We expect these negotiations to get \n     underway in the beginning of 2005, and we will be consulting \n     closely with the Congress over the next 90 days, as required \n     by the Trade Act.\n       An FTA with the UAE will promote the President's initiative \n     to advance economic reforms and openness in the Middle East \n     and the Persian Gulf, moving us closer to the creation of a \n     Middle East Free Trade Area. A U.S.-UAE agreement will build \n     on the FTAs that we already have with Israel, Jordan, and \n     Morocco, as well as the FTA that we recently have signed with \n     Bahrain, and will encourage the six members of the Gulf \n     Cooperation Council (GCC) to adopt standards that promote \n     trade and investment. In 2003, the UAE had $4.6 billion in \n     two-way trade with the United States, and the United States \n     had a $2.4 billion trade surplus with the UAE. The UAE is an \n     important strategic partner on a broad array of foreign and \n     national security issues.\n       This FTA will directly benefit the United States. By \n     reducing and eliminating barriers to trade, a comprehensive \n     FTA with the UAE will generate export opportunities for U.S. \n     companies, farmers, and ranchers, help create jobs in the \n     United States, and help American consumers save money while \n     offering them more choices. The UAE already provides an \n     attractive market for U.S. products, and is a regional \n     transportation and business hub in the Gulf and the Middle \n     East. The UAE's Jebel Ali port is the third busiest port in \n     the world, with excellent growth opportunities. In 2003, U.S. \n     businesses exported $3.5 billion worth of products in such \n     areas as machinery, aircraft, vehicles, electrical machinery, \n     and optical and medical instruments. Agriculture exports from \n     the United States totaled $259 million during the same \n     period. The United States' trade relationship with the UAE is \n     the third largest in the Middle East, behind only Israel and \n     Saudi Arabia.\n       An FTA will provide new export opportunities for U.S. \n     services firms in sectors such as telecommunications, \n     finance, distribution, energy, construction, engineering, \n     health care, legal services, accounting, tourism and travel, \n     and environmental services. An FTA will also support the \n     UAE's commitment to transparency, openness, and the rule of \n     law, thereby enhancing respect for intellectual property, \n     labor rights, and environmental protection. An FTA will also \n     allow the United States to work more closely with UAE customs \n     and port authorities that manage Jebel Ali and other \n     transshipment points, an important opportunity for \n     cooperation similar to that provided by our FTA with \n     Singapore and the agreement we are negotiating with \n     Panama.\n       Last year, the UAE entered into a Trade and Investment \n     Framework Agreement (TIFA) with the United States. Since \n     signing the TIFA, the UAE has demonstrated a serious \n     commitment to free trade. It has become a party to the World \n     Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty, \n     and has pledged to join the Information Technology Agreement \n     (ITA) and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.\n       Our initial consultations with the Congress, including with \n     the Congressional Oversight Group on September 8, 2004, \n     indicate broad bipartisan interest in an FTA with the UAE. \n     Following these consultations, I visited the UAE to discuss \n     with top officials the topics covered in our comprehensive \n     FTAs, to identify particular areas for work, and to assess \n     the UAE's commitment to moving forward with an FTA. I came \n     back with a strong sense of the UAE's interest in connecting \n     the FTA to their plans for development, growth and openness. \n     The UAE interest in an FTA also complements The 9/11 \n     Commission Report recommendation urging the United States to \n     expand trade with the Middle East as a way to ``encourage \n     development, more open societies, and opportunities for \n     people to improve the lives of their families.''\n       Through our FTAs in the Middle East, the United States is \n     supporting moderate Islamic countries led by modernizers who \n     are promoting openness and economic growth. Supporting \n     countries such as the UAE as they expand their trading and \n     investment relationships with the United States is a concrete \n     and mutually beneficial way for the American people to \n     enhance opportunity and hope in this critical region.\n       The Administration will continue to work closely with the \n     Congress, including through the consultation, notification, \n     and reporting procedures in the Trade Act. Moreover, to \n     ensure that interested stakeholders are informed and have \n     ample opportunity to provide their views, the Administration \n     will conduct the negotiations in a transparent and accessible \n     manner.\n       The specific objectives for negotiations with the UAE are \n     as follows:\n\n\n                             trade in goods\n\n       Seek to eliminate tariffs and other duties and charges on \n     trade between the UAE and\n\n[[Page S11358]]\n\n     the United States on the broadest possible basis, subject to \n     reasonable adjustment periods for import-sensitive products.\n       Seek to eliminate the UAE's non-tariff barriers to U.S. \n     exports.\n       Pursue fully reciprocal access to the UAE's market for U.S. \n     textile and apparel products.\n\n\n     Customs Matters, Rules of Origin, and Enforcement Cooperation\n\n       Seek rules to require that the UAE's customs operations are \n     conducted with transparency, efficiency, and predictability, \n     and that customs laws, regulations, decisions, and rulings \n     are not applied in a manner that would create unwarranted \n     procedural obstacles to international trade.\n       Seek rules of origin, procedures for applying these rules, \n     and provisions to address circumvention matters that will \n     ensure that preferential duty rates under an FTA with the UAE \n     apply only to goods eligible to receive such treatment, \n     without creating unnecessary obstacles to trade.\n       Seek terms for cooperative efforts with the UAE regarding \n     enforcement of customs and related issues, including trade in \n     textiles and apparel.\n\n\n               Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures\n\n       Seek to have the UAE affirm its WTO commitments on SPS \n     measures and eliminate any unjustified SPS restrictions.\n       Seek to ensure that the UAE's policies regarding \n     agricultural biotechnology products and food safety standards \n     are science-based and do not create unjustifiable barriers to \n     trade.\n       Seek to strengthen collaboration with the UAE on \n     implementing the WTO SPS Agreement and to enhance cooperation \n     with the UAE in relevant international bodies on developing \n     international SPS standards, guidelines, and recommendations.\n\n\n                   Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)\n\n       Seek to have the UAE reaffirm its WTO TBT commitments, \n     including those relating to labeling requirements on U.S. \n     food and agricultural products produced through \n     biotechnology, and help ensure that the UAE's technical \n     regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures \n     do not serve as an unnecessary impediment to trade.\n       Seek to strengthen collaboration with the UAE on \n     implementation of the WTO TBT Agreement, enhance regulatory \n     transparency, and create a procedure for exchanging \n     information with the UAE on TBT-related issues.\n\n\n                      Intellectual Property Rights\n\n       Seek to establish standards to be applied in the UAE that \n     build on the foundations established in the WTO Agreement on \n     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS \n     Agreement) and other international intellectual property \n     agreements, such as the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO \n     Performances and Phonograms Treaty.\n       Seek to have the UAE apply levels of protection and \n     practices in line with U.S. law and practices, including \n     appropriate flexibility, in areas such as trademark, \n     copyright, patent, and data protection and enforcement of \n     intellectual property rights.\n       Seek

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Emerson, \nIA native Spc. James C. Kearney, III, who lost his life when the \nmilitary vehicle he was traveling in was struck by a rocket-propelled \ngrenade and small arms fire near Sharan, Afghanistan. Spc. Kearney was \nassigned to the Iowa Army National Guard Company B, 1st Battalion, \n168th Infantry, Air Assault, based in Shenandoah, IA. Spc. Kearney \nenlisted as an infantryman in 1999 and was mobilized for Operation \nEnduring Freedom in March 2004. My prayers go out to James's mother and \nfather, Theresa and James Kearney, Jr., as well as his brothers and \nsister.\n  In paying tribute to Spc. Kearney, we recognize the efforts of an \nextraordinary young man who worked to make the world a safer place. The \nRev. Ken Gross, a friend of James, describes him as ``. . . a person of \ncharacter with great determination. He was adventurous, fearless and \nenjoyed taking risks.'' Spc. Kearney will always be remembered for the \ngood work that he did for his community and for his country. As a \nsoldier and patriot, Spc.\n\n[[Page S11359]]\n\nJames C. Kearney, III has given us a model of true dedication and \nvirtue.\n\n\n                      Specialist Raymond L. White\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Elwood, \nIN. Specialist Raymond L. White, 22 years old, died on November 12 \nduring an ambush in Baghdad, Iraq. Choosing not to hide within the \nsafety of the armored Humvee in which he was riding, Raymond returned \nfire. During this selfless attempt to protect other members of his \ncompany, Raymond was shot. With his entire life before him, Raymond \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A 2001 graduate of Frankton Junior-Senior High School, Raymond went \non to attend the New Mexico Military Institute for 2 years before \nfollowing a long-standing family tradition of joining the military. \nAccording to friends and loved ones, Raymond was pleased to follow in \nthe footsteps of his father, uncle and great-uncle. His mother Sharon \nrecalled to the Indianapolis Star a time when she asked Raymond why he \nwanted to go to Iraq. He responded simply, ``Well, Mom, it's my \npatriotic duty.''\n  Raymond was the thirty-sixth Hoosier soldier to be killed while \nserving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the \n1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. This brave young \nsoldier leaves behind his parents, Sharon and Henry White and his \nbrothers, Henry, Daniel and Jessie.\n  Today, I join Raymond's family, his friends and the entire Elwood \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nRaymond, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n  Raymond was known for his dedication to family and his love of \ncountry. When looking back on Raymond's life, family friend Don Cox \ntold the Indianapolis Star that ``He grew up to be a very fine young \nman.'' His father, Henry, recounted to the Indianapolis Star the \ndescription of Raymond's heroic efforts that he received from his \ncommander, highlighting the fact that his son had died in the same \nfashion in which he had lived. ``He always put others first,'' Henry \nsaid. Today and always, Raymond will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Raymond's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Raymond's actions will live on far longer \nthan any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Raymond L. White in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Raymond's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Raymond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11359-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FIRST LIEUTENANT EDWARD IWAN\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

First Lieutenant Iwan \nwas killed on November 12, 2004 in Fallujah, Iraq when a rocket-\npropelled grenade hit his Army vehicle. He was 28 years old.\n  First Lieutenant Iwan grew up on his family's farm in Albion and \nenlisted in the U.S. Army upon graduation from Albion High School in \n1994. After serving 3 years, he joined the Army Reserve Officers' \nTraining Corps at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln where he earned a \ndegree in criminal justice and received a commission in the U.S. Army. \nAt Lincoln, he was a leader in the ROTC program. First Lieutenant Iwan \nwas a platoon leader in the Army's 2nd Infantry Division who will be \nremembered as a loyal soldier who had a strong sense of duty, honor, \nand love of country. Thousands of brave Americans like 1LT Iwan are \ncurrently serving in Iraq.\n  Lieutenant Iwan is survived by his parents, Donna and Kenneth Iwan of \nAlbion and two sisters, Ginger and Kate. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith them at this difficult time. The United States of America is proud \nof Edward Iwan's service and mourns his loss.\n  For his service, bravery and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring 1LT Edward Iwan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11359-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11359-S11360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RETIREMENT OF SENATORS\n\n\n                          Senator John Edwards\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to Senator \nJohn Edwards and acknowledge his dedication to fighting for the middle \nclass.\n  Senator Edwards, the son of a mill worker, was the first in his \nfamily to go to college. He then went on to law school where he met his \nwife, Elizabeth. Following his graduation from law school, he earned a \nreputation as one of the best trial attorneys in the country, taking on \nthe causes of those who had suffered serious tragedies as a result of \nthe negligence or malfeasance of others.\n  Elected in 1998, Senator Edwards has served just one term in the \nSenate, but he made a mark in a number of areas. First and foremost, he \nwas a lead advocate for a Patients' Bill of Rights. From his background \nhelping families that had suffered injuries at the hands of our health \ncare system, Senator Edwards brought a passionate understanding of the \nneed to hold health insurance companies accountable when their \ndecisions led to serious injuries or death. More importantly, he \nchampioned changes in rules that would prevent these adverse outcomes \nin the first place. His dedication to this cause paid off in 2001, when \nthe Senate finally passed the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Senator Edwards also made a big contribution on education policy. He \nwas an early voice in favor of education reform, and worked to provide \nadditional resources to help local schools achieve higher standards. As \na co-chair of the Senate Rural Education Caucus, I saw first hand his \nwork to support funding to meet rural school needs like the Rural \nEducation Achievement Program and to make certain that the unique \nchallenges for rural schools in complying with the No Child Left Behind \nAct are recognized.\n  Senator Edwards also, of course, distinguished himself in running for \nPresident and serving as the Democratic nominee to be Vice President. \nHis concern about our country fracturing into ``Two Americas''--one \nwealthy and privileged, the other increasingly left behind--resonated \nwith millions of Americans.\n  Senator Edwards is leaving this body. But I am confident he will not \nturn his back on public service and look forward to his continued \ncontribution to our Nation's political debate. Working with the Senator \nfrom North Carolina has been a joy, and we wish him and his wife a \nhappy and health future.\n\n\n                          Senator don nickles\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to pay \ntribute to and acknowledge how much I will miss Senator Don Nickles in \nthe United States Senate.\n  Since joining the Senate in 1980, Senator Nickles has been a forceful \nadvocate for smaller and smarter government, while at the same time \ntenaciously fighting for the interests of the people of Oklahoma. In a \nbody filled largely with lawyers and career politicians, Senator \nNickles brought a small businessman's perspective to the legislative \ntable. Throughout his career he\n\n[[Page S11360]]\n\nspoke from personal experience about the need to relieve unnecessary \nburdens on our Nation's small businesses.\n  Personally, I have come to know Senator Nickles well from our joint \nservice on the Budget and Finance Committees. Although we were often on \nthe opposite side of policy debates, he was always a straight-shooter, \na gentleman, and a pleasure to work with. In areas where we disagreed, \nhe was a formidable and articulate advocate for his position. In areas \nwhere we agreed, he was a powerful and determined ally. I am proud to \nsay that, despite this era of too much partisan division, I consider \nSenator Nickles a good friend. His ability to maintain a civil and \nrespectful tone and demeanor in even the toughest policy disputes has \nexemplified the finest traditions of the Senate.\n  In his role as Budget Chairman, I am particularly grateful for the \ngraciousness and respect with which he treated me and my staff. His \nefforts to strengthen the Budget Committee and the budget process will \nbe an important part of his legacy in this body.\n  I have been honored to serve with Senator Don Nickles. I join my \ncolleagues in wishing the Senator and his family all the best in the \nfuture and in paying tribute to his tremendous contributions to the \nSenate and our Nation. We will miss him.\n\n\n                        SENATOR PETER FITZGERALD\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to Senator \nPeter Fitzgerald as he prepares to leave the United States Senate.\n  For the past 6 years, Senator Fitzgerald has done important work as a \nmember of the Agriculture Committee, on which we had the pleasure of \nserving together. Senator Fitzgerald supported the creation of a \ncommission to investigate changes to the Federal farm payment system. \nWe share the belief that small, family-owned farms should receive \nadequate assistance from the Federal Government, and the creation of \nthis commission has helped to ensure this goal.\n  I am also grateful for the support that Senator Fitzgerald has shown \nfor legislation I have introduced related to the tax treatment of \nleasehold improvements. He and I understand the need to modernize \nbusiness infrastructure by shortening the cost recovery period for \nchanges that commercial landlords make in space rented to tenants. By \nreducing the cost recovery period, the expense of making these \nimprovements would fall more into line with the economics of commercial \nlease transactions, and more building owners would be able to adapt \ntheir buildings to fit the needs of today's business tenants. I thank \nSenator Fitzgerald for his strong support of this important initiative.\n  Senator Fitzgerald also recognizes the importance of improving the \noverall health of Americans, and has shown this through the \nintroduction of his Healthy Lifestyles Act. Encouraging physical \nactivity is an essential component in the fight against obesity, and is \nan important tool in preventative health care. I commend Senator \nFitzgerald for his work in this area.\n  More generally, Senator Fitzgerald has proven himself to be a \ndedicated public servant who has served the State of Illinois and the \ncountry with honor. Today, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to \nSenator Fitzgerald and wish him well in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11360-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11360-S11363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO OHIO VETERANS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, on May 29, 2004--coinciding with the \ndedication of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, DC--\nWorld War II veterans, their families, and their friends gathered at \nthe Don Gentile American Legion Post 532 in Columbus, OH to honor their \ncomrades who fought bravely in World War II.\n  Fifty veterans attended the service where they were honored by a \ncrowd of more than 500. Guest speakers included Columbus Dispatch \ncolumnist Mike Hardin, Post 532 commander Ray Papp, and Isabella \nGentile Beitman, the Post namesake's widow. Memorabilia was displayed \nthroughout Post 532, area ROTC units paraded, and the Columbus Symphony \nOrchestra provided the music. Following the memorial garden dedication, \nmilitary planes conducted a fly-by. Additionally, each veteran received \na framed certificate with the Memorial picture and an angel pin, \nsignifying how our veterans are truly guardian angels.\n  The Post 532 members' hard work made this service possible, and I \nwould like to personally thank auxiliary secretary, Gladys Caudill, who \nregistered more than 300 World War II veterans for their inclusion in \nthe National Registry. These efforts and the dedication ceremony are \nfitting reminders of the sacrifices these brave men and women made for \nour freedom--sacrifices that have shaped all of our lives, our \nchildren's lives, and the lives of our grandchildren. I thank them for \nall they have done for us so that we may continue to enjoy Life, \nLiberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness--all because of their efforts \nsome 60 years ago.\n  I would like to honor the members of Post 532 by printing their names \nin the Record. They selflessly fought for our Nation in World War II, I \nremember them and honor them at this time.\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Members of Post 532           Branch               Hometown\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAcocella, Guydon............

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and \nrecognize our Nation's veterans. Too often, the sacrifices of our \nNation's brave men and women of the Armed Forces go unnoticed and \nunderappreciated. I wish to take a moment now to share a recent \nexperience I had with some of New Jersey's Vietnam Veterans.\n  On November 11, 2004, I was honored to participate in a Veterans' Day \nCeremony hosted by the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in \nHolmdel, New Jersey. At this ceremony, I was touched by the words of \nMajor Frank M. McDonough, Esq., a retired member of the United States \nMarine Corps. Major McDonough has written a moving piece about what it \nmeans to be a veteran.\n  Mr. President, in honor of the sacrifice of our Nation's veterans, I \nask unanimous consent that Major McDonough's written statement be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           November 11, 2004\n\n (By Frank M. McDonough, Esq. Major, United States Marine Corps, Ret.)\n\n       The Marine CH-46 helicopter swept high and wide over the \n     clouds of smoke, shrapnel, and exploding shells.\n       Mayhem spewed from the burning ammunition dump. It had been \n     struck the night before by a rocket launched by some of the \n     40,000 enemy troops surrounding the miserably exposed plateau \n     encampment.\n       As the Crew Chief shouted debarkation instructions over the \n     din of the rotors, the Marines craned around in their canvas \n     benches to see the mile-long, half-mile wide combat base \n     below, through the glassless chopper windows. For most it \n     would be their first combat experience. For the 26-year-old \n     Lieutenant this was neither his first nor his last trip ``in-\n     country,'' but it would be the longest 77 days of his life.\n       Suddenly the helicopter dropped like a stone toward the \n     airstrip and the Crew Chief was screaming, ``Get out! Get \n     out!'' as the Marines grabbed packs and seabags and rushed to \n     the lowered ramp in the rear of the rapidly descending bird.\n       They tumbled out, ass over teakeatle, several feet in the \n     air, as the aircraft started to roll and rise, never actually \n     having touched the ground.\n       As instructed, the passengers rushed to the waiting \n     drainage ditch at the edge of the metallic runway. Mortars \n     and rockets struck all around; and the din was so great that \n     they never heard the safe departure of the big dirty green \n     bird that had just deposited them in the middle of no man's \n     land.\n       Nor did they care; for this was run for life.\n       The Lieutenant streaked across the landing strip as fast as \n     his legs would move, carrying the 80 pound seabag behind him \n     a protection against the flying shards of aluminum runway \n     matting mixed with shrapnel, dirt and other debris . . . but \n     ready to abandon if necessary.\n       The dense clouds of smoke and loud clanging sounds which \n     deadened his ears and shrouded his movement could not protect \n     him from the flying death around him.\n       But in seconds he was in the trench, on his face, in the \n     dusty red clay that he would live in, bathe in, eat in, sleep \n     in, and wear for many weeks to come.\n       The crump, crump, crump of the deadly explosives slowly \n     subsided with the disappearance of the chopper behind the \n     hills.\n       Soon, there was absolute silence.\n       Navy Medical Corpsmen from Charlie Med, the makeshift \n     hospital across the road . . . conveniently located next to \n     the equally makeshift mortuary . . . started working their \n     way along the trench . . . backs and shoulders bent . . . \n     bodies crouched to avoid enemy snipers . . . making sure that \n     everyone was okay.\n       The Lieutenant checked his moving parts. They seemed to be \n     all there. Even his seabag made it unscathed. Then he looked \n     up for the first time since hitting the ground at Khe Sahn.\n       Directly in front of him was a large sign. In scarlet and \n     gold . . . the Marine Corps' colors . . . a sign which \n     pointed him to his destination.\n       ``1st Battalion, 13th Marines, Turn Right and Run like \n     Hell.''\n       It was combat humor at its best.\n       According to military records, since 1775, 2 million men \n     and women have given their lives for our country; men and \n     women of all colors, religions, and beliefs. They wore many \n     uniforms over the decades: some blue, some red, some gray . . \n     . some green, white, khaki; and some of the various colors of \n     camouflage.\n       Some had no uniforms but fought anyway; and some performed \n     their service behind the enemy's lines in the clothing of the \n     day, hopeful that they would be protected by their anonymity.\n       Some were farmers; some city kids. Some had never seen a \n     pair of boots before they joined; others like me signed up \n     with long hair, motorcycle boots and way too much attitude.\n       They were young, old, married and single. They were poor; \n     and they were rich. Most were free; some were freed slaves. \n     Some were paid to serve in the place of others. Some \n     volunteered and some were conscripts.\n       Shanghaied, they would tell you.\n       There were summer soldiers who left in fall to harvest \n     their crops. Others served for a fixed number of years; and \n     there were many who served their entire lives. There were too \n     many whose entire lives were not very entire.\n       When they were in, they spent much of their time \n     complaining; but when they got out they spend much of their \n     time bragging . . . about where they went and who they went \n     with . . . although not very often about what they did.\n       In fact, in the Marine Corps we used to say that a Marine \n     wasn't happy unless he was bitching; and most couldn't wait \n     until they\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\n     got out. Yet check out all the proud United States Marine \n     Corps decals on the cars traveling along the Garden State \n     Parkway.\n       One thing they shared. No matter what their origins or \n     their social status, there was no telling them apart in the \n     trenches of France, the frozen fields of Pennsylvania, the \n     steamy islands of the Pacific, the bloody battlefields of \n     Spotsylvania, the deadly skies over Korea, the tropical scrub \n     of San Juan hill, or the boiling waters of the South China \n     Sea.\n       They were one.\n       Some were recognized for their heroism.\n       In the beginning by receiving an award called the Badge of \n     Military Merit, created by our first Commander-in-Chief.\n       In 1932, that badge became known as the Purple Heart. It \n     eventually was emblazoned with George's image and restricted \n     to those who shed their blood in the service of their \n     country.\n       Tens of thousands of Purple Hearts have been awarded for \n     wounds received in battle. Too many thousands never lived to \n     see theirs; and would happily have done without.\n       And there is another award that goes back to the early \n     years. Presented since the Civil war, it is called the Medal \n     of Honor. There have been 3,459 of those medals presented for \n     3,454 separate heroic actions.\n       The earliest Medal of Honor was presented for an action \n     against Native-Americans in 1861. Ironically, since 1861, 22 \n     Native-Americans have received the Medal for their own \n     valorous actions in defense of a country that once seemingly \n     sought to exterminate them.\n       I have known many who were awarded the first medal, and \n     four who were awarded the second.\n       Despite their heroism and suffering . . . or perhaps \n     because of it . . . I really don't know . . . they seemed no \n     different than the thousand others I served with, and the \n     many thousands more that we have all heard or read about.\n       They all served their country . . . in good times and bad . \n     . . in peacetime and in war . . . with valor and distinction.\n       At Valley Forge, they wrapped rags around their frozen feet \n     then marched to take Trenton; 175 years later they wrapped \n     rags around their frozen feet then fought their way out of \n     the Chosin Reservoir.\n       In 1805 they marched across 600 miles of burning desert to \n     destroy the Barbary Pirates at Tripoli; 178 years later, not \n     that far from Tripoli, they died in a barracks in Beirut.\n       Still they would not be deterred. And only a few years \n     later, they freed one European people from a tyrannical \n     butcher; and a Middle Eastern country from a demented \n     invader.\n       But in Yemen they simply made a goodwill port call and 17 \n     paid the ultimate price.\n       And in Somalia they tried to help a starving people they \n     didn't even know . . . and had probably never heard of; and \n     they paid yet again.\n       They jumped out of airplanes into the dead of night at Ste. \n     Mere-Eglise; and a few miles away they scaled the deadly \n     cliffs of Normandy with the bodies of their buddies drifting \n     in the surf below.\n       At Midway, they brought a thousand year old Empire to the \n     beginning of its end.\n       In 1865, a women cut off her hair, donned a soldier's \n     uniform, and fought alongside her compatriots as a man. She \n     was simply following the example of an earlier heroine who \n     joined the battlefield right here in Monmouth County. More \n     than 1.7 million women have served in the military since.\n       Some nursed our fighters in the jungles, in the freezing \n     cold, and aboard ships under kamikaze attack. And not only do \n     they still serve in tents, bomb craters, and blown out \n     buildings around the world; but they now command units in \n     Iraq and fly choppers in Afghanistan.\n       Some military personnel carry no weapons and wear no \n     scrubs, but use a bible, the Torah or the Quran, to minister \n     to their fellow soldiers. One from Staten Island earned the \n     Medal of Honor of his heroic Chaplain's service.\n       And let's not forget the 6,000 Merchant Marines and their \n     700 ships lost during World War II.\n       In five years, my immigrant family from Scotland and \n     Ireland sent seven men and women off to fight for their \n     adopted country. It is something we as a people do. We rarely \n     question why. We just do.\n       Now, one of my sons is in a place called Fallujah, while \n     his brother launches fighter jets from the Abraham Lincoln \n     somewhere in the Pacific.\n       I would never ask them to do this. I certainly didn't even \n     encourage them. It is the only thing in my entire life that \n     has ever brought me fear! But is their chosen destiny; and \n     like all others before them, they just do.\n       In just my lifetime, I can think of a number of heroes who \n     could have avoided serving, or flown a desk in the rear, but \n     chose not to. One was the son of a legendary Marine General \n     who had earned five Navy Crosses in combat. The younger \n     Marine came home a double amputee, his life so shattered that \n     he ultimately died by his own hand.\n       One was a famous baseball player who left his team not \n     once, but twice, to fight for his country in not one, but two \n     wars. And he came back to his beloved Red Sox to finish his \n     career.\n       One was the son of the future Chief of Naval Operations, \n     the highest rank in the Navy. He probably could have gotten \n     any job he wanted, but he went into combat anyway; and came \n     back to die of Agent Orange.\n       Another was the son and grandson of two Naval Heroes, but \n     he spent 8 years in the Hanoi Hilton.\n       And then, of course, there was the son of the former \n     Ambassador to Great Britain. He didn't have to go either, but \n     he chose to be a PT boat skipper; and spent the rest of his \n     too-short life in excruciating pain.\n       They all could have found a way out, but didn't. Not even \n     the young Marine Lance Corporal I met in I Corps who had a \n     Columbia medical degree in his resume, but he chose to fight \n     his war, at the front, on the ground, as a grunt.\n       Like that young Lance Corporal, they had a belief in \n     themselves, in their creed, in their country, and many times \n     . . . more often than not . . . in their cause.\n       If nothing else, they learned to believe in their fellow \n     soldiers and to serve them . . . to the death if necessary.\n       Today, we celebrate all veterans, those alive and among us, \n     those who have gone on to their reward, and those still \n     serving.\n       It matters not whether in peace or in war. If in war, it \n     matters not what the outcome. It is the man and the woman \n     that we honor.\n       We can do no less than one man . . . not of this country . \n     . . did in honoring that legacy.\n       He was a 30 year old Vietnamese Squad Leader. A member of \n     the 320th Division of the People's Army of Vietnam during one \n     of the most trying periods in a ten-year war, the hallowed \n     memory of which surrounds us here today in this poignant \n     Vietnam Veteran's Memorial.\n       He was the enemy!\n       After the war he went back to farming. But then, in 1996, \n     at the age of 58, he walked into the US Army POW/MIA office \n     in Hanoi to tell his story.\n       While serving North Vietnam in uniform in 1968, he found \n     the body of a dead American Marine. He buried it in a bomb \n     crater. But he never forgot.\n       So he lead the MIA team to the remains, which were then \n     recovered and returned to the Marine's home community just \n     two months ago, some 30 years after the fall of Saigon.\n       Now I can tell you from personal experience that the spring \n     of 1968 was one of worst periods in the war.\n       Yet this soldier took the time to bury his enemy.

Mr. President, I come to the floor in support of the \nMentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. On October 11, \n2004, the Senate passed this bill and on October 30, 2004, President \nBush signed it into law. I am very pleased that this law is now on the \nbooks because it will help address a serious problem that I have talked \nabout before on several occasions.\n  Each year, more than 700,000 individuals with serious mental illness \nare booked into our Nation's jails. A recent Justice Department study \nrevealed that 16 percent of all inmates in America's state prisons and \nlocal jails today are mentally ill. This has created one of the biggest \nchallenges facing our front-line police officers, judges, prosecutors, \nand corrections officers and has left mentally ill inmates caught in a \ndestructive cycle.\n  As a former prosecuting attorney, I know about the helplessness that \nlaw enforcement officers feel when they have no other option than to \narrest and incarcerate a person with mental illness who has committed a \nnon-violent crime. I have seen the cycle of a non-violent, mentally ill \noffender who is arrested repeatedly and put into the system \nrepeatedly--never being treated for his illness and, as a result, \nbecoming more and more ill. I also have shared the frustration of \njudges who repeatedly sentence these low-level offenders, knowing that, \nwithout connection to needed services, they will just end up right back \nin the courtroom.\n  Despite the complexity of these issues, recent initiatives \ndemonstrate that we can increase public safety and reduce the numbers \nof mentally ill people trapped in the criminal justice system. We know \nthat if given appropriate care early, the special needs of the mentally \nill can be addressed to avoid a growing problem that increases the \nlikelihood of repeat offenses. Four years ago, Senator Pete Domenici, \nRepresentative Ted Strickland, and I authored America's Law Enforcement \nand Mental Health Act. As a consequence of this law, the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice made available to 37 jurisdictions $7 million in \nfunding and technical assistance for mental health courts. These courts \nare staffed by a core group of specialized professionals, including a \ndedicated judge, prosecutor, and public defender, who deal with mental \nillness cases and a court liaison to the mental health services \ncommunity. While still early in their implementation, mental health \ncourts have shown promising results. Mentally ill persons who choose to \nhave their cases heard in a mental health court often do so because \nthat is the first real opportunity that many have had to seek \ntreatment.\n  Last year, Senator Leahy, Senator Domenici, Representative Strickland \nand I introduced the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime \nReduction Act. Our bill authorizes a grant program to help states and \ncounties design\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\nand implement collaborative efforts between their criminal justice and \nmental health systems. This would allow, for example, a State \ncorrections department to partner with the mental health system to \nensure that people with mental illness released from prison are \nprovided medications and connected to community-based service \nproviders. It also could provide for programs to train local law \nenforcement on responding to individuals with mental illness. These \nprograms would be proposed and controlled by the local and State \nofficials most knowledgeable about the needs of their communities.\n  Since its inception, our Nation has stood on the foundations of \ncompassion and justice. These programs envisioned by this bill are a \nwonderful embodiment of both ideals and have earned a broad coalition \nof support from law enforcement, mental health advocates, state \nofficials and private groups, including the Council of State \nGovernments, the National Sheriffs' Association, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, and the American Correctional Association. With this \nbill, we move closer to both addressing the needs of the mentally ill \nand easing the burden upon our police and correctional workers. It will \nmake a real difference, and I thank my colleagues--especially Ranking \nMember Leahy, Senator Grassley, Senator Durbin, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Cantwell, Chairman Hatch, and Senator Murray for their support. \nI would also like to thank Congressman Strickland and Chairman \nSensenbrenner for championing this issue on the House side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11366-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF VEE BURKE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a tribute to Vee \nBurke, specialist in income maintenance, Domestic Social Policy \nDivision, a dedicated and gifted employee at the Congressional Research \nService, who will be retiring from CRS at the end of this month.\n  Mrs. Burke is a graduate of the University of Chicago. She has four \ngrown children and is the widow of Vincent Burke with whom she wrote \nNixon's Good Deed, a book about Nixon's welfare reform proposals.\n  When Mrs. Burke joined CRS more than 30 years ago, she was already a \nrecognized expert in the field of public welfare. During her tenure at \nCRS, she became a leading expert on the history, evolution and \ninteraction of welfare and public assistance programs for low-income \nindividuals and families.\n  Because of her stature as one of the leading authorities in the \ncountry in this policy area, Mrs. Burke's advice and assistance has \noften been required by the Congress. Over three decades, Mrs. Burke has \ncontributed to major congressional deliberations affecting AFDC and \nrelated public assistance programs, including the sweeping welfare \nreforms enacted in 1996 that replaced AFDC with TANF.\n  During the consideration of the reauthorization of the 1996 welfare \nreform legislation in both the 107th and the 108th Congress, Mrs. Burke \nprovided invaluable assistance to the Senate Finance Committee. In the \n108th Congress, Mrs. Burke was especially helpful to myself, as \nChairman of the Senate Finance Committee and to my staff. She assisted \nin the drafting of the committee mark and legislation, providing \ntechnical assistance as well as continuously analyzing state data. \nBecause of her vast knowledge, Mrs. Burke also functioned as an \nimpromptu tutor to Senate Finance Committee staff on this history of \nwelfare.\n  The work of the Congress is detailed and complex--in order to do our \nwork members and our staffs need to be well versed in policy in order \nfor us to make the best decisions. For this expertise, we often rely on \nthe analysis of the Congressional Research Service. CRS provides a \nunique service to the Congress in that they are truly nonpartisan. The \nspecialists from CRS provide non-biased, research based analysis that \nhelps guide us, as policymakers, to make the best decisions.\n  Mrs. Burke, throughout her long and admirable career, has embodied \nthe very best of what CRS provides for the Congress. Those of us who \ncare deeply about programs affecting the poor thank her for her \nefforts, will miss her and wish her well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11366-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF SHARON HICKEY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep gratitude and \nbest wishes to a dedicated and long-serving member of my Washington \nstaff, Sharon ``Sherry'' Hickey, who has worked on Capitol Hill for \nnearly 31 years and who is retiring from the U.S. Senate on December 3, \n2004.\n  Sherry has been a member of my Senate family since I was first \nelected to this office in January 1989. She has many talents, ``wears \nmany hats,'' is always willing to lend a hand or offer guidance, and \nher contributions to the work of this office, particularly in the area \nof constituent outreach, have been invaluable. She began in my office \nas assistant to the chief of staff and military caseworker. As \ncaseworker, she most clearly demonstrated her compassion and empathy \nfor others. Sherry assisted many grateful soldiers and their families \nin my home State of Connecticut, including during the first Gulf War, \nby intently listening to their concerns and successfully resolving the \nvariety of problems they faced to the fullest extent possible.\n  Sherry is also a gifted and eloquent writer. As my personal/\nlegislative correspondent, she has researched and drafted responses for \nliterally thousands of constituent communications on important issues \nbefore Congress, as well as requests for tribute, congratulatory, and \nrecommendation letters that I have received over the years. With her \nexpressive, articulate, and intuitive communication skills, Sherry has \na knack for preparing responses to each of them in the informative, yet \npersonalized, style that I prefer.\n  Prior to the good fortune that brought her to my office, Sherry first \nbegan her Hill career when she was hired by Representative John Melcher \n(D-MT) in December 1973. Following his election to the Senate in 1976, \nSherry remained on his staff as a personal assistant and consumer \naffairs caseworker until he left office in 1988. Previously, she served \nas secretary to the Assistant Director of the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury's Bureau of the Mint from 1967-1971.\n  Some may find it surprising to learn that, among her many hidden \nabilities, Sherry is a talented artist. Perhaps her retirement will \nafford her more time to pursue this interest. Still, what has always \nbeen most important to Sherry is her family. She met her husband Peter \nwhile she was a member of Senator Melcher's staff; and their son, \nBrian, of whom they are both enormously proud, spent 2 years as a \ntoddler at the Senate Employees Child Care Center. Sherry often brought \nBrian to the office for a visit, so it is hard for me to believe that \nhe has since achieved the Boy Scout rank of Eagle Scout and is now a \nsecond-year student at the University of Virginia! For her own part, \nafter spending precious time devoted to raising her son and guiding him \nalong the path toward adulthood, Sherry applied her energies after \nwork, and, with her usual determination, completed her Associate in \nScience degree from Northern Virginia Community College earlier this \nyear.\n  Sherry has had and exemplary career and fully understands the value \nof a public service commitment to help others. She has always had a \nspecial caring touch in reaching out to the constituents we serve and \ngetting them the help they need and deserve. She has provided a guiding \nhand and has been a resource and support to so many members of my \nstaff. Sherry has what some may call an ``old-fashioned'' work ethic, \nbut it is one based on immense pride and satisfaction in a job well \ndone.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nCalvert Alliance Against Substance Abuse, Inc., CAASA, a grassroots \norganization that has been dedicated to fighting alcohol and drug abuse \nin Calvert County since 1989.\n  Since its inception fifteen years ago, CAASA has been working hard to \nestablish a healthy, drug-free environment for the entire community. \nThis grassroots organization meets the people where they are. CAASA \nencourages citizens to take an active role in preventing substance \nabuse through public awareness, education, treatment and law \nenforcement. Its programs benefit students in the classroom, families \nat home and individuals in the workplace.\n  CAASA has consistently supported the expansion of school-based \nsubstance abuse prevention activities and programs to help abusers and \ntheir families achieve a drug-free lifestyle. It has also assisted \nbusinesses in promoting an alcohol and drug-free workplace. I believe \nthat the best ideas come from the people. CAASA does just that--it \nawards grants to members of the community who approach them with new \nideas. By working together with the people, CAASA is helping to \nstrengthen our communities and fight the drug war right here in \nMaryland.\n  Many of the programs that CAASA has sponsored have benefitted the \nyouth of Calvert County, such as Project Graduation. Project Graduation \nis a drug-free and alcohol-free all night celebration for the \ngraduating seniors from Calvert County's public high schools. Since the \ninception of this program, there have not been any drug or alcohol \nrelated motor vehicle incidents involving members of Calvert County's \ngraduating classes on graduation night.\n  This group has proven to be a critical part of our Nation's war on \ndrugs by working locally in communities in Maryland. For this we owe \nthem our graduate. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me today in \nrecognizing the Calvert Alliance Against Substance Abuse, Inc. for \nshowing the community how to ``choose life . . . not drugs.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11367-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11367-S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JOHN ``RODDY'' SUNCHILD\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I want to recognize a truly \ngreat citizen, a great tribal leader and a miltary hero, John ``Roddy'' \nSunchild. The Rocky Boy Tribe of North Central Montana, the State of \nMontana and the United States of America have lost an outstanding \nleader, citizen and soldier. And for those of us who had the privilege \nof knowing him, his family and colleagues, we have lost a great father, \ngrandfather, husband and friend.\n  John ``Roddy'' Eagle Sunchild, Sr. an enrolled member of the Chippewa \nCree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation was born June 30th, \n1930, the grandson of Sunchild, an early leader of the Cree people. He \nattended schools on the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation in Montana in \nhis youth.\n  Roddy was a quiet, unassuming man. At the same time, he was a fierce \nadvocate for his community and his people and a courageous warrior/\nsoldier for his country. He possessed a gentle, understated sense of \nhumor that put people at ease and, at the same time, made points more \neloquently than long-winded speeches.\n  At age 17, Roddy enlisted in the U.S. Airborne Paratroopers and was \nimmediately assigned to a tour in Korea. It was during his time with \nthe 4th Airborne Ranger Company that he distinguished himself as one of \nthe most honored members of the 187th Regimental Combat Team. Roddy \nreceived citations which included the Master Parachutist Badge, \nAirborne Glider Badge, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with Double \nValor, the Purple Heart, the U.S. Good Conduct Medal, Korean Campaign \nMedal, the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation, the French Fourragere, and \nMaster Sergeant. The highest level he attained in the military was an \nE7.\n  Roddy and his wife Florence, a retired teacher for the Rocky Boy \nElementary School system, have four children, nine grandchildren, and \none great grandchild.\n  In 1984, he was elected to the Tribal Business Committee, where he \nadvocated for tribal education opportunities for his people, along with \nbetter health services. His leadership, while serving as Chairman for \nthe Stone Child College Board of Directors, was the primary catalyst \nfor the college in achieving full accreditation. He initiated various \nwellness programs for the Chippewa Cree Tribe and sought opportunities \nfor individual improvement though health, education, and a stronger \ntribal government.\n  In 1992, Roddy was elected Tribal Chairman and during his tenure the \nChippewa Cree Tribe sought, and was awarded, a Self-governance Compact \nfrom the U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA. \nRoddy was a staunch proponent for Tribal Higher Education and for \nimproved Health Care for his people. Roddy was very well known \nthroughout the United States and Canada for his active involvement in \nthe well being and improvement of Indian Country.\n  Over the past several years, Roddy founded and served as the Chief \nExecutive Officer for the National Tribal Development Association, \nNTDA, which administers federal grants and cooperative agreements to \nenhance the governance and economies of Indian Reservations. The NTDA \nalso works to promote inter-tribal trade and commerce and create \nprograms that serve as a hand up, rather than a hand-out.\n  Roddy exemplified what could be construed as a true modern warrior. \nHe was able to advocate and promote modern ways in order to ensure that \nNatives could compete in today's world. While doing this he still held \non to and practiced his true traditional and cultural ways. He was one \nof our Sundance leaders, and had earned the right to practice various \nother cultural ceremonies. His presence played an integral part in most \ncultural ceremonies held on the Rocky Boy's Reservation.\n  Family was of particular importance to Roddy. What Roddy enjoyed most \nwas being at home with his family. He especially enjoyed his many \ngrandchildren. Roddy was an active member of numerous Native American \norganizations and associations and was a great advocate for Native \nAmerican Veterans, especially on the Rocky Boy.\n  Roddy not only set an example for others to follow, he set about his \nlife's\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\nwork with the sole purpose of helping others to reach their full \npotential. At the core of his being was his deep commitment and love \nfor his people, the Chippewa Cree. Through them, his legacy continues.\n  As a great leader, Roddy personified the meaning of commitment, \nvision and honor. His people, Indian Country, the United States of \nAmerica and the world are better for having been witness to his life on \nearth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11368-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BENJAMIN CARSON\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today it is my privilege to honor an \nOregon Veteran Hero. On December 12, 1941, 18-year-old Benjamin Carson \nleft his family dairy farm in rural Minnesota to join the United States \nMarine Corps. He would join a long family legacy of military service. \nCarson's grandfather's grandfather was in the Revolutionary War, his \ngreat grandfather served in the Civil War, his dad fought in World War \nI, and he would soon fight in World War II. Though all were wounded in \nbattle, none of them died as a result of their service.\n  After arriving in San Diego at the U.S. Marine recruit depot, Carson \nbegan a strict training regimen. A month later, he graduated from \nrecruit school and volunteered to go to war immediately. Carson was \ninterviewed by James Roosevelt's son who asked him four questions--what \nhe did for a living, whether he could swim, whether he could march 30 \nmiles a day on a cup of rice, and how often did he go to Sunday School. \nCarson must have given the correct answers because 4 days later he was \nselected for duty.\n  Carson left that day with members of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion \ncommanded by Colonel Carlson, known today as ``Carlson's Raiders.'' \nCarson was selected for a special unit because of his strong swimming \nskills. On August 8, 1942, Carson joined more than 200 men on \nsubmarines headed for the Makin Islands. Their objective was to destroy \nenemy installations, gather information, and divert Japanese attention \nfrom the Solomons.\n  Fighting broke out nearly immediately as Carlson's men landed ashore \non August 17, 1942. About 30 men were lost and another 16 wounded. \nUnder fierce opposition, Colonel Carlson made a decision to withdraw \nback to the original landing site and launched his boats for a return \nto sea. However, since morning the surf had kicked up considerably, and \nwith their outboard motors repeatedly swamped, relatively few of the \nboats could make it out through the breakers. Many capsized, and most \nof the marines were cast back onto the beach. Carson was one of the few \nthat survived.\n  In November of 1942, Carson was sent to Guadacanal. He was overseas \nfighting in various battles until January of 1944, when he was sent \nhome for a 30-day furlough at which time he met his future wife. He \nmarried Helen on May 5, 1944, and two days later shipped out to battle \nagain.\n  On February 19, 1945, Carson was a squad leader in the 5th wave to \nhit Red Beach in Guadacanal. The fighting was intense and men were \ndropping quickly. With only nine of his men left, Carson was shot in \nthe arm. He spent 5 weeks in a hospital base on Pearl Harbor and \nreceived the Purple Heart for his injuries. He was discharged on \nJanuary 6, 1946 after the war had ended.\n  Carson went to college on the GI Bill and received a degree in \nForestry from Iowa State College. He went on to work for the Forest \nService and maintained an active lifestyle with his wife and two sons. \nEventually the couple moved to Oregon, where they have lived since \n1978.\n  Carson says his military experience has very much shaped his life. \nHis sense of duty to his country and the people who have died in the \nname of freedom has never left him. Nearly 60 years after the famous \nbattle on Makin Island, Carson participated in a campaign to recover \nthe dead. In 2001, authorities located 19 bodies on Makin Island, all \nAmerican servicemen. Carson says it was extremely gratifying to be able \nto offer some closure for the families of the deceased.\n  Though he has an artificial shoulder from the injuries he suffered \nwhile shot in battle, Carson still travels and works on his farm. He \nand his wife volunteer with the Mercy Corps and recently traveled to \nUzbekistan, where they helped teach Uzbeks about agriculture.\n  For his selfless service to others, and to the United States in times \nof war, I salute Benjamin Carson as an Oregon Veteran Hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11368-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NEW JERSEY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndecade of economic development and social service leadership provided \nto my State by the New Jersey Community Development Corporation. \nNJCDC's success has been widely and deservedly acknowledged.

The results of \nthis partnership are notable: an AmeriCorps project enlisting \nvolunteers as mentors to at-risk youth and support companions for the \nfrail elderly; community economic development and restoration efforts \nincluding the refurbishing of Paterson's historic raceway system and \nits Great Falls Historic District; the establishment of a \ntransportation opportunities center to provide job training and jobs \nfor a disadvantaged population; building and operating housing for \nhomeless youth and the homeless mentally ill population; community \nresidences and day programs to help developmentally disabled adults \nlead independent lives; educational initiatives including an \nalternative academy high school for inner-city students and a \nYouthBuild program; and one of my own priorities, financial literacy \nprograms leading to economic security for inner-city and senior \npopulations.\n  All of this in the relatively short span of 10 years.\n  I am pleased to enter this tribute into the Congressional Record, \nwith every expectation for NJCDC's continued achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11368-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11368-S11369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEL SHELTON, EDUCATOR AND INSPIRATION TO MANY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an Idahoan \nof exceptional talent. Many possess remarkable talents, but this \nindividual stands out because he has used his gifts to enrich the lives \nof others, educate young people, inspire creativity and provide beauty \nand drama that resides in the music of the heart. Mel Shelton, former \nBoise High School Band Director, Bose State University, BSU, Director \nof Bands and Professor of Music Education, member of the Boise \nPhilharmonic, conductor and soloist with the Boise Municipal Band, \nfounder and conductor of the Treasure Valley Concert Band, retired \nProfessor Emeritus, Director of Bands from BSU, and internationally \nrecognized composer has proven to be an exemplary artist, passionate \nand driven educator and dedicated citizen.\n  Mel has pushed countless students to reach out to the furthest \nboundaries of their talent and energy. He has exposed young musicians \nto new places and foreign countries, providing them with experiences \nthat they will be able to draw artistic inspiration from for the rest \nof their lives. His incredible orchestral and band compositions are \ninterpretations of profound life experiences. His exposure to and \nfriendship with students from the Basque community in Boise, \nincidentally the largest such community in the nation, inspired him to \ncompose the first Basque music specifically published for concert band \nmedia. Some of the most rugged peaks of Idaho, the Grand Tetons, were \nthe inspiration for a piece by the same name. Mel also composed a work \nin honor of fallen wildland firefighters recently entitled ``Requiem \nfor Wildfire Heroes.'' These and many other of Mel's works have been on \n``Required Lists'' for contests and festivals throughout the country, \nand he has been the well-deserved recipient of\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\nmany distinguished local, State, and international awards.\n  Mel says, ``Music is a picture painted on a background of silence. It \nis unique in that it allows our brain to see with our ears and hear \nwith our hearts.'' Mel Shelton transforms the mystery and passion of \nIdaho and its citizens from the transcendent to the realm of the \ndiscernable, unlocking our ability to appreciate Idaho's heritage and \nbeauty. I commend him on his lifelong dedication to music, to Idaho's \nchildren, and remarkable accomplishments as a master in his \nfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11369-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INDIANA SERVICE LEADERS SUMMIT\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to tell you about the \nextraordinary young Hoosiers I recently had the privilege to meet. Last \nmonth, I hosted my second annual Service Leaders Summit to honor high \nschool students from across Indiana for their service and dedication to \ntheir communities and hopefully to inspire them to continue serving \nthroughout their lives.\n  The young men and women I met last month have answered the call to \nservice. Some of them have helped build homes, some tutored and \nmentored younger students, and others have raised money to support \ncancer research and to feed the hungry. Several of the young men and \nwomen started service clubs on their own to address the problems in \ntheir schools and communities. Each one of the students I met spent \nhours making a difference in their hometowns and together they have \nimpacted the lives of thousands of Hoosiers.\n  The student leaders heard from Hoosiers of all backgrounds who have \nchosen to dedicate their lives to serving others. The speakers focused \non the different aspects that make up a successful service project: \ninspiration, organization, dedication, evaluation and reflection. \nFollowing the speeches, the students and I prepared care packages to \nsend to Hoosier troops serving in Iraq. Later, the students planted \nnearly 170 trees at a local park. Through their work together, these \nstudent leaders were able to experience the dramatic results from the \npower of service.\n  Robert F. Kennedy once said that ``Some men see things as they are \nand say `Why?' I dream of things that never were and say, `Why not?' '' \nEach one of these young men and women have already asked themselves \n``why not?'' and have worked to make positive changes in their \ncommunities. They represent a new generation of promise with the \npotential to make a real difference across Indiana and the Nation.\n  I would like to thank each one of the following individuals for \nparticipating in the summit and for their service to their communities: \nJennifer Ahoni, Kayla Ambers, Ashley Amerman, Carrie Anderson, Emily \nBacker, Kristy Backfish, Robin Baker, Shayla Bearman, Jennifer Behzadi, \nWilliam Bennett, Hannah Bessinger, Natalie Binkholder, Joseph Bizjak, \nAllison Blumenthal, Jessica Bougs, Theodore Bourke, Josh Bowman, Eric \nBrichto, Bethany Brisco, Benjamin Brock, Sabrina Bruce, Stefan Burk, \nMitch Burk, Jennifer Burks, Tyler Camp, Stacey Carroll, David Chan, \nAbby Charlesworth, Maria Clark, Chelsie Clausar, Michael Coffee, Nick \nCreager, Kelley Day, Jill Devine, Sydney DeVries, Caitlin DeWater, \nLauren Dinsmore, Shane Dixon, Danielle Dresner, Stefanie Dyar, Chloie \nEavinger, Kahler Elliott, Alyssa Flannery, Jeniece Fleming, Michelle \nFoisy, John Ford, Matthew Frye, Marcus Gadison, Christina Gephart, \nJulie Gidley, Emily Giles, Matt Green, Nicole Hakes, Deiter \nHammerstein, Katelyn Hausman, Jennifer Hayden, Cory Heimann, Kristy \nHentchel, Eric Hilton, Lorin Hinsberger, Daniel Hodgkiss, Julia Horn, \nYin Huang, Maurice Jackson, Jonathan Jackson, Ryan Johnson, Jonathan \nJones, Amanda Jursic, Caitlin Kelley, Krystle King, Kyle Kinnett, Becky \nKlimaszewski, Lana Knox, Jeremy Kunzman, Andrew Landis, Michelle \nLavengood, Alyssa Lee, Kara Levell, Cassandra Lewis, Kristen Liming, \nCara Lonis, Lauren Looney, Shandra Lynch, Kevina Lyons, Connie Mach, \nMeredith Marschand, Krystle Martin, Emelie Martlage, Sarah Matney, \nMallory McClain, Bernie McGee, Brittney McPheeters, Lauren Mesinger, \nBryan Meyer, Andrea Miller, Mark Modesitt, Jessica Moore, Alex Munder, \nCassie Myers, Jessica Niksich, Collin Northcutt, Tyler Orem, Nick \nOschman, Elizabeth Otte, Joyce Partyka, Heather Peebles, Steven Pelych, \nMonica Poplawski, Kolin Pound, Sheena Reed, Sieyda Requeno, Meredith \nRess, Elizabeth Rice, Rachel Robbins, Brooke Robertson, Ashley \nRodarmel, Zach Rodgers, Chantal Roullins, Kimberly Roush, Ben Schrodt, \nAllison Shafer, Megan Sikes, Jessica Singleton, Anthony Smith, Larissa \nSmith, Kristen Stout, Hannah Streeval, James Strycker, Randall Suggs, \nKate Summers, Megan Sutherland, Katie Terrell, Lindsay Terry, Tracey \nTodd, David Toupin, Nicole Tow, Lyndsay Trauner, Brandon Tucker, \nMelissa Van Westrum, James Victery, Ryan Waggoner, Ben Walker, Shaun \nWendel, Lauren Wendling, Sarah Wermuth, Alexander Whiteman, J.D. \nWillett, Chase Winkle, Olivia Worland, Taryn Zubel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11369-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM AND CONNIE HUDGENS\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

He \nhelped with the construction of Interstates 30 and 40. Mrs. Hudgens \nretired from Wal-Mart and worked many other jobs before. But her most \nimportant and rewarding job was as a wife and mother.\n  They have two daughters, Joyce Cates of North Little Rock and Sandra \nEvans of Lonoke.\n  They are also blessed with 6 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Hudgens now reside in Lonoke where they attend, and Mr. \nHudgens is a deacon emeritus of Lonoke Baptist Church.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11369-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11369-S11370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NORM NIELSEN\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to salute Norm Nielsen, \npresident of Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, IO, on his \nupcoming retirement. Dr. Nielsen has served the college and the greater \ncommunity with dedication through both good and difficult times. During \nhis tenure, and because of his commitment, talent and hard work, \nKirkwood Community College has become a major contributor to economic \ndevelopment in Eastern Iowa.\n  During Dr. Nielsen's illustrious 18-year tenure at Kirkwood, the \ncollege has become the third largest institution of higher education in \nIowa. Its excellence has been recognized with numerous honors and \nawards. For example, Kirkwood was named by the National Alliance of \nBusiness as its 2000-01 Community College of the Year.\n  I have known Norm for many years. I respect him as a true visionary \nwho has helped to shape and transform the mission of our Nation's \ncommunity college system. I respect him as a builder of programs and \npartnerships focused to enhance the quality of life in Eastern Iowa. \nMost of all, I respect Norm as a builder of people, a dedicated \neducator who believes in the transforming power of higher education and \nadvanced training.\n  I salute Norm for his extraordinary work over the years in improving \nIowa's community college system.

Mr. President, I want to salute Norm Nielsen, \npresident of Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, IO, on his \nupcoming retirement. Dr. Nielsen has served the college and the greater \ncommunity with dedication through both good and difficult times. During \nhis tenure, and because of his commitment, talent and hard work, \nKirkwood Community College has become a major contributor to economic \ndevelopment in Eastern Iowa.\n  During Dr. Nielsen's illustrious 18-year tenure at Kirkwood, the \ncollege has become the third largest institution of higher education in \nIowa. Its excellence has been recognized with numerous honors and \nawards. For example, Kirkwood was named by the National Alliance of \nBusiness as its 2000-01 Community College of the Year.\n  I have known Norm for many years. I respect him as a true visionary \nwho has helped to shape and transform the mission of our Nation's \ncommunity college system. I respect him as a builder of programs and \npartnerships focused to enhance the quality of life in Eastern Iowa. \nMost of all, I respect Norm as a builder of people, a dedicated \neducator who believes in the transforming power of higher education and \nadvanced training.\n  I salute Norm for his extraordinary work over the years in improving \nIowa's community college system. I know that we can count on him to \ncontinue to play a contributing role even in retirement.\n  Norm Nielsen's leadership will be missed. But he will leave Kirkwood \nCommunity College in good hands, as Mick Starcevich takes over as \npresident. Dr. Starcevich was previously superintendent of Prairie \nCommunity School District. Norm Nielsen is a tough act to follow, but I \nknow that Mick is superbly qualified to take on the challenge of \nleading Kirkwood Community College into the future.\n\n[[Page S11370]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11370-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WENDELL L. JOHNSON\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I commend an outstanding \nVirginian, Mr. Wendell L. Johnson, whose work has adorned the walls of \nmany members of the House of Representatives. The ``Member of \nCongress'' seal designed by Mr. Johnson has been used numerous times by \nour federal legislators over the years, and he deserves the \nacknowledgment of this chamber for his service to the United States.\n  As a young man of 18 years, Mr. Johnson enlisted in the Army to help \nhis country during World War II. Rising to the rank of Sergeant, he \nearned a Good Conduct Medal before being honorably discharged in \nDecember 1945. Continuing a career of public service, Mr. Johnson \njoined the staff of United States Representative Alvin E. O'Konski of \nWisconsin. While assisting the congressman in preparation for a \ntelevised speech in 1958, Mr. Johnson astutely realized that the \nviewing audience, who soon would be tuning in with this new medium, \nmight not be able to identify Representative O'Konski at first sight. \nUnderstanding correctly the value of the congressman's image on \ntelevision, Mr. Johnson hurried to the hardware store for the tools and \nsupplies necessary to create a logo dignified enough to appear with a \nmember of the United States Congress. By the time that the good people \nof Wisconsin had turned on their RCAs and Zeniths, Representative \nO'Konski spoke proudly from behind a podium bearing Johnson's \nexceptional ``Member of Congress'' seal.\n  While not the official seal of either the House of Representatives or \nthe Senate, Mr. Johnson's noble design represented the first insignia \nand plaque used for an individual member of the United States Congress. \nIn the decade following its first use, his handiwork became very \npopular among Representative O'Konski's colleagues in the House. Mr. \nJohnson was thrilled to see orders for his product from the House \nStationery Clerk, and he made a hobby of providing plaques to a host of \nmembers, including Harold Ostertag, Louis Wyman, Bill Brock, Dan \nRostenkowski, and Donald Rumsfeld.\n  Mr. Johnson's artistry expertly reflects the dignity and honor of the \nlegislative branch. Featuring a proud eagle under a field of fourteen \nstars, the circular plaque bears the words ``Member of Congress'' above \nthe name of our nation. A banner of ``E Pluribus Unum'' is clutched in \nthe beak of the eagle, which holds in its talons a branch of olives and \nthree arrows. Mr. Johnson's design has earned the esteem of many, as it \nhas appeared on Congressional stationery, the official oil portrait of \ntwo committee chairmen, and even a number of gravestones.\n  I thank you for the opportunity today to give Mr. Wendell L. Johnson \nthe recognition that he so rightly deserves for his service to \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11370-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11370-S11371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PREMATURITY AWARENESS DAY\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a \ngrowing number of premature births in the United States. The March of \nDimes has declared November 16th Prematurity Awareness Day. This event \nis part of a five-year plan, launched in 2003, to use the combined \npower of awareness, education, and research to significantly decrease \nthe number of premature births in the United States.\n  The rise in premature births throughout the country and in my own \nState--despite all of our achievements in medicine--is astounding. \nNationally, more than 480,000 babies were born preterm in 2002. Nearly \n13 percent of Indiana's infants are born preterm and in half of the \ncases, doctors cannot identify the cause. Prematurity is the leading \ncause of infant death in the first month of life. Many of these infants \nwill suffer lifelong health problems--such as cerebral palsy, mental \nretardation, chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss--and \nsome will die. Reducing the number of premature births will improve the \nhealth of hundreds of thousands of infants born each year.\n  Aside from these human costs, the financial cost of caring for \npreterm infants is enormous. The March of Dimes estimates that the \nnational hospital bill for infants with a diagnosis of prematurity/low \nbirthweight was $13.6 billion in 2001.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 1726, the PREEMIE Act, \nlegislation that seeks to expand and coordinate research on the \nprevention of preterm birth and the most effective care for babies when \nthey are born preterm.\n  Senator Lincoln and I have also introduced S. 1734, the Prevent \nPrematurity and Improve Child Health Act, which seeks to improve \nMedicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program to better \nreflect our current state of knowledge on preterm birth. For example, \nmedical research tells us that smoking is a considerable risk factor \nfor preterm and low birthweight infants. Our bill takes this knowledge \nand translates it into practice by ensuring that smoking cessation \nservices and pharmaceuticals are available for pregnant women enrolled \nin Medicaid.\n  My wife Char and I have been long-time volunteers for the March of \nDimes and I am pleased that they are committing such an enormous amount \nof time, energy and resources into conquering the stubborn problem of \npreterm birth with their five-year Prematurity Campaign. Both of these \nbills have the potential to make a real difference in many lives and I \nhope that our colleagues will consider joining us in this effort.\n  I am proud to tell you that the Indiana March of Dimes Chapter has \nmany events planned for Prematurity Awareness Day. I commend the March \nof Dimes for its dedication in working toward a day when babies and \ntheir families no longer have to face the devastating consequences of \npremature birth. I call on my colleagues to join the fight against \npremature birth.\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a \nserious issue--the growing number of premature births in the United \nStates. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 480,000 \nbabies were born prematurely--that is, born at less than 37 completed \nweeks of gestation--in 2002. The number of premature births in the \nUnited States increased 27 percent between 1982 and 2002.\n  In my own State of Idaho ten percent of babies born in 2002 were \npreterm, and the rate of preterm births in Idaho has risen 21 percent \nsince 1992. The preterm rate for our Native American population was \n12.8 percent and 11 percent in our Hispanic community. In addition, 6.1 \npercent of all babies born in Idaho had a low birth weight. It is even \nhigher for Hispanic babies--6.9 percent of them are born with low birth \nweight, higher than the national average.\n  The March of Dimes has begun to address the issue of prematurity and \nhealth disparities by funding prenatal education and outreach projects \nin different parts of Idaho. Two projects are in our largest cities, \nBoise and Nampa, and target low-income and low-income Hispanic women \nand one outreach project is on a rural reservation. Finally, the March \nof Dimes is funding a smoking cessation project for pregnant women in \none of our northern cities, Lewiston.\n  The March of Dimes has declared November 16th Prematurity Awareness \nDay. This event is part of a 5-year plan, launched in 2003, to use the \ncombined power of awareness, education, and research to significantly \ndecrease the number of premature births in the United States. In Idaho \nthis week there will be media coverage spotlighting prematurity \nawareness, and pink and blue street lights in downtown Boise for 2 \nweeks drawing public attention to the issue. In addition, many \nretailers will be providing free information to shoppers about the \nearly warning signs of prematurity.\n  Let me share the story of this year's Idaho ambassador family. During \na routine medical exam, the mother of twins Morgan and Max was placed \non immediate bed rest due to signs of pre-term labor. Fortunately, when \nMorgan and Max were born 10 weeks early, they received specialized \nmedical care at the neonatal intensive care unit and were able to come \nhome after just five weeks. Today they are healthy, vibrant toddlers.\n  Thanks to research being supported by the March of Dimes, doctors are \nbetter able to identify signs of preterm labor--a life-saving factor in \nthe case of Morgan and Max. Advances made by the March of Dimes in the \ntreatment of premature babies--like surfactant therapy--gave these \ntwins a good start toward a healthy life.\n  The March of Dimes has long been a national leader in the fight for \ninfant\n\n[[Page S11371]]\n\nand child health. I commend the March of Dimes for its dedication in \nworking toward a day when babies and their families no longer have to \nface the devastating consequences of premature birth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11371-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JOHN SPINA'S NAVY SERVICE\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I say thank you to a patriot \nand a technical expert, Mr. John Spina, who is retiring from civilian \nservice to the Navy in December 2004.\n  John was born and was raised in the Philadelphia, PA area. He began \nhis government career in 1954 at the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin in \nWest Bethesda, Maryland, as a cooperative student while attending \nDrexel University. He received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical \nEngineering from Drexel in 1958. John continued his Federal career at \nthe Model Basin--now NAVSEA, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock \nDivision--culminating in 50 years of diligent service to the Navy. John \nand his wife Rosemary live in Virginia and have been married 46 years.\n  John's early assignments included travel to the David Taylor Model \nBasin's Field Station at Lake Pend Oreille in Bayview, ID where he led \nthe initial testing at the large capacity haul down site, Wigwam, using \n10-foot long rising bodies.\n  As part of the Acoustics and Vibration Laboratory, he conducted tests \non body shapes for signal devices followed by tests with a special \nbuoyantly-propelled device. He performed extensive torpedo tests with \nPennsylvania State University, using buoyant, powered rise and \n``gravity drop'' methods. He also participated in towed array tests \nwith Bell Labs and was instrumental in testing the initial core samples \nof the bottom of the lake in the late 1960's in preparation for the \nfirst big haul down system to be used for large model, Kamloops.\n  John completed his master's degree at Catholic University in 1971. \nHis work with large models and testing at the Bayview facility \ncontinued and led to the design, development, construction, and \ndeployment of several large-scale submarine models: Steelhead, \nMackinaw, S6W, Kamloops, and Dolly Varden, named after fish in Lake \nPend Oreille. Unparalleled in the history of quieting, these models and \nthe associated test programs were an immense success, contributing to \nthe understanding and reduction of all aspects of submarine noise.\n  The introduction of Dolly Varden provided a valuable capability for \ninvestigating noise sources and mechanisms with the economy of cost and \ntime not possible in full scale. As test requirements and submarine \nquieting demands changed, these models were modified and adapted to \nhundreds of unique configurations, demonstrating the performance of \nmaterials and shapes for submarine applications.\n  In the late 1980s, the Navy required powered model testing to further \nthe science of quieting. A cooperative effort by the David Taylor \nResearch Center and the Naval Sea Systems Command culminated in the \ndesign, construction, delivery, and successful operation and employment \nof the large-scale vehicle, Kokanee, in 1988. Again, John was actively \ninvolved, forming the crew, directing the logistics, and developing the \noperating plans and procedures. The results of the Kokanee testing \noffset over $1 billion in comparable full scale test and demonstrated \nsuperb prediction of full scale performance.\n  The success and accomplishments of the Kokanee program showed that \nlarge models provide a valuable contribution to submarine development \nand John again led the specification, design, and development process \nfor a second powered vehicle, the 200-ton Cutthroat model of the \nVirginia Class.\n  In a parallel effort, static submarine tests also required additional \ntest facilities and capabilities. Shortly after the deployment of \nKokanee, plans were implemented for the construction of the \nIntermediate Scale Measurement System, ISMS. This multi-million dollar \nprogram provided a dramatic improvement in the ability to understand \nstructural acoustics and to demonstrate advanced silencing theories and \nmethods.\n  While others pioneered new designs, data acquisition, and processing \nmethods, John supported testing through the development of model \nhandling and alteration capabilities, and an infrastructure of \ndedicated, trained personnel, unique equipment, and documentation of \ntest methods that has continually improved performance and reduced \ncosts. It is, therefore, fitting that we recognize and honor him for \nhis years of service, months of travel, and unwavering support for the \nfacility at Lake Pend Oreille and the Navy.\n  John Spina has been a significant contributor to our nation's \nresearch and development in the area of quieting vessels and \nsubmarines, present and future capabilities, as well as numerous \nperformance improvements for quieting operational and future vessels \nand submarines. I extend to John and Rosemary best wishes, fair winds, \nand following seas in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11371-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO MRS.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a singularly \nworthy public servant, Mr. Robert Snyder, Senior Executive Service, who \nhas served our country and the American people with great distinction \nfor over 35 years. I make this statement to recognize his retirement \nfrom his current position as Executive Director and senior civilian of \nthe Missile Defense Agency.\n  Rob Snyder has been uniquely qualified to discharge his \nresponsibilities at MDA. A graduate of Temple University in business \nadministration, he went on to earn two masters degrees, one in business \nand another in public administration. He is a graduate of executive \nprograms at American University, the Federal Executive Institute, and \nHarvard. And he served with honor in Vietnam with the U.S. Army.\n  After working for almost two decades elsewhere in the Defense \nDepartment--most of that time involved in trench warfare over budgets--\nin 1988, he came to the missile defense business. That year, he was \npromoted to the Senior Executive Service as the Deputy Comptroller of \nSDIO, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. His maturity of \njudgment, breadth of experience, and absolute integrity quickly made \nhim a driving force for getting things done, and done the right way. \nFive years ago, after earning several promotions, he was made the first \nExecutive Director of what was then BMDO, the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOrganization, and is now MDA.\n  His responsibilities increased, but he never lost his focus on \nprogrammatic issues. When we, here on the Hill, needed accurate and \ntimely responses to our detailed questions on what has always been a \npolitically contentious program, more often than not, it was Rob Snyder \nwho came over to brief us. We always came away from those meetings \nbetter informed of the specifics and purposes behind the issues at \nhand, and with a clearer understanding of the rationale for Agency \ndecisions and recommendations.\n  We came to rely on him the same way that multiple Directors have, \nfirst, of SDIO, then, of BMDO, and now, of MDA. He has been, almost \nsingle-handedly, the missile defense program's institutional memory.\n\n[[Page S11372]]\n\n  His work on various Agency efforts has been largely out of public \nview. But that's not to say he didn't have an impact. Program audits, \nfinancial controls, budgetary accuracy, facility relocation, personnel \nmanagement--all must be managed efficiently, effectively, and with \nabsolute integrity. Any shortcomings here can lead to chaos in an \norganization. Yet as the Agency's first Executive Director, Rob Snyder \nmaintained the highest standards, held himself accountable, and kept \nthis infrastructure in solid shape so that senior program managers \ncould focus on making the missile defense program a successful one.\n  He has been a hero behind the scenes, and because of his enduring \ncontributions to the missile defense program, we stand on the threshold \nof eliminating long-standing vulnerabilities to the very real threat of \nballistic missile attack to our homeland, our deployed troops, and our \nallies and friends.\n  Among other recognitions, he has received the Department of Defense's \nhighest award for civilians. With over 16 years in the SES--almost half \nof his Federal service--he has had an extraordinarily productive career \nand one we in this Chamber are right to honor.\n  We will miss his wise counsel as he moves on to a well-earned \nretirement. We owe him a profound debt of gratitude for the \ncontributions he has made to our Nation and our security over a \nlifetime of service. I am sure I speak for all of us in this body in \nsaying that we wish him and his family many years of health and \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11372-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

During the week of November 21-28, \ncommunities and churches across the United States will participate in \nthis annual celebration by reading and reflecting on the teachings of \nthe Bible. In doing so, they recognize the Bible's importance in our \ndaily lives. I am thankful for the opportunity to serve as Senate Co-\nChairman of National Bible Week this year, and I commend the National \nBible Association for its sponsorship of this yearly tradition.\n  The first National Bible Week, organized in 1941, was created as a \nway to extend comfort and hope to our nation during the tumultuous days \nof World War II.

I pray that \nall Americans, particularly our soldiers and their loved ones, would \nreceive ``the peace of God, which transcends all understanding'' \n(Philippians 4:7).\n  I believe Americans of all religions and faith backgrounds can find \nwisdom and understanding in the Holy Scriptures. Indeed, the Bible and \nits teachings have greatly influenced my own life. I encourage all \nAmericans to read the Bible and consider the wisdom, lessons, and \ntraditions that have come to us from it. I congratulate the National \nBible Association for its dedication to the celebration of the Holy \nBible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11372-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11372-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, withdrawals and a treaty which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11372-4", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11372-S11373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 2003, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 13, 2004, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       S. 524.

A bill to improve authorities to address urgent \nnonproliferation crises and United States nonproliferation operations; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2981. A bill to provide for the elimination and safeguarding of \nconventional arms; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce two new bills to \nstrengthen U.S. nonproliferation efforts. One of these is a new \nConventional Arms Threat Reduction Act. The other is the fourth \ninstallment of the Nunn-Lugar legislation, the nonproliferation program \nthat Sam Nunn and I sponsored in 1991.\n  In that year, Sam Nunn and I authored the Soviet Nuclear Threat \nReduction or Nunn-Lugar Act, which established the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program. That program has provided U.S. funding and expertise \nto help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle their enormous \nstockpiles of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, means of \ndelivery and related materials. In 1997, Senator Nunn and I were joined \nby Senator Domenici in introducing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Act, which expanded Nunn-Lugar authorities in the former \nSoviet Union and provided WMD expertise to first responders in American \ncities. In 2003, Congress adopted the Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, which \nauthorized the Nunn-Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet \nUnion to address proliferation threats. The bill that I am introducing \ntoday would strengthen the Nunn-Lugar program and other \nnonproliferation efforts and provide them with greater flexibility to \naddress emerging threats.\n  To date, the Nunn-Lugar program has deactivated or destroyed: 6,462 \nnuclear warheads; 550 ICBMs; 469 ICBM silos; 13 ICBM mobile missile \nlaunchers; 135 bombers; 733 nuclear air-to-surface missiles; 408 \nsubmarine missile launchers; 530 submarine launched missiles; 27 \nnuclear submarines; and 194 nuclear test tunnels.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program also facilitated the removal of all nuclear \nweapons from Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. After the fall of the \nSoviet Union, these three nations emerged as the third, fourth, and \neighth largest nuclear powers in the world. Today, all three are \nnuclear-weapons-free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn-\nLugar program. In addition, Nunn-Lugar is the primary tool through \nwhich the United States is working with Russian authorities to \nidentify, safeguard, and destroy Russia's massive chemical and \nbiological warfare capacity.\n  These successes were never a foregone conclusion. Today, even after \nmore than 12 years, creativity and constant vigilance are required to \nensure that the Nunn-Lugar program is not encumbered by bureaucratic \nobstacles or undercut by political disagreements.\n  I have devoted much time and effort to overseeing and accelerating \nthe Nunn-Lugar program. Uncounted individuals of great dedication \nserving on the ground in the former Soviet Union and in our Government \nhave made this program work. Nevertheless, from the beginning, we have \nencountered resistance to the Nunn-Lugar concept in both the United \nStates and Russia. In our own country, opposition often has been \nmotivated by false perceptions that Nunn-Lugar money is foreign \nassistance or by beliefs that Defense Department funds should only be \nspent on troops, weapons, or other war-fighting capabilities. Until \nrecently, we also faced a general disinterest in nonproliferation that \nmade gaining support for Nunn-Lugar funding and activities an annual \nstruggle.\n  The attacks of September 11 changed the political discourse on this \nsubject. We have turned a corner--the public, the media, and political \ncandidates are paying more attention now. In a remarkable moment in the \nfirst Presidential debate, both President Bush and Senator Kerry agree \nthat the number one national security threat facing the United States \nwas the prospect that weapons of mass destruction could fall into the \nhands of terrorists.\n  The 9/11 Commission weighed in with another important endorsement of \nthe Nunn-Lugar program, saying that ``Preventing the proliferation of \n[weapons of mass destruction] warrants a maximum effort--by \nstrengthening counterproliferation efforts, expanding the Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative, and supporting the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram.'' the report went on to say that ``Nunn-Lugar . . . is now in \nneed of expansion, improvement, and resources.''\n  The first bill that I am introducing today is ``The Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2004.'' It would underscore \nthe bipartisan consensus on Nunn-Lugar by streamlining and accelerating \nNunn-Lugar implementation. It would grant more flexibility to the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense to undertake non-proliferation \nprojects outside the former Soviet Union. It also would eliminate \nCongressionally imposed conditions on Nunn-Lugar assistance that in the \npast have force the suspension of time-sensitive nonproliferation \nprojects. The purpose of the bill is to reduce bureaucratic red tape \nand friction within our Government that hinder effective responses to \nnonproliferation opportunities and emergencies.\n\n  For example, recently Albania appealed for help in destroying 16 tons \nof chemical agent left over from the cold war. In August, I visited \nthis remote storage facility, the location of which still remains \nclassified. Nunn-Lugar officials are working closely with Albanian \nleaders to destroy this dangerous stockpile. But the experience also is \nillustrative of the need to reduce bureaucratic delays. The package of \ndocuments to be reviewed by the President took some 11 weeks to be \nfinalized and readied for President Bush. From beginning to end, the \nbureaucratic process to authorize dismantlement of chemical weapons in \nAlbania took more than 3 months. Fortunately, the situation in Albania \nwas not a crisis, but we may not be able to afford these timelines in \nfuture nonproliferation emergencies.\n  The second piece of legislation that I am introducing is the \n``Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004'' or ``CATRA.'' This \nlegislation is modeled on the original Nunn-Lugar Act. Its purpose is \nto provide the Department of State with a focused response to the \nthreat posed by vulnerable stockpiles of conventional weapons around \nthe world, including tactical missiles and man portable air defense \nsystems, or MANPADS. Such missiles and other weapons systems could be \nused by terrorists to attack commercial and military targets, and U.S. \nfacilities here at home and abroad. Reports suggest that Al Qaeda has \nattempted to acquire these kinds of weapons. In addition, unsecured \nconventional weapons stockpiles are a major obstacle to peace, \nreconstruction, and economic development in regions suffering from \ninstability.\n  My bill declares it to be the policy of the United States to seek out \nsurplus and unguarded stocks of conventional armaments, including small \narms, light weapons, MANPADS, and tactical missile systems for \nelimination. It authorizes the Department of State to carry out an \naccelerated global effort to destroy such weapons and to cooperate with \nallies and international organizations when possible. The Secretary of \nState is charged with devising a strategy for prioritizing, on a \ncountry-\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\nby-country basis, the obligation of funds in a global program of \nconventional arms elimination. Lastly, the Secretary is required to \nunify program planning, coordination, and implementation of the \nstrategy into one office at the State Department. The bill also \nauthorizes a budget increase commensurate with the risk posed by these \nweapons.\n  The Department of State has been working to address the threats posed \nby conventional weapons. But in my judgment, the current funding \nallocation and organizational structure are not up to the task. Only \nabout $6 million was devoted to destroying small arms and light weapons \nduring fiscal years 2003 and 2004. We need more focus on this problem \nand additional funding to take advantage of opportunities to secure \nvulnerable stockpiles from proliferation, theft, or diversion.\n  In August, I visited Albania, Ukraine, and Georgia. Each of these \ncountries has large stockpiles of MANPADS and tactical missile systems \nand each has requested U.S. assistance to destroy them. On August 27, I \nstood in a remote Albanian military storage facility as the base \ncommander unloaded a fully functioning MANPAD from its crate and \nreadied it for use. This storage site contained 70 MANPADS that could \nhave been used to attack an American commercial aircraft. Fortunately, \nthe MANPADS that I saw that day were destroyed on September 2, but \nthere are many more like them throughout the world. Too often, \nconventional weapons are inadequately stored and protected. This \npresent grave risk to American military bases, embassy compounds, and \neven targets within the United States. We must develop a response that \nis commensurate with the threat.\n  I am offering these two bills now, during the November session, so \nthat the administration, Congress, and the public can begin an \nexamination of their merits. I will reintroduce these bills when \nCongress reconvenes in January. I am hopeful for strong support that \nreflects the priority status of U.S. nonproliferation efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2982. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to make a \nstillborn child an insurable dependent for purposes of the \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance program; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer remarks on a bill \nthat I am introducing that would make a stillborn child an insurable \ndependent for purposes of the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance \n(SGLI) program.\n  Experiencing the death of a child results in both emotional trauma \nand financial hardship for parents and families. However, further \nstress is added when the family involved is in the military. I was \nrecently contacted by a constituent family that experienced a \nstillbirth and subsequently learned that they were not eligible for the \nmilitary's dependent death benefit because the child was stillborn.\n  The Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program is currently \navailable to all members of the uniformed services, their spouses, and \ndependents. Specifically, when a servicemember's family experiences the \ndeath of a child, the family is entitled to a $10,000 child death \nbenefit under the SGLI program. However, if a servicemember's family \nexperiences a stillbirth, the family is not eligible for a death \nbenefit under the SGLI program because current insurance standards \nrequire that a death certificate be issued for a child to be covered. \nHowever, neither a birth certificate nor a death certificate is issued \nfor a stillborn infant.\n  In a recent Federal court case, Warnock v. Office of Servicemembers' \nGroup Life Insurance, the issue of whether a stillborn infant is an \n``insurable dependent'' under SGLI was litigated. The court held as a \nmatter of law that both statute and SGLI policy do not provide coverage \nfor a stillborn infant. To further substantiate the necessity of \nmodifying this insurance coverage, the Army Family Action Plan \nsupported providing a death benefit for stillborn infants at their \nannual conference in 2003, thus demonstrating this is an important \nissue for all military families.\n  This legislation is imperative because it will alleviate some of the \nfinancial hardship that a servicemember's family must endure as a \nresult of a stillbirth. My bill would amend Title 38 of the United \nStates Code to make a stillborn child an insurable dependent for \npurposes of the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program.\n  By including stillborn infants within the scope of the SGLI program, \nwe will be helping to ease the financial burden of military \nservicemember families at a time of great loss and emotional stress.\n  I hope that many of my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nessential legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2983. A bill to establish hospice demonstration projects and a \nhospice grant program for beneficiaries under the medicare program \nunder title XVIII of the Social Security Act, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2984. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to increase \nthe number of permanent faculty in palliative care medicine at \naccredited allopathic and osteopathic medical schools and to promote \nthe development of faculty careers as academic palliative specialists \nwho emphasize teaching; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, our health care system is structured to \ncure but often neglects how we die and how to make dying patients and \ntheir families more comfortable. Today, I am introducing two bills \nwhich I believe will provide better care options for dying patients in \nour country. The Medicare Hospice Demonstration Act seeks to test ways \nin which to improve the Medicare hospice benefit, and the Palliative \nCare Training Act recognizes that we need a larger cadre of health care \nprofessionals who know how to help those with terminal illnesses have a \nbetter quality of life.\n  Although this Congress made improvements in the Medicare Hospice \nbenefit last year, I believe we need to continue to test new modes of \nproviding hospice care so that more seniors are not only aware of the \nbenefit, but access it when needed. Medicare introduced the hospice \nprogram in 1983 as an optional benefit for achieving a ``good death''. \nThis benefit is widely recognized as effective in improving quality of \nlife for terminally ill patients. Hospice programs provide a range of \nservices to control pain and provide comfort care, primarily to \nindividuals in their own homes. In the past decade, the number of \nMedicare patients receiving hospice care has more than doubled. Today, \nabout 20 percent of patients who die in the United States receive \nhospice care. However, average lengths of stay in hospice have been \ndropping. According to the GAO, twenty-eight percent of Medicare \npatients in the hospice program receive hospice care for one week or \nless. One reason for this shift in hospice use is patient unwillingness \nto forego curative care--or to abandon hope despite a terminal \ndiagnosis. The Medicare hospice program pays for medical procedures \nnecessary for pain control and other symptom management, but not those \naimed at curing the patient. As a result, many seriously ill patients \nresist the program because it forces them to make a choice between the \nhope that there might be a cure and the acceptance that one's life is \ncoming to an end.\n  The Medicare Hospice Demonstration Act would remove this obstacle by \npermitting patients to seek hospice care as they continue curative \ntreatment. I believe more people would use the hospice benefit and use \nit in a timely manner so they could get the full benefit of the range \nof services hospice offers if they did not have to give up hope. I also \nbelieve that this concept along with counseling assistance provided by \nthis demonstration project would help the medical community be better \nable to help patients accept hospice care.\n  The second bill I am introducing, ``The Palliative Care Training \nAct'', uses the model already in law for other specialities to create a \nHospice and Palliative Care Academic Career Award. This award would \nfoster the creation of faculty at our Nation's medical schools to teach \npalliative\n\n[[Page S11382]]\n\ncare, once the specialty is recognized as a board certified specialty.\n  For some the term ``palliative care'' may be new. Palliative care \nimproves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the \nproblem associated with life-threatening illness, through the \nprevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, \nassessment, and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, \npsychosocial and spiritual. It neither hastens nor postpones death. \nThis type of care offers a support system to help patients live as \nactively as possible until death and to help the family cope during \ntheir loved one's illness and in their own bereavement. In addition, \npalliative care is applicable early in the course of illness, in \nconjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, \nsuch as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n  No one likes to think about what it will be like at the end of our \nlives. We rarely have the discussions we need to have with our medical \nproviders about how to help us have a ``good'' death. Much of the fault \nlies in the way we have structured our health care system. With all \nthat the American health system has to offer, we need to make sure \nresources are put in place to assure patients and their families better \ncare in their last days. I believe these two bills provide important \ncomponents to do that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 2986.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nexpand the country of origin labeling for certain covered commodities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as you know, we are trying to finalize the \nappropriations bills this week so that we can get that done and go \nhome. But in these appropriations bills, there are a lot of surprises. \nOne of them is a movement to water down the country-of-origin labeling, \na law that was passed in the 2002 farm bill.\n  I will tell you that over the past weeks--in fact, before the \nelection--I was in 45 communities and traveled 2,500 miles and found \nout that my State supports country-of-origin labeling and does not want \nto see it watered down. I heard from my folks. They strongly support \nit.\n  In Montana, we want ``U.S.A'' on it. They are proud of what they \nproduce. They are proud of the finished product. Of course, I have \nsupported country-of-origin labeling for many years, and I was glad to \nsee it finally pass in 2002 when we passed the 2002 farm bill.\n  Now we are at the task of trying to write the administrative rules on \na law that is already in place. We are having problems with that.\n  But as Congress completed the bill and the President signed it into \nlaw, we had some folks already trying to dismantle it. That is wrong. \nSome folks wanted to muddle it up. That was wrong for the simple reason \nthat you can't implement a law unless you know what the rules are. We \ndon't know what those rules are right now. In fact, I think it is kind \nof like if the Washington Redskins go over to play Baltimore in \nfootball and they don't make the rules until after the opening kickoff. \nI don't think that works very well.\n  But right now we have some folks who want to take another run at it. \nThey are getting very aggressive and working overtime to get it done. \nGranted, the law has a couple of flaws in it. It is nothing that we \ncan't fix. But keeping it muddled up all the time while we are trying \nto write the administrative rules becomes very difficult.\n  There is a move to defund the entire writing process at one time. \nThat was defeated.\n  Now, instead of having a mandatory COOL law in effect today, which \nwas the original intent to have a good program, of course, the rules \ncontinue because the implementation wasn't supposed to be until 2006. \nThat was a compromise to continue the rulemaking process. Now I am told \nthat there is another move again to soften the law and make it a \nvoluntary law instead of a mandatory law. I don't support that. My \nproducers don't support that. They are tired of waiting around.\n  We need to get the country-of-origin labeling done. It needs to be \ndone right, and it needs to be mandatory.\n  I have a concern with the COOL law currently on the books. But today \nI am introducing legislation that begins to fix one part of that law.\n  Right now, very little beef will actually be labeled in the grocery \nstores. The law excludes over half of the beef sold in this country. \nBut let me be clear. Under no set of circumstances do I support rolling \nback the country-of-origin labeling. If Congress votes to make COOL \nvoluntary, it may as well repeal the law because voluntary COOL does \nnot work.\n  On October 2002, the Secretary published guidelines for a voluntary \nlabeling program so any retailer who chose to label could do it. But \nnone did.\n  Some of my friends say if we mandate a program, then let us try \nvoluntary again. It is now time to shift the balance of power in the \nworld of agricultural marketing and mandate country-of-origin labeling.\n  You see, overwhelmingly, the folks who support COOL are small cow/\ncalf producers--my ranchers back home in Miles City, Judith Gap, \nRudyard, Dillon, and across the State of Montana.\n  These are guys who have worked hard on their ranches each and every \nday. They raise and produce healthy cattle and they want ``U.S.A.'' on \ntheir products. I don't blame them. But they do not have a lot of say \nin this decision. Once the calves leave the ranch, producers lose \ncontrol to other parts of the industry.\n  While what I am doing is offering a bill to fix it, let us expand the \nbill to processed meats. We have to do that. The bill I am introducing \nwill remove the exemption in the law for processed foods. In practice, \nthis means beef jerky, sausages, and marinated pork tenderloins which \nare all excluded from the labeling requirements as it stands. These are \ncommon consumer products and none of them would be just the same as \nthey are for fish and shellfish which is already in effect. Looking at \nthose rules, we are not asking for any more.\n  With that, let us understand that attempts to weaken the law cannot \nhappen in this body nor should it happen on these appropriations bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11382-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11382-S11384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 469--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEAS OF NATIONAL TIME \n      OUT DAY TO PROMOTE THE ADOPTION OF THE JOINT COMMISSION ON \n   ACCREDITATION OF HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS' UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL FOR \n                PREVENTING ERRORS IN THE OPERATING ROOM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Santorum) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, we have all heard the expression, ``To \nerr is human.'' We teach our children that mistakes are okay because we \nlearn from them. However, there are some mistakes that are more costly \nto make than others. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine released a \nreport entitled, ``To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.'' \nThe report revealed the following devastating statistic: every year, \nbetween 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized people in the United States die \ndue to medical errors.\n  Science has not yet found a cure for cancer or even the common cold, \nbut it has discovered a way to prevent the thousands of fatalities that \noccur every year due to medical errors. The Joint Commission on \nAccreditation of Healthcare Organizations developed a universal \nprotocol that calls for surgical teams to literally call a ``time out'' \nbefore surgeries begin. This ``time out'' serves a brief period for \nsurgeons and nurses to verify the patient's identity, the procedure to \nbe performed, and the site of the procedure. Endorsed by the American \nCollege of Surgeons, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the \nAmerican Hospital Association, the Association of Perioperative \nRegistered Nurses, and the American Society for Healthcare Risk \nManagement, this idea of a ``time out'' may seem almost simplistic, but \nthe fact of the matter is even the best surgeon in the world can make a \nvery costly mistake if he or she does not stop for a moment for surgery \nand take a ``time out.''\n  Therefore, it is my pleasure to rise today to submit this resolution, \nwhich promotes a National Time Out Day and promotes the adoption of the \nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization's \nuniversal protocol for preventing errors in the operating room.\n  To err may be human, but for the thousands of relatives that are \ncurrently sitting in a hospital waiting room, waiting for a loved one \nto come out of surgery, human error is not an acceptable answer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 145--TO CORRECT THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. \n                                  1417\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, H.R. 5163, the Norman Mineta Research \nand Special Programs Improvement Act, will be considered by the Senate \ntoday. I support H.R. 5163 and look forward to its enactment into law.\n  H.R. 5163 will realign the current Research and Special Programs \nAdministration, creating two new entities; the Pipeline and Hazardous \nMaterials Safety Administration and the Research and Innovative \nTechnologies Administration. Each new entity will be led by an \nAdministrator.\n  Section 2 of the bill provides a new Section 108 of Title 49, \ncreating the new Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety \nAdministration. In 108(c), the bill creates the Administrator position, \nas follows:\n\n       (c) Administrator.--The head of the Administration shall be \n     the Administrator who shall be appointed by the President, by \n     and with advice and consent of the Senate, and shall be an \n     individual with professional experience in pipeline safety, \n     hazardous materials safety, or other transportation safety . \n     . .\n\n  By spelling out qualifications for its new Administrator, Congress is \nseeking to enhance the prospects for success for the new Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration.\n  The new Research and Innovative Technologies Administration is \ncreated by amending Section 112 of title 49, eliminating reference to \nthe Research and Special Programs Administration and modifying its \npowers and duties. Aside from adding the position to the Executive \nSchedule Pay Rate, H.R. 5163 does not address the new Administrator, \nResearch and Innovative Technologies Administration.\n  As with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, \nsuccess of the Research and Innovative Technologies Administration will \nrest to a significant degree on the effectiveness of its leadership. \nIts Administrator should be well qualified. He or she should be an \nindividual with professional experience in transportation research, \nresearch management, research program development, education and \ntraining in transportation and transportation-related fields and in \ntransferring technologies into real world applications.\n  I hope that the President will apply these qualifications when \nselecting a candidate for Administrator, Research and Innovative \nTechnologies Administration.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mutual assistance available under the \n     Treaty includes: taking the testimony or statements of \n     persons; providing documents, records, and articles of \n     evidence; locating or identifying persons; serving documents; \n     transferring persons in custody for testimony or other \n     purposes; executing requests for searches and seizures; \n     undertaking telecommunications surveillance, undercover \n     investigations, and controlled deliveries; assisting in \n     proceedings related to immobilization and forfeiture of \n     assets, restitution to the victims of crime and collection of \n     fines; and any other form of assistance not prohibited by the \n     laws of the State from whom the assistance is requested.\n       I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable \n     consideration to the Treaty, and give its advice and consent \n     to ratification.\n                                                 George W.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the debt limit extension bill. Under the order, there \nwill be up to 6 hours of debate on the measure prior to the vote. It is \nmy expectation that we will use a portion of that debate tomorrow and \nthe remainder of the debate on Thursday. A number of our colleagues \nwill be attending the opening of the Clinton Presidential Library and, \ntherefore, I expect that vote to occur when that delegation returns.\n  As I mentioned this morning, we have a lot of work to do prior to \nadjournment of this Congress. In addition to the debt limit bill, the \nSenate must also complete action on the remaining fiscal year 2005 \nspending bills, the intelligence reform conference report, if \navailable, a number of nominations, and any other conference reports \nthat may become available.\n  It is our intention to finish our work on these items this week. \nTherefore, Senators should make themselves available for busy days over \nthe remainder of the week.\n  Mr. President, I will be happy to turn to the Democratic leader. If \nnot, I will be putting us into a quorum call for a period of time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask if the majority leader can give us \nany understanding as to progress that may have been made today on the \nappropriations and the omnibus bill. It is my understanding it is \nunlikely the bill will come up before Friday, but might he share with \nus what he knows about the progress the negotiators made today?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response to the Democratic leader, \ntremendous progress has been made over the course of the weekend, \nyesterday, and then over the course of today. We have a number of bills \nthat are involved, as everyone knows, and it is a monumental task that \nboth the staff and the Senators have been asked to do. But huge \nprogress is being made.\n  We will, for the convenience of Senators, not be voting on Thursday \nduring the day. We will have a vote likely Thursday night. It would be \nan objective to finish the omnibus bill on Friday. I hesitate to say \nthat because a number of Senators have come up and said exactly what is \nin that omnibus bill. The staff is working with the Senators on the \nvarious conferences and the appropriators, and it is very important \npeople be able to see it and have the opportunity to comment on it and \ndebate what is in that bill.\n  Tremendous progress is being made which led me to say that if we stay \nfocused, we should be able to finish our business this week on Friday \nor Saturday, although, again, we have the intelligence bills to \nconsider.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader. I only reiterate what I \nsaid this morning. Obviously, our ability to expedite consideration of \nthe omnibus bill, which is very critical, will be directly related to \nthe degree to which extraneous matters are incorporated in the bill. I \nhope very earnestly that people who have an inclination to want to\n\n[[Page S11392]]\n\nadd extraneous issues can refrain from doing so in order to complete \nour work and to avoid what might be an extended delay.\n\n  I know both sides are working with that in mind. I appreciate the \neffort made to bring this matter to a close. This is probably one of \nthe most important remaining pieces of unfinished business. I \nappreciate very much the leader's report tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also want to reemphasize what the \nDemocratic leader just said. A number of people are coming forward with \nlegislation in the hopes there is some way it can be attached to the \nomnibus bill because people realize it is an important bill, and it is \na bill we have worked on in a bipartisan way to bring to closure, which \nwe will. I encourage our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nunderstand that we are not going to be including extraneous matter on \nthis bill. That is under mutual agreement with the Democratic \nleadership and the Republican leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/16/senate-section/article/S11392-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11392-S11393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 1417\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
