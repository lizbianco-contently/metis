Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration of S. \n1, the prescription drug benefits bill first thing this morning. There \nare two amendments currently pending to the bill: an Enzi amendment \nrelating to pharmacies and mail-order prescriptions, and a Bingaman \namendment regarding asset tests. These amendments are being reviewed, \nand we will have one of those votes some time early today. The other we \nwill be voting on over the course of today. In addition, of course, we \nwill be considering other amendments both today and tomorrow.\n  The chairman and ranking member will continue to work together to try \nto get Senators to come forth and offer their amendments, or to let \nthem know what those amendments will be so we can establish a queue for \nthose amendments to be considered today, tomorrow, and, indeed, into \nnext week.\n  I do encourage, as I did yesterday morning, all Members to come \nforward and let the managers know what amendments they are considering \noffering. It is important to do so. For example, today we are waiting \non one of the amendments to get an official scoring back from the \nCongressional Budget Office, so even after we hear about the \namendments, it takes some time to process them. So it is absolutely \ncritical that we hear from our colleagues in terms of what amendments \nthey intend to offer.\n  We will have rollcall votes throughout today's session. We will be \nvoting tomorrow as well.\n  (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8167-6", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUNETEENTH OBSERVANCE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will comment very briefly on two \nissues, the first is on the Juneteenth observance.\n  Madam President, Juneteenth, which is also known as Freedom Day, is \nthe date on which 250,000 slaves living in Texas finally learned of \ntheir emancipation. And that occurred nearly 3 years after President \nLincoln's historic Emancipation Proclamation.\n  It was in 1865, on June 19, that Union General Gordon Granger led \n2,000 troops into Galveston, TX, with news that the war had ended and \nthat slavery had been abolished. He told the people of Texas:\n\n       [T]hat in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive \n     of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an \n     absolute equality of rights and rights of property between \n     former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore \n     existing between them becomes that between employer and free \n     laborer.\n\n  The celebrations that followed began a 140-year tradition. Today, all \nacross the country, Americans of all races will celebrate with prayer, \nand picnics, food, family, and friends.\n  We join them, here on the Senate floor, to celebrate the struggle for \nfreedom and to honor the profound contributions of African Americans to \nour Nation's culture and history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8167-7", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8167-S8169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, one last issue I wish to speak about now \nis one we will be talking about today and tomorrow on the floor of this \nSenate, and that is this whole issue of strengthening and improving \nMedicare.\n  Over the last several days, we have used terms such as ``actuarial \nvalue,'' and ``asset tests.'' We hear those terms again and again. We \nuse acronyms so often. We talk about PPOs and HMOs and waiting on CBO \nfor scoring. All these are important issues and vital issues, technical \nissues that are critical to our decisions that must be made, that we \nare obligated to make and should make to serve seniors in a better way \nwith regard to their health care.\n  But I do want to step back, just for a second, to set the stage for \ntoday's debate, to talk to seniors who might be either watching on C-\nSPAN or listening on the radio, and try to describe\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\nwhat, from a big picture, from sort of 30,000 feet, what this bill is \nall about.\n  When I am back in Tennessee, traveling through the State talking to \nseniors, the questions that I receive are not about reform or private \ncompetition or a market-based approach, and how all that is going to \nwork in the bill. It is not how many stand-alone drug provider plans \nwill be on the table. It is not what we have to think about here, what \nthe 10-year cost is, or even the 20-year cost of the benefits we are \ndiscussing. Those are critical issues, issues that we must address as \nwe address this historic legislation at this very important time, given \nthe demographics, given the fact that we are talking about a health \ncare system that has not kept up with the great advances in the \ndelivery system and the technology and the medical science that have \noccurred over the last 30 years.\n\n  What they ask in these town meetings or in drugstores or when I am \nwalking along on a sidewalk is: How is this going to affect me? I am a \nsenior. I am concerned about my future. I am concerned about if I get \nsick. I am concerned about the fact that if I have an illness now, how \nis it going to affect me?\n  Very quickly, the first thing that will happen is in about 6 months, \nmaybe 7 months after the President signs this legislation and makes it \nlaw of the land, every senior and individual with a disability on \nMedicare--every senior--will have the opportunity to get a little card, \na Medicare prescription drug card. Every senior will be able to benefit \nfrom this little Medicare prescription drug card.\n  When I am talking to a senior, I tell them: You will be able to use \nthis card similar to the way you might have a card for discounts at the \ngrocery store, which is becoming increasingly popular today. We \nestimate that by using that little card--a card you do not have today; \nyou cannot have today because the law does not allow it, but in 6 or 7 \nmonths after this bill is signed into law, you will have a card that \nwill give you a discount of somewhere between 10 and 20 percent, by \nusing that card, compared to the way you are getting your drugs today.\n  That is important to the senior because the senior knows that, yes, \nthis will benefit me. Yes, Government, in a bipartisan way, has \naddressed the fact that the burden before me is huge.\n  Why can we do that? Because by using the combined purchasing power of \nup to 40 million people--instead of an individual senior going into a \nretail store and paying retail dollars for that--all of a sudden that \nsenior, by having that card, becomes part of a huge purchasing group of \nas many as 40 million people.\n  If you are living alone and your income is less than $12,000 or if \nyou are married and you and your spouse bring in less than $16,000, on \nthat little card will be $600 of value you can use each year right off \nthe top. In other words, you not only get a drug discount, but you will \nget an additional subsidy to help offset the cost of those medicines.\n  A senior asks me, How am I going to benefit? You take care of the \ndetails up in Washington, and do it right. But how is it going to \nbenefit me?\n  Second, beginning in the year 2006, all seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities covered by Medicare will be offered comprehensive \nprescription drug coverage. They will have access to a plan that offers \nmore comprehensive coverage, when they ask how it is going to benefit \nthem in the future.\n  Third--and this is what I am most excited about in the entire bill--\nwe have also taken steps to offer seniors and that next generation of \nseniors a strengthened and improved overall Medicare Program. Seniors \nwill have new choices they don't have now to get better coverage that \nmeets their individual needs. They will be able to choose the type of \ncoverage that best suits their needs.\n  They get immediate help, and we do it in a way with a benefit they \ndon't have access to today, and, in addition to that, we expand choice. \nThey will have an opportunity to choose a plan that better meets their \nneeds. This is an exciting improvement in the Medicare Program which \nreally brings it up to a modern type of health care delivery similar \nto--not exactly but similar to--the options we have as Federal \nemployees and that I have as a Member of the Congress.\n  It used to be ``Mediscare.'' The last time we tried, 2 or 3 years \nago, it was ``Mediscare.'' They said, ``Don't change.'' People will try \nto force you into HMOs. Do not trust Government. They are going to \nstrip things away from you.\n  Actually the President mentioned this in a bipartisan meeting with \nSenators yesterday. It is no longer ``Mediscare,'' thank goodness. It \nis Medicare. That is really what we are trying to do in a bipartisan \nway.\n  People say, You want to have your choice of doctors and not be forced \ninto HMOs. That is simply not true. In this bill, if you want to--for \nseniors listening to me--you can keep exactly what you have today in \nterms of your traditional Medicare coverage. You don't have to do \nanything to take advantage of the best choices. You can keep exactly \nwhat you have today. If you stick with what you have, you can get the \nprescription drug benefit along with everybody else, if you want to. In \nother words, keep what you have but take advantage of only prescription \ndrugs. But if you are dissatisfied with your coverage today--and you \nrealize that Medicare really doesn't cover preventive care, it covers \nvery little in the way of chronic disease and management, it does not \ntoday, except Medicare+Choice, an organized, coordinated way of getting \nyour health care--you don't have to, but you will be able to choose the \nexpanded, the more flexible, and the more coordinated kind of coverage \nthat today we clearly have as Federal employees and which also most \nworking people have today, that sort of coordinated care plan.\n  But in Medicare today, you don't have that option. You will have the \noption to get things that are not currently covered by Medicare, such \nas preventive care.\n\n  I mentioned the programs of chronic disease management. There are \nalso programs that promote wellness. Annual physical exams we know are \nso important. Again, whether it is annual or every 18 months, it \nprobably doesn't matter that much. But right now, it is not covered \nunder Medicare. That would be covered in the new program. You will be \nable to have a nurse call you or stay in touch with chronic disease \nmanagement to remind you in case you have forgotten about who it is \ntaking your weight or checking your blood pressure or looking for fluid \nretention and blood pressure, all of which are important. If you pick \nthose up early, it keeps you from being hospitalized or getting sick. \nThat heart is beating. If fluid is building up in your lungs, the heart \nbeats harder and harder. You will have to be admitted to the hospital, \nand you will be trying to catch up. If they pick it up earlier and you \nstay healthy through appropriate management, you will not have to be \nhospitalized.\n  These are the kinds of coordinated benefits most working people have \ntoday and, as I mentioned, which Federal employees have today. It is \nthe sort of benefit we want to make available--not forcing people but \nmaking it available to seniors as well.\n  Our goal in this bill is to allow you to have options so you can \nchoose the kind of coverage and the kinds of doctors and hospitals that \nare most consistent with your needs. That is our goal, to make sure \nthose choices are available for you.\n  In the days to come, we will have a lot of discussion and amendments \nas to how this plan will evolve. That is the whole purpose of having \nthe debate and amendments.\n  As all of us know, the House of Representatives is going full steam \nahead doing exactly the same thing we are doing and developing a plan, \nafter which we will go to conference.\n  This bill represents the largest expansion of the Medicare Program in \nits history. We are going to be spending an additional $400 billion, \nwhich is a hefty sum, in providing this new benefit and strengthening \nthe Medicare Program, and $400 billion is a lot. But the fact is that \nseniors over the next 10 years are going to be spending about $2 \ntrillion on medicines and prescription drugs.\n  We are trying to target the resources of $400 billion in a way that \nmakes the most sense so we can have appropriate benefits for seniors \nwho are less well off and seniors who have very high drug costs so they \nget the most help.\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\n  I am looking forward to the debate. I want America's seniors to be \nable to come back to this picture I have just painted, and I want them \nto understand really these three things.\n  No. 1, if you want to, you can stick with what you have.\n  No. 2, you can, if you want to, stick with what you have but also get \nhelp with your prescription drugs.\n  And, No. 3, you will have for the first time in our Medicare Program \nthe option, the opportunity of choosing a comprehensive, coordinated \nhealth care plan that keeps up with medical advances, with advances in \ntechnology and with advances in health care delivery systems.\n  When we finish this bill, and when we are successful, you will have a \nplan that offers real health security.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8169-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act to make improvements in the Medicare Program, to provide \n     prescription drug coverage under the Medicare Program, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Enzi/Reed Amendment No. 932, to improve disclosure \n     requirements and to increase beneficiary choices.\n       Bingaman Amendment No. 933, to eliminate the application of \n     an asset test for purposes of eligibility for premium and \n     cost-sharing subsidies for low-income beneficiaries.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 933\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise to address the pending Bingaman \namendment because I believe it is important to provide some of the \nbackground as to how we arrived at the asset test that is included in \nthe pending bill before the Senate regarding prescription drug coverage \nand the overall Medicare Program.\n  We learned a lot, as I said initially, from the debate and the \ntripartisan plan we had offered last year. We had included an asset \ntest. That asset test did present a number of problems to colleagues on \nthe other side of the political aisle. We attempted to work it out, but \nobviously it was not to their satisfaction. We had a number of meetings \nduring the course of the debate last fall on the pending legislation, \nbut we were not able to resolve the differences.\n  One of the key contentious issues was the fact that we had an asset \ntest they believed was too encompassing, that it would deny many low-\nincome individuals the ability to have access to the overall drug \ncoverage and the type of subsidy we had included. So we learned from \nthat debate, we learned from the discussions, and we took a far \ndifferent approach this time in this legislation to incorporate the \nlessons that had been learned in developing an asset test.\n  We understand Senator Bingaman's desire to do more for low-income \nbeneficiaries, but we have to keep in mind that we have crafted the \nlegislation within the $400 billion parameter included in the budget \nresolution. We have come a long way in terms of how much we are \nproviding for a prescription drug benefit. Can we do more? Absolutely. \nBut obviously we have to live within the confines of our ability to \nfinance this and so many other obligations.\n  Just 5 years ago we started at $28 billion with then-President \nClinton's proposal. We increased it to $40 billion, to $300 billion, to \n$370 billion. Now we are up to $400 billion as proposed by President \nBush. That is almost $200 billion more than he had originally proposed \nlast year. We have come a long way in this debate.\n  How do we design the best, most effective, fairest low-income subsidy \nassistance? We decided it would be important to provide a universal \nbenefit in the Medicare Program when it came to prescription drug \ncoverage. But also we wanted to ensure that we targeted those who were \nmost in need. That was one of the other principles that was so \nessential in developing the program. That is why we decided to use \nvarious low-income Medicare and Medicaid beneficiary programs that are \nalready enacted and have been part of law, consistent across the board \nwith respect to formulas, and have been used by senior citizens so it \nis something familiar to them.\n  We used the qualified Medicare beneficiaries program, otherwise known \nas QMBs, the select low-income immediate beneficiaries, SLIMBs, and \nqualified individuals, the QI-1 program, to send the highest level of \nassistance with cost premiums, deductibles, and copayments to those \nmost in need. As it exists in current law, we target the assistance to \nbeneficiaries based on both their income and asset level to make sure \nwe are capturing those who truly have the most need.\n  We drop the asset test that was included in the previous tripartisan \nlegislation that would have prevented 40 percent of low-income \nbeneficiaries from receiving coverage. We really address some of the \ninequities and the problems with our previous asset test by including, \nthis time, in this legislation, programs that have already worked for \nseniors who have a very limited asset test.\n\n  For those in the lowest income categories, we are talking $2,000 for \nindividuals, $3,000 for couples. For those from 73 percent to 100 \npercent, we are talking about asset tests between $4,000 for \nindividuals and $6,000 for couples. The same is true for those between \n100 and 135 percent of the poverty level; then for those between 135 \npercent and 160 percent of poverty level, assets again at $4,000 and \n$6,000 for a couple.\n  We think that by establishing consistency with other programs that \nhave worked, we are able to design a fairer approach to the issue in \nterms of eligibility for the low-income subsidy. Also, we are utilizing \nexisting government infrastructure so that we do not divert scarce \ndollars away from beneficiaries to create new Federal or State \nbureaucracies.\n  In developing S. 1, we did look to the lessons we learned from last \nsummer's debate and the negotiations that progressed into the fall. We \nrealized that in constructing the tripartisan plan, we were excluding \nmillions of seniors and disabled Americans from eligibility for the \nlow-income assistance subsidy because their income or assets did not \nmeet the strict guidelines. Obviously, we did that because we were then \nliving within the confines of $370 billion.\n  So we created the new categories for low-income assistance. It goes \nup to 160 percent of poverty level. Again, that is also a change from \nthe tripartisan plan where we put the maximum subsidies up to 150 \npercent of poverty level. So we increased it from 150 to 160 percent of \npoverty level. For an individual that means $15,472 and for a couple \nthat is $20,881, regardless of an individual's assets. We are not even \nusing an asset test for another category below 160 percent of poverty \nlevel so that we are ensured we are capturing everybody who comes \nwithin those poverty guidelines in order to ensure they get the maximum \nsubsidy possible.\n  This new category that we are capturing under the 160 percent and not \nrequiring an asset test will include 8.5 million additional Medicare \nbeneficiaries in 2006 and provide them with very generous assistance. \nThey will not be subject as well to the gap in coverage where they are \nresponsible for 100 percent of the cost of the prescription drugs.\n  This new benefit only requires a $15 deductible compared to the $275 \nfor those above 160 percent of poverty. They have a much more generous \ncost sharing starting at 10 percent, from $51 to the benefit cap of \n$4,500; and from $4,500 until they spend $3,700, they pay a 20 percent \ncopayment. Once they reach the catastrophic cap, the Government will \npay 90 percent of the cost.\n  We clearly did design a program that provides the most assistance to \nthose in most need. I know we always could do more, but obviously we \nhad to stay within the parameters of the $400 billion in designing this \nprogram. There are those on my side of the political aisle who believe \nwe have gone too far in providing the types of subsidies we do. But we \nhave copayments that obviously do help to reduce utilization and\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\noverutilization of the benefit. At the same time, we also understand if \nthese individuals don't have access to any type of prescription drug \ncoverage, then they are going to be denied the ability to have access \nto the most innovative therapies and medications now available to treat \nso many illnesses. If they don't have access to these types of therapy, \nthey can become sicker, which then results in hospitalization, and \nthen, of course, we have a more expensive form of care that does impose \nadditional and exorbitant costs on the Medicare system.\n  So I think in the final analysis we are going to see, by the type of \nbenefit we have provided to the low-income, that they have the ability \nto have access to a prescription drug benefit so that ultimately we can \nrealize savings to the Medicare Program. It is absolutely vital that \nthis benefit be available to those individuals most in need.\n  It is also vital that we have a universal drug benefit, and that is \nwhy we designed the program from that standpoint, embracing the \nuniversal tenet of the Medicare Program. It is important that we do all \nwe can to maintain consistency with the basic tenets and principles of \nthe Medicare Program.\n  Madam President, I believe we have designed a very fair, effective, \ngenerous assistance to those in the low-income category. As I said, we \neven increased it from the tripartisan bill of last year, from 150 \npercent up to 160 percent of poverty level. We essentially removed the \nasset test for those in the categories from 160 percent of income \nlevels and below. We have created consistency by using other low-income \nprograms in the Medicaid and Medicare areas that will not result in any \nconfusion or contradictions among different eligibility standards. So \nwe have really made considerable progress in designing, I think, the \nbest, most effective type of program.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I see the Senator from Missouri in the \nChamber. He wants to speak next. For the information of all Senators, I \nthink we are going to get an amendment offered on the floor shortly. \nBut the sponsor of the amendment has only a very short time that he can \nbe in the Chamber. I urge my friend from Missouri to remember that \nbrevity is the soul of not only wit but sometimes persuasion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's comments. I \nremind him that I have only recently come over from the House and am \nused to speaking in 3-, 4-, and 5-minute bites where necessary. I will \ntry to adhere to the old standard. I know many people want to speak on \nthis important bill. Many have important amendments they want to offer. \nI will not delay the Senate very long.\n  I wanted to come down and speak about this, in part, because this is \na problem which has existed for a long time and has hurt a lot of \npeople, and which I am just very encouraged and pleased to say I \nbelieve this Congress will finally solve.\n  I went into the House of Representatives in 1992 and, as many Members \ndo, I often went to parades in the communities I represented. I enjoyed \nwalking in them and shaking hands with folks. There was one couple with \nwhom I got to shake hands virtually every parade in the city of \nHazelwood. They would sit in the garage watching the parade. I would \nrun up the driveway and visit with them. Every year, we would visit \nabout this issue. They would take a minute--not too long because the \nparade was going by--and tell me of the struggles they were going \nthrough because there was no prescription drug feature to their \nMedicare coverage. They were making the choice that many senior \ncitizens in the State of Missouri have to make every day between the \ncost of their prescription drugs and the cost of other necessities of \nlife.\n  That choice hurts all of us. It hurts them, hurts their families who \nworry about them, and it hurts all of us because they often resolve \nthat dilemma against buying the prescription drugs. Those drugs are \noften medicine they need to stay healthy. It is one of the things that \nis so self-defeating about our current policy because if folks cannot \ntake the drugs they need, they get sick, and then Medicare covers the \ntreatment and it costs a lot more than if we had simply helped them \nstay healthy in the first place.\n  We should not interpret any of this as a slap at Medicare. Medicare \nis a program which has provided important medical care for tens of \nmillions of people for a generation. But it was devised in 1965 when \nnobody had prescription drug coverage. Prescription drugs were not a \nmajor feature of ongoing medical care in those days. Since then, it has \nbecome a very common feature of health insurance to have some kind of \nprescription drug coverage. But we have not updated Medicare to keep \npace with those changes. We have not strengthened and improved Medicare \nas we should have. But now we are going to. That is the good news.\n  That is really the message I wanted to come down here and deliver. To \nme, the legislation is all about the principles and, yes, of course, it \nis about the details, but first you have to try to do the right thing, \nand then you have to check the details to make certain you are trying \nto do the right thing.\n  We need coverage that goes into effect, at least partially, right \naway. Seniors have waited long enough. We have been promising long \nenough, and now we need to deliver. We need coverage that is permanent, \nnot one that sunsets a few years from now. We need voluntary coverage \nin the sense that you don't have to change your coverage if you have \nanother method you like better. This bill qualifies on that count. We \nneed coverage that targets the bulk of its relief for the people who \nneed it the most. This is something that in townhall meetings all over \nMissouri seniors have said this to me. The folks with the lowest income \nand the highest prescription drug costs should get the most relief. \nThis bill makes efforts to achieve that, and I think it largely does.\n\n  We need legislation that has a reasonable system of copays and \ndeductibles for those who can afford them because that is the way we \ncontrol overutilization, and overutilization can be bad for everybody. \nIf too much money that we don't need to spend has to be spent in the \nprescription drug area, that is less money for care for heart patients \nor kidney patients or maintaining the standards at our teaching \nhospitals, which is so important to the quality of Medicare.\n  We need a bill that provides choices for people, one that competes \nfor the business of these seniors, to make certain they are getting the \nhighest quality at the lowest cost that we are capable of providing.\n  There are going to be many amendments offered to this bill. I am \ngoing to vote for some of them. There is one I believe we will see \ntoday that will help make certain that local pharmacies are able to \nparticipate. I think that is a great idea. I will vote for that \namendment. I will vote against some. Some will undoubtedly carry and \nsome will fail.\n  It is my intention to vote for this bill on final passage--almost no \nmatter what. I don't want to sign a complete blank check here, but I \ncannot imagine changes that would be made to the bill that would keep \nme from voting to send this bill on, to move this process forward, to \nbegin keeping the promise we have made over and over and over again in \nthe last few years to that generation of Americans who won the Second \nWorld War, who set up the architecture of containment that won the cold \nwar, and built this country by their work, faith, sweat and, effort. \nThat is what this bill represents to me.\n  I congratulate the Finance Committee, the chairman, and the ranking \nmember for producing this bill. It is, at minimum, a noble effort, a \ngood first step. I think it is probably better than that, but, at \nminimum, it is that. We cannot get to the end if we don't take the \nfirst step. That is what this bill represents. I am pleased to be here \nsupporting it. I hope we can strengthen and improve the bill as we \nstrengthen and improve Medicare, and I am grateful for the opportunity \nto say a few words on the floor.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I apologize to my good friend from \nMissouri. It turns out that the Senator who is going to offer the \namendment is not able to do so at this time.\n  Mr. TALENT. Perhaps I should want to do another 30 minutes or so. I \nam\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\nkidding. I had all the time I needed, and I appreciate the suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I wish to take a few \nminutes to speak about a feature of this prescription drug bill which I \nbelieve is particularly noteworthy, and that is help for low-income \nseniors.\n  The subsidies provided for low-income seniors and disabled people are \nfar more generous and much more humanitarian than many of the proposals \nthe Senate has considered in the past. We know that most seniors who \nsigned up for this new drug program will benefit from assistance with \ntheir prescription drug costs.\n  Many seniors today pay thousands of dollars a year for drugs. That is \ncommon knowledge, and that is a substantial expense to them. It is to \neverybody, but particularly seniors and particularly low-income \nseniors.\n  For 40 percent of our seniors who make less than $15,000 per year, \nthe prescription drug coverage provided by this bill will be truly \nlifesaving. That is, 40 percent of our seniors make less than $15,000 a \nyear.\n  We have all heard stories about poor seniors who eat less so they can \npay for their prescription drugs or who take only half the dosage the \ndoctor recommends. I have seen that. I worked at a drugstore one day. I \nwas really quite taken aback by the number of times the elderly would \nwalk up to the pharmacist and quietly ask the pharmacist whether they \ncould cut back on their prescription because they could not pay for it \nall, and they and the pharmacist would go into a little huddle as to \nwhich drugs to take and which ones not to take. I have seen it \nfirsthand. A lot of us have heard a lot about this. We have heard about \npatients with disabling illnesses who cannot afford the expensive drugs \nthat might slow the progression of a dangerous and unpredictable \ndisease. It is clear, 40 percent of our seniors are making less than \n$15,000. That has to tell us it is a huge problem we have to address.\n  This bill will give some hope to those folks. The bill is an \nimprovement, as I mentioned, over last year's bill. Last year, that \nbill gave seniors generous assistance with cost sharing but up to a \npoint. Once the low-income senior hit the so-called benefit gap--that \nis the donut we are talking about--the bottom fell out of the low-\nincome safety net.\n  Seniors who could hardly afford food and rent would have to be \nresponsible under that bill for half the cost of their drugs, a cost \nthat most obviously could not be assumed. By some estimates, 30 percent \nof low-income seniors would fall into this gap.\n  In the bill before us, low-income seniors remain much better \nprotected in this so-called gap. They pay higher cost sharing in the \nbenefit gap, but their out-of-pocket expense would never go more than \n20 percent above the cost of drugs, and for the lowest income seniors \nwho are not eligible for full Medicaid benefits, cost sharing would not \ngo above 10 percent. I think this is a good improvement.\n  I am also proud the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, and \nI have been able to increase the number of low-income seniors who will \nbenefit from the extra subsidies. Our bill will provide assistance for \nMedicaid beneficiaries up to 160 percent of the Federal poverty level. \nAn amendment was offered in committee to raise the poverty level to \n160 percent. I wish it could go higher, but we are somewhat limited by \nthe $400 billion we are working with in the entire bill. But at least \nwe are up to 160 percent of the Federal poverty level. That means \nbeneficiaries with an annual income of barely over $14,000--that is \nbecause they are not within 160 percent, just slightly over--are still \nstruggling to provide for life's basics.\n\n  Perhaps one of the most important improvements in this bill is the \nassistance it provides for low-income seniors without subjecting them \nto assets tests.\n  Asset levels for elderly Medicaid beneficiaries and so-called QMBs \nand SLMBs are very low. Those are categories depending upon the \npercentage of poverty, so that if an individual has accountable assets \nof over $4,000, they are not eligible for assistance. A couple with \nassets over $6,000 is not eligible for assistance. These asset levels, \nwhich are based on SSI eligibility standards, have not been adjusted \nsince 1989.\n  Asset tests exclude millions of poor Americans from Medicaid, and \nthey would have excluded millions of poor seniors from many of last \nyear's prescription drug subsidies. Think of it, an 80-year-old man \nwith $800 a month in income might not be eligible for any assistance if \nhis brother left him, say, a $10,000 car in his will. If he is married \nand he has paid life insurance premiums his whole life, the policy \ncould prevent him from getting help with prescription drug benefits.\n  This proposal includes a subsidy category that is based only on \nincome, not on assets. It is not as generous as the asset-tested \ncategories, and I wish we could improve that, but it takes an important \nstep toward covering more needy seniors and allowing them the dignity \nof keeping a car or a single precious heirloom.\n  We could do more if we had more money, but we do not have more money. \nWe could eliminate the asset test altogether. We could provide better \nsubsidies in the donut. We could provide more help to people who are \nstill in need but who make $15,000 or $18,000 per year and have high \ndrug costs.\n  Nevertheless, I am proud of the progress we have made over last \nyear's low-income proposals, and I suspect with each new chapter in \nthis prescription drug/Medicare book, we are going to be able to make \nimprovements along the way.\n  This bill is a major improvement over current law. It is a major \nimprovement over the low-income provisions in last year's bill. I urge \nthis body to adopt this proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, the ranking member, Senator Baucus, \nraised a number of valid issues as to how we were able to improve upon \nthe lessons we learned last year from our debate on this most important \nissue regarding asset tests. That was, obviously, one of the areas we \nhad difficulties addressing in a way that would satisfy most of our \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  This year, having drawn upon those lessons, we did craft a proposal \nthat ultimately maximizes the ability of those low-income individuals \nof participating in this program in the fairest way possible, and that \nis not to exclude those who certainly are in need of this type of \nbenefit and certainly are in need of some type of assistance because \nthey do have low incomes. Therefore, I think the asset test is a much \nmore fairer approach, much more equitable, without excluding those who \ncertainly have the need for this type of program.\n  We have come a long way in designing a system that, for the most \npart, will satisfy those who had concerns with the previous provision \nin the tripartisan plan.\n  In fact, Families USA supported our legislation with respect to this \nprovision. I quote from it:\n\n       We congratulate the U.S. Senate for making major \n     improvements in the prescription drug coverage for America's \n     14 million Medicare beneficiaries below 160 percent of \n     poverty.\n\n  They felt it was essential to assist the most vulnerable Medicare \nbeneficiaries, and they, obviously, supported our efforts and thought \nwe should not take any steps to minimize the improvements that have \nbeen made in this legislation with respect to the subsidies included in \nthe pending legislation.\n  I raise another issue I was unable to address yesterday, and that is \nwith respect to the Government fallback provision that is included in \nthe pending legislation. I know there was an amendment that was offered \nby the Senator from Michigan that would provide for a permanent \nfallback because those who argue we should have a permanent option to \nGovernment fallback so seniors can choose under the stand-alone \nprescription drug benefit say it will offer more stability and more \nchoices to seniors.\n  As we worked last year, again drawing upon the lessons with respect \nto a Government fallback, we learned two things. Obviously the \nprovision and the way we addressed it in the tripartisan plan was not \nsatisfactory. We did have\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nlanguage that ensured it guaranteed a seamless approach so seniors \nwould not lose their coverage in the event the private delivery \nmechanism did not work to provide the prescription drug benefit, but \nthat did not satisfy many of the critics with respect to our \nlegislation last fall.\n  On the other hand, we saw how much a Government-run program can cost. \nCBO estimated a Government-run program could cost at least $600 \nbillion, at least based on the bill that had been introduced in the \nSenate, and that we debated with several versions, up to a trillion \ndollars or more. It also sunset in order to mask the true costs because \nagain a Government-run system that has no competition, has no choices, \ndoes not do anything to maximize the efficiency or increase the \ninnovative ways in which the private sector could provide those plans.\n  When one is competing against a Government-run program that has no \nrisk, then the cost goes up. That is at least the way the Congressional \nBudget Office assigned the score to that program. So we had a $600 \nbillion to $1 trillion cost with a Government-run program, because \nthere were no risks involved in that program in implementing that type \nof an approach. It was all performance based, and so therefore it was \ngoing to be much more costly. Then again, it was sunset. After 7 years, \nthe prescription drug benefit under that approach would have been \nsunsetted.\n  It also statutorily limited the number of drugs a senior could \npurchase to two in any therapeutic class. So, again, not only did the \nbenefit sunset but it also limited the choices available to seniors \nwith respect to the types of medications that would be covered under \nthat approach because it was too costly, because it was a Government-\nrun program.\n  On the other hand, we understood it was absolutely essential that \nseniors, regardless of where they lived in America, whether it was in a \nrural area or in an urban area, should have the ability to have a \nprescription drug benefit that was of equal value, that was in the bill \nthat became law. So we did include a Government fallback provision.\n  There were those who felt it did not go far enough or was not \nsufficient to prevent a seamless, uninterrupted approach in terms of \ncoverage.\n  This year, having drawn upon that experience, we designed a different \napproach, and we included a Government fallback. We think the \nGovernment fallback should be the last resort, not the first resort. \nSo, therefore, there have to be two participating in the program with a \ndrug benefit. If that fails, then the Government would step in. If only \none plan participated, the Government would step in and provide a \nfallback. We think this maximizes the approaches in terms of enhancing \ncompetition and choices but at the same time ensuring seniors that no \nmatter what happens, if private plans do not participate in some part \nof the country, they will always have the assurance and the guarantee \nthat they will have access to a prescription drug benefit in the \ncoverage without interruption. So therefore we designed a system that \nincorporated the risk management so we can encourage competition among \nthe private sector plans. We think that is important.\n\n  We also help give the Secretary the flexibility to dial down the risk \neven to nothing in order to encourage private plans to participate. But \nin the event that does not happen, that we do not get two plans at a \nminimum participating and providing choices to seniors in any part of \nthe country in any one of the 10 regions, then certainly the Government \nwould step in and provide the fallback plan. Even if there is only one \nprivate plan that is available, the Government will step in. Again, to \naddress concerns on this side of the aisle with respect to the fact \nthat we are not doing enough to encourage seniors to go into the \nprivate delivery model, we do only allow for a 1-year contract for the \nGovernment fallback, again trying to encourage private plans to \nparticipate in the process.\n  We obviously think if seniors have private plans participating, they \nwill have competition and choices that will maximize the number of \nchoices for seniors across the board similar to what is available to \nMembers of Congress and to Federal employees under the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefits Program. There are a maximum number of choices, an \narray of plans, different types of approaches tailored to the needs of \nseniors either in that particular region or in terms of their medical \nand health care needs.\n  For example, a private plan could design a generic-only plan or it \ncould design a plan that includes the most commonly used drugs for \nmedications. So we have hopes that we not only encourage competition \nbut at the same time provide a fallback for prescription drug benefits.\n  The Secretary has the authority to design that program and negotiate \nthe risks for the plans to make the market as appealing as possible and \nis required to make choices among a number of plans, at least three \nplans for each region. However, if at least two plans are not willing \nto provide services in the region, as I said earlier, the Government \nfallback will be triggered. Once triggered, the Government will enter \ninto a 1-year contract with a fallback company.\n  Further, that leaves one plan that is willing to participate in a \nfallback region. The Secretary may allow that plan to provide coverage \nalongside the Government fallback plan.\n  So we think we have maximized the assurances and the security for \nseniors that, irrespective of where they live in America, they will \nhave access to a prescription drug benefit. The structure of this \nprovision was vital in securing the type of bipartisan support we \nreceived in the Senate Finance Committee, and tripartisan support with \nthe support of Senator Jeffords we were able to achieve in the final \nanalysis. It was a 16-to-5 vote in the Senate Finance Committee because \nwe were able to incorporate the lessons of the past.\n  That is why we designed this type of permanent fallback so that it \ndoes not undermine the costs of the programs. It invites competition \nbut it also provides the assurances to seniors that they will have \nprescription drug benefit regardless of where they live in America, \nregardless of what happens in the private sector. If the private sector \ndoes not play a role, Government most assuredly will. I think we have \ndesigned the maximum amount of security and the least amount of risk to \nseniors in terms of the type of coverage they will receive.\n  I did want to address some of those issues because I do think it is a \nfundamental component of this legislation before us. There has been a \nlot of confusion about what this legislation is and is not, and I \nassure my colleagues that we do have Government protection but at the \nsame time we also do not want to diminish the ability of the private \nsector to play a competitive role. In the event that does not \ntranspire, then we obviously will have the availability of a fallback \nprovided by Government and the maximum amount of authority vested in \nthe Secretary to design that program so it does not jeopardize seniors' \naccess to coverage at any point, especially those seniors who live in \nrural areas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if we can get consent, which I will \noffer in a moment, I intend to offer an amendment which would address \none of the concerns I have with the current bill; that is, the \nuncertainty with regard to the premium itself.\n  Under the bill, it is anticipated the monthly premium paid for by \nbeneficiaries, the beneficiary obligation, would be $35, but there is \nno guarantee that beneficiary figure of $35 is going to be what our \nbeneficiaries are going to pay; it is only an average. The \nCongressional Budget Office that gave the $35 figure cannot state what \nthe range will be that will be charged to beneficiaries. It could be \nlower. Most likely, it could be higher. I am told last year the \nMedicare+Choice plans increased by 15.5 percent. That was just last \nyear alone. If Medicare+Choice premiums increased by 15.5 percent, \nthere is no telling what the figure could be. It could be $40 or $50, \nand I will get into that in a moment.\n  Even the so-called Medicare fallback, available when private plans \nchoose not to serve a community, provides no guarantee. So you do not \nhave any guarantee in the private sector options that will be made \navailable. And if those cannot be made available in a region, the \nMedicare fallback does not\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\noffer any guarantee with regard to what the premium will be either.\n  Initially, we were told by the bill's authors that the fallback plan \nwould have a uniform premium, but in fact it does not have even a \nuniform premium. So not only do we anticipate that it will not be $35, \nwe do not know what it will be. We also know it could be different in \ndifferent areas. We know that Alaska or South Dakota could be forced to \npay a much higher premium than someplace where price and utilization \nfigures could be different; say, Florida. We actually see that right \nnow with Medicare+Choice. Medicare+Choice HMOs offer prescription drug \ncoverage today. According to a report provided to the Congress \nrecently, the premiums in Connecticut, under a Medicare+Choice plan, \ntoday are $99 per month. That same premium is $16 in Florida.\n  So with the experience we have already had in the private sector, the \nMedicare+Choice option, we have seen a dramatic variation in the price \nof the premium for beneficiaries. I fear we are going to see exactly \nthe same thing with the private plans offered through this bill as soon \nas the legislation is implemented.\n  We have two issues: First, we do not know what the premium will cost \nbecause we just have an estimated national average; second, even if \nthere is a national average, we are concerned that there could be a \ndramatic variation from one part of the country to the other. It is \nthat variation, as well as that uncertainty with regard to the premium \nitself, that we are trying to address with the amendment we are \noffering.\n  The way the bill is written, I will state what will likely happen. \nThere are two terms with which I hope people will become more familiar. \nThe first term is the national weighted average premium. That is the \noverall premium cost that must be achieved in order to pay for the \nprivate sector coverage as well as the Medicare backup when the bill is \nimplemented. In other words, the prescription drug companies will \ndetermine, given what the benefit package is, given the utilization \nrates, given the actuarial tables, it will take so much money, divided \nup per person, to pay for the plan once it is implemented.\n\n  There will be two payments. One will be from the Government and the \nother is from the beneficiary. The second part of this term, the \nbeneficiary obligation, is what the senior citizen is going to pay. \nThat is the so-called $35. But the overall premium could be $100. In \nfact, we think it might be in the $100 range. So, under that example, \n$65 would be paid by Government, $35 would be paid for in the premium \nby the beneficiary, the beneficiary obligation.\n  Assume the average is $100 and assume, then, the payment is over by \n$10. Assume the premium is not $100 but it is $110. Under this bill, \nthat $10 extra in the premium is paid all by the beneficiary. That will \nbe added to the beneficiary obligation. So instead of a $35 payment, it \ncould be $45, a 30 percent increase in the premium the Medicare \nbeneficiary will have to pay. That is why there could be a significant \nvariation.\n  So we have these two calculations: The national weighted average \npremium, which we estimate could be around $100; the beneficiary \nobligation, which is $35, roughly, give or take. And of course, as I \nsaid, we do not know what it will be like in some parts of the country. \nIt could be dramatically different, as we have seen with \nMedicare+Choice right now.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 939\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \nset aside and that this amendment be considered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 939.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that an affordable plan is available in all areas)\n\n       On page 103, strike lines 10 through 13 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(B) the lesser of--\n       ``(i) the amount by which the monthly plan premium approved \n     by the Administrator for the plan exceeds the amount of the \n     monthly national average premium; or\n       ``(ii) in the case of an eligible beneficiary who is \n     enrolled in a Medicare Prescription Drug plan that provides \n     standard prescription drug coverage or an actuarially \n     equivalent prescription drug coverage and does not provide \n     additional prescription drug coverage pursuant to section \n     1860D-6(a)(2), an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of \n     the monthly national average premium.\n       On page 77, strike lines 10 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A) In general.--In the case of an eligible beneficiary \n     receiving access to qualified prescription drug coverage \n     through enrollment with an entity with a contract under \n     paragraph (1)(B), the monthly beneficiary obligation of such \n     beneficiary for such enrollment shall be an amount equal to \n     the lesser of--\n       ``(i) the applicable percent (for the area in which the \n     beneficiary resides, as determined under section 1860D-17(c)) \n     of the monthly national average premium (as computed under \n     section 1860D-15) for the year as adjusted using the \n     geographic adjuster under subparagraph (B); or\n       ``(ii) 110 percent of an amount equal to the applicable \n     percent (as determined under section 1860D-17(c) before any \n     adjustment under paragraph (2) of such section) of the \n     monthly national average premium (as computed under section \n     1860D-15 before any adjustment under subsection (b) of such \n     section) for the year.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, basically what our amendment does is \nsimply say: We understand there will be variance. We understand we \ncannot pinpoint with any precision exactly what the cost to the \nbeneficiary is going to be. Why don't we put a cap on what that senior \ncitizen is going to be required to pay, within some reason. If we say \nthe beneficiary obligation is going to be $35 a month, put a 10 percent \ncap on that premium. It can be below to whatever extent. If it comes \ndown to $15, we all ought to celebrate. But if it is going to be more \nthan $35, say that it cannot exceed 10 percent of the average \nbeneficiary obligation.\n  This would give some assurance to senior citizens that they are not \ngoing to be facing dramatically varied costs or facing this \nextraordinary uncertainty with regard to what the premium will be. But \nwithin a 10 percent range, give or take, they will know what their \npremium obligation will be as they make their decision from one year to \nthe next as to what that premium will cost them.\n  This is exactly what we do with Medicare Part B. Right now with \nMedicare Part B, beneficiaries pay $58.70 a month for their physician \nand outpatient care. I might add, that is a consistent figure. It is \nthe same in Alaska and South Dakota as it is in New York and \nCalifornia. That has worked. No one has complained.\n  I don't know that any amendment has ever been offered to suggest \nSouth Dakota ought to pay a different Medicare Part B premium than \nsomeone else. No one has said that having an actual figure every year \nthat seniors can know will be a given cost is something that does not \nwork for physicians. If it works for Medicare Part B, if it works for \nphysicians and outpatient costs, why wouldn't it work for prescription \ndrugs?\n\n  We are actually giving more latitude. We are not saying it has to be \n$35. What we are saying, simply, is let's make sure there is some \ncertainty. Even if it cannot be with the same precision--which, \nfrankly, I think it could be--but if it cannot be the same precision as \nwe expect with Medicare Part B, let's at least say: Give or take 10 \npercent, it has to be in that $35 range. I don't think that is too much \nto ask, with all the uncertainty people are facing today as they \nconsider this.\n  I was just talking on a radio station a few minutes ago, trying to \nexplain what a senior would have to pay. The question was, What does \nthis mean for a senior?\n  Here is what I had to say. I said we think the premium is going to be \n$35. We think the deductible is going to be $275. We think the copay is \ngoing to be 50/50 between the program and the beneficiary with all the \ncharges up to $4,500, and after that we know the benefits are cut off \nuntil you reach about $5,800, and then it kicks on at a 90-percent \nreimbursement rate at $5,800.\n  If I was a 87-year-old citizen listening to the radio, I would say: \nHoly cow, call my accountant. And this is for a drug benefit.\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\n  But that is what we are doing. We are asking the senior citizen \nsomehow to make sense of all this, and then we have to say we don't \neven know if two companies are going to come into your region to \nprovide the benefits in the first place. If they do not, there will be \na Medicare backup and we will give you the details on that later.\n  This just provides a modicum of additional certainty, some degree of \nconfidence that they have some idea, with one of those calculations, of \nthe premium itself, that it is not going to be $45, $55, $65 a month; \nthat it is going to be $35 a month, give or take 10 percent. I do not \nthink that is too much to ask.\n  We had a debate about this legislation in the committee. I was \ndisappointed the amendment was not adopted in committee. I feel so \nstrongly about it I think it is important for the Senate to have an \nopportunity to reconsider the amendment.\n  We got a letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Let me read this letter:\n\n       On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the \n     National Committee . . . I am writing in support of your \n     ``Guaranteed Premium'' amendment to S. 1. The current Senate \n     prescription drug bill, S. 1, does not limit the premium \n     increases, which could potentially subject seniors to \n     dramatic fluctuations in premium costs. Seniors want \n     assurance that their costs will not suddenly skyrocket. Over \n     the past year, premiums for Medicare Plus Choice plans \n     increased 15.5 percent. Seniors need to know what costs they \n     can expect in order to receive a drug benefit. Most seniors \n     are on fixed incomes and even the slightest increase could \n     impose a huge burden on their ability to afford a drug \n     benefit or other necessities, such as food and shelter.\n       We understand your amendment would limit premium increases \n     . . . preventing dramatic changes in price. We agree that \n     seniors have the right to know what they will be paying today \n     and in the future for a drug benefit. . . .\n\n  I will just add one other thought. The letter notes that a slight \nincrease could impose a huge burden on their ability to afford a drug \nbenefit. I have talked literally to hundreds of seniors--maybe even \nthousands by now. I know it is hard for a United States Senator to be \nfully appreciative of what it means to live on Social Security but many \nseniors do. That is their only source of income.\n  We are now telling them in addition to the $58.70 they pay for \nMedicare Part B, there is going to be added to that at least $35, \nprobably more, for a prescription drug benefit. So now we are talking \nabout, not $58, but probably $100, out of whatever Social Security \ncheck they get each month.\n  I have talked to many seniors who have said: For me, it is a choice \nbetween drugs and rent, drugs and groceries.\n  I think we overlook that. I think people minimize the extraordinary \nfinancial impact these charges, these costs have in their daily lives. \nWhat they want is a little more certainty. What they want is a little \nmore assurance that they can make ends meet with these extraordinarily \nlimited budgets within which they live.\n  That is what our amendment does. I am hopeful the Senate will \nconsider it. My hope is that, on a bipartisan basis, we can adopt it \nlater today.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I worked with Senator Baucus all morning, \ngetting people to come and offer amendments.\n  For the information of all Senators and other interested parties, we \nhave a number of very important committees going on--Judiciary, \nCommerce, to name but two. We have people on this side who really want \nto offer amendments, but they are simply unable to do so because of \ntheir other Senate responsibilities today.\n  There will be amendments offered, but we have to get these committees \nout of the way first.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 939, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, yesterday the committee offered a \nmodified version of the bill before us. My amendment does not conform \nto the modified version in terms of page and line numbers. I ask \nunanimous consent that a modified amendment be offered and substituted \nfor the amendment I offered earlier this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 939), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 106, strike lines 11 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(B) the lesser of--\n       ``(i) the amount by which the monthly plan premium approved \n     by the Administrator for the plan exceeds the amount of the \n     monthly national average premium; or\n       ``(ii) in the case of an eligible beneficiary who is \n     enrolled in a Medicare Prescription Drug plan that provides \n     standard prescription drug coverage or an actuarially \n     equivalent prescription drug coverage and does not provide \n     additional prescription drug coverage pursuant to section \n     1860D-6(a)(2), an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of \n     the monthly national average premium.\n       On page 80, strike lines 1 through 12 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A) In general.--In the case of an eligible beneficiary \n     receiving access to qualified prescription drug coverage \n     through enrollment with an entity with a contract under \n     paragraph (1)(B), the monthly beneficiary obligation of such \n     beneficiary for such enrollment shall be an amount equal to \n     the lesser of--\n       ``(i) the applicable percent (for the area in which the \n     beneficiary resides, as determined under section 1860D-17(c)) \n     of the monthly national average premium (as computed under \n     section 1860D-15) for the year as adjusted using the \n     geographic adjuster under subparagraph (B); or\n       ``(ii) 110 percent of an amount equal to the applicable \n     percent (as determined under section 1860D-17(c) before any \n     adjustment under paragraph (2) of such section) of the \n     monthly national average premium (as computed under section \n     1860D-15 before any adjustment under subsection (b) of such \n     section) for the year.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am going to make an opening statement \non this legislation. I understand there are amendments being worked on.\n  First, I commend the President for his leadership. But for his \nleadership on this issue, we would not be here today. The President a \nfew months ago laid out a framework for the reform and improvement and \nstrengthening of the Medicare system which we are using in this \nunderlying bill today. The President said he would be willing to move \nforward with an expansion--a rather expensive expansion, $400 billion \nover the next 10 years of taxpayer dollars--to provide prescription \ndrug benefits for our senior population, outpatient prescription drug \nbenefits. Obviously inpatient prescription drugs are covered but \noutpatient prescription drugs are not. The President said he would be \nwilling to move forward with that. He believes, as I believe everyone \nin this Chamber does, that this is a necessary part of the continuum of \ncare with which seniors, as well as all Americans, should be provided.\n  The question is how do you move forward with a huge dollar expansion \nof a program, Medicare, which is already $14 trillion short in revenues \nover the next 50-plus years? How do you move forward with a bill or an \nidea that is going to expand this program and create another unfunded \nliability of $3 to $4 trillion?\n  What does that mean? That means the money coming into the Medicare \nsystem is going to be insufficient to cover the additional expenditures \nwe are going to put on the system with this bill to the tune of $3 or \n$4 trillion over the next 50 years. How do you justify adding this \nexpense to a program that is already $14 trillion short in revenues?\n\n  The President said, I justify this because, No. 1, we need to do it. \nIt makes no sense to have seniors receive care\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\nthat is not the best quality or not necessarily recommended from the \nstandpoint of what a physician would recommend but is done because the \nalternative pharmaceutical product is not covered under Medicare. They \nwill do things that may not be the best quality care or may not be \ncalled for, just because it is covered, as opposed to something that is \nnot covered. This is an important benefit that needs to be provided. \nBut how do you justify that to the American public and future \ntaxpayers?\n  The President said we need to balance that future expenditure with an \nimprovement to the system, an improvement in terms of efficiency in the \nsystem to make the system work better from two perspectives: No. 1, \nfrom the perspective of efficiency so the money we are putting in to \nthe system is used more efficiently and, No. 2, that we provide better \nquality, that the quality of care improves under the changes we hope to \nmake in the Medicare system.\n  The President set out with those two goals, provide a prescription \ndrug benefit but improve the efficiency and the quality of the Medicare \nsystem going forward. He had other goals, but I would argue those are \nthe two big, overriding ones. So he put forward a model.\n  He understood the way you improve efficiency in this country is not \nto have the Government run the operation. The way you improve the \nefficiency is to marry what Government does well with what the private \nsector does well. What Government does well is guarantee a stream of \nfunding and provide oversight, regulation--or refereeing, if you will--\nto the private sector. What the private sector does well is compete to \ndrive down costs. Competition drives down costs. And it responds to the \nconsumer in front of you, responds to the person with whom you have to \ndeal. Because if you do not treat your patient well or your insured \nwell, then you will lose their business.\n  Under Medicare today, Medicare cannot lose the senior's business. You \nhave one Medicare plan. It is what it is. If you don't like it, tough. \nThat is it. People cannot walk, by and large. In a few communities they \nhave Medicare+Choice but just in some urban areas in this country. By \nand large, Medicare has a monopoly and they treat beneficiaries just \nlike all monopolies treat beneficiaries--not well.\n  What we want is to have a system in place where we have private \nsector insurance plans that have to treat you well, have to design \nbenefit packages you want; otherwise, they are not going to get your \nbusiness. If they do not get your business, they do not survive. We \nbelieve that will improve the quality of the medicine that is going to \nbe practiced. But it will also improve the efficiency of the health \ncare system.\n  The tradeoff, and an important one, to adding benefits to this \nalready cash-starved program was to put some things in place that over \nthe long term will result in more efficiency and better quality care \nfor our seniors. So the President put up a model which is doing that \nright now. The model is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan that \nthe Presiding Officer from South Carolina and myself are under--with \nthe exception of the pages. I don't know for sure whether they have \ncoverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. I don't \nknow. I don't think they do. Maybe they do. All the other people in \nthis Chamber who are employees of the Senate have health coverage \nthrough their Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It is a system \nthat marries what the Government does well, which is a steady stream of \nfunding, and an oversight board to make sure the private sector is \ndoing things properly--and with competition. They let each region in \nwhich the Federal employees health benefit system offers plans \ncontract. People come and bid for business. The companies that \nparticipate in the Federal employees health benefit system go out and \nmarket to Federal employees in the region to get them to sign up to \ntheir plan. If they don't do a good job, people do not sign up for \ntheir plan. If they don't offer a good benefit package, if they don't \nservice the beneficiaries well, then they lose business and move on. \nAnd someone else comes and picks up the slack. It is a good combination \nof public-private partnership to get quality benefits and efficiency of \ntaxpayer dollars and a reliable benefit for Federal employees.\n\n  The President saw this as a good model to move Medicare--which is \nright now a one-size-fits-all Government program run out of Baltimore, \nMD, and here in Washington, DC. Prices are set here for all of the \ncountry--what is going to be reimbursed, what is not going to be \nreimbursed, what technology is going to be available, what medical \ntechnology will not be available, what drugs will be available, and \nwhat drugs will not be available. Everything is run out of central \nplanning here.\n  The average time it takes for Medicare to have a new technology \napproved is roughly 18 months at the earliest and 3 or 5 years at the \nlatest. The turnover rate for a change in medical technology is 18 \nmonths to 2 years. Just about the time Medicare has the approval of a \nnew technology, it is replaced.\n  We are always behind. Why? Because it is a bureaucracy. Guess what. \nThey don't have to compete for your business. If you do not like it, \ntough. You have no choice. If you want health care coverage as a \nsenior, this is what you get. It is not consumer friendly. It is not \npatient friendly because there is no incentive to be.\n  We want to marry these two concepts--public and private, the good \nparts of both.\n  When the President put this plan out, some complained that what we \nput out wasn't detailed enough. I know many of us in the Senate urged \nthe President not to be very detailed. His job is to provide the vision \nand the overall goal and structure by which we can accomplish it in \nvery broad-brush terms. What we have been doing for the last few weeks \nis figuring out how precisely we get that done. It is very complicated. \nIt is very difficult. We are working through a lot of those issues \nright now.\n  I think we took a very good step and a big step in the right \ndirection in the Senate Finance Committee. That is the next group which \nI would like to congratulate--the chairman, Senator Grassley, and the \nranking member, Senator Baucus--for working together in a bipartisan \nway.\n  The President put forth a plan that he argued--and I think it has \nbeen proven out--is the basis for a bipartisan compromise.\n\n  ``Mediscare'' has been used in this Chamber and across this country \nfor far too long. It is time to get down to solving the problem. That \nmeans we have to try to put something together that brings the two \nparties together. The President put out a plan that lays the \nfoundation. Now it is our job to continue that work.\n  I think with the vote in the Senate Finance Committee of 16 to 5, you \nsaw that there is a foundation which has now been flushed out \nconsiderably on the Senate floor as a solid one on which to build this \nservice. There are still a lot of problems.\n  I don't want to paint this as a rosy scenario and that we are going \nto walk arm in arm down the aisle for a bill signing in the next day or \ntwo. There are a lot of issues we have to go through. The ones that \nconcern many on this side of the aisle and yet to be resolved are \nissues that go to the underlying premise of what the President is \ntrying to accomplish.\n  I talked about the President wanting to add this very expensive and \nneeded benefit onto this program but at the same time providing some \nimprovements to the system--marrying the private and public sector so \nwe would have long-term stability in this program.\n  There are concerns on this side of the aisle that while we have \naccomplished the first--that is, we have added $402 billion worth of \nnew drug benefits--we may not have done enough to make sure this new \nsystem that mirrors the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, a \ncombination of the public-private, as opposed to just the solely \npublic. But this new system was written in a way for it to succeed.\n  We are working through that process right now to make sure we don't \ngo forward with a plan which simply adds a drug benefit to a \nmonopolistic, publicly run, bureaucratically run health care system--\nMedicare--and simply add more costs to it without the improvements in \nefficiency and quality that, frankly, beneficiaries deserve and that \nthe public should demand.\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\n  We have some work to do. A lot of Members on our side are very \nconcerned about that balance because it is important. The big stumbling \nblock on this side of the aisle has always been of adding a new benefit \nthat has never existed. Universally, people here believe we need to \nextend outpatient prescription drug benefits to seniors. But the real \nquestion is, How do we deliver that benefit? Candidly, how do we \nimprove the Medicare system that was designed in the mid-1960s? It was \ndesigned after a 1965 Blue Cross plan that exists nowhere in the \n``wild,'' if you will--only in the zoo here in the U.S. Capitol--which \nis Medicare. But it does not exist in the ``wild'' anymore because it \ncouldn't survive. It became extinct because it could not compete with \nall the other species out there that were offering better benefits at \nhigher quality and at lower costs.\n  This dinosaur--this 1965 Blue Cross plan--became extinct in the \n``wild.'' But only in the laboratory of the Government here in \nWashington, DC, has this dinosaur been able to survive. Does it survive \nand thrive? No, it does not. Is it reproducing? No. It will be \nreproduced nowhere. The only place this will ever survive is in this \nenvironment of the Federal Government.\n  What we need to do is understand that there are better species out \nthere. There are better models out there. There are improvements as to \nhow we deliver quality care and better responses that beneficiaries \nneed through the insurance process. We need to implement those. I would \nargue that we need to implement them quickly. We need to get as many \npeople as possible into those better models. I don't see too many \npeople driving around in a 1965 Plymouth Fury. People do not drive them \nanymore. They are driving newer models and technologically innovative \nautomobiles that have responded to consumer demands and they have \nimproved as a result.\n\n  That has not happened in Medicare. We need to get people into a much \nmore efficient, quality-oriented model for them to ``drive'' through \ntheir senior years. That is what we are attempting to do. But if we do \nnot do that--and in the past, when we looked at all these bills, \nwhether it was in the last session of Congress or in previous sessions \nof Congress, we were never willing to get out of the 1965 ``car.'' We \nalways wanted to keep more and more people, with more and more demands, \nand with there being more and more complexity, ``driving'' in this old \nvehicle that does not work well.\n  It is on its last leg. As I said before, using the animal analogy, it \ndoes not survive in the ``wild.'' We want something that can survive in \nthe ``wild.'' Why? Because the private sector has evolved to be \nresponsive to the needs of our people. So as new technologies come into \nplay--where it takes 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 years for Medicare to figure out \nit is a good idea--the private sector, because they have the pressure \nof knowing people can leave their plans, can look at it and say, yes, \nwe will reimburse this right away because it is better quality, \nprobably better value, and it may lead to lower costs somewhere else. \nMedicare does not do that. It is not that they can't do it; they don't \ndo it.\n  So we will have plans in place that change as medicine changes. And \nthat quality is what seniors deserve. But we have to make sure the bill \nis structured to make sure these plans have the resources and don't \nhave the regulatory ropes to constrain them to where they can't \nsurvive.\n  So it is a major issue. It is one that is being debated as we speak \nin a lot of places around this Capitol as to how we structure this \nsystem. I know there are many people on the other side of the aisle who \nwould not like to see this system exist. They have been very clear \nabout that. They want a continuation of the ``extinct dinosaur'' that \ncan survive nowhere in the ``wild'' as being a model by which we can \nmodel this plan after to deliver this benefit.\n  Or the 1965 Plymouth, you don't see very many of them around. Why? \nThe consumer wants something different, better, higher quality, more \nefficient. That is what we are trying to accomplish here. I understand \nthere is opposition over there. I understand people want to stay with \nwhat they are comfortable with. Unfortunately, for lots of years, \nseniors have been scared into believing that any change is bad, that we \nare going to destroy Medicare or have Medicare go away. Candidly, \nmodels of cars change, animals evolve, we change based on technology, \ninnovation, improvement, and Medicare needs to do the same. It needs to \nhave the ability to do the same. That should not scare the American \npublic. It should be that we give seniors the kind of quality health \ncare system they deserve, that every other American has in the private \nsector who has private-sector insurance, which is available to them. So \nwe are making a good start. We have a little ways to go.\n  We have to make sure that what is the highest priority on this side \nof the aisle--which is to have a balance between a drug benefit and \nimprovements to the system--is maintained in this bill. I know that \nisn't the highest priority for many on the other side of the aisle. \nThank goodness there are more than a handful of Members on the other \nside of the aisle who understand the need to accomplish both these \ngoals. That is what bipartisan consensus is formed on.\n  I hope we can continue down that road and keep this bill centered, by \naccomplishing both missions, not just what one party really wants or \nwhat the other party is really seeking but both missions. If we can do \nthat, if we can have a balanced bill, then we will pass this bill by an \noverwhelming margin. If we have a bill that ultimately is going to rely \non a ``1965 Plymouth'' or a ``dinosaur'' to deliver benefits, then it \nis not going to be a bipartisan bill and there will not be any bill at \nall.\n  We need to have both. Seniors deserve both. Taxpayers deserve both. \nFuture generations, who are going to be dealing with this unfunded \nliability, deserve both. And we have a responsibility to deliver that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, while we have been in the quorum call, \nthere are a lot of negotiations underway in terms of various amendments \nbeing brought to the floor and the ones that are currently here. While \nI have an opportunity, I want to spend a few moments on a couple of \ncharts I know have helped me and I believe will help my colleagues and \nothers who are paying attention to the debate as to why we are looking \nat real changes in Medicare and why such changes will result in \nstrengthening and improving Medicare in a way that we just did not do \n5, 10, or 15 years ago and why the time is now for us to act.\n  Yesterday, I talked a little bit about the history and the advances \nthat have taken place since 1965, when Medicare was enacted. The \nadvances have been huge. The point I had begun to make was that the \nadvances in health care, health care delivery, medical technology, and \nscience have been huge and dramatic, but at the same time the \nstructure, the system, has been almost frozen in a 1965 model.\n  I will use three consecutive charts. The X axis here will be time, \n1965, when Medicare was first enacted, and the present date here, 2003 \nor 2005. Then on this vertical axis--this is subjective--is change. It \nis modernization. It is advances. It is differences from 1965 to where \nwe are today. With the third chart, I will put this together.\n  Referring to the first chart--this is change; this is time--Medicare \nwas enacted in 1965. Things didn't change very much in the system until \n1972, when coverage was expanded for individuals with disabilities and \nfor a subpopulation that had been missed but was growing, and that is \npeople with kidney failure, called ESRD, end stage renal disease. That \nwas a pretty dramatic change in the system because we changed the \nentitlement nature and we expanded coverage. We are doing a little bit \nof that on the floor this week and next week. I will come back to that.\n  It was a reasonable change. In terms of overall change, it wasn't a \nbig change. Then things went for another 13 years, to 1985, until we \nhad the next big structural change in the way health care is delivered \nto our seniors.\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\nThat change--we ratchet it up a little bit here in 1985--we had what is \ncalled prospective payment for hospitals, inpatient hospitalization. So \nif you had a patient in a hospital, instead of just reimbursing \nwhatever cost went through, we sat back and said: What should a patient \nwith a certain diagnosis--say, heart disease, or it could be ischemic \nheart disease--if you took all the patients coming through, what is a \nreasonable price, looking at everything we knew at that point in time, \nto reimburse the hospital.\n  That is called the prospective payment system, PPS, for inpatient \nhospitals. That was an innovative change that was important to overall \nhealth care delivery in the system.\n  Then we had several references to what happened in 1988 and 1989. In \nfact, a lot of people have said to me: We will have to be very careful \nwith what we do; otherwise, we will repeat what happened in 1988 and \n1989. Here we had enactment. We passed a bill and then repealed \ncatastrophic coverage, meaning high out-of-pocket expenditures if there \nwas a tragic, unexpected event or an automobile accident where health \ncare costs were just huge, that there would be some limit there. It was \nnobody's fault. You would have some insurance there to cap how much you \ntake out of your pocket to pay for that catastrophic event in one's \nlife.\n  Here I have a line coming up. And since we repealed it, I have a line \ngoing back down. So we attempted a pretty big change at the time, but \nfor all sorts of reasons the system was not quite ready for it and, \ntherefore, it was enacted and then shortly thereafter, in 1989, \nrepealed.\n\n  Then things didn't change very much until the late 1980s and we had \nadded a prospective payment system for physicians. I mentioned that we \ndid it for hospitals in 1985. So again, we ratcheted up, and the system \nchanged. It was modernized; it was improved in the late 1980s.\n  Since then, we had some other types of changes that didn't \ndramatically change the system in terms of the way health care is \ndelivered to our seniors but did affect it dramatically. We had the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. We had what is called Medicare+Choice \nwhich is predominantly an HMO. What we are talking about in the bill on \nthe floor is not health maintenance organizations. We are talking about \na newer, more up-to-date way than HMOs of delivering care called PPOs, \nwhich is a preferred provider way of delivering care. It is very \ndifferent.\n  This is Medicare+Choice, HMO delivery, in 1997. Today, there are \nabout 5 million people in HMOs and Medicare, and although those numbers \nare falling over time, it is because there are fewer HMOs offering it \nbecause of the regulations, the way we reimburse. But the people who \nare in the HMOs, those 5 million seniors, are very pleased with those \nplans in the aggregate. We did some other prospective payment changes \nhere but not much change.\n  The point of this graph is that since 1965, the Medicare system, a \ngreat system that has served people very well, has not changed very \nmuch at a time--and this is what is on the next chart--when technology, \nmedical science, medical advances have all been really quite dramatic \nover this same period. Indeed, if you look, again, from 1965 to 2003, \nyou see there has been huge growth in health care advances, both \nscience and technology, what we know, the human genome project, \ndelivery of care directly.\n  For example, in 1967, there was the first successful heart transplant \nand the first liver transplant. I put that on there because that is \nwhat I did before coming to the Senate. In 1969, we developed a \ngenetically engineered vaccine. We are trying to go back and pass new \nlegislation called BioShield. As soon as we get finished with Medicare, \nwe have to come back to that legislation because it looks at the \nimportance of vaccines to fight bioterrorism, SARS, and other \nillnesses.\n  In 1974, this body passed the HMO Act, a new type of delivery system. \nIt hasn't worked out quite as well as anybody would have liked, but it \nwas important to try to deliver health care more efficiently. In 1977, \ncoronary angioplasty developed, where you put these stints in the \nheart. Before then, it had never been done.\n  In 1984, we talked about HIV/AIDS on the floor. I was a resident at \nthat time, working up in Boston, MA. We didn't even know what that \nvirus was, HIV/AIDS. Since 1981, 23 million people have died from this \nvirus we identified not that long ago. We responded on this floor in a \nvery admirable, bipartisan way, following the leadership of the \nPresident. We passed a public health bill that targets this HIV/AIDS \nvirus throughout the world.\n  The first successful single lung transplant was in 1983.\n  In 1985 came preferred provider organizations, a new type of health \ncare delivery system. Over a million people were enrolled.\n  I will jump up to 1998. Now 90 million people are enrolled in this \nentity that was invented in 1985. Remember, Medicare hadn't changed at \nall. Medicare doesn't have PPOs in it today, except in a few \ndemonstration projects.\n  Prozac, in 1988, had a revolutionary effect on people when \nappropriately prescribed for certain disorders.\n  In 1987, there was the first cloned adult animal, Dolly. We remember \nthat. It brings up all sorts of issues we will be coming back to \neventually here, including the appropriate role of the cloning, stem \ncells, and all of the issues that are before us.\n  In 1997, 85 percent were enrolled in managed care. It did not exist \nin 1965 or 1970. Yet there was 85 percent enrollment in 1997.\n  The human genome project--the Senator from New Mexico just walked in \nand he is, in my mind, the father of this project. It finished 2 years \nahead of schedule, under budget. It really started as an idea here, or \nwas captured as an idea on the floor of the Senate by the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico and others as well. Since that point in time, \nover a 10-year period, there are 3 billion bits of information we now \nknow that we didn't know 10 years ago. There have been tremendous \nadvances, and it opens up a whole new spectrum of innovation, \ncreativity, and technology to benefit untreatable diseases today. This \nhuman genome project is exciting.\n  The challenge we have today is to have a Medicare system that can \ncapture that innovation, that technology, and what we learned in better \nhealth care delivery, and right now Medicare doesn't do that. Medicare \nis not designed to do that. Thus, as we look ahead, we need to \nstrengthen and improve Medicare. Now we have the opportunity.\n  If you put these two charts together, it explains why we are on this \nbill and why we are working hard to negotiate this bill in a way that \nis bipartisan and looks at health care security for seniors. That is \nwhat we want on both sides of the aisle. Shown in red on this chart, \nMedicare has not changed very much over the last 35 years. Yet we have \nhealth care delivery, and science and technology, pharmaceutical \nresearch, and heart surgery, lung surgery, and coronary artery bypass \nsurgery wasn't done in 1965, period. Medicare has not changed at all. \nHealth care advances have changed dramatically and will change even \nmore, and it is this gap--for our seniors we are talking about--that we \nare addressing.\n  How can we sufficiently change Medicare so the line will come up and \nwe can be more in sync with health care advances and health delivery \nadvances with a system that is flexible enough to capture them--whether \nit is treatment for mental illnesses or whether it is preventive care. \nThere is no preventive care in Medicare today. There is no protection \nfor catastrophic coverage. There is no chronic disease management. Yet \nour health care delivery system knows that is the most effective way to \ntreat seniors and, indeed, everybody in terms of health care.\n  So what is the response? The gap is what conceptually has changed. I \ndon't have numbers over on this side of the chart because it is \nconcepts. But at least what we are trying to do is bring that forward. \nWhat are we going to do? I will go through this quickly. We have \nseniors today--this is Medicare today--who have two choices. There is \ntraditional Medicare, with 35 million in the program. These are seniors \nand individuals with disabilities, those two groups. Five million \npeople are in Medicare+Choice. We brought that forward about 5 years \nago. Those 5 million are pretty satisfied. They are mainly HMOs, that 5 \nmillion. So 35 million are in traditional Medicare, what we call fee \nfor service. It is this traditional Medicare that really has not \nchanged\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nmuch since 1965. There have been some changes but not many.\n\n  The next question is, if this legislation is passed, after we amend \nit and pull things together, what are we going to have in 8 months or a \nyear from now? That will be this chart. It is going to be the same \nformat for the next two charts. We will have, again, traditional \nMedicare, with 35 million people, and 5 million people in \nMedicare+Choice. This will alter a little bit. The addition to this \nwill be the prescription drug card. Maybe 6 to 9 months from the time \nthe bill is signed, every senior will have access to a prescription \ndrug card that will allow that senior to go into a pharmacy, a retail \noutlet, or a mail order house and, with that card being used, will be \ngiven a discount of maybe 10, 15, 20 percent. That will be within--I \ndon't know--6 to 8 months when that will take place, while the rest of \nthe system is being modernized. That is in 2004.\n  People need help now. We can give them help now. I mentioned some \nfigures earlier. If you are low income, this prescription drug card can \nbe used just straight right off the top as a benefit. Then the last \nchart----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Leader, every time you pointed to this group, the \nmost important fact about it is they don't have any prescription drugs. \nWhen you talk about the other groups, they may have. But this group \ndoesn't have any today.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. In response to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, he is exactly right. We are talking about health care \nsecurity for individuals, and 35 million seniors who are choosing this \nparticular plan today do not have access. They have no choice. Even if \nthey wanted it through Medicare, they cannot get it. That is the \nbenefit--the prescription drug card--that we are initially going to \nreach out with to help every single senior.\n  People with low incomes will get a lot more help than wealthy people. \nEvery senior will have access to the prescription drug card. On the \nlast chart, we will show what happens 2\\1/2\\ years from now. This will \nbe Medicare in 2006. This is exciting. Seniors, after using the \nprescription drug card about 2 years, will stop using that because, by \nthen, we will have designed a system that does the following:\n  Those people, just as the distinguished Senator from New Mexico said, \nwho chose traditional Medicare can keep it. They can keep exactly what \nthey had, but they will have access to a new prescription drug \ninsurance plan. They don't have this now. We are going to add that. \nSome people say they don't want all these choices. ``I am fine, Dr. \nFrist, Senator Frist. Let me keep what I have. I am 80 years old and I \njust want exactly what I have. I am doing fine.''\n  We are going to be able to tell them they can keep what they have, \nbut if they would like, they can have access to prescription drugs. The \ngreen here represents prescription drugs. Medicare+Choice, which is \nmainly HMOs, already has prescription drugs--almost all of them. The \nvalue is about $600 today, if you choose this. Only 5 million people \nchose this, and 35 million are in that. We will really double the \nvalue. If you want to stay in Medicare+Choice, the actuarial value--I \nreally hate using these words--you are going to get this much benefit, \nand you are going to have this much benefit.\n  Or--this is the exciting part--we have the entities that build upon \nall the rapid advances of the last 20 to 30 years that is state of the \nart. That is why it is so important to get the best Democrats have to \noffer, the best Republicans have to offer, the best of the private \nsector, the best of the administration to make sure this is designed \nwell with state-of-the-art technology, the most modern, the fairest, \nthe most equitable--this is where a lot of the debate is going to be.\n  People can stay in traditional Medicare, choose Medicare+Choice, or \nchoose these new PPOs. The PPOs will have prescription drug insurance \nas part of integrated health care and coordinated care where they have \nteams of doctors and chronic disease management, with nurses who are \nintegrated into a team who may call a patient once a week to make sure \nthey have not picked up too much weight. When you pick up weight, that \nmeans you are retaining water, and you could develop congestive heart \nfailure.\n  They actually will have chronic disease management and preventive \ncare. Remember, there is no preventive care in Medicare. There is no \ncoordination in Medicare. If you have chest pain, it may be esophagitis \nor indigestion, and you might go see Bill Frist, the heart surgeon, \nbecause it is in your chest. That is what you do in Medicare. You go to \nBill Frist, the heart surgeon. I know a lot about heart surgery and \nfixing a heart, but I do not know that much, to be honest with you, \nabout indigestion. Yet people will come see me when I practice. That \ncoordination is fragmented, it is disjointed, and that is what we will \ngive away by giving this option of the PPOs. That is pretty much it.\n  The debate is how many people will move from traditional Medicare to \nMedicare+Choice or PPOs. Should there be incentives for people to move \nsince we know PPOs are a higher quality of care in terms of objective \nmanagement?\n  It only makes sense, if you coordinate people's care, you have \npreventive medicine built into it and chronic disease management. It is \ngoing to be hard to argue that the care is not there. But what sort of \nincentives? That is where much of the debate will be.\n  Initially, the debate was maybe the prescription drug package over \nhere should be more available than this one and people will gravitate. \nThe underlying bill does not have that happen. This Medicare benefit \nfor drugs is the same as the Medicare+Choice benefit and the same as \nthe PPO benefit.\n  That is the way I look at this issue. It keeps it simple, which I \nneed as we go through this debate. Now we are down to filling in the \ndetails to make this system work.\n  I am very optimistic that this will be what seniors have access to in \n2006, but it will not happen unless we do our work over the next 10 \ndays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to my \ndistinguished colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I was watching the majority \nleader's discussion in my Senate office. I was so pleased that he chose \nto give the history of Medicare and his personal understanding of where \nwe are that I thought I should come down and be present, at least as he \nfinished.\n  I congratulate Senator Frist. I am going to say something that is \nperhaps outrageous. I do not think it is possible that previous \nSenates, as they passed great health care programs--Medicaid, \nMedicare--or when they passed Social Security in the Franklin Roosevelt \ndays, I do not believe there can possibly be a Congressional Record \nthat has an explanation of something as complicated as this that is as \ncompetent, as good, as understandable as this, and I commend Senator \nFrist for that.\n\n  First of all, Senator Frist understands the issue. Second, we are \nvery fortunate that he happens to be a great doctor who decided to be a \nSenator. That does not happen very often either in history. Combine the \ntwo, and then we were pretty fortunate--we Republicans, and then the \nSenate--that we elected him as leader.\n  Frankly, as his good friend, the truth is, Senator Frist had not been \naround here long enough to be the leader. But we picked him anyway. How \nlucky we are. Frankly, he has not missed a step. This year will end, as \nit started, with one success after another because of his leadership.\n  This bill will pass. Seniors will know more about this program than \nany comparable program because of Senator Frist, because of the way he \nhas handled it. As a matter of fact, those who talk to America on all \nthe talk shows, whether they are for this or against it, whether they \ncall it too liberal, too generous, whether they call it wrongheaded, \nwhether they call it a Kennedy program that Republicans have been \nsuckered into--whatever they are saying out there, the truth is, it is \nvery bipartisan, and there is nothing wrong with that.\n  I was telling Senator Frist the other day that Social Security and \nMedicare heretofore in our history were not passed with equanimity of \nsupport.\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\nHowever, once they were passed, regardless of what has been said \npartisan-wise out there, the support has been just about the same by \nDemocrats and Republicans for Medicare funding and Social Security \nfunding. We have all agreed to save Medicare and save Social Security. \nIt is just about Democrats and Republicans doing the same thing because \nit seems that somehow the seniors of the country bring us together. We \nend up being one, and that is happening here.\n  The Senator would admit, would he not, that we are taking a chance \nbecause we are drafting something enormous, and a huge portion of it is \ngoing to have to be administered by both private companies and by the \nGovernment. It would seem that we are trying in these models to give \nour seniors choice, to build into a model something we have left out of \nmedical practice, and that is preventive medicine and group practice.\n  The majority leader gave an example of where perhaps somebody who is \nsick will actually be treated by a team if they are in a PPO. That does \nnot happen today unless it is an extraordinary fee-for-service doctor \nwho has a lot more than just a doctor's office but has all the \nequipment and two nurses who are treating people. We also are hoping \npeople will say they are comfortable, but maybe they ought to move over \nand try this broader scope of coverage.\n  I will tell all of my colleagues that my good friend, the leader, \nknows a lot about my ailments. I have been pretty sick for the last few \nyears; in fact, for 4\\1/2\\ years. I have something wrong with my hand \nthat causes unabated pain and the leader has been very helpful to me. \nThe other day he was explaining the PPO system to me. He slipped and \ntalked to me as one of America's senior citizens. He started laughing \nas he said it. He said: Well, you are, aren't you?\n  I said: That's true, I am. I'm 71.\n  He laughed and said: It would not be too easy to tell you, Senator, \njust move on over and get into a PPO. I said to him it would not be \neasy. I want to be honest, it is not going to be easy for a lot of \nsenior citizens.\n  The point is, they are going to find out from their neighbors, their \nfriends, through their relatives, and, if it is done right, from their \ndoctors, that moving from traditional Medicare to the PPOs, the group \ncoverage which will also have the same prescription coverage, is a \nbetter way for more Americans.\n  That is our hope. As a matter of fact, I think I am correct that is \nthe hope of the system. That has to happen if this new system is going \nto work properly. I ask the Senator, is that a fair assumption?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, I believe it is. Some people \nwould say, no, we can make everything work and improve on everything. \nIn terms of the demographic shift, the fact is, we have doubled the \nnumber of seniors. It is unprecedented. It never has happened in the \nhistory of this country, or indeed in the world, where a country has \ndoubled the number of seniors over a 30-year period, going from 40 \nmillion seniors to approximately 78--really about 37 million to 77 \nmillion. At the same time, we have not half but a diminishing number of \nworkers paying into the system.\n  I argue that this is done on quality of care. I just know if one gets \ninto a system where they have a doctor talking to a nurse, a doctor \ntalking to a specialist, that they have preventive care, they have a \nnurse who specializes in chronic disease management--which is the whole \npurpose of this coordinated care, that they are getting a higher \nquality of care.\n  In addition to that, it is a more efficient system. Choice is going \nto allow people to go to the systems that give the best care, and with \nthat it is sustainable over time because it allows an element of the \nmarketplace to work.\n  The marketplace is nothing more than rational people making rational \ndecisions, and it might be to stay in traditional Medicare. But the \nargument would be if someone is getting better care over here and \nbetter value over time, the PPO model will attract people.\n  The other point I should at least mention, and the reason why I know \nit can work, is that people who are near seniors say they are 64 years \nof age and they become 65 years of age about 80 percent of them have \nsimilar type plans, although not exactly. They have employer-sponsored \nplans. So when they get to be 65--not the Senator from New Mexico \nbecause he is in the Federal Government and he is already in a plan \nlike this. We have that advantage. We want to give it to our seniors. \nBut for the person who is 64, soon to be 65, when they make it to 65 \nthey give up their employer-sponsored plan and have to take this \ntraditional Medicare. So what we are going to say is when someone hits \n65----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They can stay there.\n  Mr. FRIST. They can keep that sort of plan. That is why I am so \nconfident that over the next 30 years this will work because that is \nwhat the Senator has, and what I have, and what most employer-sponsored \nplans are. But that is what we are denying seniors and those with \ndisabilities. That is why underneath I am so confident this can work.\n  We have to make this work. We have to improve it and that is what we \ncan do over the next 8, 9, 10 days.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator remember--well, he was not in the \nSenate yet.\n  Mr. FRIST. I was probably in the operating room.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He probably was. The Senator was making those flying \ntrips back and carrying the hearts so he actually could transplant them \nin a timely manner. But when we first started talking about HMOs, there \nwas a big battle going on between whom? The doctors of America and the \nlegislators because the doctors were not accustomed to HMOs. The \ndoctors were all accustomed to what was called traditional care; \nthat is, they themselves ran it. They did not have any kind of group \npractice. They did not have any kind of clinical practice. As a matter \nof fact, we used to have to go home as legislators and meet with \ndoctors and try to convince them that the goal was not to destroy the \nmedical practice but rather to give them an opportunity to practice in \na different way.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Frankly, what was being said in this Chamber--not as \nwell as the Senator from Tennessee says it and not with as much \nknowledge--but what was being said was everyone would benefit if we \nwent to the HMOs. The patients will get better care. Prevention has a \nbetter chance of inserting itself into the system than the traditional \nway. We have now--and not because we are great thinkers and because \nAmerica plans things very well, but we have moved in the direction of \nPPOs that is professional units--and HMOs, which are privately managed \ndelivery groups, they are no longer a surprise to the doctors. Some \nstill sit home, like in my State, and wonder what is happening to the \nworld. It is passing them by and it is no good.\n  The truth is, millions are trying managed care and hundreds of \nthousands of doctors are practicing that way.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if I could just briefly respond, and that \nis where this Medicare+Choice is really the HMO model, although not for \neverybody.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. We have learned a lot from it since 1974. The point is \nMedicare has not changed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. FRIST. We can preserve the good of that model but, based on what \nwe know in 2003, add state-of-the-art, quality, partnering-type, \ncoordinated, integrated delivery of health care. That is a great \nexample of traditional Medicare in 1965. We opened up the \nMedicare+Choice and 5 million people went with it. That is one type of \nplan. It is not for everybody now because, to be honest, a lot of \npatients want more choice, and therefore we give them a system that has \nmore choice. That is really what this legislation is all about.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The other thing I wanted to close with, and it seems to \nbe quite obvious, is there is no question but that some of our best \nSenators have already, or will speak about this plan, and they are \nworried. They will speak with trepidation and principally they will \ntalk about two things, but the big one will be it is going to cost more \nthan we think. Can we afford it? There is another question that is \nasked around, and that is: Are we giving benefits to the right groups \nof people in the right quantities?\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n  I served on the Budget Committee for 28 or 30 years. I was chairman \n14 times. When I left the Committee, I could have given a little speech \nand said, here is what is going to happen over the next 10 years, and \nhere is what is going to happen over the next 15 years. Of course, I \ncould have predicted cycles, that we are going to have big deficits, \nand we are going to come out of them and we are going to get bigger \nones. I probably could have talked about the fear of the baby boomers \nand our ability to pay what we have said we are going to pay them when \ntheir day comes. That is lingering and that is kind of washing its way \nthrough this debate.\n  The question is not, will we, because we will pay. The question is, \nWhen we get there and we have to make all of those payments, how are we \ngoing to pay for it? Frankly, I do not think that is a reason to say we \nshould not do this. We do not know whether in 15 or 20 years we will be \nable to have a balanced budget. In fact, if someone were to ask me--and \nthe Senator is not asking me--I would say in 15 years we probably \ncannot, regardless of the economy.\n  The choice is to do something for the seniors on medication, which we \nknow we have to do. Or we can choose to do nothing because we are \nworried about how we are going to handle this. Or we can say when that \nday comes there will be another great confrontation, and it will very \nsimply be a confrontation about how do we change this, for it is not \nwritten in stone like the Ten Commandments? How do we change them if we \nhave to? Or, God forbid, how do we change the fiscal plan of the \ncountry, whatever that is, in terms of putting a tax to pay for what?\n  Now, it is not embarrassing to admit that. It seems to me that I \nought to say that. I know that. I am very lucky to know that, and it \ncannot be that I am wrong. People cannot say I should not tell \nAmericans that, because it is true.\n  I was fortunate. I have heard every economist. I probably deserve a \ndegree in economics. I did not take economics. I took chemistry and \nphysics.\n  I have heard Alan Greenspan 20 times in my life. I called him up on \nthe Energy bill. When I need somebody to tell the world there is a \nshortage of natural gas, I call an expert. I say Alan Greenspan will \nfind out if it is true. And sure enough, he will tell the world. When \nhe does, they listen.\n  He tells Members the same thing I am talking about here. But it does \nnot mean we should not do this. How can we leave a system that has \nseniors without prescription drugs because we have questions about what \nwill happen in 20 years? We don't. We move on ahead.\n  The Senator mentioned in passing the mentally ill coverage. I don't \nintend to inject that here. But we cannot forget about the mentally ill \nin our country and the fact they are not covered by insurance because \nwe have problems. We cannot say, well, we have problems, so forget \nabout them. Because the system made a mistake and did not include them, \nwe cannot run around and say we made a mistake. Half the people that \nare in the gutters of America are there because they are homeless, \nbecause they are mentally ill, because there was no insurance when they \nwere little kids and they end up from about 15 years of age onward \ndoing nothing. We cannot say there is no solution.\n  To that end, I thank the Senator for his assistance with reference to \nthat group of people.\n  Last, your eloquent speech about the greatest wellness research \nprogram in the history of mankind, that is what I call the program the \nSenator described when we mapped the human genome. There is no greater \nscientific wellness research program. It delivered to the hands and \nminds of the scientists of the world the chromosome makeup of every \nserious disease known to mankind. They said, as if to challenge the \nscientists, Here it is, here is where they are located within the \nchromosome system; solve it, scientists. What a fantastic thing to have \nbeen a part of.\n  I thank the Senator for commenting on my involvement.\n  Mr. FRIST. I take 1 minute. I know we have other Senators on the \nfloor and we will turn to those Senators.\n  The human genome project which I mentioned a few minutes ago really \nhappened. Completion really took 10 years. There are great advances \nthat will come out of this mapping of the human genome. It is like a \nphone book we did not used to have, but now we have all that \ninformation. There will be tremendous advances out of that.\n  The problem with the Medicare system, which has not changed very \nmuch, is those new advances and what we learned cannot be rapidly \nincorporated into Medicare. I talked earlier about heart disease. Most \npeople know cholesterol is important to heart disease. The cholesterol \nscreening test is not covered by traditional Medicare today. Before \nseniors could benefit from heart transplants, the private sector was \ndoing heart transplants. It took 6 years before seniors had access to \nthat lifesaving operation.\n  The micromanagement out of Washington, DC, means new technology is \nslow to come into the system because it is so rigid. If we are going to \ncapture the great advances, we need a system that is receptive, that is \nflexible. That is what the PPO model does. The demographic shift is \ncritical.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is the expert in this body, having \nchaired the Budget Committee in such an admirable way, a distinguished \nway for so many years. Whatever we do on this floor, we have to look 10 \nyears out, 20 years out, 30 years out because of the demographic shift. \nThis plan does that.\n  In terms of the delivery program, it can be sustained over time. \nTraditional Medicare right now, because of its rigidity, means a \ndoubling in the taxes. Maybe we can do that as we go forward. By giving \ntraditional Medicare improving benefits, and allowing prescription \ndrugs, allowing flexibility, allowing choice to be part of that, it can \nbe sustained long term.\n  I appreciate the comments of my distinguished colleague from New \nMexico. I appreciate the patience of the other Senators on the floor. \nThis is an important issue. Every now and then it pays to walk back and \nlook from 30,000 feet at what is going on below. What goes on below \ndetermines ultimately what goes on at 30,000 feet. I have enjoyed the \nopportunity to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my esteemed colleague from New \nMexico leaves the floor, I commend him for his leadership on the issues \nrelated to mental health and mental health parity. No one has been more \nof a champion than the Senator from New Mexico on these issues related \nto mental health. I have been pleased since being in the Senate to \ncosponsor those efforts. I congratulate the Senator and urge him on as \nwe work to provide mental health parity which is another very important \nhealth care issue we need to address in the Senate.\n  I will speak in general as it relates to this debate regarding \nprescription drug coverage and Medicare. Seeing my friend from Wyoming, \nI commend the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, who spoke on an \namendment dealing with community pharmacies which is important to pass. \nI am supportive of it.\n  I did not have a chance to say that yesterday and wanted to take a \nmoment today to commend him for his work. Part of providing choice for \nseniors is to make sure they can have the same choice from their \ncommunity pharmacy as mail order and a number of other issues dealing \nwith the importance of community pharmacies. Congratulations for his \nwork in this area.\n  I take a moment to speak about my perspective relating to where we \nare and the issues of Medicare and many of the comments I have been \nhearing this morning that I respectfully share a difference on. I \nbelieve millions of Americans who have benefitted from Medicare have a \ndifferent perspective about the choice of traditional Medicare--\ndependability, reliability, ability to choose your own doctor, the fact \nit has been there for our seniors and people with disabilities since \n1965--have a different view versus wading through the insurance \nbureaucracies. There are lots of bureaucracies we can talk about, but \ncertainly Medicare is not alone in having a bureaucracy. Anyone who has \nhad to wade through insurance forms or attempted to wade through \nquestions from our insurance companies certainly would not say that is \nless bureaucratic or less paperwork. I find it interesting to hear \ncomments lauding\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\nthe process of working through insurance companies. If you ask anyone \nwhen they have a claim of any kind whether or not that is a \nstreamlined, easy process, usually it is not.\n  When I hear about how traditional Medicare does not cover preventive \nservices or has not been updated to cover other services, it is very \nimportant to note that it could. Traditional Medicare can cover \npreventive services. Since arriving in the House of Representatives in \n1997, we have gone from paying for mammograms every other year to \npaying for mammograms every year. We have added other screenings. We \ncan continue to do that. There is nothing about prevention that cannot \nbe done through traditional Medicare. There is nothing relating to \ncoordination that cannot be done through traditional Medicare.\n  I am in a fee-for-service health plan myself through Blue Cross/Blue \nShield, an integrated plan. I am able in a fee-for-service plan to have \nintegration. We can do that, if we want to do that, if we want to \nstrengthen Medicare. The question is where we want to go with health \ncare. If we want to strengthen traditional Medicare, we add preventive \nmeasures. We do prescription drug benefit within Medicare so it is \ncoordinated. We are certainly not adding to the coordinated nature of \nMedicare by saying you can receive an integrated health care approach \nthrough an HMO or PPO or other plans, but we are going to, instead, \noffer only private insurance if it is available in your community. You \ncan't have an integrated approach through traditional Medicare.\n\n  That is a conscious policy choice. It is not that you can't.\n  What we are really debating here is the very same debate that we had \nbefore Medicare came into being. I urge colleagues to go back and look \nat the Congressional Record and read the debate about what occurred \nbefore 1965. There were two different philosophies. So many years later \nit is interesting to me the very same two philosophies exist.\n  One philosophy, at that time, that of my Republican colleagues, is we \nshould not have Medicare. It is a big Government program. What we \nshould have is private insurance. People should buy from private \ninsurance. At that time about half the seniors in the country could not \nfind private insurance. Much like today, in many parts of the country \nit was not available to them. Certainly, prescription-only policies are \ndifficult to find. Certainly, in Michigan an HMO is hard to find. If \nyou live anywhere but metro Detroit, you don't have an option such as \nthat. So, much like today, it was not available or not affordable. So \nthe decision was made. It was championed by the Democrats in the \nCongress. I am proud of that. They were joined by, I believe, 12 \nRepublican Members at the time who voted to make the decision, as an \nAmerican value, that we were going to make sure older Americans and \npeople with disabilities had access to health care they could afford, \nquality health care, and they would have access to it regardless of \nwhere they lived in the United States.\n  That was an important value statement made in 1965. I think it is \nfair to say it has radically changed and improved the quality of life \nfor millions, tens of millions of American citizens, that decision in \n1965.\n  Since that time, it is absolutely true that health care has changed. \nBoy, has it changed. There are exciting new things that have happened. \nThere are new treatments. There are new miracle drugs. You can take a \npill instead of having heart surgery. Our esteemed leader of the Senate \ntalked about those changes and certainly we all agree with those \nchanges.\n  The question is, Do we change and improve and strengthen Medicare to \nreflect that, or do we move to a different system? That is a conscious \nchoice. We can absolutely do everything that is being talked about here \nthrough traditional Medicare if we choose to do that.\n  Mr. President, 89 percent of the seniors are under traditional \nMedicare; 11 percent have chosen to go into managed care available in \ntheir area. I share the desire to make sure options are available to \nseniors at their choice.\n  But to somehow say we have to abandon the insurance system called \nMedicare that has worked because it is outdated is not accurate. The \naccurate statement is we choose not to update Medicare. We choose not \nto strengthen and modernize Medicare because we want to go back to the \nprivate sector, private for-profit insurance and managed care. That is \na conscious choice. I find it interesting that is the very same debate \nthat took place when Medicare started.\n  Again, there is a difference in philosophy of different parties. I \nbelieve we have seen the philosophy at work back since the mid-1990s to \nweaken Medicare, so it is easier to criticize. What do I mean by that?\n\n  We had a Speaker of the House, a well-known Speaker back in the mid-\n1990s, say we cannot eliminate Medicare directly--I am paraphrasing--\nbut, instead, we will let it wither on the vine.\n  At that time, there was a lot of strong support for going to managed \ncare, HMOs, under Medicare. At that time the person who now leads the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid said there would be a California gold \nrush into managed care. People would be leaving in droves, going to \nmanaged care because it was so much better than traditional Medicare.\n  In fact, that did not happen. In the areas where it did happen, such \nas Michigan--which I have talked about many times on the Senate floor--\nwe have had over 35,000 seniors dropped because the private HMO made \nthe business decision to pull out of the market and not to cover \nMedicare beneficiaries anymore. Those individuals went back into \ntraditional Medicare.\n  But what happened in the 1990s? We had a balanced budget agreement. I \nbelieved it was important. I supported that in 1997. But since that \ntime, we have seen cuts, very deep cuts, deeper than we were told would \nhappen, to providers who cover Medicare beneficiaries, people who \nprovide critical home health services, people who provide critical \nnursing home coverage; our hospitals, our teaching hospitals, our \ndoctors, nurses, physical therapists--all of those who provide health \ncare. We have seen deep, deep cuts.\n  We have seen rural hospitals and urban hospitals closing. We have \nseen tremendous cutbacks, more paperwork, less funding. We have seen a \ncrisis. Again, this was due to policy decisions to pull money away from \nMedicare, to underfund Medicare. My concern is that essentially \nMedicare has been set up by underfunding it, and then those who do not \nsupport Medicare saying: See, it doesn't work; not funding preventive \ncare and saying: See, we don't fund preventive care. See, it is too \nbureaucratic. All those things could be fixed if there was a commitment \nto Medicare, if there was a commitment to a program that is a great \nAmerican success story.\n  Let me just say in conclusion--I see colleagues on the Senate floor I \nknow wish to speak--I think it is important in this debate that we be \nvery honest with the American people about what the real debate is. It \nis not that Medicare has failed. It is not that Medicare cannot be \nimproved upon and modernized. The debate is a philosophical one, an \nideological one. There is a difference in view where those now in the \nmajority believed, before Medicare, and believe now, that we are better \noff with a private for-profit insurance company model.\n  I am also deeply concerned when I continue to hear that somehow we \ncannot afford to continue with Medicare anymore because of the \ndemographics. I have two points about that. I said this before, but the \nevidence is overwhelming. Medicare's administrative costs are less, and \nthey are growing at a slower rate. Its costs are less right now than \nthose of managed care HMOs. Every independent study shows there is no \nevidence that when you bring in a private for-profit insurance company \nthat needs to make a profit because they are in the private sector, the \nfor-profit side of the world, that somehow that brings more money for \nhealth care--when they have to take a piece of that for administrative \ncosts and for profit, and so on. In fact, it is just the opposite. The \nmajority of health care in this country, the majority of hospitals, the \nmajority of home health agencies and nursing homes are nonprofit so \nthat every dollar goes into health care because health care is not an \noption. It is a critical necessity for our people. That is really the \ndebate.\n\n  The other piece of the debate is another question of values and \npriorities. We continue to see trillions of dollars\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nbeing given in tax cuts as a priority to a privileged few in this \ncountry, instead of focusing on shoring up and modernizing health care \nwith a real, comprehensive prescription drug benefit, and instead of \ninvesting in education and innovation in our country to grow the \neconomy through greater productivity. These are conscious choices. The \nfact that this is not a very good benefit and the fact we are limited \nin scope is a conscious choice by this body, by this Congress, and by \nthis President, which says Medicare and health care is not as important \nas another round, and what will be coming, another round and another \nround of tax cuts for the privileged few of this country.\n  I will just say in conclusion that as we speak I believe we need to \ntalk about the fact that these are conscious choices being made. I for \none believe all the evidence shows we can strengthen and modernize and \nupdate Medicare in a way that our seniors want, need, and deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise in favor of a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. We live in different times now. Thirty-eight years ago \nwhen the Medicare Program was created, most people were treated in \nhospitals. Many illnesses were untreatable, and the average lifespan \nwas shorter than it is today. But we have made great strides since \nthen. Today people are living longer, better, and healthier lives. My \nown mother turned 102 years old last month--something perhaps she never \neven imagined. But new medical technologies and advanced drugs have \nmade it possible for many of our elderly to live productive lives for \nmany years.\n  Unfortunately, the high cost of these life-sustaining medications is \npreventing many of our seniors from reaping the benefits of these \nadvancements.\n  The elderly in my State of North Carolina have been hit particularly \nhard. The State's Division of Aging estimates that one-half of North \nCarolina's residents aged 65 and older have no prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  As I traveled our 100 counties, I have heard their stories. They are \ncutting their pills in half to make them last longer--a dangerous \npractice that can lead to unanticipated drug reactions. They are \nsacrificing groceries so they have money to buy the drugs they need. \nEven worse, far too many of them are simply going without needed drugs.\n  Many of North Carolina's seniors have even been forced to go back \ninto the workplace from retirement--often with an ailing condition--\njust to earn some income because of prescription drugs.\n  I talked last night to a woman in Clayton, NC named Kathy Roberts. \nShe retired after 13 years of working at Wal-Mart with dreams of \nspending time with her grandchildren, but a heart condition ran up \nmedical costs. Kathy had soon lost $29,000 in savings. She recently \nreturned to her job at Wal-Mart for the extra money. But because she is \nonly working part time in order to keep her $700 a month Social \nSecurity check, she is ineligible for the health insurance benefits \nWal-Mart gives to its full-time employees. Her prescription drugs cost \n$170 each month.\n\n  In Mecklenburg County, officials recently completed a report on the \nstatus of seniors there. The study found that 45 percent of older \nadults said the high cost of prescription drugs made them decide not to \ntake a medicine as frequently as prescribed. Forty percent had not \npurchased a prescription because of costs, and more than 15 percent \nsaid they put off paying for food, rent, or utilities to buy medicine.\n  This is simply not right. Our elderly deserve better treatment. This \nGovernment made a promise to our seniors when the Medicare program was \ncreated, and we should keep our promise.\n  This year we have our best chance yet to get a prescription drug \nbenefit signed into law. It is an opportunity that should not be \nallowed to slip away.\n  I have been reviewing the prescription drug plan passed by the \nFinance Committee as well as proposals put forth by other Senators. The \nFinance Committee legislation commits $400 billion over the next 10 \nyears for a benefit. It is a voluntary program, something I have long \nadvocated. But I have concerns. While the legislation adds a drug \nbenefit to Medicare, it does not make sufficient changes to strengthen \nand improve an outdated program. None of us want to add a benefit that \nis simply going to send Medicare's bills through the roof as soon as \nthe baby boomers retire.\n  Just 3 months ago, Government trustees reported Medicare was 4 years \ncloser to insolvency than expected. It is projected to start paying out \nmore money than it brings in in the year 2013. With Medicare so close \nto the brink of insolvency, shouldn't we look more closely at ways to \nimprove this aging program?\n  This bill provides a prescription drug initiative--an enormous \nchange. But in terms of improving and strengthening Medicare, it simply \ndoes not go far enough.\n  For instance, the bill does not do enough to eliminate the mountains \nof paperwork and red tape that discourage doctors from participating in \nMedicare--100,000 pages of regulations, according to the Mayo Clinic. \nWhere is the regulatory reform Medicare so desperately needs?\n  There is also a need to provide for more disclosure among our \npharmacy benefit managers and plans. The Senate should consider \namendments such as that offered by Senators Enzi and Reed which promote \ngreater transparency and require plans to disclose how much of the \nrebates from drug manufacturers are being passed on to consumers. We \nmust seek to provide a prescription drug benefit that maintains fiscal \nresponsibility, too.\n  There are also concerns that this drug benefit will cause private \ninsurers to drop coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat 37 percent of employers would be inclined to terminate \nprescription drug coverage for retirees. This would shift those \nretirees into the Government-sponsored system and further drive up \ncosts of the program. Our Nation cannot afford that. The budget \nis already being stretched because of national security concerns.\n\n  The Senate must ensure this program stays within the cap of $400 \nbillion over 10 years we agreed to in the budget resolution.\n  I intend to spend the next several days listening to the debate and \nfurther examining proposals. I hope we can find ways to address these \nissues so we can pass a benefit for our seniors this year without \ncreating a system that will balloon into a tremendous burden for future \ngenerations.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I call for regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is the regular order.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 932, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I send a modification to my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 932), as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To improve disclosure requirements and increase beneficiary \n                                choices)\n\n       On page 57, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(3) Disclosure.--The eligible entity offering a Medicare \n     Prescription Drug plan and the MedicareAdvantage organization \n     offering a MedicareAdvantage plan shall disclose to the \n     Administrator (in a manner specified by the Administrator) \n     the extent to which discounts, direct or indirect subsidies, \n     rebates, or other price concessions or direct or indirect \n     remunerations made available to the entity or organization by \n     a manufacturer are passed through to enrollees through \n     pharmacies and other dispensers or otherwise. The provisions \n     of section 1927(b)(3)(D) shall apply to information disclosed \n     to the Administrator under this paragraph in the same manner \n     as such provisions apply to information disclosed under such \n     section.\n       ``(4) Audits and reports.--To protect against fraud and \n     abuse and to ensure proper disclosures and accounting under \n     this part, in addition to any protections against fraud and \n     abuse provided under section 1860D-7(f)(1), the Administrator \n     may periodically audit the financial statements and records \n     of an eligible entity offering a Medicare Prescription Drug \n     plan and a MedicareAdvantage organization offering a \n     MedicareAdvantage plan.\n\n       On page 37, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       ``(C) Level playing field.--An eligible entity offering a \n     Medicare Prescription Drug plan shall permit enrollees to \n     receive benefits (which may include a 90-day supply of\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\n     drugs or biologicals) through a community pharmacy, rather \n     than through mail order, and may permit a differential amount \n     to be paid by such enrollees.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from North Carolina for her comments about the \namendment and appreciate her support. I am going to try to convince \neverybody else that support is also warranted.\n  I have offered a modified version of amendment 932 to the original \none yesterday on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleague from \nRhode Island, Senator Reed. Senators Pryor, Cochran, and Chambliss also \njoin us on offering this modified amendment. I welcome their \ncosponsorship and support.\n  These modifications ensure the amendment will not add to the cost of \nthis Medicare bill, which is a concern I share with Chairman Grassley \nand a great many of my colleagues.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his willingness to work with me to \naddress the concerns of our seniors and pharmacists.\n  The heart of this amendment remains the provisions that would ensure \nfair prices for consumers and fair treatment for local pharmacists \nunder a new Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  To ensure reasonable drug prices for seniors, the amendment would \nhold Medicare drug plans and Medicare Advantage organizations \naccountable for passing on to their consumers a fair portion of the \nrebates, discounts, and other incentives the plans may receive from \ndrug manufacturers and other sources.\n  The amendment would require disclosure of these incentives to the \nFederal Government. It would also clarify that the Government may audit \nthe records of these plans and organizations to ensure compliance with \nthis disclosure requirement. The amendment would not, however, make \nthese disclosures part of the public record. This is certainly not our \nintent. The amendment simply ensures that our corporate partners are \nheld accountable for sharing with our seniors the savings they \ngenerate.\n  To ensure fair treatment for the pharmacists in our communities, the \namendment we are offering would prohibit Medicare drug plans from \nimplementing restrictions that would steer consumers to only mail-order \npharmacies. It would require Medicare drug plans to allow local \ncommunity pharmacists to fill long-term prescriptions--long-term \nprescriptions; not just 30-day ones but 90 days as well--and offer \nother services they are equipped and licensed to provide.\n  Seniors trust their local pharmacist, and they should be allowed to \nkeep that relationship in place under this bill. This drug benefit \nshould not force them to choose a mail-order house when a pharmacist \nwho could provide the same or better service is right down the street, \nand they are used to dealing with them.\n  This amendment would permit a Medicare drug plan or Medicare \nAdvantage organization to charge a different cost for a mail-order \nprescription versus a prescription filled by a community pharmacist. \nThis happens today in many health plans. As an example, one health plan \nfor Federal employees charges a $10 copay for a 30-day prescription \nfilled at a local pharmacy but charges a $20 copay for a 90-day \nprescription filled through a mail order. That is a $10 savings. This \nwould allow the local pharmacist to offer the 90-day prescription so \nthe consumer could take advantage of the same reduction in copay.\n  Under this amendment, Medicare drug plans could still charge \ndifferent copays, but the plans could not prohibit a local pharmacy \nfrom filling 90-day prescriptions.\n  I know some of my colleagues are concerned that seniors may get \nconfused. Actually, if they can get through the rest of the bill \nwithout being confused, they will not be confused by this. But some \npeople are concerned that may happen or that they may pay more than \nthey should for their drugs. In response, I would say the Finance \nCommittee's bill clearly states that seniors cannot be charged more \nthan the negotiated price of a covered drug.\n  The bill is also very direct in its expectations of Medicare drug \nplans. The bill would require plans to provide clear information about \ncopayments and deductibles. This information would have to include \ndetails on the differences in cost between mail-order and retail \nprescriptions.\n  I think seniors and their families are very smart about drug costs, \nand they will take factors, such as different copays, into account when \nthey make a health care decision.\n  I am sure Medicare drug plans will encourage seniors to use mail \norder, just as health plans encourage us to use mail order. What this \namendment would do is give seniors the option--the option--to use their \nlocal pharmacists.\n\n  The bill already requires health plans to give seniors accurate \ninformation on the costs of their options. From that point, I think we \nshould trust seniors and their families to make the decisions that are \nbest for them, without arbitrary limitations on services that steer \nseniors in one direction or the other.\n  Again, I thank Senators Reed, Pryor, Cochran, and Chambliss for \njoining me in offering this modified amendment. The sponsors of this \nbill appreciate the role local pharmacists play in helping all \nAmericans manage their medications, especially the elderly and the \nsick, who need the most advice.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, Senator Reed and I worked last week to pass \na bill to address the pharmacist shortage through the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions. We agreed to work together on \nthat bill to ensure our aging population has access to the knowledge of \npharmacists on how to use a new Medicare drug benefit appropriately and \nsafely.\n  As highly educated professionals, our pharmacists know how important \ndrug therapy is in helping seniors live longer and better lives, and \nthey want to support this bill. In fact, many pharmacies and \npharmacists are supporting, and will support, the bill, in part because \nof this amendment.\n  The National Association of Chain Drug Stores and the Food Marketing \nInstitute support this amendment. I ask unanimous consent to have \nletters of support printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                     Food Marketing Institute,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2003.\n     Hon.

Additionally, our \n     industry is hopeful that the bi-partisan bill will clarify \n     that retail pharmacy will be permitted to offer Medicare \n     beneficiaries the option to receive long-term 90-day \n     prescriptions which means seniors will have both convenience \n     and the opportunity to consult with their pharmacist about \n     taking their medications safely and effectively.\n       In closing, FMI wishes to commend you on your leadership \n     regarding Medicare reform, and we look forward to working \n     with you throughout the legislative process as Congress moves \n     toward providing seniors with outpatient drug coverage.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J.

We are \n     writing to express our support for legislation that you are \n     developing along with Senator Baucus and the Finance \n     Committee Members to reform Medicare and the development of \n     an outpatient drug benefit for our nation's seniors.\n       The bill, which has bi-partisan support, will promote \n     competition and provide seniors with more choices of delivery \n     of their prescription medication. Additionally, seniors will \n     be more informed in terms of selecting a plan that will work \n     best for their particular needs.\n       Other positive points of significance include:\n       Risk is eliminated for pharmacies under the new benefit.\n       Convenient access for seniors through pharmacy networks.\n       Clarification of retail pharmacy providing 90-day supplies \n     of prescription needs.\n       Continued of retail pharmacy providing 90-day supplies of \n     prescription needs.\n       Continued pharmacist's consultation with seniors ensuring \n     medication safety and effectiveness.\n       In closing, Winn-Dixie salutes your hard work on this most \n     important issue and we look forward to working with you as \n     this most important issue continues to develop.\n           Sincerely,\n     Randy Hutton,\n       Vice President, Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               The Kroger Co.,\n\n                                    Cincinnati, OH, June 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: The Kroger Co., appreciates your \n     leadership and the efforts of Senator Baucus in developing \n     with your colleagues in the U.S. Senate legislation that will \n     reform the Medicare program.\n       Kroger is the nation's 7th largest pharmacy provider. We \n     support the Medicare reform legislation because we believe it \n     improves Medicare in several important ways.\n       First, we believe having a range of entities that can offer \n     a pharmacy benefit or drug discount card will benefit seniors \n     and all taxpayers.\n       Second, it is our understanding the legislation ensures \n     that senior will have access to nonconfidential, summary \n     information gathered from plan sponsors. We believe this \n     transparency will facilitate informed consumer choice.\n       Seniors also will benefit from the option of having their \n     90-day, long-term prescriptions filled by their neighborhood \n     pharmacy. The value-added services pharmacists provide are \n     important to the health and well being of our seniors.\n       And finally, we appreciate the clarification we understand \n     the legislation contains that pharmacists should not be held \n     responsible for risks they do not manage or control.\n       Again, we appreciate your leadership and look forward to \n     working with you and the Senate Finance Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph A. Piohler,\n       Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, by ensuring fair prices for seniors and fair \ntreatment for pharmacists, we will ensure this new Medicare drug \nbenefit does right by seniors and values the trusted relationship that \npharmacists and their senior patients share.\n  This is just a small step to helping community pharmacists. I would \nlike to do more, but we are matching that constraint with the \nrequirement that there can be no amendment that adds dollars to the \ncost of this bill. So we are staying in that constraint but still \ngiving that option for the local pharmacists.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, as modified, and I am \ngratified by all the people who are doing that.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 944 To Amendment No. 932, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I offer, on behalf of Senator Cantwell, a second-\ndegree amendment to my amendment and send the amendment to the desk.\n  I thank Senator Cantwell, who has worked with Senator Reed and myself \non coming up with this amendment, which also does not add a single \ndollar of additional cost to the pharmacy bill but does provide some \nclarification on how any audits would be done on records to make sure \nthat rebates and refunds are going to the proper place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be \nreported.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] for Ms. Cantwell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 944 to amendment No. 932.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit an eligible entity offering a Medicare \n  Prescription Drug plan, a MedicareAdvantage Organization offering a \nMedicareAdvantage plan, and other health plans from contracting with a \n    pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) unless the PBM satisfies certain \n                             requirements)\n\n       On page 2 of Amendment No. 932 between lines 18 and 19 \n     strike ``.'' and insert the following: ``with the auditor of \n     the Administrator's choice.''\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from West Virginia takes \nthe floor, I say to my friend from Wyoming, shouldn't we accept this \nsecond-degree amendment now?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am sure it has been cleared on both sides, \nand I would be more than happy to do that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on amendment No. \n944, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 944) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 932, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  We are here to consider legislation that is going to create a much \nneeded prescription drug benefit. We have been here to consider that \nmatter for some years now. We have 41 million seniors and disabled \npeople in this country who require and need that benefit. So it is a \nmomentous time. It is also a moment of opportunity, which we will \neither grab or not grab, where we can craft a prescription drug benefit \nthat provides the coverage seniors desperately need, coverage that is \nboth affordable and reliable for all seniors.\n  I intend to offer amendments--not now, but later--that will improve \nthe proposed coverage and delivery system for the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit so that this bill will better meet the real needs of our \nsenior citizens.\n  In 1965, this Nation recognized that health care costs were the \nprimary reason that one-third of our Nation's seniors lived in absolute \npoverty. With the establishment of a universal health care benefit for \nseniors, financed through both individual payroll tax contributions and \nthe General Treasury--the Medicare program--we lifted most American \nseniors out of poverty.\n  That is something to be profoundly proud of, but it is the work of \nour predecessors. And now there is work for us\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\nto do. Medicare is one of America's great achievements, but it has long \nneeded to include a prescription drug benefit. At the time Medicare was \nenacted, prescription drugs were not a popular form of treatment. Now \nthey are a critical part of health care.\n  A Medicare prescription drug benefit is something I have heard \nseniors tell me they want and need almost every time I have ever run \ninto them or have had meetings with them in my State. And I daresay the \nPresiding Officer has had the same situation in his State of Kentucky.\n  I have worked on this for nearly 2 decades as a Senator, and we are \nperhaps at the point--or perhaps we are not. I don't know. I hope so.\n  Fifteen years ago, Congress acted to provide a catastrophic drug \nbenefit under Medicare. The fact of the matter is, it was a very good \nbill. I led the fight on this floor three times to defeat repeal by the \nHouse because it was a very good benefit. There has never been anything \nthat approached that in terms of catastrophic drug benefits since that \ntime.\n  However, seniors did not understand the bill because we did not do a \ngood job of putting it out to them, and we passed it perhaps too \nquickly. So the catastrophic benefit was rejected by the very people \nthat it was intended to help through the votes of their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  We should not repeat that experience. We should do our very best as \nthe legislative process moves forward to offer a benefit that will be \nwidely welcomed by Medicare beneficiaries and by their families. This \nwill be a very hard thing to do, working with only $400 billion, as \nthat is not the full cost of what we need. But that is what we have. We \nare operating, therefore, under a very tough budget constraint. I \nunderstand and accept that. But I think we should keep in mind that if \nwe can achieve more than 50 votes for a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, we might be able to achieve more than 60 votes to pay for a \nstrengthened drug benefit. We shall see whether the Senate is able to \nsuccessfully amend this proposal over the next several days, weeks, \nwhatever the situation will be.\n  For my part, I remain committed to fight to improve the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit that is before us because I know the need is \ntremendous. The average total gross income for the average Medicare \nbeneficiary in West Virginia is about $10,800. My guess is for the \nState of Kentucky, it is not a great deal more. It probably is somewhat \nover that, but $10,800 in West Virginia. If they have various kinds of \ninternal problems, they may be paying $3-, $4-, $5,000. That doesn't \ngive them very much to live on.\n  When I talk about this, I think about senior citizens in Mingo and \nRaleigh Counties in West Virginia; Charleston and Weirton, in \nMartinsburg and Parkersburg. They want and expect a prescription drug \nbenefit that will meet their needs, and they have that right. I would \nlike to believe that 2003 could be another landmark date in the passage \nof Medicare legislation that will improve the basic health of more than \n40 million Americans. But even as I say that, I need to acknowledge \nthat there are a few things in this bill that are very troubling to me \nand which may well make the difference between a welcome and sustained \nMedicare drug benefit and a long road of complaints and criticisms from \nthe very people we are, in fact, trying to help.\n  Let me take a minute to talk about a couple of them. There is a \nsubstantial gap in coverage under this bill. That gap is about $1,300. \nUnder the bill, there will still be times when seniors are paying a \npremium and receiving no benefits whatsoever. We should eliminate that \ncoverage gap.\n  I fundamentally disagree with the notion that we should pay private \ninsurers more than traditional fee-for-service Medicare to deliver a \ndrug benefit. Either they are more efficient or they are not. If they \nhave marketing costs, well, then that has to be factored in, but there \nis no reason to pay private insurers more than other providers.\n  All Medicare beneficiaries should get the same benefit. They should \npay the same premium, just as they do under Part A or Part B. There \nshould not be different benefits or premiums for Medicare beneficiaries \njust because they happen to live in West Virginia or Montana or, on the \nother hand, in New York or California.\n  Seniors who don't have access to a private insurer or choose to stay \nin traditional Medicare should be able to still receive additional \nbenefits such as a catastrophic limit on their medical expenses. We \nshould do our best to make sure that employers do not drop coverage \nbecause there is not a sufficient incentive for them to continue \nproviding this coverage to their retirees. That should not be an \nexcuse. We could fix this by allowing employer contributions to count \ntoward the out-of-pocket costs seniors currently are paying.\n\n  In addition, I have serious concerns about the fallback in the \nproposal. It is, in my judgment, unstable. Under this proposal, if \nthere are not at least two quality bids for plans to serve a region, as \nwe all know by now, the fallback moves into place for 1 year. The next \nyear, a new bidding process begins. And if two plans show up, the \nfallback disappears. This means seniors, especially seniors in rural \nareas where PPOs and private plans are not likely to come or perhaps \nhave not ever been, may end up bouncing between a fall back, then a \nprivate plan the next year, and then back to a fallback. All the while \nseniors will be forced to change doctors and pharmacists. Their cost \nsharing will be changed, and there will be other changes. This will be \nof profound concern to them, confusing to them. I think it is a \nfrightening scenario which takes me back to the catastrophic bill to \nwhich I referred a few moments ago. I don't think that kind of coverage \nrepresents a stable, genuine, or guaranteed fallback for seniors.\n  Finally, there have been a number of Members on the floor of the \nSenate referring to this as a universal drug benefit. We should all be \nvery clear this is not a universal drug benefit. In fact, this \nlegislation specifically excludes some Medicare beneficiaries from \nenrolling in the Medicare drug benefit. Those Medicare beneficiaries \nwho are low income, 74 percent of poverty or below, and therefore, \nqualify to receive a drug benefit under Medicaid, are excluded from \nenrolling in the Medicare benefit. This is the first time in the \nhistory of the program that we would prohibit some Medicare \nbeneficiaries from receiving a Medicare benefit.\n  Not only is it unfair to exclude the poorest seniors from part of the \nMedicare Program, it gives them a bad deal. Prescription drugs are an \noptional benefit under Medicaid. States can and are limiting the number \nof prescriptions. Some States only cover three drugs or charge any \ncopayments that they choose to or that they have to. Since 1965, \nMedicare has provided a universal benefit to all of its beneficiaries. \nThat has been its magnificent social contract. It is the promise that \nsociety made to our seniors: If you work and make your payroll \ncontributions, then you get Medicare, regardless of where you live, how \nold you are, or what your income might be.\n  This legislation--for the very first time in the history of the \nprogram--would prohibit some Medicare beneficiaries from receiving a \nMedicare benefit. We should provide all seniors with a dependable \nMedicare guarantee of prescription drug coverage. That is what seniors \nexpect when we tell them we are giving them a Medicare drug benefit. \nAnd we should make sure that they have a drug plan they can always \ncount on, even if some believe private plans are the future of the \nprogram.\n  I have a word on the pending Daschle amendment. The current Senate \nplan offers no protection against varying premiums. The estimate that \nis given, $35 as an average premium, is precisely that. It is an \nestimate. The proposed legislation gives PPOs broad discretion in \nassigning premiums. Senator Daschle's amendment will limit variations \nin the amount the beneficiaries have to pay to only 10 percent above \nthe national average, no matter where they live. So it does not limit \nthe amounts plans could charge as a whole; i.e., the total premium. It \nwould also not prevent lower premiums.\n  Stable premiums limit seniors' cost of liability and complement the \nprovisions of the fallback plan. Stable premiums increase the safety \nnet for seniors in geographic regions where private insurers are less \nlikely to offer affordable coverage. This amendment is especially \nimportant for seniors who\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nlive in rural areas because it is in rural areas where private insurers \nare more likely to charge higher premiums to offset the increased costs \nassociated with benefit deliveries.\n  Stable premiums do not inhibit competition. Instead they increase the \nsafety net for seniors. Beneficiaries in rural areas, such as West \nVirginia, are often older and sicker. Competition among private \ninsurance plans in these areas is likely to be less under any \ncircumstances. Seniors' ability to plan for prescription drug \nexpenditures within their limited budgets hinges upon a great degree of \ncertainty. That is what seniors depend on. Their ability to have this \nassurance should not be decided by private HMOs, who respond to market \nforces and attempt to correct deficiencies by varying and fluctuating \npremiums. Seniors should not have to wait and see what private \ninsurance companies are going to charge them from year to year.\n\n  I support Senator Daschle's amendment. He is working to pass a \nMedicare package--as we all are--that works for all Medicare \nbeneficiaries no matter where they live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity \ntoday to speak regarding the Daschle amendment. First, I want to \ncommend my colleagues from Iowa and New Mexico, Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus, for doing truly an outstanding job with putting \ntogether a package of legislation to deal with the challenges we have \nall met and continue to sort out relating to prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors. I commend them for an outstanding effort.\n  In the midst of that commendation, I think--and others would admit--\nthat the pending legislation can be improved. I have yet to see a piece \nof legislation that could not have some amendment that at least some \npeople would think would be an improvement.\n  In this particular situation, I think the area that we could improve \nis in making sure the rate differentials among the States is not \nextraordinary. Therefore, the Daschle amendment sets a 10 percent \nvariation of the national average, so that a State would not have a \nrate that would be 10 percent above what that national average is. What \nthis provides is protection that the rate differential between States \nsuch as New York and Nebraska are not going to vary more than 10 \npercent.\n  We all recognize if insurance is a focus to provide protection and \nstabilize across a broad base of individuals, to spread the costs and \nrisks over that entire group of individuals, you will then have a rate \nthat would be based on that spreading of the risk. This particular \nsituation seeks to do that, but the spread of the risk seems to be more \ndirected on a statewide basis, therefore giving the opportunity for a \nwide variation of rates between two States on a nationwide basis.\n  I think this amendment will correct that and will assure that people \nliving in whatever State they may reside are not going to be paying a \nsubstantially higher rate than other individuals.\n  The proposed prescription drug plan promises an average premium of \nabout $35 a month. But we cannot be sure that is a guarantee because \njust in the case of Medicare, managed care, Medicare+Choice, there is \nno set premium under the new prescription drug proposal. So all \npremiums will vary nationwide. Experience suggests that premiums could \nsignificantly--as they do with premiums for Medicare HMO plans--vary \nfrom $99 a month in Connecticut to $16 a month in Florida. Floridians \nmight enjoy that, but residents of Connecticut might ask a question as \nto why we cannot have a balanced rate nationwide with variations of a \nmuch smaller amount.\n  Spreading the risk is what insurance is all about. I think spreading \nthe risk in this case involves spreading the costs as well. I think I \nspeak for many of my colleagues when I say we want to have a \nprescription drug benefit that is well balanced, meets the needs of \nthose who are the neediest and the sickest, but provides a fair amount \nof coverage for all American seniors who qualify. It is my duty to make \nsure that what we provide, whether for Nebraskans or Floridians, is \ntruly a spread of the risk and cost. We need to ensure that the \npremiums are priced both fairly and equitably and that geographic \nconcerns don't price seniors out of the market for coverage in any \nlocation. That is what I think we must find as the focus as we move \nforward.\n  So, again, I commend my colleagues for putting together an \noutstanding package of benefits given the very difficult task of making \nthe ends meet with $400 billion, but with needs that could exceed that \nseveral times over, putting together a package that I think truly \nrepresents what will take care of the prescription drug needs of our \nseniors. At the same time, we want to make sure the protection is also \nthere against a wide disparity of rates from State to State. So I speak \ntoday on behalf of the Daschle amendment. I hope the people within this \nbody will look at that and think about that in terms of their own \nStates--not as to whether their State will get a better deal than \nothers but where we all have an opportunity for an excellent deal and \nthat the variations will be minimal at best.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I note that the managers are not on the \nSenate floor at this moment. I had visited with Senator Reid before the \nDemocratic Policy Committee luncheon, and he indicated the floor would \nbe open for an amendment. I have an amendment I wanted to offer. It \ndeals with reimportation. I am ready to offer that. The amendment is \nwritten, and I have been told that they are looking for amendments. \nThis is ready to go. If we are not able to offer it now, the question I \nask is when are we able to offer it?\n  Can we sequence it so I may have an understanding as to when I may \noffer it this afternoon?\n  The issue of reimportation is one that relates to this legislation \nbecause it relates to the issue of the cost of prescription drugs. I \nwill want to offer this on behalf of myself and Senators Stabenow, \nJeffords, Snowe, Johnson, Levin, and Boxer. I don't want to tie up the \nSenate for any great length of time. I think this is important, and I \nwould like to speak on it. I expect a number of colleagues would like \nto speak on this amendment as well. It makes sense to me to have it \nconsidered, and then I will make a presentation, and then it can be set \naside so others can make presentations.\n  I understand we have three additional amendments that are now pending \nand on which we will likely have a vote, perhaps midafternoon. I don't \nknow exactly the whereabouts of the committee chairman or ranking \nmember. They are not on the floor. I shall not ask for unanimous \nconsent, but I would like to, as soon as they return, be able to query \nthem so I can understand where I fit in this mix. As I indicated \nyesterday and today, I have continued to hear that they want amendments \noffered, and they want to move through these issues as quickly as \npossible. I am ready. Several of my colleagues would like to speak on \nthis as well and are ready to do so. I will wait at this moment until \nthe chairman and ranking member come back. I will make the inquiry of \nthem as to when I might be sequenced. I would like to be recognized to \noffer this amendment this afternoon--the earlier the better.\n  At the moment, I will relinquish the floor. I am tempted to ask \nunanimous consent, but I shall not in recognition that the chairman and \nranking member will want to find some order. I will relinquish the \nfloor with the expectation of being able to query them on the floor \nwhen they return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, to follow the remarks of my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, I, too, have an amendment I would like to lay down. It is \na very short amendment. It would not require a great deal of debate and \ndiscussion. I hope it would have widespread support. It has to do with \nmammography screening under Medicare, and the fact that we have a dual \nsystem now for that screening. They are reimbursed at a certain rate.\n  For diagnostic mammographies, they are reduced to a lower rate. What \nwe find is when a woman who is Medicare\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\neligible who gets screened for breast cancer and, under the screening \nmammography, there are some indications possibly that she might have \nbreast cancer, she now needs to get a diagnostic screening. The waiting \ntime is up to 6 months because the rates are so low for the \nreimbursement for diagnostic screening of mammographies.\n  What we have done is put women in this very terrible position. They \nget screened and there is some indication they might have breast \ncancer, and yet they then cannot get the diagnostic screening they \nneed.\n  What my amendment would do, basically, is increase the technical \nportion of diagnostic mammograms performed in hospital-based facilities \nby removing this procedure from the ambulatory payment categories and \nplacing it in the Medicare fee schedule. The Medicare fee schedule \nreimburses at a higher rate than the ambulatory payment categories. The \nchange would result in roughly a 13-percent increase for unilateral \ndiagnostic mammograms and roughly a 39-percent increase for bilateral \ndiagnostic mammograms.\n  As I have said, under these two repayment categories, screening \nmammographies are already in the Medicare fee schedule, but the \ndiagnostic mammograms are still in the ambulatory payment category. \nThis amendment would put the diagnostic screening in the same position \nas the screening.\n  Medicare officials estimate that more than half of all women who are \nMedicare beneficiaries receive their breast cancer screenings in a \nhospital-based facility. Unfortunately, due to the low Medicare \nreimbursement rates for the diagnostic screening, over 700 hospital-\nbased mammography facilities have closed in the last 2 years simply \nbecause the reimbursement rates are so low. As a result, waiting times \nfor hospital-based mammograms covered by Medicare can be several months \nin many parts of the country. These delays can have significant \nclinical implications for fighting breast cancer.\n\n  Again, what my amendment would do is correct the problem by \nincreasing the reimbursement for the diagnostic mammograms. I point out \nagain why this is necessary. Women receive diagnostic mammograms \nfollowing the screening mammograms if there is a suspicious finding.\n  Imagine that you had a screening--put yourself in a woman's shoes--\nand they said there is some suspicion there, but because there are no \nlocal hospital-based mammography facilities--they have closed down--you \nmay have to wait weeks or months to get your diagnosis definitively \nconfirmed or denied. As these facilities close, there are fewer places \nfor women to get mammograms.\n  When you consider that approximately 1 million additional women per \nyear become age eligible for these mammogram screenings, it is easy to \nsee we have an access problem. Moreover, because radiologists use and \ntrain at these hospital facilities, they find it difficult to sustain \ntheir mammography practices, and fewer and fewer of them are being \ntrained.\n  Again, it is a very simple, straightforward amendment. I would like \nto ask that the pending amendment be set aside, but I am not going to \ndo that. As the Senator from North Dakota pointed out, the managers are \nnot in the Chamber. It seems to me we are trying to move this process \nalong, and we have amendments we could offer and have a short debate, \nhave a vote or have them accepted. We are standing here not being able \nto move the process along.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted to yield to my colleague from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I know what is going to happen. When we get into mid next \nweek, late next week, as we try to finish this bill, there is not going \nto be enough time to offer these amendments and to debate these \namendments. That is why, it seems to me, right now it is in our \ninterest to lay these amendments down, have the discussion on the \namendments, and then proceed.\n  I mention to the Senator from Iowa, there is a second amendment I \nhave--I have not offered it, but I have talked to the staff about an \namendment that sounds similar to the amendment Senator Harkin \ndescribed, and that is on the issue of cholesterol screening.\n  If you have heart disease and have cholesterol screening for that \nheart disease, it is covered under Medicare. But if you do not have \nheart disease and the screening is to determine whether you have heart \ndisease, it is not covered. It seems to me the best way to promote \nwellness and the appropriate way to deal with the reimbursement for \nthese issues, especially something such as cholesterol screening, would \nbe to cover cholesterol screening, especially if the cholesterol \nscreening is to determine whether someone has heart disease, not just \ncover in the circumstance you know they have heart disease. It seems to \nbe a similar circumstance to the situation the Senator from Iowa \nwas describing.\n\n  I am told the chairman and ranking member are off the floor working \non this bill. When they come back, I hope to inquire of them. My desire \nwould be to be the next Democratic amendment. I know the Senator from \nIowa wishes to have his amendment considered. It behooves the Senate \nand those managing this bill to put us in line, let us offer amendments \nand move them through, so that by late next week we are not in a \ncircumstance where we are told: We have to finish this bill; we do not \nhave to time to consider your amendment.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator has laid out exactly \nthe format. We know the crunch is going to come next week because at \nthe end of next week begins the July 4 recess period. They are going to \ngo around asking, Can you drop your amendment; drop your amendment; we \nhave to get out of here.\n  Here we are ready to go with amendments that I think are meaningful. \nThe Senator from North Dakota has a meaningful amendment. The one on \ncholesterol screening sounds meaningful. These are important life-and-\ndeath issues for a lot of people out there, as mammogram screenings for \nwomen are.\n  These are not amendments that are going to require a long time to \ndebate. As a matter of fact, in the length of time I have stood here, I \nprobably could have offered my amendment, had it debated, and started a \nvote on it or had it accepted. I hope we will move along.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Chair please advise at least this Senator what \nis pending at the desk right now? What is the pending business before \nthe Senate right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Enzi amendment, as \nmodified and amended. There are also two other amendments pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further parliamentary inquiry: There are three amendments \npending, and the one that is now before the Senate is the Enzi \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator assumes then the other two amendments--I am \nsorry, I forgot what they are--a unanimous consent agreement was \nentered to set them aside to consider the Enzi amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Enzi amendment was the first amendment \ncalled up, and consent was obtained to set the Enzi amendment aside, \nfirst for the Bingaman amendment and then for the Daschle amendment. \nThen Senator Enzi called for the regular order, which brought the \namendment back before the Senate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The pending business is the Enzi amendment. As I said, \nwith comity with respect to the fact the managers are not here, I will \nnot ask unanimous consent to set the Enzi amendment aside to offer my \namendment. When they come back, I hope we can do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand there are some issues as to \nwho is in line and how this is going to proceed. I will simply express \nwhat I hope will occur and what I believe is the general understanding, \nat least amongst a number of Senators, and that is that the next \namendment to be offered is a Republican amendment. We\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nhave been alternating back and forth. The amendment that would be \noffered would be the amendment sponsored by myself, Senator Schumer, \nSenator McCain, and Senator Kennedy, which deals with generic drugs. We \nwould agree to an hour of debate, no second degree, and then a vote on \nthat amendment.\n  I would ask unanimous consent for that now, but I understand there is \none Senator from the other side who may have an issue. So we want to \nwait for that.\n  As long as we are waiting and not doing much, I will talk a little \nbit about this amendment and then hopefully that will even lessen the \ntime that has to be dedicated to it once we get to it.\n  This amendment which will be brought forward by myself, Senator \nSchumer, Senator McCain, and Senator Kennedy, is very important \nlegislation. It is not specifically on the Medicare issue but it is \ncertainly specifically on the issue of how we make affordable drugs \nmore available to people in this country by making available to people \nin this country drugs which are of a generic form which therefore cost \nless and are more affordable.\n  This has been an issue that has been before the Senate before. It has \nbeen debated. As a matter of fact, a bill offered by Senator McCain and \nSenator Schumer passed the Senate by a rather large vote. I did not \nsupport it at the time. However, we have taken the issue back. We have \nsat down. We have worked very hard with all the different people who \nare concerned about how we should proceed in this very critical area of \ngetting drugs out to consumers at a more reasonable price, and we have \nnow worked out this understanding with legislation which passed out of \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, which I have the \nhonor to chair and Senator Kennedy is the ranking member. It passed out \nof that committee unanimously.\n  The reason it passed out unanimously obviously is because after a \ngreat deal of consideration we were able to reach an accommodation that \nworks rather well in addressing this issue.\n  The basic theme of this bill is really quite simple. No. 1, we want \nto make generic drugs more available to consumers on a faster \ntimeframe, which therefore gives them lower cost drugs. At the same \ntime, we want to continue to encourage innovation, especially in our \nbrand-name companies, which are the ones that create the drugs to begin \nwith. Without their creativity and research, we would not have a \ngeneric industry because there would not be any underlying drug from \nwhich to develop the generic. So we do not want to chill innovation. \nRather, we want to accomplish both goals, and to some degree the goals \npull at each other.\n  The third thing which I was concerned with was that we not set up a \nmassive atmosphere of litigation, that we not create a minefield of \nlitigation through which people have to pass before they are successful \nin getting the generics to the market or fight getting the generics to \nthe market, having a definitive decision in both of those areas.\n  This bill does that. It accomplishes those three goals. I think it \ndoes as well as can be expected in the context of the different forces \npulling at the issue.\n\n  It builds upon the underlying law, which is the Hatch-Waxman law, \nwhich was extraordinarily good legislation put together by Senator \nHatch on our side of the aisle and Congressman Waxman across the \nhallway, which basically created the first attempt at settling out the \nissue of how generics get to the market in a prompt way while still \nmaintaining innovation.\n  Over the years, Hatch-Waxman, as with much legislation, was put under \nthe microscope of the attorneys and the creative folks who work for \nvarious entities involved in this issue. As a result, it developed \ncracks. We found that in some instances the system was being gamed and \nin some instances simply misdirected. As a result, it wore down over \ntime and there were corrections that needed to be made. That is what \nthe purpose of this bill is, to correct the problems we saw that were \noccurring.\n  At the same time we moved this legislation forward, the \nadministration was moving forward with its own initiative in this area \ndealing with a 30-month stay issue, which is the technical part of this \nbill. They have now put out a rule in this area. The rule is fairly \nclose to where we end up with the legislation. As a practical matter, \nthe administration could not go as far as they wanted. And when I am \ntalking of the administration, I am speaking of the FDA, the Food and \nDrug Administration. They could not go as far as they wanted to go \nbecause they were restricted by the fact they were working within the \nframework of regulatory requirements, but because we are working in a \nlegislative atmosphere we can go much further, and we have. We have \naddressed not only the issue of the 30-month stay, we have addressed \nthe issue of the 180-day questions which were raised. We have addressed \nthe issue of listing, of how we handle the orange book and a variety of \nother issues, including patent extension, the changing of labels, \ncoloring of pills, and things like that which became an issue of \nwhether they were actually substantive changes or attempts simply to \navoid having the generics come to the market.\n  Our bill goes considerably further than the rule the FDA has put in \nplace. In my opinion, it is a very substantive improvement over the \nproposal which came through this body last year, and although it \npassed, it never became law. That is why it has garnered very \nbipartisan support.\n  I note the amendment I am going to be offering is cosponsored. The \noriginal sponsors are from last year, Senators Schumer and McCain, who \ndesigned this bill, joined by myself and Senator Kennedy, the chairman \nand the ranking members of the committee, Senator Roberts, Senator \nEdwards, Senator Collins, Senator Leahy, Senator Johnson, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Harkin, and Senator Kohl. I know other Members have a \ndeep interest in this bill and will probably want to cosponsor this \namendment also.\n  With that being said as an introduction to the issue, hopefully we \ncan move to it as soon as we reach an accommodation with all of those \nparties who have other issues floating around.\n  I will yield the floor unless the Senator from Oregon has a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I could pose a question to the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from New York, who has been very gracious in \nindicating that he has been in support of what I want to do. Last week \nI made public a report from the General Accounting Office involving \nTaxil, which is the biggest selling cancer drug in history. This drug \nwas developed largely by the taxpayers, with everything for support \nfrom the Pacific yew tree, which grows in my home State of Oregon, all \nthe way to the work done at the National Cancer Institutes by Federal \nresearchers, and has produced $9 billion in sales for Bristol-Myers \nwith the Federal Government getting a return of about $35 million, \nabout one half of 1 percent on the biggest selling cancer drug in \nhistory.\n\n  In this report, the General Accounting Office documents that the \nFederal Government basically dropped the ball. Without going to price \ncontrols and regulations and things of this nature, with some modest \nsteps, the Federal Government could have stood up for the taxpayers and \nthe patients who cannot afford the medicine and gotten the drug to \nmarket quickly and also taken steps to make it affordable and to \nprotect the taxpayers. It is my desire, as somebody who has worked on \nthese issues often with the Senator from New Hampshire for many years, \nto work out a bipartisan agreement where the National Institutes of \nHealth would simply consider affordability when it enters into these \nagreements. It would not have to do anything prescriptive but would \nalso have to look at affordability. I do not want in any way to hold up \nthe work of the Senator. I think what he and the Senator from New York \nhave done is very helpful, but I would have to object now if we could \nnot get an agreement to at least at some point in this take a very \nmodest step and ask that the question of affordability be considered \nwhen the National Institutes of Health enters these agreements, given \nthe fact that basically patients on this particular drug, which has \nbeen the biggest selling cancer drug in history, cannot afford it and \ntaxpayers got very little in return.\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\n  Would that be acceptable to the Senator from New Hampshire? If I did \nnot object at this point, would the Senator from New Hampshire work \nwith me so at some point later in this discussion we could get a \nbipartisan agreement on a very modest step that affordability be \nconsidered in these agreements? Is that acceptable to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. First, I was very impressed with the report the Senator \nwas able to get out of the public domain. It was a report that raised \nvery serious issues. The fact is it appears somebody dropped the ball \nsomewhere in the process. We should have gotten a better return for the \ntaxpayer than we got on this drug.\n  The Senator is approaching an issue which needs to be addressed. I am \nhappy to work with the Senator to try to address it. I cannot say \nunilaterally I can agree to the terms, but I will work throughout the \nday and tomorrow and have our staffs work to try to come up with \nlanguage that gets to the Senator's purpose to make sure, when this \nresearch is done by NIH or other Federal entities, that research \nreceives a fair return to the taxpayer. I was rather surprised we did \nnot in that instance. I am happy to work with the Senator.\n  On this amendment, there is an agreement between myself and the other \nprimary sponsors that we will not have second-degree amendments because \nwe worked hard to get to this point.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is being \nvery gracious. On the basis of his statement that he would work with me \non it--what the Senator from New Hampshire and Senator Schumer have \naccomplished is very important. I reiterate how important it be done at \nthis time. It is one thing when drugs are developed with private sector \nmoney. It is a free enterprise system. Fortunately, investors take \nrisks. There are some gushers, some that are not profitable. It is a \ndifferent story when the drugs get to market with taxpayer money. Here \nwe have the largest selling cancer drug in history.\n  It is imperative over the next day or so we work in a bipartisan way. \nThe National Institutes of Health does phenomenal work. I don't want to \ndo anything to impede their mission in getting drugs to market quickly. \nThat is their first and foremost obligation. But let us also make sure \nwhen they sit down and enter into these agreements, they also try to \nmake sure the drugs are affordable. It is one thing to get the drugs on \nthe shelf, and it is another to not have the patients able to afford \nthem.\n  On the basis of the pledge of the Senator from New Hampshire to try \nto work this out with me in the next day or so in an agreeable fashion, \nI do not intend to object. I want to see the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and the Senator from New York go forward. I will \nwork with the Senator from New Hampshire when he completes this \nimportant amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator from Oregon. His issues are \nlegitimate. I certainly hope we can work this out and include it in the \nbill. It is an appropriate place for it.\n  I now ask unanimous consent, regarding the amendment Senator Schumer, \nI, Senator Kennedy, and Senator McCain will offer relative to generics, \nthat we have 1 hour of debate equally divided and there be no second \ndegrees and the yeas and nays be considered as ordered on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator, the Senator \ncannot order the yeas and nays by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside and that Senator Gregg be recognized in order \nto offer an amendment regarding generic drugs, with no second-degree \namendment in order to the amendment; further, that there be 60 minutes \nequally divided for debate prior to the vote in relation to the \namendment; provided further that at 3:45 today the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Enzi amendment, No. 932, as amended, with no \nother amendments in order to the Enzi amendment. I further ask that \nfollowing that vote there be 10 minutes equally divided for debate \nprior to a vote in relation to the Daschle amendment, No. 939, again \nwith no second-degree amendment also in order prior to the vote. \nFinally, I ask consent that following that vote, the Senate proceed to \na vote on the Gregg amendment, with no intervening action or debate, \nand 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote.\n  I further ask consent that following disposition of the Gregg \namendment, the next sequence of amendments be the following: Senator \nDorgan, Senator Grassley, and Senator Harkin, and these would be first-\ndegree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if we could get \nsome time to explain the amendments.\n  The second two votes will be 10-minute votes? I ask consent they be \n10-minute votes, not the ordinary 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I amend my consent request accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, as the manager of the bill \nsaid, there will also be 2 minutes equally divided before each vote?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is in my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, is \nit my understanding the vote on Gregg-Schumer is the third rollcall \nvote in sequence, and following the disposition of that vote I will be \nrecognized to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 945\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n     Edwards, Ms. Collins, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Feingold, \n     Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 945.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text Of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona, who is one \nof the original creators of this legislation and has done such \nextraordinary work in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg for his leadership \non this legislation. I thank him for reaching out to Senator Schumer, \nSenator Kennedy, and myself to resolve issues that are important. He \nrecognized the problem existed and worked to ensure loopholes in the \nsystem are closed and consumers have access to the best and most \naffordable medicines. Senator Gregg's leadership enabled the \nexpeditious introduction and successful committee markup of this \nlegislation. Under his chairmanship, the bill was reported out by \nunanimous consent last Wednesday.\n  Senator Kennedy's support of this measure must also be recognized. \nHis\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nexperience and technical expertise have been invaluable throughout the \nprocess. Staffs of all three of these Senators have worked 7 days a \nweek for the last few weeks to ensure that the language we have crafted \nis as technically sound as possible without unintended consequences.\n  I also thank my friend, Senator Schumer, with whom I have enjoyed \nworking over the last few years. His dedication to American consumers \nand his commitment to restoring fairness to the drug industry must be \ncommended time after time.\n  This amendment will enhance competition and restore a level of sanity \nin the pharmaceutical market. The amendment closes loopholes in the \ncurrent food and drug laws that allow brand pharmaceutical companies to \nprotect themselves from generic competition by unfairly extending drug \npatent life, maximizing company profits on the backs of American \nconsumers.\n  This amendment ensures that lower cost generic drugs will get to \nmarket faster and with more competition, allowing substantial savings \nfor both consumers and taxpayers. With this measure, we are one step \ncloser to the larger goal of providing better access to affordable \nhealth care for all Americans.\n\n  Several years ago, my good friend, Senator Schumer, and I began this \neffort when we introduced the first Greater Access to Affordable \nPharmaceuticals Act in the fall of 2000. I joined Senator Schumer then \nin order to put a stop to the anticompetitive actions in the \npharmaceutical industry that artificially inflate prices and keep lower \ncost prescription drugs out of the hands of American consumers. I am \nhere today because those loopholes remain.\n  Last summer, when the Senate was mired in partisan gridlock debating \na Medicare prescription drug benefit, the later version of the bill was \nused as a vehicle for Medicare debate. Although the Senate failed to \npass a Medicare prescription drug benefit package last summer, the GAAP \nAct passed by an overwhelming margin of 78 to 21. That bill set \nconsumers on course to save an estimated $60 billion over 10 years, \nwhile providing seniors and all Americans with access to more \naffordable prescription drugs. Unfortunately, after our astounding \nvictory for consumers, the bill was not subsequently passed or even \nconsidered by the other body.\n  Today, we are once again debating Medicare prescription drug \nbenefits. We have before us a plan that is estimated to cost a minimum \nof $400 billion over the next 10 years but will surely cost \nsubstantially more upon implementation. Unlike the majority of the \namendments that have been and will be considered during this debate, \nthe amendment we are offering will not cost the taxpayers a dime. In \nfact, it will save money for both the Federal Government and American \nconsumers.\n  The amendment is the result of a carefully crafted bipartisan \ncompromise, which Senators Schumer, Gregg, Kennedy, and I reached \nseveral weeks ago. This amendment achieves the same goals Senator \nSchumer and I have been striving to achieve over the last few years. It \ncloses loopholes in the law, encouraging competition, without \nsacrificing incentives for innovation, while discouraging \nanticompetitive behavior on the part of brand or generic drug \ncompanies.\n  Of the many elements contributing to the rapid growth in our Nation's \nhealth care costs, the rising costs of prescription drugs is one of the \nmost significant. This year alone, prescription drug costs are expected \nto rise by 19 percent.\n  I ask my friend from New Hampshire if he would yield me an additional \n4 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator from Arizona such time as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from New Hampshire.\n  I want to repeat that comment. This year alone, prescription drug \ncosts are expected to rise by 19 percent. Today, this morning, in New \nYork, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Arizona, seniors are getting on \na bus--in the case of Arizona, to drive to Mexico; in the case of New \nHampshire, Massachusetts, and New York, to go to Canada--to buy their \nprescription drugs. Most times these prescription drugs are fine. Most \ntimes they are exactly what they are advertised to be. But sometimes \nthey are not. That is because these seniors who are having to get on \nthe bus to go to Canada or Mexico simply cannot afford to go to their \nlocal druggist and get the prescription drugs that they very badly \nneed--many cases in lifesaving situations.\n  Skyrocketing health care costs have left many businesses struggling \nto provide coverage for their employees and an increasing number of \nAmericans without any health insurance. Consequently, access to \naffordable prescription drugs represents one of the most serious \nproblems facing our Nation's health care system today. Not isolated to \none segment of society, this issue affects individuals, families, \ncompanies, and the like.\n  The financial burdens associated with rising prescription drug costs \nhave left many companies struggling to provide employees with health \ncare coverage. This January, workers at General Electric staged a 2-day \nstrike over increased copayments for prescription drugs covered under \nthe company's insurance plan. General Motors, one of the largest \nproviders of private sector health care coverage, spends billions of \ndollars a year on workers, retirees, and their dependents, over $1 \nbillion of which is on prescription drugs alone. Even with aggressive \ncost-saving mechanisms in place, General Motors' prescription drug \ncosts continue to rise between 15 percent and 20 percent per year.\n  Given the crises in both corporate America and our Nation's health \ncare system, anticompetitive behavior in the marketplace is \nparticularly onerous. Such abuse simply has no place in our health care \nsystem. My intention in supporting this amendment is not to weaken \npatent laws to the detriment of the pharmaceutical industry, nor is it \nto impede the tremendous investments they make in the research and \ndevelopment of new life-sustaining drugs. The purpose of the underlying \nlegislation is to close loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman Act, which \nestablished the generic drug industry we know today, and to ensure more \ntimely access to generic medications. This is an important distinction \nwhich must be made clear.\n\n  Nonetheless, to believe that patent laws are not being abused, is to \nignore the mountain of testimony from consumers, industry analysts, and \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Over the past three years several \nSenate and House committees have heard testimony regarding the extent \nby which pharmaceutical companies, including generic manufacturers, \nengage in anti-competitive activities and impede access to affordable \nmedications. During a hearing at the Senate Commerce Committee, \nChairman Muris of the FTC testified that:\n\n     [in] spite of this remarkable record of success, the Hatch-\n     Waxman Amendments have also been subject to abuse. Although \n     many drug manufacturers, including both branded companies and \n     generics, have acted in good faith, some have attempted to \n     ``game'' the system, securing greater profits for themselves \n     without providing a corresponding benefit to consumers.\n\n  The intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act was to address the escalating \ncosts of prescription drugs by encouraging generic competition, while \nat the same time providing incentives for brand name drug companies to \ncontinue research and development into new and more advanced drugs. To \na large extent, Hatch-Waxman has succeeded in striking that difficult \nbalance between bringing new lower-cost alternatives to consumers, \nwhile encouraging more investment in U.S. pharmaceutical research and \ndevelopment in the pharmaceutical industry has increased exponentially. \nUnfortunately, however, some bad actors have manipulated the law in a \nmanner that delays and, at times, prohibits generics from entering the \nmarketplace.\n  I believe that this amendment will improve the current system while \npreserving the intent of Hatch-Waxman. This legislation is not an \nattempt to jeopardize the patent rights of innovative companies, nor \ndoes it seek to provide an unfair advantage to generic manufacturers. \nRather, the intent of this amendment is to strike a balance between \nthese two interests so that we can close the loopholes that allow some \ncompanies to engage in anti-competitive actions by unfairly prolonging \npatents or eliminating fair competition.\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\nIn doing so, we offer consumers more choice in the marketplace.\n  It is imperative that Congress build upon the strengths of our \ncurrent health care system while addressing its weaknesses. This should \nnot be done by imposing price controls or creating a universal, \ngovernment-run health care system. Rather, a balance must be found that \nprotects consumers with market-based, competitive solutions without \nallowing those protections to be manipulated at the consumers' \nexpense--particularly senior citizens and working families without \nhealth care insurance.\n  I want to thank my friend, Senator Schumer, with whom I have enjoyed \nworking over the last few years. His dedication to American consumers \nand his commitment to restoring fairness to the drug industry must be \ncommended.\n  I also want to thank Senator Gregg for reaching out to Senator \nSchumer, Senator Kennedy and myself, to find middle ground. He \nrecognized that this problem existed and joined us to ensure that \nloopholes in the system are closed and consumers have access to the \nbest and most affordable medicines. Senator Gregg's leadership enabled \nthe expeditious introduction and successful Committee markup of this \nlegislation, where under his chairmanship the bill was reported out by \nunanimous consent last Wednesday.\n  Senator Kennedy's support of this measure must also be recognized. \nHis experience and technical expertise have been invaluable throughout \nthe process. The staffs of all three of these senators have worked \nseven days a week for the last few weeks, to ensure that the language \nwe have crafted is as technically sound as possible--without any \nunintended consequences.\n  It is my strong belief that this measure represents a significant and \nimmediate step that Congress can take to help to improve the lives of \nmany Americans. I look forward to debating this issue and working with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect the health care \nneeds of older Americans while also eliminating the anti-competitive \nabuses of both pioneer and generic drug companies.\n  This place in some ways has become more partisan than a lot of us \nwould like. I think this legislation is an example of how people on \nboth sides of the aisle can work together. In this case, the chairman \nand ranking member of the appropriate committee, Senator Gregg and \nSenator Kennedy, have worked together, as have Senator Schumer and I, \nand all others on his committee who have made this legislation come to \nthe floor. I imagine it will pass with relative ease, to the benefit of \nmany millions of Americans.\n  I again thank all who have been involved in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for laying \nthe foundation without which this piece of legislation could not have \ncome forward. I thank him, and, of course, Senator Schumer--two key \nMembers in getting this initiative going. I congratulate them for \nmaking this product a much better product this year.\n  Also, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I cleared this with the Democratic \nmanager. I ask unanimous consent that I control the time under the \ncontrol of the Democratic manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleagues and my friend, the Senator from Arizona, who is \njust walking off the floor. He and I got involved in this issue a \ncouple of years ago when we saw the abuses that occurred. He has been \nsimply a pleasure to work with--right on the money, focused on getting \nthe job done for consumers, and not being deterred by interest groups \non one side pushing him one way or by others questioning him on this or \nthat. I thank him.\n  I also thank my partner in this endeavor, Senator Gregg of New \nHampshire. Early on this year, he came over to Senator McCain and me \nand said: Why can't we work this out? He agrees with the principles in \nthe bill that we put together, but he had some very positive and \nconstructive suggestions. I mean this as a complete compliment, having \nspent 7 years there. Without his New England style leadership--\nunderstated, to the point, courageous, forthright--this bill would not \nhave gotten as far as it did. I thank him for his leadership. I would \nsay that New England leadership is tempered by having spent a few years \nin higher education in the great city of New York as well.\n  Finally, I thank my good friend and our great leader in this Senate, \na Senator I have been privileged to know and who again has been \ninvaluable in bringing this bill to the floor. The original Schumer-\nMcCain bill would not have gotten the push that it did if the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts had not steered it through the shoals of the health \ncommittee when he was chair, and again he and his staff have just been \nof constant, invaluable assistance in making this happen. I thank him \nfor that.\n  The concept of this bill is simple. It is clear that we know we have \nthese miracle drugs. They are wonderful drugs. The people who invent \nthem in the pharmaceutical industry, I know many have had harsh words \nfor on occasion, and I am not the least of those. But they do a very \ngood thing. They come up with new, wonderful drugs that keep people \nliving longer and living healthier.\n  One of the reasons that my parents--praise God--just last week turned \n80 and 75--our whole family got together and celebrated their birthdays \nin Connecticut--is the fact that these drugs are available. I think \nevery family can recount the stories.\n  The careful balance we seek to reinstate here says we want to see \ninnovation continue. We want to see a fair and reasonable rate of \nreturn made. We want to realize that for every 1 successful drug, there \nmay be 20 or 50 or even 100 failures. There has to be an economic \nviability there. We want that to happen.\n  I think most of us agree that the Hatch-Waxman bill--I thank my \nfriend from Utah, who I think is over at the Judiciary Committee trying \nto work out another grand compromise, this time on asbestos, understood \nthat.\n  But here is what has happened over the last several years. This is \nwhere I fault the drug companies despite the goodness of the products \nthey come up with. A lot of blockbuster drugs were on the market. Their \npatents were about to expire. The drug industry, accustomed to the high \nrate of return they have had, came to the conclusion that they had to \ndo everything they could, they had to pull out all the stops to extend \ntheir monopolies. They came up with wild and crazy schemes to do it, \nsuch as patenting the substance the body makes when the drug is \ningested; developing computer programs and listing the patents on the \ndrug; and, in one case, absurdly, a new patent was asked for because \nthe color of the bottle was changed.\n  That was never the concept of Hatch-Waxman. We found that the \npharmaceutical industry, instead of spending all its time developing \nnew drugs, was developing new patents. They seemed to care more about \nhiring good lawyers than good chemists, scientists, and doctors.\n  Let me give you one example of what happened. Paxil, a $2.1 billion \ndrug used to treat obsessive compulsive disorders, has been in \nlitigation since 1998. After the lawsuit began and the first 30-month \nstay was triggered, the brand, Glaxo, listed nine additional patents on \nthe drug, triggering five additional 30-month stays.\n  Well, over the past 4 years, there have been court decisions on four \nof those patents. The patent which began this litigation was found not \nto be infringed by the generic, and three others were found invalid. \nBut the 30-month stays are still going on and on and on, costing \nconsumers $3 billion. The same drug, with its same miracle qualities, \nwould have been available for $3 billion less altogether had these \nfrivolous and unnecessary patents not been filed. Well, this story \ncould be repeated and has been repeated.\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\n  Why is this a great day for consumers? Because the cost of the \ngeneric drug is so much less than the cost of the brand-name drug. And \nthat generic drug should be allowed to come on to the market without \nfrivolous patents, lawsuits, and legal mumbo jumbo preventing that from \nhappening.\n  We want a rate of return to be made by the drug company, but we do \nnot want to allow them to do what they have been doing, with increasing \nfrequency: playing games, perverting the law, and costing consumers \nbillions of dollars because the lower-priced generic drug is delayed \nfrom coming on the market by frivolous patents.\n  Let me give you some examples in my State:\n  In Buffalo, Allegra, a great drug for allergies: The brand cost for \n30 pills is $84.56; if a generic were available, it would cost about \n$32.98.\n  In New York City, Prevacid, to treat acid reflux: The brand cost is \n$154.28; the generic would cost $60.17.\n  In Rochester, Celebrex, a great drug for arthritis: The brand cost is \n$108.29; the generic would cost $42.23.\n  In Rochester, Lipitor, a wonder drug for cholesterol; I think it is \nnow the largest selling drug in the world: The brand cost is $77.73; \nthe generic would cost $30.32.\n  And finally, in Syracuse, Norvasc, for angina and hypertension: The \nbrand cost is $54.37; the generic would cost $21.20.\n  The bottom line is: When 30 pills cost you $100 for the brand-name \ndrug, it will cost you $25 or $30 for the generic--for the exact same \nmedication.\n  What our proposal does is encourages robust competition by allowing \nthe generic to come on to the market in its fair time. It restores the \nbalance of Hatch-Waxman. It does it in a way without frivolous \nlawsuits. It does it in a way that gives everybody notice. But what it \nsays is, the recent trend to extend the patent monopolies long beyond \nwhat anyone thought they should be will be stopped.\n  So this is a fair compromise. It is a compromise that helps \nconsumers. It was estimated that the original McCain-Schumer--bill I \ndon't see why it should be too much different in this new bill that \nSenator Gregg and myself, with Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy, have \nsponsored, other than some changes due to the baseline--would have \nsaved American consumers $60 billion over 10 years. It was estimated \nour bill would have saved $18 billion in the Democratic Medicare \npackage on the floor last year.\n  In the same way, the bill before us today will save companies, that \nare struggling to pay for health care, hundreds of millions of dollars. \nThat is why it has such a big and broad coalition behind it. And not \njust consumers and consumer groups, but industry groups, companies such \nas General Motors, the insurance industry--which I am often at odds \nwith when it comes to health care issues--are fully on our side. There \nis a broad consensus of support.\n  It is my hope the House will pass this bill. It is my hope the \nPresident of the United States will support this bill and sign it. And \nit is my hope--my sincere hope--the drug companies will see the error \nof their ways and, instead of spending so much time on extending patent \nmonopolies, they will, rather, spend that time creating new drugs. They \nwill spend their time not innovating new patents but, rather, \ninnovating new drugs. That is what this is all about.\n\n  One final point. Some might say, well, the FDA is doing some of this, \nanyway. I am glad they are, but as this chart shows, the FDA only goes \nabout a third of the way in doing what is needed in this fair and \nbalanced bipartisan compromise. In fact, when the FDA actually talked \nabout closing these loopholes, it was made clear that legislation would \nbe needed to finish the job.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this legislation finishes the job. It \nallows generics to come on the market. It will save consumers, American \ncompanies, and our Government billions of dollars and increase the \nquality of health care--the good health and vitality--of the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRAPO). The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I do not see Senator Gregg on the floor, \nso let me yield 10 minutes to my colleague and partner in this 2-year \nattempt to bring balance back into the area between brand and generic \ndrugs. He is one of our great leaders in the Senate on health care and \nso many other issues, the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Chair will remind me when I have \nused 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate Senator Schumer and \nSenator McCain for the development of this legislation from over 2 \nyears ago. I thank them for their work and help with our Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee.\n  When I was fortunate enough to be chairman of that committee, we \nconsidered the legislation, and we reported that legislation out. But \nit was a very contentious meeting of our committee, and we had a very \ncontentious debate here on the floor of the Senate.\n  But what we have been able to do over the period of the recent \nmonths, under the leadership of Senator Gregg and others, is we have \ncome up with a recommendation which reflects virtually a unanimous \ncommittee. I think this legislation is going to achieve the objectives \nSenator McCain and Senator Schumer had intended.\n  So at the outset, I want to say that I am very hopeful we will get \nthis legislation passed.\n  I quite frankly think this is the appropriate amendment on the \nappropriate vehicle because we are talking about prescription drugs and \nwe are talking about Medicare, and we are now talking about the costs \nof the prescription drugs. These matters are interrelated.\n  If you ask people and seniors about their issues with prescription \ndrugs, they will say, first, accessibility and availability, but, \nsecondly, they will talk about cost. This legislation isn't going to be \nthe final answer on cost, but make no mistake about it, as Senator \nSchumer has pointed out, the savings will be in the tens of billions of \ndollars to consumers over the period of the next few years. That is \nincredibly important.\n\n  The Hatch-Waxman legislation, as we know, was to try to provide \nencouragement to our drug companies to innovate and to create and to \nbring new possibilities into the market. It has been very successful. \nBut it has also interfered with the chances for generics to enter the \nmarket after these patents were up.\n  As has been pointed out by those earlier, we found out there were \nabuses. Senator McCain and Senator Schumer noted this and made a series \nof recommendations in order that we address it. Their position was \njustified, again just over a year ago, by the Federal Trade Commission, \nwhich virtually identified very similar kinds of problems. There were \npreviously many questions by the Members of this body--I remember the \ndebate and I can still hear the voices in opposition. But, I think, \nthis legislation is reaffirming the efforts which they have developed \nand which will, hopefully, pass here and will be accepted in the \nconference that is going to take place.\n  Just finally, Mr. President, I want to review once again, as the \nSenators have pointed out, the cost difference of the various drugs \nover recent times.\n  First of all, this chart I have in the Chamber shows you that the \nbrand and generic price gap continues to widen.\n  This chart goes back to 1990. And here you will see, the average \nprescription was going for $27.16, but only $10.20 for the generic.\n  On the chart, the red represents the continuing increase in the cost \nof the average prescription drug that is requested by the pharmacy. It \nhas gone up to $65.29 over the period of 10 years. For the generic, it \nhas gone from $10.29 up to $19. So we have seen this dramatic increase \nin terms of the brand name, and really a very level increase \neffectively in terms of the generic.\n  If we are talking about cost and talking about prices, the more we do \nto help give consumers a greater opportunity to get generics, we will \nhave had some important impact in terms of creating a downward trend in \nprices. That is enormously important.\n  Let's just look over, as others have pointed out, the difference \nbetween the average cost per brand name on these\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\nvarious items. If we look at Prozac for depression, $110.77 for the \nbrand name versus $44.31 for the generic. Claritin for allergies, \n$63.65 versus $25.46. And going to heart disease, Norvasc, $55.69 to \n$22.27. Zocor for high cholesterol, $124.71 to $49.88. These are \nvarious drugs dealing with ulcers, depression, allergies, heart \ndisease, and high cholesterol, which are many of the challenges our \nseniors are facing. This is a pretty good indicator of what we are \ntalking about in terms of making generics more available and improving \nthe opportunity for them to get on the market and be able to have a \npositive impact for our consumers.\n  All of us understand that we have doubled the NIH budget. That is \nbecause we recognized in a very important way, Republicans and \nDemocrats, that this really is the life sciences century. The \nopportunities we are facing now with the mapping of the human genome, \nthe analysis of DNA, the proclivities that individuals have in terms of \ncancer and other diseases, are enabling us to anticipate and begin to \ndevelop medical technologies that will help prevent individuals from \ngetting these diseases. The opportunities are unlimited. We have made \nthat commitment and we are finding these breakthroughs that are taking \nplace every single day. Many of these initiatives are up in my home \nState of Massachusetts, they are in New England, associated with many \nof our great universities and our teaching hospitals. We want to make \nsure those kinds of breakthroughs are actually going to get out and \nbenefit our fellow citizens.\n  We want to maintain on the one hand the incentives for the industry, \nthe pharmaceutical industry to move ahead with breakthrough kinds of \ntechnologies. On the other hand, we want to make sure that available \ndrugs in the form of generics will be accessible. This legislation is \ngoing to have an important impact in terms of the cost.\n  I commend the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, and Senator McCain \nfor moving this along. I thank very much the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Gregg, for giving it time and attention and for his very \nconstructive and positive help. This is an important piece of \nlegislation. It makes a very significant difference for our seniors. I \nam hopeful this will pass by an overwhelming majority.\n  I yield back to the Senator from New York any remaining time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom New York for their kind words. Obviously their efforts have \nalready been highlighted and have been the key to this successful \nundertaking. The doggedness of Senator Schumer on this issue has \nmanaged to bring this to fruition.\n  It is an important piece of legislation as has been outlined relative \nto the differential in cost. It will save people significant amounts of \ndollars on their pharmaceuticals, obviously, as they come off patent. \nIt is important not to underestimate the innovation side. We didn't \nwant to do something that basically undermines or chills innovation, \nbecause the ability of our health care system to function well today \nrequires a pretty strong pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceuticals are \nreally the process by which we are going to be caring for people as we \ngo into the future. That is where the true discoveries are occurring, \nespecially in the biologics area.\n  We want to make sure we have an extraordinarily vibrant and strong \nresearch component, not only in the public sector through NIH, where we \nhave doubled that budget, but in the private sector where people will \ninvest in research, if they see a reasonable return. Some folks forget \nwhen they go to Canada to buy these drugs at a discounted price, they \ndon't realize the cost of bringing a drug to the market is \nextraordinary. It takes about somewhere between 10 and 12, 15 years to \nbring a new drug to the market. It costs somewhere in the vicinity of \nthree quarters of a billion dollars, $750 million to $1 billion, to \nbring it to the market. You can't do that unless you have dollars to \nsupport the investment and that length of time it takes to develop the \ndrug.\n  In a free market society, dollars flow where there will be a return. \nIf somebody is going to find that they invest in a drug and that drug \nresearch comes to fruition and they produce a drug and immediately the \ndrug is taken over or in too short of a time the drug's patent rights \nare taken over so there cannot be an adequate return on investment, \npeople will not make the investment in trying to find a new drug. As a \nresult, everyone will suffer. There will be fewer new and exciting \ndrugs on the market that help people with health issues. So we have to \nhave a strong and vibrant industry doing the research. That is why I \nhave always been an aggressive advocate of a strong pharmaceutical \nindustry. It is key to maintaining a health care system in this country \nwhich is going to be vibrant and effective for people.\n  That being said, there is a time at which drugs need to come off \npatent. They have to be available at a lower price. They have to be \navailable at a more reasonable price, the return having occurred on the \noriginal investment. What we saw, regrettably, under Hatch-Waxman, was \nthere were games being played. There were games being played on both \nsides of the aisle, in fact. There were games being played on the \nbrand-name side which would use the 30-month stay as a weapon, \nbasically interminable stays. And there were games on the generic side \nwhere they might team up with a brand name and take advantage of the \n180-day exclusivity clause and never bring the drug to market even \nthough they had filed. This bill is an attempt to address those issues. \nIt addresses them very conscientiously and in a positive way. It does \nit in a way that will not open up a whole new arena of litigation. It \nis going to do it in the context of the already existing causes of \naction which is the way it should be done, and it goes a little bit \nfurther than what the administration could do in their FDA rule, quite \na bit further in some areas, certainly the 180-day issue. In addition, \nit has statutory support versus regulatory action which means it \nprobably has more opportunity to survive a court challenge.\n  We think this is an excellent bill. It is a bipartisan bill. I thank \nthe original sponsors, Senators Schumer and McCain. I especially thank \nSenator Kennedy for his willingness to work across the aisleway to make \nsure we move it through committee in a prompt way and have it be done \nin a constructive manner.\n  I notice the Senator from Maine is here. I suspect she wishes to \nspeak on this as she has been an aggressive advocate for this type of \napproach, one of the leaders on this issue in the Senate. We regret she \nis no longer on the HELP Committee because she was a positive force on \nlots of issues but especially this one specifically.\n  Now that she is chairperson of the Investigation and Oversight \nCommittee, she has her plate full of her own accord. I yield to the \nSenator from Maine such time as she may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for his \nleadership on this issue. He is an extraordinarily talented chairman of \nthe HELP Committee who was able to bring people together on both sides \nof the aisle. This is yet another example of an outstanding achievement \nof the chairman, working together to benefit the people of this \ncountry. I do miss serving on the HELP Committee. I enjoyed the many \nissues the committee addresses, and this is an issue that is near and \ndear to my heart. I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment. I commend not only Chairman Gregg, but also Senators \nSchumer, McCain, and Kennedy, for all of their hard work on this \ncomprehensive proposal.\n\n  The amendment we are offering today will make prescription drugs more \naffordable by promoting competition in the pharmaceutical industry to \nincrease access to lower priced generic drugs while at the same time \nprotecting innovation and preserving the incentives for companies to \nmake the investments necessary to develop newer, better, and safer \npharmaceuticals.\n  This amendment, which is based on legislation I joined Senators \nSchumer and McCain in introducing earlier this year, will make \nprescription drugs more affordable for all Americans. The Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that our original proposal would have cut our \nNation's drug costs by some $60 billion over the next 10 years, and I \nunderstand this compromise proposal is\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\nalso expected to result in similar savings.\n  I will repeat that. There are very few bills we are ever going to \nconsider that will result in cutting our Nation's health care costs. \nThis proposal, according to the CBO, will help reduce the cost of \nprescription drugs by some $60 billion over the next decade. At a time \nwhen we are modernizing Medicare to include a prescription drug \nbenefit, it is very important that this legislation be passed to help \nmoderate the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Prescription drug spending in the United States has increased by 92 \npercent over the past 5 years. These soaring costs are a particular \nburden for millions of uninsured Americans, as well as for seniors on \nMedicare who now lack prescription drug coverage. Many of these \nindividuals are simply priced out of the market or forced to choose \nbetween paying the bills or buying the pills that keep them healthy.\n  Skyrocketing prescription drug costs are also putting the squeeze on \nour Nation's employers, who are struggling in the face of double-digit \nannual premium increases to continue to provide health insurance for \ntheir employees. They are exacerbating the Medicaid funding crisis that \nall of us are hearing about from our Governors back home as they \nstruggle to bridge shortfalls in their States' budgets.\n  The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act made significant changes in our patent laws \nthat were intended to encourage pharmaceutical companies to make the \ninvestments necessary to develop new drug products while enabling their \ncompetitors to bring lower priced generic alternatives to the market.\n  We should acknowledge that, toward that end, the Hatch-Waxman Act has \nsucceeded to a large degree. Prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act passing, it \ntook 3 to 5 years for generics to enter the marketplace after a brand \nname patent expired. Today, lower cost generics often enter the market \nimmediately upon the expiration of the patent. As a consequence, \nconsumers are saving anywhere from $8 billion to $10 billion a year by \npurchasing lower priced generic drugs.\n  There are even greater potential savings on the horizon. Within the \nnext few years, the patents on brand name drugs with combined sales of \n$20 billion are set to expire. If the Hatch-Waxman Act were to work as \nit was intended, consumers could expect to save between 50 to 60 \npercent on these drugs as lower cost generics became available as these \npatents expired.\n\n  Despite its past success, however, it has become increasingly \napparent that our patent laws in the Hatch-Waxman Act have been subject \nto abuse. While many pharmaceutical companies have acted in good faith, \nthere is mounting evidence that some manufacturers have attempted to \ngame the system by exploiting legal loopholes in the current law.\n  Too many pharmaceutical companies have maximized their profits at the \nexpense of consumers by filing frivolous patents that have delayed \naccess to the lower priced generics. Currently, brand name companies \ncan delay a generic drug from going to market for years. A ``new'' \npatent for an existing drug can be awarded for merely changing the \ncolor of the pill or its packaging. There were examples cited by the \nChairman of the Federal Trade Commission in testimony before the Senate \nCommerce Committee last year.\n  One case involved the producer of a heart medication which brought a \nlawsuit for patent and trademark infringement against the generic \nmanufacturer in early 1996. Instead of asking the generic company to \npay damages, however, the brand name manufacturer offered a settlement \nto pay the generic company more than $80 million in return for keeping \nthe generic drug off the market. In the meantime, the consumers of this \nheart medication, which treats high blood pressure, chest pains, and \nheart disease, were paying about $73 a month, while the generic would \nhave cost them only $32 a month.\n  Last July, the FTC released a long-awaited report that found that \nbrand name drug manufacturers had misused the loopholes to delay the \nentry of lower cost generics into the market. The FTC found that these \ntactics led to delays of between 4 and 40 months--that is over and \nabove the first 30-month stay provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act--for \ngeneric competitors of at least eight drugs since 1992.\n  The FTC report pointed to two specific provisions of our patent \nlaws--the automatic 30-month stay and the 180-day market exclusivity \nfor the first generic to file a patent challenge--as being particularly \nvulnerable to strategies that could delay the entry of lower cost \ngenerics into the market. And it is precisely those two provisions \nwhich this carefully crafted compromise, which the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Kennedy, Senator Schumer, and Senator McCain have \ncrafted, it is precisely those provisions that would be solved, and \nthose loopholes would be closed by the amendment we are offering today.\n  The bipartisan amendment we are offering would restore the balance in \nthe current laws. It would close the loopholes that have reduced the \noriginal law's effectiveness in bringing lower cost generic drugs to \nmarket more quickly.\n  Again, I salute the chairman for the tremendous work that was done on \nthis important proposal. I am delighted it is being offered. I am proud \nto be a cosponsor. This will make a real difference in the drug bill, \nnot only for consumers, not only for seniors, but employers, State \ngovernments, or anyone who is purchasing prescription drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators Gregg, \nSchumer, McCain, Kennedy and others in introducing the Gregg-Schumer-\nMcCain-Kennedy Amendment to the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit \nbill.\n  As we all know, the sky-rocketing cost of prescription drugs is a \nproblem deeply affecting senior citizens across the country. During my \nlistening sessions and travels around my State of Wisconsin, health \ncare, and specifically the cost of prescription drugs, continue to be \nthe number one issue on people's minds. The problem of access to \naffordable prescription drugs is particularly acute among Wisconsin \nsenior citizens who live on fixed incomes. Nationally, prescription \ndrugs are senior citizens' largest single out-of-pocket health care \nexpenditure, and the amount they are spending is rapidly increasing: \nthis year, the average senior spends $996 a year for their prescription \ndrugs. This is expected to rise to $1,147 in 2004.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the bill on which this \namendment is based, the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals \nAct. This important legislation will improve access to prescription \ndrugs, and make them more affordable for our Nation's seniors. By \nclosing a series of loopholes that are hindering true competition in \nthe prescription drug market, this legislation will bring lower-cost \ngeneric drugs to the market faster, passing on approximately $60 \nbillion in savings to consumers over the next ten years.\n  A Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit is absolutely necessary, and the \ndebate we are having on this bill is an important one. But there are no \nreal cost-control measures for the rapidly escalating costs of \nprescription drugs. This amendment is truly a cost-savings measure for \nnot only our Nation's seniors, but also all Americans who need \nprescription drugs. This amendment offers a way to help halt the rising \ncosts of prescription drugs, without costing the taxpayers a dime.\n  Drug companies have every right to profit from their innovations. We \nneed drug companies to continue the important research that brings \nlife-saving drugs to the market. But once a prescription drug patent \nexpires, we cannot allow the drug companies to keep renewing their \npatents for frivolous reasons, denying consumers affordable access to a \ngeneric alternative.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senators Gregg and Schumer, of which I am a \ncosponsor.\n  We are all aware of the incredibly high cost of health care these \ndays and the often prohibitive cost of prescription drugs. We have all \nheard the sad but true stories of the senior citizens who are forced to \nchoose whether to buy food or buy the medicine they need. We have heard \nthe stories of seniors who only take half a pill instead of a whole one \nin order to make their prescriptions last longer. We hear these \nstories, and we all struggle to find a solution to these problems.\n  I believe this amendment is an incredibly important step towards that\n\n[[Page S8195]]\n\nsolution. In 2001, Americans spent more than $130 billion on \nprescription drugs, and of this amount, only $11 billion of this was \nspent on generic drugs. What makes this statistic so important is that \nalthough only $11 billion out of $130 billion spent was on generic \ndrugs, this $11 billion bought 45 percent of the total prescription \ndrugs purchased in 2001. Generic drugs, as safe and effective as their \nbrand name counterparts, cost up to 80 percent less than those \ncounterparts, and this amendment will help make sure that these drugs \nare made available to the consumer as soon as possible.\n  This important amendment will close the loopholes that brand name \ncompanies have been using to make sure that their drug is the only one \non the market, keeping their profits, and consumer costs, high. It will \nprevent brand name drugs companies from listing frivolous patents with \nthe FDA in order to keep generics from being able to enter the market, \nand if they do, it will give generic companies recourse options. It \nwill limit brand name companies to one automatic 30-month stay \nautomatically keeping a generic alternative off of the market, instead \nof unlimited stays, which have kept generics off the market for years.\n  These provisions, and others in this amendment, will save significant \nmoney to States, large corporations, small businesses, senior citizens, \nand so many others--money we could all use in this economy. For \nexample, at the State level, Wisconsin spent over $14 million dollars \nin 2001 as a part of its Medicaid Program on 17 popular drugs whose \npatents will expire in the next 2 years. If generics for those drugs \nare allowed to enter the market, the taxpayers in my State will save \nabout half of that money. That is no small change.\n  At the same time, however, this amendment will not force \npharmaceutical companies to stop researching and developing new and \nimproved drugs, and looking for the cure for cancer, Alzheimer's \ndisease, Parkinson's disease, and so many other ailments we are so \nclose to curing. Both of these goals--bringing generics to the market \nas soon as possible, and continuing to support companies in their \nresearch and development efforts--are vital, and I believe this \namendment strikes a solid balance between the two.\n  I would like to commend Senators Schumer, McCain, Kennedy, and Gregg \nfor their hard work on this effort, and I encourage all Senators to \nvote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Gregg-Schumer \namendment. This is a revised and improved version of S. 1225, the \nGregg-Schumer bill, ``The Greatest Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals \nAct of 2003.'' The HELP Committee reported S. 1225 just last week.\n  This bipartisan amendment was authored by Senators Gregg, Schumer, \nMcCain, and Kennedy. I commend all of them for their hard work which, I \nbelieve has resulted in a bill that is vastly improved over legislation \nthat passed the Senate last July, S. 812. Additionally, substantial \nimprovements have been made between the version reported by the HELP \nCommittee last week and the new draft of the amendment that I \nunderstand was only completed early this morning after an all night \ndrafting session.\n  While I am supportive of the efforts and leadership of Senator Gregg \nand his prime cosponsors, Senators Schumer, McCain, and Kennedy, I am \nnot in position to support this extremely important but complicated \namendment at this time.\n  While I am mindful that the underlying bill is an attractive vehicle \nfor this amendment, my experience teaches me that it is good to let the \ndust settle a bit, or at least let the ink dry, before making an \ninformed judgment on an amendment that works at the complex \nintersection between the patent code and the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act.\n  I can say this for certain: Senators Gregg, Schumer, McCain, and \nKennedy deserve credit for their effort to make drugs more affordable \nfor the public without undermining the existing incentives for \ndeveloping new medicine.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the \nissue of competition in the pharmaceutical industry. This hearing \nfocused on the July 2002 Federal Trade Commission Study: Generic Drug \nEntry Prior to Patient Expiration, the recently-finalized Food and Drug \nAdministration rule on patent listings and the statutory 30-month stay \navailable in certain circumstances, and the new bipartisan Gregg-\nSchumer legislation, S. 1225.\n  At that hearing, I requested the Department of Justice to give us its \nopinion on the constitutionality of a provision of the legislation and \nasked the Patent and Trademark Office for their views on the patent-\nrelated provisions of the bill. I want to learn more from DOJ and PTO \nand others about their views on this only recently developed piece of \nlegislation.\n  As well, at the hearing I discussed with the Chairman of the Federal \nTrade Commission, Tim Muris, and the Chief Counsel for Food and Drugs \nat the Department of Health and Human Services, Dan Troy, problems that \nmay arise from the manner in which the bill addresses the granting of \nthe 180-day marketing exclusivity incentive when patents are \nsuccessfully challenged. The amendment appears to retain a feature of \nthe current system that grants the 180-day marketing exclusivity period \nto first filers of generic drug applications rather than those \napplicants actually successful in defeating the patents of pioneer drug \nfirms.\n  I look forward to working with the proponents of this legislation and \nonce again commend them for their efforts to bring innovative and \naffordable drugs to the American public.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Schumer for their \nbipartisan efforts and leadership on this issue. This amendment would \neliminate questionable practices that have emerged since passage of \nHatch-Waxman. I applaud the responsible intent of this amendment.\n  This amendment reduces the possibility for drug companies to play \ngames and prevent competition. These drug companies have not been \naccountable to consumers. Simply stated, this bill helps to ensure that \nconsumers have access to low-priced drugs. This is a good thing.\n  This amendment reduces the cost of prescription drugs.\n  I can't think of a better time to enact these improvements. The \nunderlying bill, S. 1, will provide drugs to seniors and this amendment \nwill ensure access to lower priced drugs to everyone.\n  I support this amendment and appreciate the efforts of the HELP \nCommittee on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gordon \nSmith of Oregon be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 4 minutes. \nThe Senator from Montana has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMontana, who is working hard overall on this legislation. We appreciate \nhis work.\n  I came to the floor today to join with colleagues to support this \namendment and to commend the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for their joint leadership on the committee of \njurisdiction and on this very important amendment.\n  I think one of the most important actions we can take to lower \nprescription drug prices for everyone is this amendment. Making the \nmarketplace work, making competition work, allowing, once a patent is \ncompleted, for a generic drug--or, as we say in Michigan, an \nunadvertised brand--to have the opportunity to go on the market, to be \nable to manufacture that drug and drop the price, I think is very \nsignificant.\n  It is very important that we adopt the provisions in this amendment \nthat relate to enforcement and the 30-month stay.\n\n[[Page S8196]]\n\n  We have had in Michigan for the last couple of years a very important \ncoalition with Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the Detroit Regional \nChamber, and the Grand Rapids Chamber. I just came from a meeting in my \noffice with representatives from the chambers, with other businesses, \nand those in the community who understand we have to get a handle on \nthe explosion of prescription drug prices, and it is critically \nimportant we have competition to bring those prices down.\n  We know the average brand-name product is going up about three times \nthe rate of inflation. We also know it is very costly to invest in new \nbreakthrough drugs. We have many policies on the books to support and \nsubsidize, through the taxpayers, new breakthrough lifesaving \nmedication and to get it to market.\n  There is important research done in my State of Michigan, of which I \nam very proud, through those working in Ann Arbor and Kalamazoo and \nmany other parts of Michigan, which has made a real difference in our \nlives.\n  Also, after we help fund the National Institutes of Health research, \nwe allow companies tax deductions and credits for research, and we give \nthem up to a 20-year patent so they can recover their costs from their \ninvestments in critical research and then the opportunity to bring \nthese products to market.\n  The deal with the American taxpayers is once that process of \nsubsidizing and support is finished, that formula, that information is \nsupposed to be available for companies that do not do research--\ncompanies that have been called generic drug companies--to manufacture \nthat medicine at a cheaper price. They do not do the research so, by \ndefinition, it can be done at a cheaper price. We know that anywhere \nfrom 30 percent--I have seen prices that were 70 percent lower. There \nis a wide range in the ability to bring down prices by having this \nsystem work.\n  We also know that, unfortunately, there have been cases where the \nsystem has not worked, where companies have gamed the system or \nmanipulated the system to stop these lower-cost medications from going \non the market.\n  This amendment will close the loopholes and hopefully better enable \nthe system to work so we can have the benefit as consumers, as American \ntaxpayers, of the investments we have made in helping to bring new \ndrugs to the market and have the benefit of being able to afford those \nproducts once that medicine comes to the market.\n  I am very pleased and appreciate the hard work everyone on both sides \nof the aisle has been involved in to bring this legislation forward. I \nhave spoken many times on the floor about what I believe to be the two \ngoals of Medicare prescription drug coverage and lowering prices for \neveryone. This amendment is part of lowering the prices for everyone.\n  I commend everyone involved and urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it goes without saying we live in a very \ncomplicated era. That is especially true with prescription drug \npricing, health care costs, new technologies, and new health care \ntechnologies. You cannot turn on the evening news without seeing a new \ntechnology, some way to help people lead higher quality lives, and you \ncannot turn on the TV without seeing an ad where essentially a \nprescription drug is being advertised as a new drug to help make \npeople's lives better.\n  It is very hard for people to know what to believe. It is also very \ndifficult to know just what the right policy should be in Congress with \nrespect to prescription drug benefits, more particularly what prices \npeople should pay for drugs, and that is why we have deductibles, \ncopays, and catastrophic coverage, and also what price Medicare should \npay to the prescription drug companies when seniors are receiving \nbenefits for drugs, and what the subsidy would be.\n  It is not easy. I commend the Senators who put together this \namendment because this amendment says: OK, the brand-name drug \ncompanies, the pharmaceuticals have their patent protection, and there \nis a good reason for patent protection: Because it takes a long time to \ndevelop drugs, and it is expensive. But there comes a time when enough \nis enough, when 17 years--I think that is the number of years of patent \nprotection--is enough.\n  Over the years, some of the drug companies have been able to prevent \ncompetition from working; that is, the generic companies come along to \nproduce basically the same product, since the patent expired, but they \nare, in effect, denied the ability to sell at the much lower price \nbecause pharmaceuticals have multiple 30-month periods of stay. I am \nnot saying this bill is perfect, but it is a great advance in helping \nbeneficiaries and in helping the Federal Government get the best price, \nget the best buy for the drugs that are on the market that senior \ncitizens are going to utilize and buy, one way or another, and Uncle \nSam is going to buy.\n  I highly compliment the authors of this legislation. We will see how \nwell it works. My guess is it is going to work pretty well. There are \nmany efforts, Mr. President, as you know, around the country; many \nStates are figuring out ways, with volume purchasing, to get lower \nprices for prescription drugs under the Medicaid program.\n  We do not want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. The \npharmaceuticals have provided our people with wonderful drugs. There is \nno getting around that. At the same time, everybody wants to get as \nmuch as he or she can for themselves--not everybody but a lot of people \ndo. Certainly, in our competitive capitalistic system which works \npretty well, companies are concerned about the bottom line, \nshareholders, quarterly reports, so they are going to try to make as \nmuch money as they can for the shareholders, and that is their \nresponsibility.\n  In so doing, brand-name companies have taken advantage of the patent, \ntaken advantage of current law. They have found a loophole, and this \nlegislation is designed to close that loophole, so that after 17 years \nand the patent period has expired, companies can offer generic drugs, \nlower-priced drugs. That makes the most sense once the patent period \nhas expired. It is going to help. This is a bill which has many \ndifferent provisions. It is very complicated. We are entering a whole \nnew era of prescription drug benefits and a whole new way to get them \nout to senior citizens through Medicare, through private plans, through \nPPOs, through HMOs, and trying to find the right balance between value \nfor beneficiaries--that is stability, so our senior citizens know what \nthey are getting on the one hand and efficiency on the other; that is \nmaking sure it is the lowest price possible.\n  This amendment before us does a pretty good job in striking that \nbalance; that is, efficiency as a lower cost to seniors and the Federal \nGovernment because of generics, and also stability because it is done \nin a way that seniors have a better idea what they are getting.\n  I commend the Senators, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I \ncommend Senators Gregg, Schumer, McCain, and Kennedy for their work on \nthis carefully crafted and bipartisan amendment.\n  Improved access to generic drugs is a policy that is, frankly, long \noverdue. Last year I voted in favor of this amendment, and I am pleased \nto say I believe today's vote will be on an improved amendment.\n  The bill's sponsors have worked with the FDA, the drug industry, and \nthe generics to reach the compromise that is before the Senate today. \nThe result is a bill that will bring generics to the market in a timely \nway without stifling or shifting the process. Innovations that are \nvital to the American public and to health care consumers around the \nglobe are, I believe, contained within this bill. By closing the \nloopholes that have allowed both the brand name drug companies and the \ngenerics to keep more affordable drugs off the market, all Americans \nwin. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8197]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lincoln \nbe added as a cosponsor to my modified amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, that is just enough time for me to once \nagain thank the people who have brought this bill to fruition, \nespecially Senator Schumer, Senator McCain, and Senator Kennedy. It is \nvery strong legislation which is going to do a lot to make drugs more \naffordable for all American citizens, and innovation for new drugs to \ncare for the people in America.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know we are about to vote in a couple of \nminutes. I look forward to voting for this very important amendment. I \ncommend the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from New York \nfor their tireless work to bring this amendment to the floor in a way \nthat it will receive broad support. It will achieve the objective of \nlowering the cost of prescription drugs, I believe, by bringing generic \ndrugs to market faster. It will do so in a balanced, responsible way.\n  I also want to take a second to applaud the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, who really showed remarkable foresight in the original Hatch-\nWaxman bill that has done so much to maintain balance between fostering \nresearch and innovation of new drugs on the one hand and expanding \naccessibility of more affordable generic drugs on the other. The \nsuccess of that particular bill has been remarkable.\n  I do have several concerns about the amendment. I will be voting \nproudly for this amendment, but I will state the few concerns I have \nthat I hope we can address over the coming days.\n  The intent of the amendment is clear: To improve competition, to \nbring high-quality, cost-efficient, and generic alternatives to the \nmarket sooner; and this amendment does just that.\n  Mr. President, I want to address the amendment before us offered by \nSenator Gregg and to commend him for his tireless work to lower the \ncost of prescription drugs by bringing generic drugs to market faster.\n  Last year, the Senate considered, and I voted against, a proposal to \ndisrupt a system that has worked relatively well for almost 20 years--\nthe landmark Hatch-Waxman law. And I want to express my respect and \nadmiration for the tremendous commitment and foresight shown by Senator \nHatch in sponsoring and authoring--along with other colleagues in this \nbody--the original Hatch-Waxman bill that has done so much to maintain \na balance between fostering research and innovation of new drugs on the \none hand and expanding the accessibility of more affordable generic \ndrug copies of existing medicines on the other.\n  Under Hatch-Waxman, generic competition has flourished. In 1984, when \nthe law was passed, generics represented less than 20 percent of the \nmarket. Today, generic drugs represent nearly 50 percent of the entire \nmarket.\n  Yet because of some abuses of the law, S. 812 last year proposed to \naddress the conditions under which generic drugs come to market. \nAlthough the bill was intended to speed this process and bring cheaper \ndrugs to the American consumer, I voted against this proposal for a \nnumber of reasons, including concerns about the impact the bill would \nhave on public health as well as its possible effect on the development \nof new, innovative drugs. I shared the concern about abuses to Hatch-\nWaxman and agreed with issues related to rising drug costs, but the \nproposal last year simply went too far, way beyond the recommendations \ncontained in the Federal Trade Commission's 2-year study.\n  Therefore, I commend Senator Gregg for the good work he has done on \ntoday's amendment. This represents significant improvement from last \nyear's bill in an attempt to address ongoing concerns with last year's \nproposal.\n  Currently, we are working to provide Medicare recipients access to \nprescription drugs, and that debate will continue into next week. \nDuring this discussion, we must address the cost issue, what current \nchanges we must invoke to maintain the long-term sustainability of this \nadded benefit by ensuring that the cost of drugs are appropriate, \nreasonable, and not beyond the reach of Americans. The Hatch-Waxman law \nhas almost 20 years of balance, and now is the time to go back and \nreadjust and make sure that balance is well situated going forward.\n  As we look at the overall skyrocketing cost of health care, the cost \nof prescription drugs is dramatically increasing. But in the name of \ncost savings, never should we threaten public health. Furthermore, \nnever should we threaten the research and innovation that has made us \nthe envy of the world in terms of health care--the great breakthrough \ndrugs, the investment in research and development, which eventually \nwill deliver a cure for diseases that are not curable today.\n  Let me make clear that today's amendment is much improved over last \nyear's proposal, which took a heavyhanded approach to this very real \nproblem and would have dealt a serious blow to pharmaceutical research \nand innovation. My colleagues, Senators Gregg, Schumer, McCain, and \nKennedy, should be commended for their progress. Nevertheless, the \namendment still has some significant flaws. Let me briefly outline \nseveral of my concerns. Even though these concerns will not prevent me \nfrom voting for this amendment, I believe that we must address these \nissues and I hope my colleagues will work with me in this regard.\n\n  First, I am concerned by questions that have been raised regarding \nthe constitutionality of a key provision allowing generic drug makers \nto seek declaratory judgment that the brand's patent is not valid or is \nnot infringed. At the least, it seems likely that this question will \ngenerate significant litigation; at the worst, it raises the prospect \nthat all of the work put in on this point may ultimately be for naught \nif the courts decide that it is unconstitutional.\n  Next, under current law, if the court finds that a person has \nwillfully infringed a patent, then the court awards treble damages. The \namendment states that the court need not award treble damages in some \ncircumstances--an alteration of patent rights that would apply only to \ndrug patents and that removes the disincentive for generic companies to \nwillfully infringe patents.\n  While this amendment seeks to codify the recently finalized FDA rule \nlimiting innovators to one 30 month stay, I am concerned that it fails \nto include a clarification of the Food and Drug Administration's, FDA, \ncurrent policy that an amendment or supplement to an abbreviated new \ndrug application, ANDA, cannot cover a drug other than the original \ndrug indicated in the ANDA. Without closing this obvious loophole, we \nare only creating additional problems with the appropriate \nadministration of the 30-month stay and leaving in place a possible \nmanner by which to game the system.\n  The intent of the amendment is clear, to improve competition and \nbring high-quality, cost-efficient generic alternatives to market \nsooner. If improving competition is achieved, I believe costs will \ndecrease. However, I believe changes could be made to better improve \ncompetition, for example,\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\nby allowing a generic firm that may not have been the first to file but \nis the first to have an approved drug ready for market to obtain the \n180-day marketing exclusivity. This would be more proconsumer because \nit would reward the generic company that actually gets their drug to \nmarket fastest, rather than the one that simply was first in line.\n  However, I do comment Senator Gregg for including a ``use it or lose \nit'' provision to discourage anticompetitive behavior. This is a \nsignificant advancement from last year's ``rolling exclusivity'' \nprovision, and will protect consumers from anticompetitive behavior on \nthe part of both brand drug companies and generics.\n  I will support this amendment. However, I believe we must continue to \nwork to ensure the workability of the amendment, to provide that this \ndoes not inadvertently increase the health and safety risks to \npatients, and to avoid setting precedents that could lead to greater \nconfusion and litigation in this area. I thank Chairman Gregg for his \nwork on this issue and look forward to continuing to work with him on \nthis as we move forward.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from New Hampshire for his tremendous \nsupport in authoring, sponsoring, and amending this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 932, as modified and amended.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

There are now 10 minutes equally divided prior \nto the next vote.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the amendment that is now pending before \nthe Senate addresses a concern that many of us have with regard to the \nvolatility of the premium.\n  As everyone knows, currently, the Medicare Part B premium is $58.70. \nThat is across the board, across the country. Regardless of where you \nlive, regardless of the circumstances, a senior pays $58.70. We do not \nknow what the premium for this prescription drug benefit will be. We \nare told the average cost is anticipated to be $35. But there is the \naverage national weighted premium that is supposed to be about $100, \nwhich comprises both what the beneficiary pays and what the Government \npays. If that is off by $10, if it is going to be $110 rather than \n$100, that $10 is going to be added to the $35, requiring a 30-percent \nincrease in the cost of the premium for the beneficiary.\n  So we are very concerned, first, about the unpredictability of the \npremium, and, secondly, about the volatility of the premium because we \nreally do not know what the national weighted average is going to be.\n  We also know because of utilization, there could be dramatic changes \nfrom region to region. Currently, in a Medicare+Choice program, \nincluding prescription drug benefits, a benefit package in Florida \ncosts $16 and a package costs $99 in Connecticut. So you get a wide-\nranging variance with regard to regions of the country.\n  This amendment simply says: Look, of all the factors you have to be \nconcerned about; at least on the premium you are going to have some \nunderstanding that it is not going to vary as dramatically and as \nwildly as it might because there will be a cap of 10 percent over that \nnational average for the beneficiary's contribution. If the national \naverage is $35, it cannot exceed 10 percent more in any 1 year. It \nmight exceed more than that year after year, but each year it would be \nwithin 10 percent of the average. It can go below that, but it just \ncannot go above 10 percent.\n  When you look at all of the concerns that seniors have with regard to \nthe unpredictability of this plan, the co-pay, the coverage gap, the \nstop loss, the benefits package itself--all of those concerns, in \naddition to the variance of the premium--we are simply saying, let's \ndo, at least in part, what we do with Medicare Part B. If Medicare Part \nB can be $58.70, let's say the prescription drug benefit can be $35 \nplus 10 percent regardless of what circumstances may be out there.\n  Let's give a little more certainty, a little more stability to \nseniors as they begin to pay their premiums. As it as a result of this \nbill, they are going to be paying $100 a month now for Part B as well \nas for this new prescription drug benefit per month. I think we have to \nbe concerned about how high those costs can go and how much economic \nchallenge these seniors are going to have to take on as they face the \nreal prospect of being in a position of not being able to afford the \nbenefit at all.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my dear friend and colleague from Nebraska, \nSenator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the purpose of insurance is to \nhelp stabilize the market and spread costs and risk over an entire \ngroup of people. This amendment will help achieve that goal. It will \nreduce significantly the unpredictability of the premium and the \nunpredictability of the disparity of State premiums. It will bring \ncertainty to the process. People will know that their rate cannot be \ngreater than 10 percent of the national average.\n  If we are going to manage care, we need to manage competition as \nwell. This is one way of being able to do it. Just such as in Medicare, \nthe insurance companies here, providing the new drugs, would decide \nwhat premiums to charge seniors based on experience within the State. \nWhat we would say is they have to take into account the national \nstatistics and data in determining the rates.\n  I think it will even it out, and the disparity between State 1 and \nState 2 will be significantly lower. Unpredictability will be reduced \nand the certainty that will be established will be beneficial to the \npeople. It will give seniors peace of mind, as well, with the ability \nto pay and know what the future will bring.\n  Stability and predictability is important in this particular program. \nWe hope our colleagues will take a look at this and understand that the \ndifference in the rate in New York should not be significantly \ndifferent than the rate in Florida or Nebraska or wherever we may \nreside.\n  I think we all have an interest in making sure this program works, \nthat\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nit is sustainable, and, therefore, I ask colleagues to be supportive of \nthis amendment. I think it is in the best interests of the insuring \npublic, and, in this particular case, our seniors.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the minority leader, Senator Daschle. This amendment would \nmandate a nationwide cap on the premium for the stand-alone \nprescription drug plans.\n  Although at first this amendment might seem attractive, a closer look \nreveals blemishes and flaws in this approach, flaws that would spell \ndisaster for the stand-alone prescription drug benefit and for Medicare \nbeneficiaries were we to adopt this amendment.\n  S. 1 provides for a stand-alone prescription drug plan premium that \nwould average $35 nationwide. The amendment offered by Senator Daschle \nwould cap the premium at $38.50.\n  Although it may sound trivial, the difference between these two \napproaches is an important distinction to make if we are to implement a \nsuccessful program.\n  S. 1 provides for at least two, and perhaps many more, private \nentities to bid for and provide stand-alone prescription drug coverage \nin each region. The plans may provide either the standard drug benefit \nor a drug benefit that is actuarially equivalent to the standard drug \nbenefit.\n  The actuarially equivalent plans will have some flexibility in \ndetermining the specific prescription drugs that they provide and how \nthey provide those drugs to beneficiaries. Some plans may be more \nefficient. These plans may find that they are able to provide \nprescription drugs at a lower cost and charge a premium that is less \nthan $35. Others may choose to offer enhanced coverage or use delivery \nsystems that require a premium that is higher than $35. It may be 5 \npercent higher. It may be 10 percent higher. It may be 15 percent \nhigher. Or, it could also be lower.\n  So why should we lock ourselves in? We would be negating the very \nflexibility around which S. 1 was designed.\n  The point is that by providing for an average nationwide premium and \nstipulating that the plans may be actuarially equivalent, we allow \nplans to offer choices. And that is what Americans and particularly \nMedicare beneficiaries want.\n  S. 1 provides Medicare beneficiaries with the opportunity to choose \nplans based on price, service, and within certain mandated limits, the \nprescription drugs that are provided.\n  Let me mention something that I addressed also a few days ago in my \nopening remarks. This pertains to the provision in the bill ensuring \nthat Medicare beneficiaries will have affordable prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  S. 1 gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the discretion \nto make adjustments in geographic regions so there will not be a large \ndiscrepancy in Medicare prescription drug premiums across the country.\n  This is very important to me, because I do not want Utahns paying \nsignificantly higher premiums than Medicare beneficiaries living in \nMiami or New York.\n  That being said, I believe it is better to give the Secretary of HHS \nthe discretion to make those important decisions. If we cap the monthly \npremium in legislation, we are taking away plan flexibility--one of the \nfundamental principles of S. 1.\n  If we adopt the Daschle amendment and cap the stand-alone drug plan \npremium nationwide, Medicare beneficiaries will lose choices. The plans \nwill not have the flexibility to offer improved service; they may find \nthat they are unable to offer different services at all. There could be \nlittle to distinguish plans from each other. And beneficiaries may not \nbe able to find a plan that offers the services or the particular brand \nof drug that they prefer.\n  This is not what Medicare beneficiaries want and it is certainly not \nwhat we in the Senate should offer them. My Finance Committee \ncolleagues and I have worked hard during the last several months to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with choices; choices that allow them to \ndetermine which prescription drug plan works best for them.\n  My colleague from South Dakota is concerned also about the complexity \nof variable premiums in S. 1. He has claimed that differences between \nplans will be confusing to our Nation's seniors.\n  I share Senator Daschle's desire that our seniors understand the \nterms of the plans that they are offered. However, I must disagree that \nthe stand-alone prescription drug plans provided for in S. 1 will \nconfuse seniors because the choices offered to them will be clear. \nDifferences between plans will be obvious; seniors will choose a plan \nbased on the factors that are important to them. It seems to me that \nthis promotes the kind of transparency in public policy that a \ndemocratic, open society is all about.\n  Let me mention another problem that will certainly occur if the \nSenate were to mandate a national prescription drug premium.\n  If we mandate a specific, nationwide premium dollar amount, Congress \nwill be back here every year debating whether that amount reflects the \ntrue cost to deliver prescription drugs. Since we all know how quickly \nthe Government moves, this seems like a decidedly inefficient process.\n  This is not how the American people want their elected officials to \nspend our time, and it certainly is not how I think we can best use our \ntime. This is an instance when Congress should trust the American \npeople to determine what is best for them by making choices in the \nmarketplace.\n  Furthermore, providing for a nationwide average premium allows plans \nthe flexibility to design prescription drug benefit packages that \nreflect modern health care--not just what makes sense today, but what \nwill make sense in 10 to 20 years.\n  If plans do not have this flexibility, we may in 10 years find \nourselves in the same situation that we are in today, needing to revise \na system that no longer provides the up-to-date options that Medicare \nbeneficiaries need and deserve.\n  The private health insurance market and the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Plans operate in this manner.\n  These plans provide benefits that have evolved over time in response \nto enrollees' needs to keep pace with modern health care innovations. \nFlexibility enables these plans to adjust quickly to meet their \nenrollees' needs and flexibility will allow the stand-alone \nprescription drug plans to meet Medicare beneficiary needs quickly and \nefficiently over time.\n  It is important also that we recognize that the Congressional Budget \nOffice has said that prescriptive benefits, those spelled out in \nstatute, will cost more and will provide lower quality and less \nefficient health care. Setting limits usually means that plans provide \nthe minimum benefit at the lowest cost. Providing flexibility enables \nplans to be innovative and to offer multiple coverage options that \nreflect what Medicare beneficiaries want.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to resist the \ntemptation to vote for this amendment. Although it may sound enticing, \ncapping the prescription drug premium will result in an outcome that \nnone of us desire and that no one intended.\n  Capping the prescription drug premium will result in a one-size-fits-\nall approach, an approach that will leave us in a few years with a \ntired old prescription drug plan that doesn't meet anyone's needs.\n  This bill, S. 1, is about providing people with choices--choices that \nare affordable, but choices that also provide Medicare beneficiaries \nwith what they need and want.\n  When the Government limits prices, Americans lose choices. In \nestablishing a national average premium, not a nationwide premium, S. 1 \nwill provide Medicare beneficiaries with the prescription drugs that \nthey need and the choices that they want today and in the future. That \nis what Medicare beneficiaries tell us that they want and that is what \nmy Finance Committee colleagues and I have worked so hard to provide. \nAnd that is why I will oppose this amendment and why I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time in support of the amendment has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I just want to inform my colleagues that \nthis\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nis a balanced bill. It has been very difficult to achieve that balance. \nI fear it is becoming more fragile as the days pass by. I think it \nwould be very unfortunate if this bill fell apart.\n  I am not saying, by any stretch of the imagination, that the \namendment offered by my very good friend from South Dakota is going to \ntip the balance of the bill, but I am saying--knowing of other \namendments that are coming up, and the views that various Senators are \ntaking on the amendments they may offer later on--this balance, this \nbill which I think we all want to support, is not in jeopardy yet but \nit is somewhat tenuous.\n  There are protections in the bill for premiums. A couple quick \npoints: One, under the bill, there are large geographic areas, which \nwill tend to force the premiums to not fluctuate but to be according to \ninsurable principles.\n  Second, there are very strong consumer protections that are basically \nthe FEHBP protections which provide premiums have to be in line with \nbenefits. That is under FEHBP. We incorporated that in the bill.\n  There is also a geographic adjustment in the bill. Right now, the \nSecretary has discretion to make the geographic adjustment. That might \nbe strengthened later on in the proceedings.\n  I am sympathetic with the purpose of this amendment, but my judgment \nis, at this time, we should not adopt this amendment because there are \nsufficient protections in the bill, and I do not want this bill--I do \nnot think any Senator wants this bill--to go south because of other \namendments that may be adopted that may cause that to happen.\n  This is a historic moment. We are on the eve, the cusp of passing \nprescription drug benefit legislation. We should not take that lightly. \nI know we don't. I think we want a big vote. Medicare passed by a large \nmargin back in 1965. Many Senators are saying there is a chance this \nunderlying bill could get 60, 70, 80 votes. I say to my colleagues, I \nthink we owe it to ourselves to try to find a way to help pass this \nlegislation by a large margin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment. Competition is the key to holding down costs. That is common \nsense. This amendment is anticompetitive because it constrains \ncompetition. I think we should oppose it.\n  According to CBO, the competitive policies in our bill ensure that \npremiums and cost sharing for drug coverage will be affordable. Under \nS. 1, prescription drug plans that do a poor job of negotiating drug \nprices will have to charge a higher premium. The same goes for plans \nthat are inefficient and wasteful. Plans that do a good job negotiating \nwill be able to charge lower premiums. That is the marketplace. We \nshould not micromanage it. This amendment does just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  I remind my colleagues, a similar amendment capping premiums at 5 \npercent was defeated in the Finance Committee last week by a vote of 7 \nto 14.\n  I yield to my friend from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would just say, in conclusion, \nprotections in this bill are exactly the same we have as Members of the \nSenate. The Administrator could not approve a premium unless it \nreasonably and equitably reflects the value of the prescriptions they \nare getting. A Government agency makes the decision on whether it is a \nreasonable premium.\n  When you have a deductible that is fixed, it cannot be varied at all. \nAnd the catastrophic cut-in cannot be raised. It can be lowered. You \nhave to have something left to compete on, and the premium will be one \nthing, although it still has to be approved by the Administrator.\n  So I think the balance we have in the bill is a good one. It is \nequitable, and I think it can work.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 939, as modified.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution No. 176, \nintroduced by myself and Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 176) recognizing the National Hockey \n     League's New Jersey Devils and National Basketball \n     Association New Jersey Nets for their accomplishments during \n     the 2002-2003 season.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object--and I shall not object--I \nwant to be certain I will be recognized following the disposition of \nthe resolution by the two Senators from New Jersey. My understanding is \nthat I was to be recognized at this moment. They are asking for 10 \nminutes, combined, for this resolution. Is my understanding correct \nthat I will be recognized by previous unanimous consent following \ndisposition of this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been ordered that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota shall be recognized to offer the next amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, is that reserving the time that was \nimmediately available? I am a little concerned. If the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has that, I want to honor that. If not, we might take a \nlittle more time than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time has been allocated.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I understand the drift of things, \nobviously Senators can reserve, we can work this out. I ask consent \nthat the Senators from New Jersey be given 10 minutes to speak on a \nvery important subject; following that, the Senator from North Dakota \nbe authorized on his amendment to follow the order in the earlier \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I rise today with my distinguished colleague from New \nJersey, my friend and longstanding representative of our great State, \nSenator Lautenberg, to discuss a resolution honoring the New Jersey \nDevils and the New Jersey Nets, their accomplishments in postseason of \nthe respective leagues.\n  The past 2 weeks have seen the Devils host the Stanley Cup after \ndefeating the Anaheim Mighty Ducks and the Nets reached the NBA finals. \nFor the second year in a row, the Nets have been in the finals of the \nNBA, this year against a very talented group from Texas, the San \nAntonio Spurs. These accomplishments have made the constituents of my \nState very proud, and deservedly so.\n  Over the last 9 years, the New Jersey Devils have won the NHL Stanley \ncup three times--as much as my team in hockey. During that time, a \nstifling defense led by Scott Stevens, the playmaking abilities Patrik \nElias and Scott Gomez, and the superb goaltending of Martin Brodeur \nhave become the standards of excellence in the National Hockey League.\n  At the same time, the New Jersey Nets have become one of the most \nsuccessful teams in the NBA, winning the Eastern Conference \nChampionship each of the last 2 years, led by the outstanding play of \nJason Kidd, in my view the best pointguard in the NBA.\n  The Devils and the Nets both play at the Continental Airline Arena in \nEast Rutherford, NJ, a town of about 10,000 folks. Many think it is the \nnexus of the sporting universe. We would like to see some of the \nOlympics in 2012. That is right, even though some of my colleagues from \nTexas might dispute some of that view.\n  It is a great organization that happens to own both teams, the Devils \nand the Nets. They go beyond their supporting crowds. Both teams are \nactively involved in the community and give a tremendous amount back to \nit. Patrik Elias helps support Transplant Speakers International, an \norganization that raises funds and awareness for organ transplants. \nDikembe Mutombo helped dedicate the Nets Reading and Learning Center at \nthe Hudson County Boys and Girls Club in Jersey City. Over and over \nagain the players have helped in our disadvantaged schools and \ncommunities. They are terrific.\n  I mention one individual who sets a standard for excellence in \nbusiness and in sports. That is the general manager--surprisingly, of \nboth teams--Lou Lamoriello, whose dual role is unique in the sporting \nworld. Quite frankly, I think he is the best in the business because he \nsets a standard not only on the basketball court and hockey wing but in \nhow he operates in the communities, giving back and expecting people to \nbehave and operate in a class way.\n  This is a terrific credit to an organization, to the teams, and most \nparticularly to fans who have supported them. New Jersey sometimes does \nnot get the kind of recognition it needs. These two organizations have \ndone that through dedication, teamwork, and sportsmanship. They have \nachieved great success. I congratulate them.\n  I yield to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my colleague and friend from New Jersey for \nhis enthusiasm. I know he often gets on an airplane no matter what \ntime, as long as our business here is done, and he gets up there, maybe \nsometimes in the fourth quarter of a game. But he gets there and roots \nthe Nets on.\n  I am pleased to note the great sports accomplishments of two New \nJersey teams in recent weeks. I support this resolution. I congratulate \nthe New Jersey Devils for winning the Stanley Cup and the New Jersey \nNets for winning the NBA's Eastern Conference.\n  I am going to be gracious and extend my congratulations to Senator \nHutchison, with whom I had a wager, because the San Antonio Spurs \nplayed wonderful basketball, as disappointing as it was to me and other \nNew Jersey Net fans. I paid off that wager with a case of beautiful New \nJersey tomatoes for our terrible loss.\n  Winning the Stanley Cup 3 of the last 9 years proves that the Devils \nare the most dominant team in hockey. I was thrilled to watch them win \ngame 7 with a shutout by the Devils' exceptional goalie, Martin \nBrodeur, who recorded 7 shutouts during the playoffs alone. Special \ncongratulations are in order for five players who have been with the \nteam for all three championships: Brodeur, Ken Daneyko, Scott Stevens, \nSergei Brylin, and Scott Niedermayer.\n  As mentioned by Senator Corzine, general manager Lou Lamoriello has \nestablished a culture of success in New Jersey by molding winning teams \neach year around this core of five. The Meadowlands, where the \nContinental Airlines Arena is located, is no safe haven for opponents. \nOur Devils were a remarkable 12 and 1 on home ice during the playoffs. \nThat's the most home wins in the history of the Stanley Cup playoffs.\n  It's nice to congratulate the New Jersey Nets, as well, because New \nJersey, after all, is where the first professional basketball game was \nplayed, in Trenton, 1898. No, I don't remember it.\n  The Nets have been Eastern Conference champions and have played in \nthe NBA finals for 2 years in a row. This year they compiled an amazing \nstreak of 10 consecutive wins, sweeping past the Celtics and Detroit \nPistons along the way.\n\n[[Page S8202]]\n\n  Nets coach Byron Scott has led the Nets to the most wins in franchise \nhistory. The Nets, led by their superb point guard Jason Kidd, lost a \ntough 6-game series to the Spurs, who are undoubtedly championship \nmaterial. But the Nets are in that class, as well. I hope that this \nteam will stay intact and continue on its quest to winning an NBA \ntitle.\n  New Jersey is a haven for great professional sports teams, and on \nbehalf of the whole State of New Jersey, I congratulate the Devils and \nNets and wish both teams the best of luck in the future.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I rise in sorrow because baseball lost \na legend, African Americans lost a pioneer, and I lost a good friend. I \nwent to high school with Larry Doby at Eastside High School in \nPaterson, NJ, and watched as he amassed records that were beyond \ncomprehension for most people.\n  He had four All-State letters. He played basketball, baseball, \nfootball, and he ran track well enough to earn an All-State letter in a \nbig State like New Jersey, with that population. He was not only an \nexciting player to watch on the field, he was a good man. His five \nchildren and the whole country will miss him greatly.\n  Few people realize that Larry began his groundbreaking athletic \ncareer in 1943 as the first African-American to play in the American \nBasketball League for the Paterson Panthers. He then moved on to \nbaseball, playing for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League. \nAfter returning from his service in the Navy for two years, Larry hit \n.414 with 14 home runs in his final season in Newark, NJ.\n  It was on July 5, 1947, just 11 weeks after Jackie Robinson broke the \ncolor barrier in major league baseball, that Larry Doby signed a \ncontract with the Cleveland Indians of the American League. He was the \nfirst African-American player in the American League.\n  Larry had no intention or desire to become an important part of \nhistory. When Indians owner Bill Veeck predicted to Larry that he would \n``be part of history,'' Larry replied, ``I had no notions about that. I \njust wanted to play baseball.''\n  And play baseball he did, and quite well. Larry was an All-Star 7 \ntimes in his 13-year career, and he helped the Indians win the World \nSeries in 1948 with a home run in Game 4. He hit at least 20 home runs \nin 8 straight seasons.\n  Larry went on to become the second African-American manager of a \nmajor league team taking the helm of the Chicago White Sox in 1978. He \nwas also the director of community relations for the New Jersey Nets in \nthe late 1970s, encouraging the development of youth programs in urban \nNew Jersey.\n  It was not easy for Larry, few things this important are. He was \nharassed by opposing players and fans. He was forced to eat in separate \nrestaurants, to sleep in separate hotels. Some of his own teammates \nwould not even shake his hand. But he pressed on, and we're a better \ncountry for it.\n  Larry said it best in a speech after his career had ended. He said:\n\n       We can see that baseball helped make this a better country. \n     We hope baseball has given (children) some idea of what it is \n     to live together and how you can get along, whether you be \n     black or white.\n\n  When historians take note of the great contributions made by citizens \nof the State of New Jersey, certainly the name of Larry Doby should be \nincluded. He is at the top of that long list in my mind.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague from New \nJersey for bringing up this discussion of Larry Doby, who is really a \nnational hero. I commend anyone to read the reports in today's \nnewspapers about his career and the evolution of how African Americans \nascended to the role they rightfully should have received in American \nbaseball and American life in general. He was a hero to all of us. I am \nthankful he was remembered by my senior colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8202-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8202-S8216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 946\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment I send to the desk is sent on \nbehalf of Senators Cochran and Breaux. It addresses an issue that we \nhave addressed on the Senate floor this evening. It has to do with the \nsafety aspects of the underlying Dorgan amendment.\n  As everyone in the Chamber knows, we have spent the last several days \naddressing the important issue of adding prescription drugs as a \nbenefit to our Medicare Program today and at the same time \nstrengthening and improving Medicare.\n  Just a few minutes ago, the Senate passed legislation that will speed \naccess of generics to the market, really making drugs overall, I \nbelieve, more affordable and more accessible to all Americans. This \nmerely builds on the rule announced last week by the administration \nthat will enhance the overall process with generic drugs by limiting \nbrand drug manufacturers to only one 30-month stay. But in the midst of \nthe overall bipartisan progress to enhance access to and improve the \naffordability of prescription drugs, once again this proposal or \nproposals to look at importation of drugs from Canada have resurfaced.\n  Very briefly, the Senate has debated this issue several times before. \nThe legislation itself is already on the books. Congress passed, this \nbody passed, indeed President Clinton signed into law the Medicine \nEquity and Drug Safety Act of 2000, which allows for the importation of \npharmaceuticals into the United States. However, the law provided that \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services had to demonstrate that its \nimplementation, No. 1, would impose no risk to the public's health and \nsafety; No. 2, would result in significant reduction in the cost of \ncovered products to the American consumer.\n  Since that time, two Health and Human Services Secretaries, one a \nDemocrat and one a Republican, could not demonstrate safety or cost \nsavings from importation.\n  I reiterate, the law on the books is such that safety concerns have \nbeen expressed and, indeed, two HHS Secretaries could not demonstrate \nsafety or cost savings from importation; therefore, the law has not \nbeen implemented.\n  In addition, the FDA, two separate Secretaries of Health and Human \nServices, the U.S. Customs Service, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, and almost every former FDA Commissioner have \nconsistently and repeatedly opposed these proposals and told us they \ncannot ensure that importing drugs is safe.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nJune 19 to Senator Cochran from Mark B. McClellan, Commissioner of Food \nand Drugs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Department of Health & Human Services\n\n\n                                 Food and Drug Administration,\n\n                                     Rockville, MD, June 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Cochran. This letter is in response to your \n     request for information from the Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA) on the importation of prescription drugs into the \n     United States from foreign countries. It is currently illegal \n     to import prescription drugs from foreign countries into the \n     United States, but Congress has been debating whether to \n     amend the law to allow such products to flow into the United \n     States and become part of the drug supply. The FDA has \n     serious concerns about proposals that would open America's \n     borders to a stream of imported prescription drugs for which \n     FDA cannot assure safety, effectiveness or quality.\n       We share with Congress deep concern for senior citizens and \n     other patients who have difficulty paying for their \n     prescription drugs. As I am writing this, the Congress is \n     working towards enactment of landmark legislation to provide \n     a prescription drug benefit that will enable millions of \n     America's seniors to receive coverage for their drugs in \n     Medicare. In addition, under my leadership, FDA has taken a \n     number of significant steps to provide greater access to \n     affordable prescription medications that are safe and \n     effective. These steps include new initiatives to accelerate \n     approval of innovate new medical procedures and drug \n     therapies, changes to our regulations to reduce litigation \n     that has been shown to unnecessarily delay access to more \n     affordable generic drugs and proposals to increase Agency \n     resources for the review and approval of generic drugs--\n     products that are often far less expensive than brand name \n     products.\n       The overall quality of drug products that consumers \n     purchase from United States pharmacies is very high, and the \n     American consumer can be confident that the drugs they use \n     are safe and effective. However, a growing number of \n     Americans are obtaining their prescription medications from \n     foreign sources and when they do so, consumers are exposing \n     themselves to a number of potential safety risks that must be \n     ignored. In FDA's experience, may drugs obtained from foreign \n     sources that either purport to be or appear to be the same as \n     U.S.--approved prescription drugs are, in fact, of unknown \n     quality. These outlets may dispense expired, subpotent, \n     contaminated or counterfeit, product, the wrong or a \n     contraindicated product, an innocent dose, or medication \n     unaccompanied by adequate directions for use. The labeling of \n     the drug may not be in English and important information \n     regarding dosage and side effects may not be available. In \n     addition, the drugs may not have been packaged and stored \n     under proper conditions to avoid degradation.\n       Some have suggested that limiting each drug imports to \n     those from Canada would address these potential safety \n     concerns. But FDA cannot guarantee the safety of Canadian \n     drugs. Additionally, Canadian health officials have made \n     clear in public statements that they can provide no assurance \n     as to the safety and authenticity of drugs products shipped \n     to Canada for resale in other countries. In fact, the Agency \n     has concrete examples of drugs purchased from Canadian \n     pharmacists that violate safety provisions established by FDA \n     and the state pharmacy authorities, and we had been instances \n     of internet sites that offer to sell FDA-approved drugs, but \n     upon further investigations we have determined that the drugs \n     they sell are adulterated, sub-potent, or counterfeit.\n       The relatively ``closed'' regulatory system that we have in \n     this country has been very successful in preventing \n     unapproved or otherwise unsafe drug products from entering \n     the U.S. stream of commerce. Legislation that would establish \n     other distribution routes for prescription drugs, \n     particularly where those routes traverse a U.S. border, \n     creates a wide inlet four counterfeit drugs and other \n     dangerous products that are potentially injurious to the \n     public health and that pose a threat of our nation's drug \n     apply.\n       In sum, while we strongly support efforts to make \n     prescription drugs more affordable and have taken several \n     recent steps to accelerate access to more affordable, safe \n     and effective prescription drugs, I remain concerned that \n     provisions to legalize importation of prescription drug \n     products would greatly erode the ability of the FDA to ensure \n     the safety and efficacy of the drug supply. At the time, the \n     Agency simply cannot assure the American public that drugs \n     imported from foreign countries are the same as products \n     approved by FDA, or that they are safe and effective.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Mark M. McClellan, MD., Ph.D.\n                                   Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I will read two sentences from the letter, the entire text \nof which will be in the Record. It says in the first paragraph:\n\n       The FDA has serious concerns about proposals that would \n     open America's borders to a stream of imported prescription \n     drugs for which FDA cannot assure safety, effectiveness or \n     quality.\n\n  In the last paragraph, one other sentence:\n\n       I remain concerned that provisions to legalize importation \n     of prescription drug products would greatly erode the ability \n     of the FDA to ensure the safety and efficacy of the drug \n     supply.\n\n  One final point: Canadian health officials just very recently made it \nclear\n\n[[Page S8204]]\n\nthat they cannot, and they indeed will not, vouch for the safety of \nprescription drugs imported from Canada to the United States. Thus, I \nwould argue that there is no need for Congress to pass yet another \npiece of legislation when a law is already on the books, and doing so \nonly further threatens the safety of the American public, particularly \nin this time of sensitivity to the dangers of possible biological, \nchemical, or other terrorist attacks.\n  Relying on medicines that have been imported from other countries, if \nthat were the case, I believe would lead to seniors and individuals \nwith disabilities opening themselves to unnecessary threats in \nparticular, especially in light of the current bill, where we are \ngiving them access to prescription drugs they simply did not have \nbefore. Obtaining drugs from other countries has a certain appeal to \nseniors who simply have no access to any prescription drugs at all, but \nthe underlying premise of the bill on the Senate floor is that we are \ngoing to improve that access to each and every senior, in terms of \nhaving better access to those prescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the effort to provide \nprescription drugs to Medicare beneficiaries and to lower the costs of \nmedicines for all Americans. Today's therapies are too valuable, in \nterms of improving health and quality of life, for Medicare \nbeneficiaries not to have prescription drug coverage.\n  However, we must not create new opportunities for counterfeit \nproducts, or products that have been tampered with, or products of \nunknown origin to be brought into this country.\n  The amendment I have offered requires the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to certify that the reimportation of drug products will \npose no additional risk to the public health and safety and will result \nin a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the \nAmerican consumer.\n  If reimportation is safe and will reduce costs, this amendment should \nnot pose a problem. However, these are genuine concerns that \nreimportation may not be safe for Americans.\n  We have had this issue before the Senate on two previous occasions. \nThree years ago during consideration of the annual appropriations bill \nfor the Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration and \nrelated agencies, a similar amendment was added to the bill. The Senate \nunanimously approved that amendment.\n  Then again last July, when we were considering the Greater Access to \nPharmaceuticals Act, a similar amendment was offered that limited \nreimportation to products from Canada. Again, the Senate, by a vote of \n99-0 approved this safeguard as part of the legislation that passed the \nSenate. The House did not act upon this legislation.\n  In both these cases the Senate has adopted this amendment by a \nunanimous vote both times for an obvious reason: the safety of the \nAmerican consumer must be protected.\n  Three years ago, Secretary of HHS Donna Shalala was not able to make \nsuch a demonstration as required by that law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of her letter to President \nClinton dated December 26, 2000, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  The Secretary of\n\n\n                                    Health and Human Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 26, 2000.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The annual appropriations bill for the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (P.L. 106-387), signed \n     into law earlier this year, included a provision to allow \n     prescription drugs to be reimported from certain countries \n     for sale in the United States. The law requires that, prior \n     to implementation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     demonstrate that this reimportation poses no additional risk \n     to the public's health and safety and that it will result in \n     a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to \n     the American consumer.\n       I am writing to advise you that I cannot make the \n     demonstration called for in the statute because of serious \n     flaws and loopholes in the design of the new drug \n     reimportation system. As such, I will not request the $23 \n     million that was conditionally appropriated for FDA \n     implementation costs for the drug reimportation system \n     included in the FY 2001 appropriations bill.\n       As you know, Administration officials worked for months \n     with members of Congress and staff to help them design safe \n     and workable drug reimporation legislation. Unfortunately, \n     our most significant concerns about this proposal were not \n     addressed. There flaws, outlined below, undermine the \n     potential for cost savings associated with prescription drug \n     reimportation and could pose unnecessary public health risks.\n       First, the provision allows drug manufacturers to deny U.S. \n     importers legal access to the FDA approval labeling that is \n     required for reimportation. In fact, the provision explicitly \n     states that any labeling information provided by \n     manufacturers may be used only for testing product \n     authenticity. This is a major loophole that Administration \n     officials discussed with congressional staff but was not \n     closed in the final legislation.\n       Second, the drug reimportation provision fails to prevent \n     drug manufacturers from discriminating against foreign \n     distributors that import drugs to the U.S. While the law \n     prevents contracts or agreements that explicitly prohibit \n     drug importation, it does not prohibit drug manufacturers \n     from requiring distributors to charge higher prices, limit \n     supply, or otherwise treat U.S. importers less favorably than \n     foreign purchasers.\n       Third, the reimportation system has both authorization and \n     funding limitations. The law requires that the system end \n     five years after it goes into effect. This ``sunset'' \n     provision will likely have a chilling effect on private-\n     sector investment in the required testing and distribution \n     systems because of the uncertainty of long-term financial \n     returns. In addition, the public benefits of the new system \n     are diminished since the significant investment of taxpayer \n     funds to establish the new safety monitoring and enforcement \n     functions will not be offset by long-term savings to \n     consumers from lower priced drugs. Finally, Congress \n     appropriated the $23 million necessary for first year \n     implementation costs of the program but did not without \n     funding core and priority activities in FDA, such as \n     enforcement of standards for internet drug purchase and post-\n     market surveillance activities. In addition, while FDA's \n     responsibilities last five years, its funding authorization \n     is only for one year. Without a stable funding base, FDA will \n     not be able to implement the new program in a way that \n     protects the public health.\n       As you and I have discussed, we in the Administration and \n     the Congress have a strong obligation to communicate clearly \n     to the American people the shortcomings in policies that \n     purport to offer relief from the high cost of prescription \n     drugs. For this reason, I feel compelled to inform you that \n     the flaws and loopholes contained in the reimportation \n     provision make it impossible for me to demonstrate that it is \n     safe and cost effective. As such, I cannot sanction the \n     allocation of taxpayer dollars to implement such a system.\n       Mr. President, the changes to the reimportation legislation \n     that we have proposed can and should be enacted by the \n     Congress next year. At the same time, I know you share my \n     view that an importation provision--no matter how well \n     crafted--cannot be a substitute for a voluntary prescription \n     drug benefit provided through the Medicare program. Nor is \n     the solution a low-income, state-based prescription drug \n     program that would exclude millions of beneficiaries and \n     takes years to implement in all states. What is needed is a \n     real Medicare prescription drug option that is affordable and \n     accessible to all beneficiaries regardless of where they \n     live. It is my strong hope that, when Congress and the next \n     Administration evaluate the policy options before them, they \n     will come together on this approach and, at long last, make \n     prescription drug coverage an integral part of Medicare.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on July 9, 2001, a letter from the \ncurrent Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, \nindicated that based on an analysis by the Food and Drug Administration \non the safety issues and analysis by his planning office on the cost \nissues, he could not make the required determinations, and he stated \nhis view that we should not sacrifice public safety for uncertain and \nspeculative cost savings.\n  Secretary Thompson also indicated that prescription drug safety could \nnot be adequately guaranteed if drug reimportation were allowed and \nthat costs associated with documentation, sampling, and testing of \nimported drugs would make it difficult for consumers to get any \nsignificant price savings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Thompson's letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The Secretary of\n\n\n                                    Health and Human Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2001.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: I am writing to follow up on my \n     earlier response to your letter January 31, 2001, co-signed \n     by fifteen of\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\n     your colleagues, regarding the Medicine Equity and Drug \n     Safety Act of 2000 (MEDS Act).\n       You and other Senators and Representatives asked that I \n     reconsider former Secretary Shalala's decision and make the \n     determination necessary to implement the MEDS Act. As I \n     mentioned in my prior communication, I ask the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) to carefully reexamine the law to \n     evaluate whether this new system poses additional health \n     risks to U.S. consumers, and the Office of the Assistant \n     Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (OASPE) to examine \n     whether the new law will result in a significant cost savings \n     to the American public.\n       I believe very strongly that seniors should have access to \n     affordable prescription drugs. I applaud your leadership in \n     this area, and agree that helping seniors obtain affordable \n     medicines should be a priority. However, as my earlier \n     response stated, I do not believe we should sacrifice public \n     safety for uncertain and speculative cost savings.\n\n\n                            Safety Concerns\n\n       After a thorough review of the law, FDS has concluded that \n     it would be impossible to ensure that the MEDS Act would \n     result in no loss of protection for the drugs supplied to the \n     American people. As you know, the drug distribution system as \n     it exists today is a closed system. Most retail stores, \n     hospitals, and other outlets obtain drugs either directly \n     from the drug manufacturer or from a small number of large \n     wholesalers. FDA and the states exercise oversight of every \n     step within the chain of commercial distribution, generating \n     a high degree of product potency, purity, and quality. In \n     order to ensure safety and compliance with current law, only \n     the original drug manufacturer is allowed to reimport FDA-\n     approved drugs.\n       Under the MEDS Act, this system of distribution would be \n     open to allow any pharmacist or wholesaler to reimport drugs \n     from abroad; this could result in significant growth in \n     imported commercial drug shipments. As you know, the FDA and \n     the states do not have oversight of the drug distribution \n     chain outside the U.S. Yet, opening our borders as required \n     under this program would increase the likelihood that the \n     shelves of pharmacies in towns and communities across the \n     nation would include counterfeit drugs, cheap foreign copies \n     of FDA-approved drugs, expired drugs, contaminated drugs, and \n     drugs stored under inappropriate and unsafe conditions.\n       While the MEDS Act requires chain of custody documentation \n     and sampling and testing of imported drugs, these \n     requirements cannot substitute for the strong protections of \n     the current distribution system. Counterfeit or adulterated \n     and misbranded drugs will be difficult to detect, and the \n     sampling and testing proposed under this program cannot \n     possibly identify these unsafe products entering our country \n     in large commercial shipments.\n       I can only conclude that the provisions in the MEDS Act \n     will pose a greater public health risk than we face today and \n     a loss of confidence by Americans in the safety of our drug \n     supply. Although I support the goal of reducing the cost of \n     prescription drugs in this country, no one in this country \n     should be exposed to the potential public health threat \n     identified by the FDA in their analysis. Further, the \n     expenditure of time and resources in maintaining such a \n     complex regulatory system as proposed by the MEDS Act would \n     be of questionable public health value and could drain \n     resources from other beneficial public health programs.\n\n\n                              cost savings\n\n       The clear intent of the MEDS Act is to reduce the price \n     differentials between the U.S. and foreign countries. The \n     review by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning \n     and Evaluation (OASPE) concludes there are significant \n     disincentives for reimportation under the MEDS Act, including \n     the costs associated with documenting, sampling and testing, \n     the potential relabeling requirements and related costs and \n     risk associated with such requirements, the overall risk of \n     increased legal liability, the costs associated with the \n     management of inventories by wholesalers and pharmacists, and \n     the risk to existing and future contractual relationships \n     between all parties involved. Moreover, there are a number of \n     reasons (including potential responses by foreign \n     governments) why lower foreign prices may not translate into \n     lower prices for U.S. consumers. Insufficient information \n     exists for me to demonstrate that implementation of the law \n     will result in significant reduction in the cost of drug \n     products to the American consumer.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Since I am unable to make the determination on the safety \n     and cost savings in the affirmative, as required under the \n     law, I cannot implement the MEDS Act. Please find attached to \n     this letter a more detailed analysis of the factors \n     influencing the public-safety and cost-savings questions. If \n     you need further clarification of my position on these \n     issues, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n       Thank you for your leadership in health care. I look \n     forward to working with you on new initiatives for making \n     medicine more affordable to our citizens, and on other health \n     issues of importance to our Nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy G. Thompson.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, just this week, Mark McClellan, \nCommissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has written to \nreiterate this point. I ask unanimous consent that Dr. McClellan's \nletter of June 19, 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health & Human Services, Public Health \n           Service, Food and Drug Administration,\n                                     Rockville, MD, June 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: This letter is in response to your \n     request for information from the Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA) on the importation of prescription drugs into the \n     United States from foreign countries. It is currently illegal \n     to import prescription drugs from foreign countries into the \n     United States, but Congress has been debating whether to \n     amend the law to allow such products to flow into the United \n     States and become part of the drug supply. The FDA has \n     serious concerns about proposals that would open America's \n     borders to a stream of imported prescription drugs for which \n     FDA cannot assure safety, effectiveness or quality.\n       We share with Congress deep concern for senior citizens and \n     other patients who have difficulty paying for their \n     prescription drugs. As I am writing this, the Congress is \n     working towards enactment of landmark legislation to provide \n     a prescription drug benefit that will enable millions of \n     America's seniors to receive coverage for their drugs in \n     Medicare. In addition, under my leadership, FDA has taken a \n     number of significant steps to provide greater access to \n     affordable prescription medications that are safe and \n     effective. These steps include new initiatives to accelerate \n     approval of innovate new medical procedures and drug \n     therapies, changes to our regulations to reduce litigation \n     that has been shown to unnecessarily delay access to more \n     affordable generic drugs, and proposals to increase Agency \n     resources for the review and approval of generic drugs--\n     products that are often far less expensive than brand name \n     products.\n       The overall quality of drug products that consumers \n     purchase from United States pharmacies is very high, and the \n     American consumer can be confident that the drugs they use \n     are safe and effective. However, a growing number of \n     Americans are obtaining their prescription medications from \n     foreign sources and when they do so, consumers are exposing \n     themselves to a number of potential safety risks that must \n     not be ignored. In FDA's experience, many drugs obtained from \n     foreign sources that either purport to be or appear to be the \n     same as U.S.--approved prescription drugs are, in fact, of \n     unknown quality. These outlets may dispense expired, \n     subpotent, contaminated or counterfeit product, the wrong or \n     a contraindicated product, an incorrect dose, or medication \n     unaccompanied by adequate directions for use. The labeling of \n     the drug may not be in English and important information \n     regarding dosage and side effects may not be available. In \n     addition, the drugs may not have been packaged and stored \n     under proper conditions to avoid degradation.\n       Some have suggested that limiting such drug imports to \n     those from Canada would address these potential safety \n     concerns. But FDA cannot guarantee the safety of Canadian \n     drugs. Additionally, Canadian health officials have made \n     clear in public statements that they can provide no assurance \n     as to the safety and authenticity of drug products shipped to \n     Canada for resale in other countries. In fact, the Agency has \n     concrete examples of drugs purchased from Canadian \n     pharmacists that violate safety provisions established by FDA \n     and by state pharmacy authorities, and we have seen instances \n     of internet sides that offer to sell FDA-approved drugs, but \n     upon further investigation we have determined that the drugs \n     they sell are adulterated, sub-potent, or counterfeit.\n       The relatively ``closed'' regulatory system that we have in \n     this country has been very successful in preventing \n     unapproved or otherwise unsafe drug products from entering \n     the U.S. stream of commerce. Legislation that would establish \n     other distribution routes for prescription drugs, \n     particularly where those routes traverse a U.S. border, \n     creates a wide inlet for counterfeit drugs and other \n     dangerous products that are potentially injurious to the \n     public health and that pose a threat to the security of our \n     nation's drug supply.\n       In sum, while we strongly support efforts to make \n     prescription drugs more affordable and have taken several \n     recent steps to accelerate access to more affordable, safe \n     and effective prescription drugs, I remain concerned that \n     provisions to legalize importation of prescription drug \n     products would greatly erode the ability of the FDA to ensure \n     the safety and efficacy of the drug supply. At this time, the \n     Agency simply cannot assure the American public that drugs \n     imported from foreign countries are the same as products \n     approved by FDA, or that they are safe and effective.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Mark B. McClellan, M.D., Ph.D.,\n                                   Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it would seem prudent that the safeguards \nwe have adopted twice, by unanimous votes, should also be applied to\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\nthis proposal. That is why I offer this amendment.\n  We should be certain that any change we make results in no less \nprotection in terms of the safety of the drugs supplied to the American \npeople and will indeed make prescription drugs more affordable. \nLiberalization of protections that are designed to keep unsafe drugs \nout of this country, especially considering the terrorist threats we \nface now, should occur only if the necessary safeguards are in place.\n  This amendment will ensure that the concerns of the last two \nadministrations regarding the safety and cost-effectiveness are \naddressed prior to the implementation of this proposal.\n  Currently, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it is \nunlawful for anyone to introduce into interstate commerce a new drug \nthat is not covered by an approved new drug application or an \nabbreviated new drug application. Approval must be sought on a \nmanufacturer and product-by-product basis. A product that does not \ncomply with an approved application, including an imported drug not \napproved by FDA for marketing in the United States, may not be \nimported, even if approved for sale by that country.\n  A product introduced into interstate commerce that does not comply \nwith an approved application is considered an unapproved new drug in \nviolation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as well as \n``misbranded'' under the section of that act.\n  Under section 801 of the act, a drug that is manufactured in the \nUnited States pursuant to an approved new drug application and shipped \nto another country may not be reimported into the United States by \nanyone other than the original manufacturer. This prohibition on \nreimportation of products previously manufactured in the United States \nand then exported was added in 1988 to prevent the entry into this \ncountry of counterfeit and adulterated products.\n  Section 801 was enacted not to protect the corporate interests of \npharmaceutical companies but to protect the safety of American \nconsumers. Counterfeit drugs are a very real threat and can be deadly. \nAny change of drug reimportation laws must assure safety from this \nthreat. Limiting reimportation to drugs from Canada does not \nnecessarily solve that problem.\n  In a July 11, 2001, letter to the Energy and Commerce chairman and \nranking member, William Simpkins, Acting Administrator of the \nDepartment of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration, who was \nreferring to reimportation amendments, said the following:\n\n       (W)e oppose . . . these amendments because they would \n     hinder the ability of law enforcement officials to ensure \n     that drugs are imported into the United States in compliance \n     with long-standing Federal laws designed to protect the \n     public health and safety.\n\n  More recently, in letter dated November 25, 2002, Asa Hutchinson, \nthen Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration at the US \nDepartment of Justice, reiterated this position with respect to any \ntype of proposal that might limit the ability of the FDA to inspect and \nassure the safety and compliance with Federal law of products that \nwould be brought back into the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Administrator Hutchinson's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Drug Enforcement Administration,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: The purpose of this letter is to \n     respond to your inquiry regarding the position of the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration (DEA) with respect to any proposal \n     to limit the authority of the Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA) to inspect shipments of prescription drugs that are \n     imported into the United States.\n       In general, DEA opposes any such limitations because they \n     would hinder the ability of federal law enforcement officials \n     to ensure that drugs are imported into the United States in \n     compliance with long-standing federal laws designed to \n     protect the public health and safety. Since its creation in \n     1906, the FDA has served as the American public's watchdog to \n     ensure safe, medically approved prescription drugs. In \n     undermining the FDA's ability to do its job, we risk \n     undermining the public health and safety.\n       First, a brief explanation of DEA's role in this issue: \n     DEA's statutory authority is limited to controlled substances \n     (drugs of abuse). DEA is the primary agency responsible for \n     enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). \n     Controlled substances can be viewed as a subset of \n     prescription drugs. All legal (pharmaceutical) controlled \n     substances are prescription drugs (e.g., OxyContin, Percocet, \n     Demerol, Valium). However, most prescription drugs are not \n     controlled substances (e.g., Claritin, Prozac, Viagra, \n     erythromycin, insulin). Nonetheless, for the following \n     reasons, limiting FDA's authority to inspect shipments of \n     imported prescription drugs could potentially lead to an \n     increase in the illegal importation of controlled substances \n     into the United States.\n       DEA is currently facing enforcement challenges on many \n     fronts with respect to controlled substance importation and \n     smuggling. Several foreign countries have been identified as \n     the source of a large amount of controlled substances that \n     have been illegally imported. Additionally, the United States \n     Customs Service (USCS) inspectors on the southern and \n     northern borders must determine whether each traveler \n     entering the United States with a drug is complying with the \n     Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the CSA. \n     Information obtained from the USCS indicates that there is an \n     increased volume of prescription drugs being imported through \n     the mail as a result of the Internet. Sometimes the drugs are \n     counterfeit; other times the drugs are real drugs, including \n     controlled substances, sold without the required \n     prescription. Although the CSA clearly prohibits importation \n     of controlled substances in this manner, the FDA and USCS \n     must inspect each package to ascertain the contents. \n     Identifying a drug by its appearance and labeling is not an \n     easy task. From a practical standpoint, inspectors cannot \n     examine drug products and accurately determine the identity \n     of such drugs or the degree of risk they pose. This is \n     particularly true since these drugs are often intentionally \n     mislabeled. Persons who are willing to illegally ship \n     controlled substances to the United States are unlikely to \n     honestly label their packages as containing controlled \n     substances,\n       Therefore, in order to support DEA's efforts to curtail the \n     illegal importation of controlled substances into the United \n     States, it is crucial that FDA retain its authority to \n     inspect all packages that purport to contain ``prescription \n     drugs.'' If federal law prohibited the FDA from inspecting \n     foreign shipments of prescription drugs, making an exception \n     in the law that would allow the FDA to inspect controlled \n     substance shipments would serve little purpose. The foreign \n     shipper could simply label the package ``prescription drugs--\n     noncontrolled substances'' and the FDA would be powerless to \n     take any investigative steps or to assist the DEA in \n     intercepting these illegal shipments.\n       I trust that this has been helpful in explaining he DEA's \n     position on this issue. Please let me know if there is \n     anything else I may do to assist you in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Asa Hutchinson,\n                                                    Administrator.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, William Hubbard, FDA's Associate \nCommissioner for Policy and Planning, and the FDA's authority on the \ntopic of reimportation of pharmaceuticals, has testified a number of \ntimes before Congress regarding the dangers of reimported products and \nthe inability of the U.S. regulatory system to assure the safety of \nproducts brought into this country. Most recently, this month before \nthe House Committee on Government Reform, Dr. Hubbard testified\n\n       (T)he overall quality of drug products that consumers \n     purchase from United States pharmacies is very high. The \n     public can be confident that the drugs they use are safe and \n     effective. However, FDA cannot offer the same assurances to \n     the public about the safety of drugs they buy from foreign \n     sources.\n\n  There are a number of reasons why these products are not safe. \nCounterfeiting of drugs is common throughout the world and the \ntransshipment of these counterfeit products through Canada is one of \nthe most serious dangers.\n  A recent example of the dangers of counterfeiting is the FDA alert \nissue on May 23 of this year regarding counterfeit version of the \ncholesterol lowering agent, Lipitor. This product is taken by over 18 \nmillion Americans. This investigation is currently ongoing and FDA is \nstill trying to determine the extent of this case.\n  In March, the FDA discovered counterfeit versions of the drug Procrit \nwhich had been contaminated with bacteria or in some cases the product \ncontained no active ingredient.\n  There are numerous other examples. It is amazing the number of drugs \nthat are now on the shelves in drugstores in America that are \ncounterfeit and no one knows about it. These are difficulties that we \nnow face. The proposal of this amendment by the Senator from North \nDakota will further relax our capability to find illegal drugs, and to \nfind those drugs that are dangerous\n\n[[Page S8207]]\n\nthat are being brought into this country.\n  It will create a new opportunity for transshipping drugs from all \nover the world into our country which will be a great danger to the \ncitizens of our country.\n  The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the body that \nrepresents the state boards of pharmacy in all 50 United States, as \nwell as eight Canadian Provinces has stated in March of this year\n\n       Of utmost concern is the lack of ability to determine the \n     actual country of origin. An order for what is purported to \n     be a Canadian drug may never be filled by a legitimate \n     Canadian pharmacy with a Canadian drug or even be filled in \n     Canada.\n\n  NABP, representing the boards that regulate the practice of pharmacy, \nhas also recently joined the Canadian National Association of Pharmacy \nRegulatory Authorities in endorsing a statement opposing illegal \nimportation of prescription drugs.\n  The Canadian government itself has stated publicly that drug products \nshipped to Canada for resale in other countries do not fall under the \nCanadian regulatory system, and they can provide no assurance as to the \nsafety or authenticity of such drugs.\n  The conditions contained in my amendment, which would be added to the \nlegislative proposal before the body, are the same as those previously \nadopted twice by this Senate. They were adopted both times by unanimous \nvotes of the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues to again support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was interested in the statement by the \nmajority leader. This, of course, is not the amendment the Senate \npreviously considered. It is not the amendment to which the Senate \npreviously agreed. It is not the provision of law that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has refused to implement in two \nadministrations. It is not that at all.\n  First, we will sort out the facts.\n  Let me make a case for the amendment itself. My colleague just won a \ndebate we weren't having. His debate is about a piece of legislation \nthe Senate passed a couple of years ago. I supported that, and I \nbelieve the Health and Human Services Secretary and the FDA made a \nmistake in not implementing it. Nonetheless, that was all a couple of \nyears ago.\n  Yes, this particular amendment we offered deals with the \nreimportation of prescription drugs, but it deals only with the \nreimportation of prescription drugs from the country of Canada--only \nfrom the country of Canada.\n  The Senate previously addressed this issue of reimportation in 2000 \nby saying reimportation from other countries--as long as it was an FDA-\napproved drug and brought here under conditions of safety--would be \nappropriate. We have already said the HHS and FDA did not implement the \nprevious legislation. But now, we will narrow this legislation very \ndramatically and provide reimportation only from the country of Canada.\n  I will explain why that is important.\n  First, miracle drugs offer no miracles to those who cannot afford \nthem. If we don't do something to make drugs more affordable, seniors \nin the country lose, and others who need prescription drugs and can't \nafford them lose.\n  We should and must put some downward pressure on drug prices.\n  I understand the pharmaceutical manufacturers do not like that. I \nunderstand why they resist it. If I were in their position, I would \ncertainly resist it as well.\n  I don't try to paint with a dark brush all of those who are on the \nother side of the issue. I think the pharmaceutical industry does many \ngood things. They do a lot of very important research, some of which is \noriginal and some of which they take from the National Institutes of \nHealth. They create medicines that are very important for the American \npeople.\n  I also said the other day that some of the pharmaceutical companies \nhave been providing free and discounted drugs to the lowest income \nAmericans. Five and a half million people have benefitted from free \nmedicines from American drug companies. I commend those companies. I \ndon't have the names of all the companies. Good for them. It is a step \nin the right direction. They ought to be commended and saluted for \ntheir program to help the lowest income Americans.\n  But the other issue is the larger one of the price of prescription \ndrugs. The fact is, we need to try to do something that puts some \ndownward pressure on prices. Let me describe, if I might, what the \nproblem is. Let me do it with some bottles of medicine.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be able to show some bottles of medicine \non the Senate floor. These are empty bottles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is Zocor. A very famous football coach advertises \nthis at halftime at football games. He says he takes Zocor. It is quite \na good medicine, I am sure. These are two bottles for Zocor--one from \nthe United States and one from Canada. The same pill is put in the same \nbottle, manufactured in the same place, by the same company. In both \nbottles is an FDA-approved drug. The only difference is, when that \nmedicine is sold in the United States to U.S. consumers, it costs $3.03 \nper tablet. In Canada, the same pill, in the same bottle, made by the \nsame company, cost $1.12 cents per tablet--$3 versus $1. The same pill, \nsame company, different countries. That is Zocor.\n  This is a drug called Lipitor. It has the same purpose as Zocor--to \nreduce cholesterol. You can see that it is sold in the United States \nand in Canada. These are bottles from each country. They are identical \nbottles, made by the same company, again only the cost is different--$1 \nper tablet for the Canadians, and $1.86 for the U.S. consumer. The same \ndrug, same pill, manufactured in the same FDA-approved plant, put in \nthe same bottle, but different prices.\n  This is Vioxx used for arthritis. As you can see, same pill, made by \nthe same company, put in identical bottles. The difference? It costs \n$2.20 if you buy it in the United States. If you are a Canadian \ncustomer, it costs 78 cents for the same tablet--$2.20 versus 78 cents \nfor the same medicine.\n  Let me use one more example, if I might.\n  This is Prevacid: Those who are afflicted with ulcers would take this \ndrug. As you can see, once again, the same bottle, identical shape. The \ndifference? It costs $3.58 for the American consumer, and $1.26 for the \nCanadian consumer--same pill, same bottle, same company, but a \ndifferent price.\n  Let me tell you about being in a little one-room drugstore in \nEmerson, Canada, 5 miles north of the United States. Just 5 miles north \nof the Canadian border, there is a drugstore. I accompanied a group of \nseniors to the one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada, just to make a \npoint.\n  The point was very simple. The medicines those seniors purchased in \nCanada--the identical medicines to what they buy in the United States \nand for which there is no safety concern or issue because the chain of \ncustody is identical in Canada--cost much less.\n  It begs the question. Why not let the market system resolve these \nissues? As long as you have the safety of supply and the closed chain \nof custody which you can be confident in--and you certainly do with \nCanada because their system is very comparable to ours--allow people to \ndecide where they want to purchase their prescription drugs. If they \ndecided they would purchase their prescription drugs where they are \nless expensive, it forces repricing of prescription drugs in this \ncountry.\n  Let me use some charts to show what is happening. How much more does \nthe U.S. consumer pay? More than everyone else in the world by far. If \nwe pay $1 for a pharmaceutical product, that same product is 62 cents \nin Canada. You can see what it is around the globe in different \ncountries--in England, 69 cents, Germany, 65 cents, France, 55 cents, \nand Italy, 52 cents.\n  Let me show a chart with specific medications.\n  I just showed these: U.S. price versus Canadian price for Prevacid, \nZocor, Paxil--all heavily used drugs and costing nearly 40 percent more \nin the United States than in Canada.\n  Now let me quote, if I might, President George W. Bush during the \nthird Presidential debate in St. Louis, MO.\n  During the Presidential debates, President Bush was asked about this. \nHere is what he said:\n\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\n\n       Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made \n     sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas \n     to come back and other countries to come back into the United \n     States. That makes sense.\n\n  What he was saying there is that the reimportation of prescription \ndrugs makes sense. That is what he said in the third Presidential \ndebate.\n  I am not making this up. These are the President's words from the \ndebate--prescription drugs coming back into the country would make \nsense. If I could put words in his mouth, I would believe, of course, \nthat he would say it makes sense, if this is safe.\n  But, nonetheless, this President, in a debate, said reimportation \nmakes sense.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I was obviously on this issue with the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. We were forced into providing an ``out'' for them so we \ncould get the bill to the floor that said the Secretary would have the \nauthority to be able to set the bill aside and prevent this coming in. \nI don't think they would be required to make any rationalization. But, \nobviously, it was something we had to accept at the time in order to \nget the bill voted on. And then what happened?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, the second-degree amendment that was \nattached then dealt with safety and so on. What happened was, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the FDA indicated they \nwould not implement the law, so it was not implemented. But it is \nimportant to point out that this piece of legislation dealt with the \nimportation of prescription drugs from many other countries.\n  We have narrowed this amendment to the country of Canada, to allow \nthe reimportation of drugs only from Canada. And because Canada has an \nidentical chain of custody to this country, there can be no question as \nto the safety of allowing licensed distributors and pharmacists to be \nable to access, from a licensed pharmacy in Canada, FDA-approved \nprescription drugs. So that is why I do not have a problem accepting \nthe second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I cannot think of anybody at HHS or the FDA who can make a credible \ncase that there is a safety issue by allowing a licensed American \npharmacist to access prescription drugs from a licensed pharmacy in \nCanada. There is no safety issue there. It is gone, finished.\n  So we, I hope, will adopt this. I believe there is no justification \nfor HHS or the Food and Drug Administration to fail to implement this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me conclude quickly and quote what \nHealth Canada's Associate Director General said:\n\n       As soon as any drug crosses the border into Canada, it has \n     to meet all the regulations of our laws. . . .\n\n  What they are saying in Canada, with that statement, is that they do \nnot have drugs ricocheting around their country that are counterfeit \ndrugs or non-approved drugs. They have a drug safety system very much \nlike ours, in which drugs that go from an inspected plant into this \nsystem, all the way through to the local licensed pharmacy, so that you \nhave a safety circumstance that everyone understands.\n  Let me continue. It was referenced a bit ago that all of the FDA--or \nvirtually all--of the former FDA Commissioners, oppose this. Let me \ntell you what former FDA Commissioner David Kessler said:\n\n       I believe the importation of these products could be done \n     without causing a greater health risk to American consumers \n     than currently exists.\n\n  That is David Kessler, former FDA Commissioner.\n  Let me continue. William Hubbard, FDA Senior Associate Commissioner, \nSeptember 5, 2001, in a hearing that I chaired before the Senate \nCommerce Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs said:\n\n       I think as a potential patient, were I to be ill and \n     purchase a drug from Canada, I think I would have a \n     relatively high degree of confidence in Canadian drugs. . . .\n\n  Simple and easy to understand, I think.\n  Finally, let me describe the systems in the United States and Canada. \nDrugs must be proven to be safe and effective. We are talking only \nabout FDA-approved drugs. There are good manufacturing practices \nrequired in both countries. There is appropriate labeling required in \nboth countries. There is the inspection of manufacturers, pharmacies, \nand drug wholesalers in both countries. Pharmacists and wholesalers \nmust be licensed in both countries. And there is a chain of \ncustody required between the pharmacist, the wholesaler, and the drug \nmanufacturers in both countries. There is a regulatory requirement for \npostmarketing surveillance required in both countries. And a national \nmechanism for drug recall exists in both countries.\n\n  This is a chart that shows the same thing: The regulation in the \nUnited States and the regulation in Canada, from the production of the \ndrug to the licensing of the pharmacist, are the same. There isn't any \nway, in my judgment, that restricting reimportation to medicines from \nCanada will allow the HHS or FDA folks to say this does not work. Of \ncourse, it works. Of course, it will not compromise the safety of the \nAmerican consumer. The question is, Will we be able to have a \ncircumstance where the American consumer can access lower cost \nprescription drugs?\n  It is not my intention--and it has never been my intention--to force \nU.S. consumers to go outside of this country to access a supply of \nprescription drugs. It is my intention to find ways to put downward \npressure on these prices by injecting competition that will force a re-\npricing of drugs in this country.\n  Now, every year, spending on prescription drugs in this country is \nincreasing 15 percent, 16 percent, 18 percent, every year. Just about \nevery year, there are double-digit increases in the cost of \nprescription drugs. If we do not do something about this, we will hook \na hose up to the Federal tank and suck this tank dry. I guarantee it.\n  Now, let me end as I began. If I were representing the pharmaceutical \nindustry, I would fight like the dickens to price drugs however I \nwished to price them. That is in their interest. It is in their \nstockholders' interest. I understand that. It is in their company's \ninterest. But there is a limit.\n  This increase every year--15, 16, 18 percent--comes from two main \nfactors: one is increased utilization, the other is price inflation. \nThe fact is, if we do not find some way to moderate these price \nincreases, this system of ours isn't going to work.\n  I started by saying that I think the prescription drug industry, the \npharmaceutical manufacturers in this country, provide a significant \nservice to the American people by doing the research and providing \nprescription drugs that are, in many cases, breakthrough drugs. I might \nsay at least a fair amount of that which they do comes from National \nInstitutes of Health research which is financed by the U.S. taxpayer. I \ndo not complain about that. Good for them. And I want those companies \nout there.\n  I want the NIH and the pharmaceutical manufacturers searching for the \ncure for diabetes and for cures for cancer and searching for new \npharmaceutical products that can help the American people. I want that \nto happen. I do not want to shut off research.\n  The argument is made that if somehow the American people do not pay \nthe highest prices in the world, it will shut down research on new \ndrugs. That is not true. The fact is, European drug companies spend \nmore on research on drugs than companies do in the United States. There \nis more research on drugs that occurs in Europe than in the United \nStates, and prices are lower in Europe than in the United States.\n  I just do not think it is right. I do not think it is right for the \nU.S. citizen to pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the \nentire world. I just do not believe that is right.\n\n  Now, I understand all the arguments that are going to be raised by my \ncolleagues who oppose this and I would just ask them, what happened to \nyour faith in the market system? I hear a lot about this market system: \nLet the market system work.\n  As long as you have the safety of the drug supply, and a protected \nchain of custody--and that exists in Canada; no one can come to this \nfloor and say it does not--why not let the market system work?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course. I am happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S8209]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if a drug is shipped from outside of \nCanada to Canada for resale in the United States, does that go through \nthe same handling that the Senator from North Dakota has discussed?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. As I indicated in one of the charts I presented, the \nCanadian official said that any drug that crosses into Canada is \ntreated just the same as the drugs that enter the United States. As you \nknow, there are many drugs that are imported into this country. Just as \nis the case for the importation of drugs into the United States by the \ndrug manufacturers, drugs that are imported into Canada from other \nsources of production are certified as safe by the Canadians--just as \nours are certified by the FDA.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If they are for the purposes of being resold in the \nUnited States, not in Canada, are they also certified by the \nGovernment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. First of all, the only way they can be reimported into \nthe United States would be if a licensed pharmacist or a licensed \ndistributor in the United States purchases them from a licensed \npharmacist or distributor in Canada. So at that point, they have \nentered the stream of prescription drugs in the Canadian system. At \nthat point, the Canadians say: We assure the safety of the chain of \ncustody of those prescription drugs just as you do in the United \nStates.\n  I find this debate interesting because I was up on the border of \nCanada one day. This was before mad cow disease occurred in Canada. My \nheart goes out to the Canadian ranchers for having discovered one \ninstance of mad cow disease. Do you know what we do with Canada with \nrespect to meat. We say: We have reciprocal inspection procedures for \nmeat. You inspect it and that is good enough for us. What we want you \nto do is cut one little strip off the meat and lay it in the back of \nthe truck, and we will open the back of the truck and see if it looks \ndecent and smells all right, and then you just run the truck through. \nWhy? Because we have reciprocal inspections. We say: If it is good \nenough for you, it is good enough for us.\n\n  We have identical chains of custody for prescription drugs in Canada \nand the U.S., but we won't say: If it is good enough for Canada with an \nidentical chain of custody for prescription drugs, it is good enough \nfor us. That doesn't make sense to me.\n  There is only one reason we won't say that. That is because some are \nwilling to support the notion that the U.S. customer, the U.S. citizen, \nshould pay the highest prices for prescription drugs. I happen to think \nthat is wrong. I believe our citizens ought to pay a good price. \nMiracle medicines are not cheap. We ought to pay a good price and a \nfair price. Should we pay the highest price in the world? I don't \nbelieve so.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I compliment him on his \namendment. I see seniors from our State sometimes trying to get up to \nCanada and buy drugs, the same drugs you pointed out, and paying one-\nthird as much as in the United States. The Senator pointed out that one \nof the arguments we often have here for this higher drug price in the \nUnited States is so the drug companies can engage in research. And we \nwant them to do that research. They do a lot of good research, as the \nSenator just stated. They develop new drugs, and sometimes those drugs \ndon't pan out, and they need to cover the expense of bringing new drugs \non the market. We are all for that.\n  But I ask the Senator from North Dakota, is it not a fact that last \nyear the major drug companies in the United States spent more money on \nadvertising to the public than they did on research, that they actually \nspent more money advertising prescription drugs which you and I can't \neven buy unless we get a prescription? Yet we see full-page ads in USA \nToday, three and four-page spreads in Time and Newsweek magazine, full \npages in the New York Times.\n  I ask the Senator, what sense does it make if, in fact, they are \ngoing to charge us high prices for drugs in the United States and they \nare using it just to advertise for drugs we can't even buy unless we \nget a prescription? Isn't it a fact they actually spent more money on \nadvertising than they did on research?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe that is the case. I don't have the numbers in \nfront of me. I believe Senator Stabenow referred to that earlier. My \nunderstanding is that the expenditures on advertising and promotion \nexceed the expenditures on research.\n  Let me make two additional points and then yield the floor. I support \nresearch and development, R, tax credits for industries, including \nfor the pharmaceutical industry. They benefit greatly from them. I have \nalways supported those tax credits. I think it makes sense to provide \ncredits and incentives for the development of new drugs.\n\n  Second, when these drugs are produced and then sold, I don't think we \nought to pay the highest prices in the world.\n  Let me give one more example, if I might. A woman with breast cancer \nneeds Tamoxifen. With a prescription to go buy Tamoxifen, you have one \nof two choices, if you live near the border. You can pay $10 for a \nsupply of Tamoxifen in the United States, or you can go to Canada and \nbuy exactly the same amount of Tamoxifen for $1--$10 or $1. Why should \nyou have to fight breast cancer and fight these pricing policies at the \nsame time? It is not fair. It doesn't make sense that we should pay the \nhighest prices in the world.\n  Again, the majority leader started off by saying we have passed this \nbefore and it doesn't work. Let me correct it again to say: Legislation \nlimited to Canada has not been enacted before. We passed something else \nbefore. You are right, it was not implemented. It was reimportation \nfrom other countries in the world, provided it was an FDA-approved \ndrug. That was not implemented.\n  This will be reimportation from Canada, so the legislation has been \ndramatically narrowed to a country that has an identical chain of \nsupply for which there can be no safety concerns about unsafe drugs. We \nare only talking about having licensed pharmacists and licensed \ndistributors accessing those drugs from licensed pharmacists or \ndistributors in Canada.\n  I am not interested in any way ever compromising the supply of \npharmaceutical drugs in America. I wouldn't offer this in a million \nyears if I felt it did that. I know it doesn't. There isn't any way \nanyone in this Chamber can demonstrate that there is a safety issue \nwith respect to the medicines sold in Canada. You might be able to \ndemonstrate there is a safety issue dealing with Bali or Honduras or \nGuatemala or Zaire, but you can't do it with Canada. You just can't. \nAnd so that is why I have no difficulty accepting the second-degree \namendment offered by my colleague from Mississippi.\n  There is not a safety issue with respect to this narrow amendment. \nThere is only this issue: Shall the American people be able to see a \nrepricing of prescription drugs that results in price fairness with \nrespect to what U.S. and Canadian consumers are charged for identical \ndrugs put in identical bottles produced by the same company?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator really has made an eloquent case for why we \nought to have free trade with Canada in drugs as long as they meet the \nsame requirements. I ask the Senator, do we not in fact have a free \ntrade agreement with Canada?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, we have free trade with Canada. It actually isn't \nfree trade. We could spend a long time talking about wheat and other \nissues. We have a free trade agreement with Canada, but it excludes \nprescription drugs. Why? Because a piece of legislation was passed a \ndecade and a half ago that said the only entity that will be allowed to \nreimport prescription drugs into the United States is the manufacturer \nof that prescription drug. That is what perverts the market. If you \nassume that you have a safe supply of drugs in both countries, why then \nwould consumers simply not decide where to purchase the drug in \nwhatever represents their best interests? Why would they not be able to \nmake their own choice under a free trade agreement? It is perverted by \nthis previous legislation that prohibits the reimportation except by \nthe manufacturer.\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\n  What we are saying now is, we would allow the reimportation by the \nlicensed pharmacies. We are not talking about somebody shuffling around \nin a T-shirt who knows nothing about prescription drugs. We are talking \nabout a licensed pharmacist or a licensed distributor who does this for \na living. We are saying they have the ability to go to Canada and \naccess medicines from a licensed pharmacist or a licensed distributor.\n  I would love to have somebody make a persuasive case that somehow \nthat compromises safety. I don't think the case exists.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, I thank \nthe Senator for yielding again. The Senator continues to make an \nexcellent point here that seems to be lost on the proponents of this \nbill on the other side.\n  I continue hearing how this is a bill that is supposed to promote \ncompetition. It is supposed to promote free enterprise and the \nmarketplace. Yet here, as the Senator from North Dakota has pointed \nout, in one place where the marketplace really could save seniors \nmoney, by opening up the marketplace for these drugs to come in from \nCanada as long as they meet all of our FDA requirements, on this the \nother side says, no, we don't want the marketplace to work in this \ncase.\n  It kind of gives lie to all of the arguments about how this bill is \nto promote competition in the marketplace on drugs for the elderly. \nQuite frankly, it seems to me this bill is to promote higher prices and \nto ensure the elderly really do not get the best deal they could \npossibly get in buying prescription drugs which would mean they would \nnot be able to buy them from Canada, which distorts the marketplace.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his well-reasoned arguments and his \nwell-reasoned amendment. With this amendment, we ought to strike a blow \nfor the marketplace and let the marketplace work by allowing our \nseniors to be able to purchase these drugs under this so-called free \ntrade agreement that we have with Canada.\n  I compliment the Senator from North Dakota for this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say I will not put this entire \nreport in the record, but we asked the Congressional Research Service, \nthe CRS, to do a comparison of U.S. and Canadian requirements for \napproving and distributing prescription drugs. This is by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service. They prepared a memorandum \ncomparing the U.S. and Canadian systems for both approving and \ndistributing prescription drugs. Essentially this report affirms that, \nin all aspects of the U.S. and Canadian drug systems, drug approval, \ndrug manufacturing, drug labeling, drug distribution, the U.S. and the \nCanadian systems are similar in all respects.\n  There just is not a circumstance here where someone can say the U.S. \nsystem is terrific and the Canadian system is not. Both countries have \nchains of custody that I think give people in Canada and the U.S. \nassurance of safety.\n  Perhaps before I give up the floor, I should mention this has been \nsomething Republicans and Democrats have worked on over a period of \ntime. We have debated these issues before, but not this amendment \nbecause this is narrowed to Canada. I would be remiss if I didn't \nmention our late colleague, Paul Wellstone. If he were in the Chamber, \nhe would be sitting in that back seat, and he either would have offered \nthe amendment, perhaps, or be waiting to be among the first to speak. \nHe, like many others of us--particularly in northern States--felt \nstrongly that the reimportation of prescription drugs was a way for \nsenior citizens, yes, but all Americans, to access the same \nprescription drugs at a fairer price.\n  My expectation is that when we finish this debate and have a vote--I \nbelieve we will vote on this tomorrow--this amendment will be further \namended by the second-degree amendment of Senator Cochran, which I \nindicated I would accept. I don't believe there is a need to vote on \nthat. I believe that amendment will be subject to a recorded vote \ntomorrow.\n  I hope my colleagues will do as we have done previously on broader \nlegislation. At least with this narrower bill, let's decide to pass \nthis and see if this can help provide some downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate that. I wanted first to compliment my \nfriend from North Dakota, who has worked so diligently on this issue. I \nam very proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator can only yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was yielding for the purpose of a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I was in the middle of saying I wanted to ask is it not \ntrue that even though the report you just indicated made it clear the \nsafety provisions, the oversight, is the same between Canada and the \nU.S., isn't it true that even in light of that, you have gone the extra \nmile to put into place basically a 1-year provision for reimportation, \nand then at the end of that time the program would stay in effect, \nunless the Secretary submits a certification that in fact there is a \nproblem, that based on experience, based on evidence that the benefits \ndo not outweigh the risks? Isn't that correct that you in fact have \ngone that extra step, that extra mile to make sure even though we know \nit is safe, it is the same, that we give a safety valve so that the \nSecretary in fact could step in and certify if there was a problem?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Stabenow has done a service by \npointing out something in the amendment I did not point out. The other \nchange is that this would be a 1-year pilot program, when approved by \nthe Senate. The certification will still be that this is safe because, \nclearly, we have identical systems in the U.S. and Canada.\n  In addition, after a 1-year pilot project, there will be a 6-month \nperiod in which the Secretary of Health and Human Services will certify \nif there is a problem, if in fact there is one. I expect there will not \nbe. At that point, this program will continue. At least it creates a \nspecific 1-year pilot project and an evaluation, so there is a fail-\nsafe system if there would be any problem at all. I would not expect a \nproblem--particularly because we have narrowed this--with respect to \nCanadian drugs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan \namendment, although as modified by Senator Cochran's amendment, I will \nnot oppose it.\n  Senator Cochran's amendment goes to the whole point here, which is \nthat reimportation of drugs is unsafe. I am not the one saying that. I \nthink most Members here are very concerned about the safety aspects of \nreimportation. We have three Secretaries of Health and Human Services, \n10 former FDA commissioners, the U.S. Customs Service, the White House, \nDEA, CMS, Canadian Pharmacy Regulatory Agency, U.S. Pharmacy Regulatory \nAgencies, and 44 U.S. pharmacist groups, voicing safety concerns about \nthe reimportation of drugs.\n  I am satisfied Senator Cochran's amendment will sufficiently reflect \nthe concern of Members of this body and of these organizations about \nthe issue before us. So I am going to set that aside. I could argue \nuntil the cows come home how this is an unsafe and unwise practice to \nengage in. But with this amendment, we will leave it up to the \nSecretary to determine as to what he believes--and he was here a minute \nago. We have a statement from him already saying he does not believe it \nis safe. I am comfortable leaving it in the hands of someone who will \nstudy this issue in depth with respect to safety.\n  I want to dispel a couple of myths that have been created during this \ndebate. One of the myths is that American pharmaceutical companies \nspend more money on advertising than they do on research. As most \npeople who have followed the pharmaceutical industry and followed this \ndebate know, the pharmaceutical industry is the most research-intensive \nindustry in our country. I have always said I find it remarkable that \nwe are here on the floor of the Senate all the time beating up on the \npharmaceutical companies, saying they make too much money or they spend \ntoo much money on advertising or they don't spend enough money on \nresearch and development, and we need to whack them here and\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\nwhack them there until they become like the steel industry, where they \nbecome--or other industries--less and less profitable, and then we pass \nloan guarantee programs to prop them up. That is sort of the way we do \nthings here. If anybody is doing well, whack, we are going to take a \nshot at them and say they are doing too well for everybody's good.\n  Let me just suggest the pharmaceutical industry is doing well because \nthey are leading the world in curing disease and treating very serious \nhealth problems. They are doing it because of the enormous amount of \nresearch they are doing, not because of the money they are spending on \nadvertising. General Motors spends more money on advertising--some $4 \nbillion every year. That dwarfs almost all of the spending by the \npharmaceutical industry with respect to advertising. Yet I don't hear \nthe Senators from Missouri or Michigan or any others out here \ncomplaining we pay too much for cars. Cars are as much of a necessity \nfor most people as pharmaceuticals. Why don't we hammer General Motors, \nFord, and those other folks for wasting this money on advertising.\n  Companies spend money on advertising because they have an obligation \nto sell their product. The way you sell your product is by promoting \nthe value that product hopes to bring to an individual's life--the \npositive attributes of the product. Pharmaceutical companies have the \nright to do that through advertising to the general public, which may \nnot be informed about new therapies that are available, as well as \nthrough direct advertising to physicians who prescribe the medicine. \nThat is a proper role, I believe, in informing the public. We want them \nto be informed.\n  I cannot imagine we would want a public that would not want to know \nwhat some of the more recent developments and potential improvements to \ntheir lives that are available to them. Some have suggested their \nspending on advertising is more than they are spending on research and \ndevelopment. That is not true. I know that was said in passing. Someone \nsaid: I think this is the case. Let me clarify for the record so we do \nnot have this common misstatement that I think this may be the case. \nLet me tell you what the facts are.\n\n  I have a chart. It is just a piece of paper. I do not have it blown \nup. The black line is the spending on research and development, and the \nlight gray line is the total promotion. Total promotion means, yes, \nadvertising, but it also means the free samples of drugs many receive \nwhen they go to the doctor's office. That goes in promotion. That is \nactually, in a sense, free drugs for the purposes of advertising and \npromoting the product. All that is included in here.\n  You can see that research and development while, yes, advertising is \ngoing up, research and development is going up even further. In 2001, \n$30 billion was spent on research and development and a little over $10 \nbillion on advertising--three to one. I daresay General Motors does not \nspend three to one on research and development versus their \nadvertising. I daresay most companies and most industries do not come \nclose to spending that amount of money. But you know what. They are the \nbad guys. They are the guys we have to hit upside the head. Why? Why do \nwe have to hit them upside the head? Because they are increasing their \nprices too much. It is too costly, and we need these products.\n  Let's look at why they are increasing their prices and why you can go \nto Canada, Germany, or other places, and receive these drugs for less \nmoney. There are a couple of reasons.\n  No. 1, there was an excellent article in the ``Weekly Standard'' just \nthe other day talking about the incredible cost of getting drugs \napproved by the FDA.\n  For a company which starts out with thousands of compounds with which \nthey are experimenting, researching, trying to work themselves through \nthe process to determine what is a viable compound to experiment with \nand to move forward with, they start out with thousands, tens of \nthousands. They narrow it down to a few hundred. They do some more \nintensive research on those. They get to about four or five they do \nsome trials on and some tests on and even further research. They come \ndown to usually one drug where they go through the extensive process of \nclinical trials and testing.\n  By the way, the reason Europe, Canada, and other countries around the \nworld get drugs years before we do, in some cases, is because of the \nincredible costly process the very people who are complaining the drugs \ncost too much have supported, the extensive approval process that jacks \nup the price of those drugs in this country.\n  It costs $1 billion on average for a drug to go from that basic \nresearch of compounds all the way through the process of determining \nwhether it is effective, whether it is safe, what conflicts there are. \nAll the issues they have to deal with, it costs about $1 billion in \nthis country.\n  It does not cost $1 billion in Canada. It does not cost $1 billion in \nEurope. It does not cost $1 billion in Mexico. It costs $1 billion here \nbecause of the extraordinary lengths to which we go to make sure the \ndrugs here are, what? Let's hear that word again. Safe. That those \ndrugs are safe. We put a premium value on, yes, efficacy. They have to \nbe effective. They have to treat what they say they are treating, and \ndo so effectively, but they also have to be safe. So we put a high \nvalue on safety, and we require these companies to go through enormous \nhoops to make sure, in this country, before a drug is sold, we know it \nis safe.\n\n  We are suggesting two points: No. 1, safety is a highly valued \ncommodity when it comes to drug use, and that reimportation is unsafe. \nNo. 2, one of the reasons reimportation is so popular is because the \ncost of the drugs are cheaper. One of the reasons they are cheaper is \nbecause they do not have to go through the safety measures they are put \nthrough in this country.\n  You require them to prove it is safer, and then you say: Gee, why are \nyou charging us more money? Why don't we just get them from this other \ncountry, that, by the way, does not require you to go through those \nhoops. So they do not pass on the costs to these other countries.\n  There is another reason. The other reason is because in Canada, \nMexico, most of the world, they set prices. They set prices. They say: \nYou want to sell drugs in our country? Fine. Pfizer, you want to sell a \ndrug in our country? No problem. Here is what we will pay you.\n  Pfizer says: Wait a minute, we have all these costs. I want to make a \nprofit.\n  Fine, if you want to make a profit, here is what we will pay you.\n  We charge $3 for this drug in the United States. You are only \noffering to pay us $1.\n  Well, we have looked at it and your manufacturing costs are 50 cents; \n$1 is a pretty good price. You will make 50 cents on every pill.\n  Pfizer says: That is our manufacturing cost. We have hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in research costs. We have litigation costs we have \nto be concerned about. We have advertising and other related costs that \nare built into the cost of this drug. You are only giving us the \nmanufacturing cost.\n  If you don't like the deal, you cannot sell your drug. So if you want \nto sell your drug and make your 50 cents, sell your drug. If you don't, \nsee ya.\n  The drug company has to make a decision: Do I agree to sell based on \nthe price the Government wants to give me or am I shut completely out \nof that market?\n  A lot of drug companies say: OK, I am not making the money I could in \nthis country because we do not have those kinds of price caps on our \ndrugs yet, and they say: At least I am making some margin. OK, I will \nagree to sell there. If they say no, they do not have any market share \nat all.\n  That is a best case scenario. A worst case scenario in Canada is: I \nhave a breakthrough drug, and there are no other drugs like it in the \nworld. It is a new class. It is, in fact, one of these great \ndiscoveries that we hope for every day. They go up to Canada and say: \nWe spent over $1 billion researching, coming up with this great \nbreakthrough drug for a cure or for a treatment for this illness.\n  Canada says: Great, we would love to sell that drug. There isn't any \nother drug out there that does this. Yes, you want to charge us $10 a \npill, that is nice; we will pay you $5.\n  The drug company says: Well, that is nice, 10.\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\n  Canada says: No, you didn't hear me, 5.\n  The drug company says: I am just not going to sell the drug.\n  A lot of drug companies will sell it anyway. Why? Because they feel a \nsocial responsibility to have that drug available, as we see with the \nAIDS drugs in Africa that are being sold at well below the costs in any \nother country in the world. They may feel a social responsibility to \nsell it, and, in many cases, they do.\n  Let's assume for some reason this company says: No, I do not feel any \nsocial responsibility here; I am going to play hard ball. What does the \nCanadian Government do? What do they by law have the right to do? They \nhave the right to steal that patent, make the drug in Canada, and sell \nit for whatever price they want.\n  That is a pretty strong bargaining position. It is wonderful to stand \nout here on the floor of the Senate and beat up on these companies for \nselling drugs for less money in Canada, for less money in Mexico, for \nless money in Germany. Why?\n  No. 1, it is a one-sided bargaining situation. You either take the \nprice we give you or you are out of the market. If we want your drug \nanyway, we will steal your patent. Not a lot of bargaining power. Plus, \nby the way, the United States costs so much more because of the FDA \nprocess, not to mention the litigation costs on top of the research and \ndevelopment costs.\n  The litigation costs in this country, because of runaway malpractice \nsuits and liability suits, product liability suits, class action suits, \nthe costs associated with drugs are higher here on top of that.\n  So what do we do? We blame the pharmaceutical company. We blame them \nbecause Canada sets prices. We blame them because we have an extensive \nand very costly FDA process. We blame them because we cannot put our \ntort liability system in place. It is their fault because they want to \nadvertise their product. God forbid that someone knows what my product \nis. This is the bad work that is being done.\n  Now what are we going to do? We are going to say that, yes, well, \nmaybe you are right, Senator, maybe it does cost more to bring a market \nhere. I think everybody would admit that, yes, our litigation system is \nmore costly; yes, Canada sets prices and blackmails them if they do not \ngo along. We agree with all of that, but you know what, it is still not \nfair, because our seniors--and not just seniors but anybody--our people \nin America deserve the same price they get in Canada.\n  Okay. Let's make a decision. Let's make a decision that, in a sense, \nwe are going to set prices in this country, that we are going to adopt \nthe Canadian formula. Now, obviously not every drug is sold in Canada. \nSo there are a lot of drugs that will not be affected by this \nreimportation because Canada does not pay for every drug. There are \ncertain drugs that just are not sold up there. Why? Because the drug \ncompany decided they were not going to play ball and sell at a price \nthat is well below what they believe is a profitable price for them to \nsell. So we are only talking about a certain group of drugs. We \nunderstand that.\n  We saw an amendment earlier today that is going to make sure these \nresearch-oriented drug companies, the ones that are creating the new \ntherapies for the future, now that their patents expire on time, they \nhave no patent extensions, even though some may be worthy or not; we \nare going to tighten down on that so generics can get into the \nbusiness. Generics, by the way, make no breakthrough drugs, do no \nresearch on new therapies to treat diseases that are heretofore \nuntreated or not sufficiently treated, but we are going to squeeze down \nthese drug companies that are making these research investments and \ndoing these kinds of innovative therapies. We adopted that earlier. Now \nwe are going to whack them again and we are going to basically take the \nCanadian prices that were set in Canada and have them apply in the \nUnited States, so there will be free trade.\n  I heard people say free trade, free trade with a country that sets \nprices. Now, I would suspect the Senator from North Dakota would not be \nfor free trade if they set the price of wheat in Canada at 50 percent \nbelow the price of wheat in the United States. I do not think the \nSenator from North Dakota would call that free trade--I could be \nwrong--or if we set the price of timber at half, by law, in Canada, of \nwhat the product was here. I do not think the Senator from Iowa would \nconsider that free trade if they set the price of corn or the price of \nmilk in Canada, by law, at half the price of the product in this \ncountry. I do not think we would be up here extolling the virtues of \nCanadian free trade. I know for a fact the Senator from North Dakota \nwould not because he is on the floor with great frequency extolling the \nevils of free trade in Canada, particularly when it comes to wheat. \nThey do not set the price of wheat in Canada, but he is for free trade \non a product that is artificially priced below the market to come into \nthis country. Interesting economic theory but certainly not consistent \neconomic theory.\n\n  So what happens? We now have this product coming into this country at \nbelow what arguably it could cost to get that product approved and \nresearched, with the liability costs, all the other costs associated. \nNow what would be the result? If it is that pervasive, we may force the \ndrug companies to lower their prices. It could happen. In either event, \nwe are going to take a significant piece of the market share away from \nthe pharmaceutical companies selling drugs in this country.\n  What is the effect of that? Well, the effect of that is obviously \nlower profits for pharmaceutical companies. There are a lot of folks, I \nguess, who do not want people to be profitable, not at the expense of \nour consumers who want to buy pharmaceuticals. In the end, the result \nis this: We have to make a decision as to whether we want an industry \nthat is going to spend 30-plus-billion dollars a year in finding the \nnext cure, in doing the next level of research for that disease someone \nin our family may have or some neighbor may have, or whether we are \nmore concerned with having cheap drugs today.\n  Let's understand, with eyes wide open, what we are balancing. We \nsubsidize the world's research. Admit it. I accept that. People say we \npay more for drugs here than everybody else in the world. All we are \ndoing is subsidizing the drug companies in this country and the rest of \nthe world is riding along on the money we give drug companies by paying \nhigher prices for drugs. They piggyback on us, and that is not fair. \nOkay. You are right. What do you want to do about it?\n  Well, one thing we could do is talk to our trade officers and get \nthem to pound away at these other countries so they do not set \nformularies and artificially low prices. We could do that. Do we tell \nCanada they cannot blackmail our companies by threatening to make the \ndrug and steal the patent? We could do that. Short of that, which is \nnot happening right now and this debate is happening right now, we have \nto make this decision, and the decision is this: Do we want to \neliminate the research and development of new drugs and new therapies \nto solve new problems or problems that exist, diseases that exist, and, \nyes, subsidize the world in the research and development or in exchange \nfor that next generation of drugs coming on line next year, are we \nwilling to trade cheaper drugs today for no cure tomorrow or cheaper \ndrugs today instead of the cure tomorrow, 3, 4, or 5 years from now?\n  That is a legitimate debate. I say to the Senator from North Dakota \nif he wants to enter into that debate--and the Senator from Michigan \nwho is going to speak next, if she wants to enter into that debate--I \nwill accept that debate. I will truly accept the integrity of people \nwho say it is worth it to have cheaper drugs today to get more drugs to \npeople today who need them than to develop the next generation of drugs \ndown the road for people who will need them then. That is a legitimate \nargument to make.\n  I assume many Americans would agree with that argument, particularly \nif they are the people who do not have the money to afford the drugs \nthey need today. There are probably a great number of Americans who \nwould say that is a good tradeoff.\n  I come down on the other side. I do not believe it is a good \ntradeoff. The reason I do not believe it is a good tradeoff is I think \nthere is a better way to solve what seems to be an intractable problem: \neither research, innovation, new disease treatment, or cheaper drugs.\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\n  Interestingly enough, the solution is what we are talking about in \nthis Chamber this week and next week, and that is drug coverage. The \nsolution is, let's provide drug coverage to lower the cost out of \npocket to the consumer, particularly catastrophic drug coverage.\n\n  In my mind, the most important thing we are doing, not some of what I \nconsider very broad coverage that we have in this bill, but most \nimportant is including the catastrophic coverage. If we have a high \ndrug user or the low-income subsidies in this bill for low-income \nindividuals, those are the people I am most concerned about. They are \nthe ones who, I argue, are the most compelling cases for saying we need \ncheaper drugs now as opposed to cures later.\n  If we can solve those compelling cases of the low-income individual \nand the high user of pharmaceuticals, if we can solve those two \nproblems, then we take a lot of pressure off this issue of cures \ntomorrow versus drugs now.\n  This amendment does not belong. It is an anachronism. We get to the \nheart of the problem that this amendment attempts to solve. I believe \nit solves it in the wrong way.\n  I also believe reimportation is unsafe. It is unfair to an industry \nin this country which is much maligned--until, of course, you get that \ndiagnosis. Once you get that diagnosis and you find out within the last \nfew years a little white pill that keeps you alive, that keeps you \nwalking, keeps you breathing, keeps you eating, once you find out there \nis an industry out there that you never had a good word for up until \nthat moment, who you thought were bad people because they were raking \nthese people over the coals with all this money they were making, until \nyou found out because of the research and development that went on, \nyour life will continue and you will be able to see your children grow \nup or you will be able to see and play with your grandchildren, all of \na sudden these companies are not so bad after all.\n  I know this is not a popular view for Members of the Senate to hold. \nI have been told on numerous occasions defending drug companies is not \na term extender for Senators. I understand that. This is not a populist \nissue. I accept it. But I have the gift in my State of having thousands \nof employees who go to work every day with the focus on creating the \nnext little pill, the next little serum that will save somebody's life. \nThey are proud of the work they do. They have a right to make money and \ndo it. They have an absolute right to make money and do it. I will \nstand by their right to do that. It is an industry that not just makes \nmoney, but we are saving people's lives. We are changing people's \nlives. We are giving that grandson the opportunity to know his grandma. \nWe should be willing to pay for it.\n  We should not be blackmailed by other countries that want to use us \nfor their research ground. We have some work to do. In my opinion, we \nhave work to do in the international trade arena to go after these \ncountries that do use us as the funding of their laboratories. But the \nmistake is not to adopt their policies. It is to get them to change \ntheir policies. What this does is adopt a flawed, fatal system for far \ntoo many people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is hard to know where to begin. I \nwould like to talk about some of the facts and realities for folks who \nare struggling to pay for those medications that are being developed or \nbeing advertised on television.\n  I hope we will remember in these debates we are not talking about \nautomobiles or tennis shoes or peanut butter or any other optional \nproduct. We are talking about lifesaving medicine.\n  I celebrate the fact we have lifesaving medicine and that we have \nthose who have dedicated their lives to that research. We have a lot of \nsuch individuals in Michigan. I am very proud of them and the work they \ndo.\n  At the end of the line, if you cannot afford the medicine, it does \nnot matter. So price does matter. Affordability does matter. \nCompetition to bring prices down does matter.\n  I am very pleased a little earlier this evening we voted together in \na bipartisan way to close loopholes the brand-name companies have been \nusing to game the system, to keep competition off the market, and \ngeneric drugs. We passed a very important amendment to this bill. I \ncommend, again, all who have worked very hard on that. The system has \nbeen out of whack. I suggest it is out of whack in a number of other \nways.\n  First, it is absolutely true that the most profitable, successful \nindustry in this country is the pharmaceutical industry. No question \nabout it. It is great they are doing well. Any other business in this \ncountry would love to have their situation. They are, arguably, the \nmost highly subsidized industry by taxpayers in this country. They have \na set of rules that up to this point have been highly in their favor to \nallow them to keep the competition off the market. It is a great deal \nif you can get it.\n  I know we have hundreds if not thousands of folks working here, \nlobbyists, making sure we keep that good deal for them. I appreciate \nthat. Unfortunately, that good deal for them, that great deal for them, \nhas been at the expense of every other business trying to provide \nhealth care for their employees, every other employee trying to keep \ntheir health care and not lose their job because of rising health care \ncosts, every senior, every family in this country. The debate about \npricing is about not only making sure we have a healthy pharmaceutical \nindustry but we have other healthy businesses and consumers who help \npay the tab for that research and can afford to buy the product at the \nend of the line.\n  What do I mean by that? I have said this before. We start with a lot \nof the basic research in this country being paid for by American \ntaxpayers through the National Institutes of Health. I am proud we have \ngreatly increased the amount of money going into basic research. We \nhave done that on a bipartisan basis. It makes a difference. We are \nvery close on many different illnesses from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's \nto diabetes, critical research. We need to be doing more. But that is \ndone by American taxpayers, investing our money. Because we benefit, we \nunderstand how critical this is.\n  That information, that research, is then given to the pharmaceutical \ncompanies who then develop it. We give them a writeoff for their \nresearch, tax deductions, tax credits for new research, all of which I \nsupport, as well as deductions for their advertising, their marketing, \ntheir administration, their other business expenses. Tax deductions, \ntax credits, are subsidies from American taxpayers. So we have a real \nstake in this operation. We are already helping pay for it.\n  Once the drug has been developed, because it is very expensive for \nnew breakthrough drugs, because it is very expensive, we have a policy \nof creating a patent for up to 20 years to limit the competition so \nthat company can, in fact, be covered at cost, because with new \nlifesaving drugs it is very expensive.\n  We have a stake in this. We have a stake in it. We helped pay for it. \nWe helped create rules that are favorable to the companies, so that, in \nfact, they can succeed. The deal, though, I believe, is that at the end \nof that process the American consumer, the American senior should be \nable to afford to buy that product that they helped pay to develop, to \nresearch, to make happen. That should be the deal.\n  That is the point. In too many cases right now that is just not \nhappening. We get to the end of the line, and there are many ways in \nwhich the companies sue currently to keep generics off the market or \nkeep the border closed so we can't buy them from Canada or do a variety \nof other things to make it difficult for the competition to come in and \nto keep the prices low. They make sure Medicare doesn't negotiate on \nbehalf of all the seniors of the country to be able to force a group \ndiscount. There are a wide variety of methods to make sure the rules \nstay the way they are and we are all paying a big price for that, I \nbelieve.\n  We certainly want this industry to be successful. I think it is clear \nby the rules, the subsidies, the support that has been there and will \ncontinue to be there. But this is not a pair of tennis shoes. It is not \nan automobile, as much as coming from Michigan I want everybody to buy \na new automobile every single year, an American-made automobile. But if \nyou don't, you will not\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\nlose your life. But if you don't get your cancer medicine, you might. \nThis is very different.\n  Let me speak to the issue of advertising. Since 1996, the FDA has \ntaken the cap off of direct consumer advertising, as we know, radio and \ntelevision, other direct consumer advertising. We know, we have seen \nadvertising skyrocket. We do not have to debate that. All you have to \ndo is turn on your television set. If not every commercial, it is every \nother commercial--they are very nice commercials--but they are \ncommercials for prescription drugs. We do not have to argue about \nwhether advertising has gone up. Every single person in this country \nknows that advertising has gone up.\n  You do not have to tell a doctor that marketing has gone up. My \ndoctor talks to me about the line of drug reps at the door to come in \nand promote particular medicines.\n  We know from studies that have been done, and FCC filings, that about \n2.5 times more is claimed under the line item for ``advertising, \nmarketing, and administration'' than is claimed under research.\n  What I find very interesting is that I keep hearing that more is \nspent on research than on advertising and marketing. Last year, I \noffered legislation to say OK, if that is true, then let's just cap the \namount you can write off for advertising and marketing to the same \nlevel you can write off for research on your income tax form. It should \nnot matter to anybody because they spend more on research. You would \nhave thought I had proposed the worst thing you could possibly propose. \nIt was adamantly and is still adamantly opposed by industry. It should \nnot matter if they are spending more on research than on advertising \nand marketing.\n  I would like to speak to the business at hand here, the question of \nallowing Americans to buy American-made drugs, subsidized by Americans, \nthe research funded in part by Americans, at the price they are sold in \nevery other part of the world--half the price we pay here.\n  This particular amendment is a very conservative, cautious amendment. \nIt focuses only on Canada. We know, in fact, there is importation \nalready back and forth from Canada. Drugs are already frequently \nimported into this country but predominantly by manufacturers. They are \nalready bringing them back across the border. In fact, according to the \nInternational Trade Commission, $14.7 billion in drugs were imported \ninto the United States in the year 2000, and $2.2 billion in drugs sold \nin Canada were originally made in the United States.\n\n  It is ironic that the drugmakers are saying drugs cannot safely move \nbetween the border between the two countries. What they are saying is \nthey don't want individuals to be able to do it or pharmacists to be \nable to do it or wholesalers to be able to do it, but they do it every \nday.\n  Also, we hear there is a difference in terms of oversight and \ninspections. According to the CRS, our Food and Drug Administration \nalready inspects pharmaceutical production lines in Canada for 341 \nprescription drugs run by about 30 drugmakers. So they are already \ndoing it for the pharmaceutical industry. We pay to send FDA inspectors \nto Canada to inspect already.\n  Another report dated September 2001, a report by our Congressional \nResearch Service--again, the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService--confirms that:\n\n       The U.S. and Canadian systems for drug approvals, \n     manufacturing, labeling and distribution are similarly strong \n     in all respects. Both countries have similar requirements and \n     processes for reviewing and approving pharmaceuticals, \n     including ensuring compliance with good manufacturing \n     practices. Both countries also maintain closed drug \n     distribution systems [which is very important] under which \n     wholesalers and pharmacists are licensed and inspected by \n     Federal and/or local governments. All prescription drugs \n     shipped in Canada must, by law, include the name and address \n     of each company involved along the chain of distribution.\n\n  So that is the reason this amendment is narrowly focused on Canada \nbecause we are talking about a system that is very similar, almost \nexactly the same in terms of the safety and the rigorous oversight. We \nare also talking about a process that is already going on, it is just \ngoing on by the manufacturers and not by licensed pharmacists or by \nindividuals or by wholesalers.\n  I think this amendment is very conservative because the amendment not \nonly has Senator Cochran's provisions in terms of certification, but \nthis is an amendment that would affect 1 year. We are going to affect \nthings for a year, to open the border to Canada. After that 1-year \nperiod, the program would stay in effect unless the Secretary submits a \ncertification to Congress that, based on substantial evidence and the \nexperience of the 1 year, the benefits of reimportation do not outweigh \nthe risks. So there are multiple protections in this amendment, and \nstrict FDA oversight is in this amendment.\n  I think this is particularly important to do in the context of the \nprescription drug legislation that we are working on and that will be \npassed by this body because the bill in front of us to provide a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit does not take effect until 2006. So \nother than a discount card, which is not new to seniors, those who have \nbeen listening to the debate we have been having all week and \nanticipating help right away are going to be sorely disappointed \nbecause there will not be a prescription drug benefit until 2006. In \nthe meantime, we can help not only seniors but families and businesses \nand everyone who is involved in paying for prescription drugs right \naway, immediately. It doesn't cost anything to open the border to \nCanada for prescription drugs for pharmacists and for individuals. We \ncan do it now. If there is an evaluation that there is a problem, it \ncan stop. But we know, based on information about the inspection \nsystems, based on what is already occurring, that it is highly unlikely \nthat there would be a problem.\n  I think it is critically important that we give major help now. We \ncan cut prices in half; in some cases much more. I have had the \nopportunity to go with a number of different seniors to Canada where \nthey have met with a Canadian physician and received a prescription and \ngone to a Canadian pharmacy. We have been shocked at the difference in \nprices for literally the very same drug. It is particularly significant \nin Michigan where we can look right across the river which you can swim \nacross, and go from Detroit to Windsor and see that kind of a price \ndifference. We have many seniors now looking to Canada for \nopportunities to see Canadian doctors because they are so desperate to \nget help.\n\n  Let me mention just a couple of things. Again, we are not talking \nabout some optional product where people are advertising and making \ngood profits. We wish them well. That is the American way. That is the \ncapital system. Good for them. But we are talking about a health care \nsystem where we are not seeing doctors being reimbursed, nor hospitals, \nnor nursing homes, nor home health agencies. The only part of the \nsystem that is exploding in cost and which is driving up the cost of \nthe health care system is in the area of pharmaceutical drugs. This is \nnot optional. It is medical. It should be viewed as part of the health \ncare system. That is what we are debating today.\n  Let me mention Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a very important drug in \nbattling breast cancer. I had an opportunity to visit with Barbara \nMorgan from Michigan when she went to Canada and visited a Canadian \ndoctor and going through the process there where she was able to get \nher monthly Tamoxifen for $15 instead of $136. That is a huge \ndifference for her. She and her husband are retired on average means. \nShe did not expect to get breast cancer after retirement. They had, \nlike many others, been saving up to do things in their retirement. They \nnow find themselves spending money on her treatment and on her \nprescription drugs. These are not theoretical discussions about people. \nThis is not a theoretical debate about allowing Americans to get \nAmerican-made, American-subsidized prescription drugs from Canada. This \nis very real. It can literally make the difference between life and \ndeath for people when they are struggling for critical lifesaving \nmedicines.\n  That is why I feel so strongly about this amendment. That is why I am \nhopeful the Secretary will look at the evidence, will look at the \nnarrow construct of this amendment and be willing to work with us, be \nwilling to allow the borders to be opened for 1 year. We\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\nare asking for 1 year with all of the safety precautions that are in \nthis amendment--just 1 year to allow our seniors and others to be able \nto see a dramatic cut in the prices they have to pay for their \nmedicines; 1 year to try this and to evaluate the issues that have been \nraised by those who are opposed.\n  I appreciate the time. This is, I believe, a very serious part of \nthis debate. If we want to make the difference right now for people, \nright now doesn't involve money in the budget resolution. It doesn't \ninvolve waiting until 2006. If we want to help folks right now, the way \nto do that is to give them the opportunity to get their prescription \ndrugs at the lowest possible price. That is what this amendment will \ndo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't see any more speakers who wish to \nspeak on the second-degree amendment. Am I correct in suggesting that \nthe regular order is now to vote on the second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree amendment is the pending \nquestion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think we are ready to vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 947\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 947) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Finance Committee has laid before \nthe Senate a bipartisan bill that will finally provide every senior \naccess to affordable prescription drugs. Passing this long-awaited \nlegislation is one of the best things we can do right away to help \nsolve the health care crisis in this country.\n  I applaud the efforts of the committee and specifically commend the \nleadership of the chairman and ranking member, Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus, in developing this critical legislation.\n  The bill reported out of the Finance Committee, S. 1, is the \nculmination of years of hard work in the Senate to bridge the gap \nbetween the Medicare of 1965 and the Medicare for today and the future.\n  Currently, seniors are paying too much for their needed prescription \ndrugs out-of-pocket. The cost of these life-saving drugs is \nincreasingly becoming a large burden for seniors, with some even \ntraveling to Canada to find cheaper drugs. Seniors should not have to \ngo to a foreign country to receive the drugs that their doctors \nprescribe. We need to provide an environment where America's seniors \ndon't have to go to Canada.\n  The bill reported out of the Finance Committee accomplishes that.\n  This bill not only provides every senior access to affordable \nprescription drugs, but it will also provide seniors access to benefits \nthat a modern health plan should have, such as preventive care and \ndisease management--options that Medicare does not currently provide. \nMoreover, these additional benefits are provided by giving seniors a \nchoice and control over their prescription drug plans and health care \nproviders.\n  These changes will only improve and strengthen Medicare. As my \ncolleagues know, when Medicare was enacted in 1965, Congress made a \ncommitment to our Nation's seniors and disabled to provide for their \nhealth security. Unfortunately, that security is on shaky ground \nbecause Medicare has not kept up with the evolving nature of health \ncare.\n  The delivery of health care has vaulted ahead so dramatically 38 \nyears after the inception of Medicare, that this system which was once \nsufficient is now antiquated and ineffective.\n  For example, conditions that used to require surgery or in-patient \ncare can now be treated on an out-patient basis with prescription \ndrugs. But more than the progress that has evolved from the utilization \nof prescription drugs, medicine has too evolved to the extent that \npreventive care can now eliminate the need for extensive reliance on \nthe health care system. It is time for Medicare to reflect the \nrealities of today's health care delivery system.\n  My colleagues from the Finance Committee have found a solution that \nis a good compromise and is a result that can be agreed to by both \nDemocrats and Republicans. Is this bill a panacea for seniors' health? \nNo. But it is a quantum leap forward from a system that has been stuck \nin a time when the Ed Sullivan Show and the Dick Van Dyke Show were \nseen as original programming in America's living rooms.\n  While the Senate has finally begun its debate on Medicare I would be \nremiss if I did not take a step back and point out the roadmap that has \nlead us to this point.\n  The President deserves great credit in providing in his budget \nsubstantial funding to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. The \namount the President allocated, $400 billion, illustrates his \ncommitment to our nation's seniors. Time and again, the President has \ncalled for strengthening and improving Medicare.\n  Additionally, this year we are operating under a budget resolution. \nLast year, the Senate operated without one because we never voted on \nthe fiscal year 2003 budget resolution--the first time the Senate has \nnot done so since 1974.\n  The Senate got the job done this year. Through the leadership of \nChairman Nickles of the Budget Committee, the Senate laid out a \nblueprint for future spending that has brought us to where we are \ntoday.\n  The Senate is standing at the brink of providing seniors access to \naffordable prescription drugs. This is long overdue, and we cannot \ndelay any further.\n  Over the past year, I have traveled throughout Ohio holding health \ncare roundtables to hear what the citizens in my State are saying. \nThese roundtables have included seniors that inevitably tell me it is \npast time that Congress added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.\n  I believe this is the year Congress will deliver on its longstanding \npromises.\n  I am ready to go to my constituents in Ohio and say we were finally \nable to move past partisanship and provide real security for their \nhealth.\n  While it is vital that we pass a prescription drug benefit this year, \nit is also vital that we pass one that is fiscally responsible. \nIdeally, seniors would receive the assistance they need to have access \nto every medicine prescribed by their doctor. Unfortunately, we live in \nthe real world and are subject to limited resources.\n  I would like to take a few moments to shed some light on our \nGovernment's current fiscal condition. As recently as fiscal year 2000, \nthe Federal Government had a combined surplus of more than $100 \nbillion. Every penny of payroll tax was retained in the Social Security \ntrust fund and the General fund was generating enough revenue to fully \nfund its contribution to Medicare and still pay down the National Debt.\n  As my colleagues know, this rosy budgetary picture is long gone.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office's latest monthly budget \nestimate, May 2003, the unified deficit for fiscal year 2003 will \nexceed $400 billion even after borrowing every penny of this year's \nSocial Security trust fund surplus.\n  With this in mind, it is imperative that we act not only to provide \nMedicare benefits for today's beneficiaries, but also for the baby \nboomers that will arrive in 2011.\n  The Finance Committee bill strikes a balance between providing \nseniors and the disabled access to needed prescription drugs today and \ndoing so in a fiscally sensible way that would allow benefits to extend \nto future generations.\n  Senator Grassley and the Finance Committee have put before the Senate \na bill that will cost $400 billion as scored by CGO.\n  The natural question that I think the American people would like to \nknow is what does $400 billion buy? In my opinion, $400 billion \nprovides a real prescription drug benefit that is affordable to both \nthe beneficiaries and the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\n  First of all, seniors would get assistance immediately through the \nprescription drug card. And our neediest seniors would receive an \nadditional $600 on top of the discounts Medicare will provide through \nthis card.\n  When the prescription drug program begins in 2006, under the Finance \nCommittee bill, premiums would average $35 a month.\n  After a $275 deductible, the government would cover half of all \nprescription drug costs up to $4,500.\n  Now, critics of this approach will claim that the so-called \n``doughnut hole'' after $4,500 will be the financial ruin of every \nsenior. The truth is that the vast majority of seniors--80 percent--\nwould never even hit the hole.\n  As a matter of fact, for 2003, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates \nthat the average Medicare beneficiary will consume approximately $2,300 \nin pharmaceuticals. And should seniors consume over $5,800 in \nprescription drugs, the Federal Government would pick up 90 percent of \ndrug costs.\n  While this benefit will greatly help seniors throughout the Nation, \nthere are still some seniors for whom the $35 per month premium and \nadditional cost-sharing is too high. For those individuals, the \nbipartisan Finance Committee bill provides protections that will allow \naccess to prescription drugs.\n  For those seniors under 135 percent of poverty, $12,123 for an \nindividual and $16,362 or a couple, the Finance Committee bill would \nprovide a full subsidy for monthly premiums. In addition, the \ngovernment would cover 95 percent of their prescription drug costs to \nthe initial benefit limit and 97.5 percent above the stop-loss limit.\n  And for those seniors between 135 and 160 percent of the poverty \nlevel, S. 1 would provide assistance with their monthly premiums on a \nsliding scale. In addition, these individuals would pay no more than 50 \npercent of their drug costs once the $250 deductible has been reached.\n  When we talk about dollars being spent, we should also point out to \nseniors that they will receive more bang for their buck under the \nFinance Committee bill through Medicare Advantage.\n  Under Medicare Advantage, seniors will not just receive direct \nassistance from the government to cover their prescription drug bills. \nRather, private health plans will have to compete for beneficiaries and \nwill attempt to attract seniors by providing the best health care \nplan--including prescription drugs and possibly preventive care, \ndisease management, vision and dental services.\n  To the advantage of both Medicare beneficiaries and the Federal \nGovernment, this competition will decrease the price of prescription \ndrugs and permit all parties to stretch their dollars further.\n  This body has been playing this political posturing game with \nsenior's health care for too long.\n  I am tired of explaining partisanship as the excuse for the Senate's \nfailure to pass a prescription drug benefit, which has forced the least \nof our brothers and sisters to choose between food and prescription \ndrugs.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will have the opportunity to show the \nAmerican people, especially our nation's seniors and disabled that we \nare serious about enacting legislation to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit this year.\n  The bill before us seems to have broad support from both sides of the \naisle. The President is ready and willing to sign a bill into law this \nyear. It is time to get the job done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8216-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, this week there was a great celebration of National \nHistory Day. There were high school students from all over the country \nin our offices and at the University of Maryland.\n  Last Friday, when I was sitting where the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota now sits, presiding over the Senate, I had the privilege of \nhearing Senator Byrd deliver an address about Flag Day.\n  Since 9/11, President Bush has spoken more regularly about the \nAmerican character. Suddenly, in our country there is a lot of interest \nin what it means to be an American.\n  In the mid-1990s, I read a book by Samuel Huntington, a professor at \nHarvard, called ``Clash of Civilizations.'' A lot of people read that \nbook in terms of understanding in what conflicts the United States, the \nWest, might find in future years. But I read it for a different reason. \nIt made me think that if the new world order was to be a group of \ncivilizations whose differences began with their cultures, their \nreligions, and a variety of other things that made them unique--it made \nme think if we were moving into that kind of an era, then maybe we \nought to have a better understanding of just what made our culture \nunique. What did it mean to be an American?\n  I was invited to hold a professorship at Harvard University and \ntaught in the John F. Kennedy School of Government there. And the \ncourse I taught was on the American character and on American \nGovernment. In that course, the graduate students applied the great \nprinciples which unite us as a country to the great controversies which \nwe in the Senate debate--about race-based scholarships, about military \ntribunals, about faith-based institutions--and the conflicts of those \nprinciples. The students were fascinated by that.\n  And then suddenly I found myself, last year, in a Senate race that I \ndid\n\n[[Page S8217]]\n\nnot expect to be in. And like most candidates for the Senate, as the \nChair well knows, I spoke about a number of different things. Sometimes \nI spoke about our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Sometimes \nI spoke about taxes, about judges, about education.\n  But, Mr. President, there was one sentence I could say during that \ncampaign to any audience, anywhere in my State of Tennessee, that \nbrought the greatest response. I could barely get it out of my mouth \nbefore there would be some response from the audience--of heads nodding \nor some kind of applause--and it was this sentence: It is time to put \nthe teaching of American history and civics back in its rightful place \nin our schools so our children can grow up learning what it means to be \nan American.\n  That is why today I stand before you to support S. 504, the American \nHistory and Civics Education Act of 2003, which we will be voting on in \nthe morning as the first order of business.\n  It will help put the teaching of American history and civics back in \nits rightful place in our schools. It will set up summer residential \nacademies for students and teachers: 2-week academies for teachers--\nsay, at a university--and 4-week academies for students of American \nhistory and civics. And it would join the variety of efforts that the \nPresident and this Congress on both sides of the aisle have been acting \nupon with increasing frequency to underscore American history.\n  It is modeled after the Governor's Schools which exist in the State \nof Tennessee and many other States across this country. And it is \npremised on the idea that if 200 teachers go to the University of \nTennessee or a university in Nevada or a university in California, and \nspend 2 weeks with outstanding leaders, talking about the great \nprinciples and the great stories and the key events of our history, \nthat they will be inspired to do an even better job of teaching that \nduring the next year to their students.\n  I introduced this bill and support it on behalf of 36 Senators, \nincluding the Democratic whip, who is the chief cosponsor, and has been \nfrom the very first day of its introduction, which I, as a new Senator, \ngreatly appreciate. It also includes Republican and Democratic leaders \nwhom I will mention in just a moment: The majority leader; Senator \nGregg, the chairman of the relevant committee; Senator Burns, the \nchairman of the relevant Appropriations subcommittee; Senator Kennedy, \nthe ranking member of our committee; and Senator Byrd, who has been a \npioneer in supporting this kind of legislation.\n  Mr. President, we need this bill, and we need additional attention to \nAmerican history because, first, when our values are under attack, we \nneed to understand clearly what those values are. And, second, we \nshould understand what unites us as Americans.\n  Our diversity and variety in this country is an enormous strength. It \nis a tremendous strength. We are a nation of immigrants with people \nfrom everywhere, but our greater strength--our greatest \naccomplishment--is we have been able to take all of that variety and \ndiversity and turn it into one country--``e pluribus unum.''\n  We need to understand what those values are. And we need to put into \ncontext the terror of the time. I have heard a great many people on \ntelevision say these are the most dangerous times our country has ever \nfaced. Well, only if you have never had 1 minute of American history \nwould you believe that. We need for our young people to know that there \nhave been struggles from the very beginning.\n  But our young people do not know the story of this country as well as \nthey should. Too many of our children do not know what makes America \nexceptional. National exams show that three-quarters of our fourth, \neighth, and twelfth graders are not proficient in civics knowledge, and \none-third do not even have basic knowledge, making them civics \nilliterates.\n  Until the 1960s, civics education, which teaches the duties of \ncitizenship, was a regular part of almost every high school's \ncurriculum.\n  But today's college graduates probably have less civic knowledge than \nhigh school graduates of 50 years ago. Reforms have resulted in the \nwidespread elimination of required classes and curricula in civics \neducation. Today, more than half the States have no requirements for \nstudents to take a course even for one semester in American government.\n  That is not the way it has always been. From the beginning of our \nNation, we have generally understood what it means to be an American, \nand that has been a preoccupation of Americans: Think of our Founders, \nwriting those letters, holding those debates, making sure we knew what \nit meant to be an American; Thomas Jefferson in his retirement years in \nMonticello taking his guests through his home and pointing to portraits \non the wall of the leaders from whom he had gotten many of his ideas so \nthey would understand what he had in mind when he helped create this \ncountry.\n  When we had a huge wave of immigration more than a century ago, just \nas we do today, our national response was to teach new Americans what \nit means to be an American. Because you don't become an American by \nyour color or by your ethnicity or by being born here. You become one \nbecause you believe a few things. If you move to Japan, you don't \nbecome Japanese. If you move to France, you don't become French. If you \nmove to America and want to be a citizen, you must become an American. \nThat is the way our country works.\n  We created the common school, today's public schools, to teach \nreading, writing, and arithmetic to immigrant children as well as what \nit means to be an American, with the hope that they might go home and \nteach their parents. That was what Albert Shanker, former president of \nthe American Federation of Teachers, said about the creation of common \nschools.\n  Then of course in World War II, President Roosevelt made sure that \nevery GI who stormed the beaches at Normandy understood what the four \nfreedoms are. We have not always been complete in our understanding of \nwhat it means to be an American. Sometimes we have gone to excess. We \ndidn't teach the stories of African Americans well. We undervalued the \ncontribution of the Spanish to our culture. And in the 1950s, we were \nembarrassed, as we look back, by McCarthyism. But that is no excuse for \nwhat is going on today: dropping civics, squeezing American history out \nof the curricula, and when it is in, it is watered down. Too often the \ntextbooks are so dull, nobody would want to study them. All the talk is \nabout victims and never about the heroes. The schools have become \npolitically correct. The teachers are reluctant to teach the great \ncontroversies. But what is American history if it is not the story of \ngreat controversies and great conflicts of principles and great \ndisappointments with not reaching our great dreams and great stories \nand great heroic efforts?\n  Our students need to know that Kunta Kinte came to this country in \nthe belly of a slave ship and that his seventh generation grandson, \nAlex Haley, wrote the story of Roots about the struggle for equality \nand freedom. They need to know that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and \nthat he wrote the Declaration of Independence, as it is taught at the \nBen Hooks Center at the University of Memphis.\n  We are a work in progress. We have never been perfect. They need to \nknow about the Pilgrims who were Christians, and they need to know \nabout the Presbyterians, my ancestors, the Scotch Irish who fought a \nRevolutionary War because they were tired of paying taxes to support \nthe bishop of a church to which they didn't belong. They need to know \nabout the religious character of our country and about the importance \nof the separation of church and state. They need to know about our love \nof liberty and about the incarceration of Japanese Americans in World \nWar II.\n\n  The response to putting the teaching of American history and civics \nback in its rightful place in our schools has been overwhelming. Not \njust the Democratic whip, Mr. Reid, has sponsored this, but 36 Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle, leaders of both sides. And in the House \nof Representatives, Roger Wicker of Mississippi is the lead sponsor of \nthe same bill. He called tonight and said they have 160 sponsors in the \nHouse, Democratic and Republican leaders.\n  I offer my special thanks to a few Senators in addition to Mr. Wicker \nfor\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\nhis leadership. To Senator Frist, the majority leader, for scheduling \nthe bill in the midst of a lot of other important business and for \ncosponsoring it. To Senator Gregg, chairman of our committee, for \nmoving it through. Especially to Senator Reid, for his understanding of \nAmerican history, his leadership, his being here tonight, and his \nserving as the principal cosponsor of the legislation. To Senator \nKennedy, who has gone out of his way not just to support the bill but \nto attract other cosponsors. He has had a long interest in this \nsubject. To Senator Burns, on the Appropriations Committee, for his \nstrong support. And to Senator Byrd, who took the time to come to the \nhearing and to testify. Senator Byrd is, of course, the author of the \nByrd grants which are already being used in many of our schools.\n  The kind of American history we are talking about is the traditional \nkind, the study of the key persons, the key events, the key ideas, and \nthe key documents that shape the institutions and democratic heritage \nof the United States of America. We spell out in our legislation that \nby key documents, we mean the Constitution and its amendments, and the \nDeclaration of Independence, for example. By key events, we mean the \nencounter of Native Americans with European settlers and the Civil War \nand the civil rights movement and the wars. By key ideas, we mean the \nprinciples that we almost all agree on in this body: Liberty, equal \nopportunity, individualism, laissez-faire, the rule of law, federalism, \ne pluribus unum, the free exercise of religion, the separation of \nchurch and state, a belief in progress. We agree on those principles.\n  Our politics is about applying those principles. That is what our \npolitics is about. The key persons, the heroes, the men and women of \nthis country from its founding until today, the scientists, inventors, \npioneers, the advocates of equal rights, and artists who have made this \nUnited States of America.\n  There are a great many efforts heading in the same direction. This is \nonly one part. The President's efforts, the Library of Congress' \nefforts, the Byrd grants, the James Madison study, the National \nEndowment for Humanities which would award these to residential \nacademies, to educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations. \nAll are working hard in this way. We are adding to that.\n  In conclusion, I will mention two things. I was in a Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing the other day. We were talking about what \nwe might expect with the reconstruction of Iraq. One witness said that \nwe would be fortunate in our nation building there if the three grand \ndivisions of Iraq, the Kurds, the Sunnis, and the Shiites, the \ngeographical areas, could agree on two things: One would be how to \nsplit up the oil money, and two would be on a federation that would \nbasically keep them safe and independent in their own areas. And maybe \nwe would have some semblance of democracy so they could choose their \nleaders.\n\n  I was thinking about how much we take for granted, how much more we \nare able to look forward to. There is no chance in Iraq of e pluribus \nunum, not for the foreseeable future. There is no general agreement on \nthose principles I just read.\n  We have a marvelous country and a great story. We should be teaching \nit.\n  The last thing I would like to say is the first thing I mentioned: We \nneed to put the terror in which we find ourselves today in context. \nThose who say this is the most dangerous time in our history have had \nno American history. What about the Pilgrims who died in the first \nwinter? What about the soldiers at Valley Forge who walked across the \nice with their bare feet? What about the Native Americans and the \nEuropean settlers killing each other's children? That was terror. What \nabout the African Americans who came in the slave ships? What about the \nbrothers who killed each other in the Civil War? What about the \nmillions who stood in line in the Depression? What about in the 1950s \nand 1960s, when we all stood within 30 minutes of a nuclear missile \nfrom the Soviet Union?\n  We have had greater terrors face the United States. This is a time of \nstruggle. It is a time when we should stop and think about what it \nmeans to be an American so that we can teach our children and so that \nwe can continue our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can remember when I served in the House of \nRepresentatives on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. Kissinger came \nbefore the committee. The chairman of the committee, Mr. Solarz from \nNew York, said: I don't know how to refer to you. Dr. Kissinger, is it \nMr. Ambassador? Is it Mr. Secretary? Kissinger didn't hesitate a \nsecond, and he said: Your Excellency would be fine.\n\n  I am reminded of this when I think of Governor Alexander, Secretary \nAlexander, and Senator Alexander--a man with a great resume who is now \na Senator. The background certainly is one where this legislation came, \nas a matter of fact, from somebody who served our country as the \nGovernor of a very important State, who served as Secretary of \nEducation, and now as a Senator. When this distinguished Senator came \nforward with this legislation, I knew right away that it was good, \nbased on his experience and background. I felt inclined to move on this \nlegislation to be a prime cosponsor of it. I am happy to do that.\n  It is important to the point where we are now. Tomorrow we will pass \nthis bill, and it will become law. I think we have such momentum here \nthat this isn't something we are going to just issue a press release on \nas having authorized this legislation. We have support so that we are \ngoing to appropriate the money. As the Senator from Tennessee has \nannounced, Senator Robert Byrd, the ranking member and long-time \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, supports this legislation. We \nare going to move forward and not only authorize but appropriate money \nfor this most important program.\n  The bill itself, if you look at it--and then read this bill, we have \na Medicare bill here that is some 700 pages long--is just a few pages \nlong, seven or eight pages. It may not seem like much, but for me it is \nvery important. For the American people, it will be very important \nbecause this little bill will allow as many as 7,200 teachers every \nsummer, every year, to be updated on what they should be teaching their \nyoung folks. The 7,200 teachers each were under this legislation--the \nChairman of the National Commission on Humanity has the ability to \nselect 12 different academies, 1 for teaching history and civics \ncongressionally, the other with a Presidential background. Each of \nthese academies will be chosen, 12 in each category, and they could \nhave up to 300 teachers to participate. That is 7,200. It adds up \nquickly. In 10 years, that is 72,000. I think that is remarkable.\n  It is important because teachers have so many burdens. They have \npaperwork, and now with Leave No Child Behind, they are so immersed in \nteaching children how to pass tests that they don't have a lot of time \nto teach sort of outside the box. This allows them to do that, to be \nreinvigorated and take a look at what is happening around the world, \nwhat has happened that they have missed.\n  So this little bill that is going to become law very quickly--because \nthe House already has over a hundred cosponsors--is important \nlegislation. I commend and applaud my distinguished friend, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, for his work in this area. I hope this is the first of \nmany pieces of legislation the Senator introduces, based on his \nexperience and background as Secretary of Education for this wonderful \ncountry.\n  As my friend has indicated, the education of America's children has \nto be one of our priorities. It is one of our priorities. We have to \nmake sure that children are our future. In order for them to be our \nfuture, we need to give the people who are teaching them the tools they \nneed to teach them to be good leaders.\n  Teachers and administrators have many important responsibilities to \nachieve that end, including providing students with the basis to pursue \nhigher education, helping them develop their individual potential, and \npreparing them for successful careers.\n  As has been indicated in the introductory remarks by my friend from \nTennessee, America is a nation of immigrants. Our schools have helped \ninstill in our diverse population a sense of what it means to be \nAmerican, and\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\nwe have prepared our youth for the responsibilities of citizenship. But \nwe can do better. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  We need to reaffirm the importance of learning American history and \nmaintaining the civic understanding, recognizing that diversity and \ntolerance are at the core of that understanding.\n  Many individual districts and schools within those districts, such as \nthose in the State of Nevada, have recognized the importance of civics \neducation and have designed curricular programs to highlight students' \nknowledge of civics and history.\n  One young man who has the unusual name of Trey Delap, a fine young \nman from Boulder City, which is right near Hoover Dam--where growth has \nslowed slightly, unlike the surrounding area--describes himself as an \naverage high school kid from a small town. Boulder City is not too \nsmall, but the school isn't really big. He dreamed of doing other \nthings all of his life, but certainly never, ever thought about \nanything dealing with government, until he participated in a program \ncalled We The People. It is a program offered through the Center for \nCivic Education that allows students to study civics and then share \ntheir knowledge through competitions such as the one held in \nWashington. They have State competition and, if they do well there, \nthey can come to Washington.\n  His first assignment as part of this We The People program began with \nthe question: What is the role of a citizen in a democracy? He pondered \nthis question, and he discovered that his true passion was government.\n  Defining the role of a citizen led him to question his own \nresponsibility as a citizen and the importance of understanding what \nour Constitution stands for. This is a high school kid.\n  In this program, Trey was able to celebrate his 18th birthday in our \nNation's Capital, while he voiced his opinion about the role of being a \ncitizen in front of lawyers, judges, and congressional staff during a \ncongressional debate. We The People is a great program, but only a few \nare allowed to participate in it.\n  What we are talking about tonight with this legislation is that \nschools all over America would have similar programs, in effect, \nbecause we would have teachers who are having a shot of adrenaline, \nupdating the education they received going through their educational \nprograms in college. This bill would establish a network of teachers \nsharing ideas about history and civics programs.\n  S. 504 would accomplish these goals that I have talked about by \ncreating grants for teachers, and the students would come and \nparticipate in the program. With teachers in so many areas not sharing \ninformation among themselves, they teach information not consistent \nwith prescribed curriculum. So we should have networks like the one \nproposed here for all students.\n  Another reason, frankly, that I jumped aboard this program was that \nSenator Paul Simon and I--we served as Lieutenant Governors together, \nserved in the House of Representatives together, and we served here \ntogether--had the idea that what we needed to work on was to do \nsomething about science and math. We lose so many science and math \nteachers because they cannot make enough money teaching in high school. \nIt has to be for the love of teaching that they stay, because math and \nscience is so acceptable by outside industry. That is the only reason \nthey stay in teaching--they love it.\n  Senator Simon and I had the idea of creating summer workshop programs \nso that math and science teachers during the summer, or with year-round \nschool systems, whenever there was a break, had summer workshops to \nattend to update their skills but be paid for doing so. This would also \ngive them some extra money.\n  Math and science teachers make the same as somebody who teaches PE. \nPE is important, and we have good teachers teaching physical education. \nBut realistically, we need more math and science teachers than we do \nphysical education teachers.\n  Well, Senator Simon and I worked hard, but we could never get the \nprogram funded.\n  This program, while it is not like the program Senator Simon and I \nsponsored, it is as I feel about this Medicare bill. This Medicare bill \nis not something I love, but it is, as we heard so many times, the \nproverbial camel with his nose under the tent. We can make this \nMedicare bill better.\n  With this program I am confident we are going to pass and fund, maybe \nwe can go back to what Senator Simon and I wanted to do: to do \nsomething to enrich math and science teachers' lives, not only enrich \nthem academically but also monetarily. I hope that is something my \nfriend from Tennessee will take a look at and work with me.\n  As we work to make sure all schoolchildren--and especially I am \nconcerned about those in Nevada--are connected to the Internet--and we \nhave programs doing that--and are connected to the future, I also want \nthem to be connected to America's past and to know the common values of \nhistories binding together all who live in this great Nation.\n  We learn from history. I love history. I love to study history, and I \nwant young people also to have a love of history. That can come about \nwith one good teacher. One good teacher can change a young person's \nlife, just like Trey's life in Boulder City. His life was changed by \nhaving someone telling him that Government is important. Government is \nimportant, history is important, this legislation is important, and I \nhope we have a resounding vote, which I am confident we will, tomorrow \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nleadership and for his comments. I look forward to working with him on \nmath and science and other education issues. I especially appreciate \nhis commenting on the teachers.\n  He noted perhaps 72,000 teachers. Even though this is just a pilot \nprogram for a few years, if for 10 years 72,000 teachers of American \nhistory and civics went to summer residential academies, called \nPresidential Academies of American History and Civics, they should be \ninspired to be even better teachers.\n  One of the things I most enjoyed doing as Governor was creating the \nGovernor's School for Teachers of Writing which was run by Richard \nMarius of Harvard. Every summer 200 teachers would gather at the \nUniversity of Tennessee. He would lead them. He taught Harvard freshmen \nin their writing program.\n  What happened was, if you put the teachers together, they taught one \nanother. They became inspired. They developed better lesson plans, and \nthey went back to their classrooms fired up and much better teachers.\n  I have great confidence in our teachers. I believe if we afford an \nopportunity for them to come together in many places across the \ncountry, and for 2 weeks focus on how to teach the great stories of \nAmerican history, that by itself will help put it in its rightful \nplace. When we add to that 4-week schools that students of American \nhistory and civics will attend, it will double our punch.\n  I appreciate that sponsorship. I look forward to the Presidential \nAcademies for Teachers of American History and Civics and the \nCongressional Academies for Students of American History and Civics.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, on June 19, 1945, Burmese democracy \nleader Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon, Burma, to Ma Khin Kyi and \nAung San.\n  Some speculate that she was destined to be a defender of freedom in \nBurma, as her father was the commander of the Burma Independence Army. \nTragedy struck the family exactly 1 month after Suu Kyi's second \nbirthday when General Aung San was assassinated. The family's loss was \nmourned by the entire nation.\n  As Burma's military leaders were to find out decades later, Suu Kyi \nhas freedom and justice coursing through her veins. She has been a \ntireless advocate for the rights and welfare of the Burmese people and \nhas sacrificed--along with other Burmese democrats--much in struggle \nfor democracy in Burma.\n  Suu Kyi is a symbol of courage and determination for the world's \noppressed. She is a shining example that principles are stronger than \nrepression. Suu Kyi and other democrats have yet to surrender to the \nState Peace and Development Council, SPDC, despite relentless attempts \nby the junta to bend and break their will.\n  How is Suu Kyi celebrating her 58th birthday? Most likely, she is \nnot. I suspect she is alone and in Insein prison.\n  In the wake of a violent ambush by the junta on her convoy on May 30, \nSuu Kyi was arrested by the SPDC. Although U.N. Special Envoy Razali \nbriefly saw her 2 weeks ago--and conveyed to an anxious world that she \nwas not physically injured in the attack--we haven't seen or heard from \nher since.\n  The International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, requested a \nmeeting with Suu Kyi, but the thugs in Rangoon refused. Unbelievable, \noutrageous--but not surprising considering the regime's track record.\n  It should not be lost on anyone that the denial of an ICRC visit \nmeans Suu Kyi is being treated worse than a prisoner of war.\n  The best gift the free world can give Suu Kyi on her birthday is a \nfull court press on the junta. Sanctions, import bans, and statements \ncondemning the SPDC's outrageous actions will help buoy the spirits of \nthe Burmese people and confirm that the international community is on \ntheir side.\n  The best gift the administration can give Suu Kyi is an import ban \nand the downgrading of diplomatic relations with the SPDC. The White \nHouse should not wait for the House to act on its legislation but \nshould implement a ban on imports immediately.\n  Finally, the best gift I can give Suu Kyi is a commitment to continue \nto stand with her and the people of Burma for as long as it takes for \nfreedom's triumph. She and her compatriots continue to be in my \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8220-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8220-S8221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JANINE JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we make many different kinds of speeches on \nthe Senate floor. Some of those speeches seek to advance legislation \nand amendments and some aim to commemorate historic events. None are as \nsad as those we make in the memory of a member of the Senate family who \nhas left us. On May 29, 2003, Janine Johnson, Assistant Counsel in the \nSenate's Office of Legislative Counsel, passed away. Janine was 37 \nyears old.\n  Many of us and our staffs knew Janine personally. Some of us only \nknew her only by her initials that appeared on the legislation and \namendments we introduce here on the floor. She served the Senate for \nnearly 13 years, doing much of her work for the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, the Agriculture Committee and the Energy \nCommittee.\n  Over the years, Janine prepared thousands of bills for me and for the \nother members of the Environment Committee. Her expertise in those \nmatters made my job easier and the jobs of the staff easier on \ncountless bills. Janine was an expert drafter on matters of critical \nconcern to the committee. She drafted several generations of Water \nResources Development Acts. She drafted our last transportation bill, \nthe mammoth Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, and was in \nthe process of drafting a new transportation bill when she fell ill. \nShe drafted many parts of the last Farm bill, including the nutrition \ntitle of that bill. I mention that because I am told that no one has \nfound a single drafting error in the hundreds of pages of that title.\n  That is very rare, but I am told by her colleagues that Janine's way \nwas the way of a perfectionist.\n  And to her about Janine's history is to hear that it was a way of \nlife. Janine was a native of Winchester, MA. She graduated first in her \nclass from Winchester High School and ultimately graduated with high \nhonors from Harvard Law School in 1986. She went on to clerk for the \nHonorable Cecil Poole on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. Following her clerkship, she came to the Senate Office of \nLegislative Counsel. In addition to serving as Assistant Counsel, she \nwas active in shaping the office itself. She interviewed new attorneys \nfor the office, and she had an unparalleled ability to recognize those \nwho would maintain the high standards of the Senate. That legacy will \nlive on in the colleagues and friends she helped to bring into the \nSenate family.\n  According to Janine's friends here in the Senate, she loved life \noutside the Senate as much as her work within it. Janine loved theater, \nmusic and swing dancing. I am told that she loved living here in \nWashington, DC, where one of her favorite times of year was the spring \nbecause of her love of our cherry trees and the Cherry Blossom \nFestival.\n  The cherry blossom Janine admired is the most beautiful flower in \nJapanese culture. It symbolizes the Japanese values of simplicity, \npurity and fleeting beauty. Many poets have described the pink and \nwhite blossoms as a metaphor for life, beautiful and simple, yet at the \nsame time sadly ephemeral and fleeting.\n  Janine's friends in the Senate would say that she was like the \nflowers she loved to see, but that her memory will not be ephemeral to \nthe Senate, to her work here, or to the many friends and family she \nleaves behind.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to pay \ntribute to a very talented, kind and generous member of our Senate \nfamily, Janine Johnson. Sadly, at the far too young age of 37, Janine \npassed away. For the past 13 years, Janine served as Assistant Counsel \nin the Senate's Office of Legislative Counsel. Some of us were \nprivileged to work with her directly and benefit from her skill and \nkeen intellect.\n  While many of us over the years have recognized the well-deserved \ncontributions of our staff in our personal offices or on committees, we \nall know that we depend highly on the exceptional professional judgment \nand tireless efforts of the staff in the Senate Legislative Counsel's \noffice. While Janine did not work for an individual Senator or \nCommittee, it is without question that Janine was devoted to the \ninstitution of the Senate, skilled in the intricacies of the law, and \nserved the Senate with distinction.\n  Janine was the primary Legislative Counsel for many issues under the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. It was \nduring my tenure as Chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee that my \nstaff and I were privileged to work with Janine. She was our counsel \nfor the development of the National Highway System Act of 1995, and \nlater on the landmark Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, \ncommonly referred to as TEA-21. Also, during my chairmanship, Janine \nguided us on the development of several Water Resource Development \nActs, that were enacted on a biennial cycle.\n  It was during those long days and weeks in working in committee, on \nthe Senate floor and later in conference on TEA-21 that we witnessed \nthe exceptional skill, thoroughness and professionalism that Janine \nbrought to every issue. The surface transportation bill expired in the \nfall of 1997. The Congress passed a 6-month extension bill and we came \nback in early 1998 to renew our efforts on a full 6-year \nreauthorization bill. Janine was there with the committee every step of \nthe way.\n  The staff recollections of Janine's contributions to the development \nof TEA-21 are unmistakable. I hear of her deep commitment to the law, \nto turning vague concepts into statute, and faithfully executing the \nviews of the committee and Senator's agreements on complex policy \nissues. Most importantly, I hear staff use heartfelt words\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nto describe Janine's grace, her delicate nature, her respect for her \ncolleagues, her genuine kindness, and her commitment to the work at \nhand. I'm told that on many occasions when staff completed work for the \nnight, usually past midnight, and left sections for Janine to draft \nthat often her work was on their desks by 9:00 the next morning. She \nwas always willing to stay long past when the Metro closed, as long as \nshe had a ride home.\n  We, in the committee, relied heavily on Janine's legal abilities, her \nlegislative drafting precision and we were fortunate to have her as a \nstar on our team--although for far too short a time.\n  Janine's academic achievements are superior, graduating with high \nhonors from Harvard Law School in 1986 and then clerking for the \nHonorable Cecil Poole on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. With her exceptional qualifications, I'm confident that she \nwould have been successful in any career path she chose. Fortunately, \nfor us, she came to the Senate and for 13 years we have all been more \nsuccessful because of her.\n  The poet Albert Pike has said:\n\n       What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we \n     have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.\n\n  Janine has certainly touched many of us in lasting ways. The Senate \nis grateful for her service and we share our condolences with her \nfriends and family.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as Senators, we are accustomed to the \nglare of the public spotlight and there are even some members of \nCongress who crave such attention. In general though, we are here \nbecause we share a deep desire to serve our country and to help ensure \nthat our government and its laws are true to the spirit of America.\n  We sometimes forget that we are also part of a Senate community \nfilled with people who believe in that same kind of public service. \nThough they do not share the spotlight with us, we could not do our \njobs without them and the nation would suffer.\n  So, I want to recognize the contributions made by all staff, and in \nparticular the experts in the Office of Senate Legislative Counsel that \nhelp keep us true to the law, its structure and its functioning. They \nhelp put our ideas into real form and maintain the integrity of the \ncode.\n  That is why it is very very difficult today to note the passing of \nJanine Johnson, Assistant Counsel in Office of Legislative Counsel. She \nwas an integral and crucial part of that office.\n  Her professionalism, her deft grasp of complicated statutes, her work \nethic, and above all, her pleasant manner and bearing, will be sorely \nmissed by that office, but also by me, my office and in particular, my \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee staff.\n  Many of my staff have worked with Janine for a decade or more and \nhave been uniformly impressed by her unparalleled skill and commitment \nto her job.\n  Janine had a knack for taking even the most complicated concepts and \nproposals and breaking them down into manageable parts. Then, she found \nways to integrate them into existing statutes. To many staff, she was a \nlegislative magician.\n  One did not need to know Janine for very long to see that she shone \nwith a pure and intense inner light that made the way clearer and \neasier for others. But, the memory of her kindness and delicate humor \nwill live on and inspire those who follow her.\n  Janine was a talented woman and a lawyer's lawyer. She had a green \nthumb and many days brought one of her prized amaryllis plants in to \nbrighten the front office. She also spoke many languages, including \nbeginning Russian which I believe she started in Middlebury, VT.\n  The Senate has suffered a great loss with the passing of Janine \nLouise Johnson. I wish her family and friends all the best in coping \nwith the pain. However, I want to note that her significant \ncontributions to the Senate and to the nation will not be forgotten and \nthat she should serve as a model for us all.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I join my \ncolleagues to mourn the premature passing of a dedicated member of the \nSenate staff.\n  Ms. Janine Johnson was an Assistant Counsel in the Office of the \nLegislative Counsel. She was a 1986 graduate of Harvard College and a \n1989 graduate of Harvard Law School.\n  Her responsibilities included drafting legislation in areas that are \nwithin the Agriculture Committee's jurisdiction. Her thoughtful work \nand dedicated service to members of the Senate are reflected in \nlegislation such as the 1996 and 2002 farm bills and the 1998 child \nnutrition reauthorization.\n  The work of the Office of the Legislative Counsel often goes \nunnoticed and under appreciated, but it is talented attorneys like Ms. \nJanine Johnson who provide such a valuable service to the Senate. I \nextend my sympathies to Ms. Johnson's family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8221-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mrs. DOLE.

At the time the vote took place, I was \nspeaking to the Flue Cured Tobacco Stabilization Corporation, a group \nof more than 500 North Carolina tobacco farmers, in Raleigh, NC. My \nattendance at the event was important in order to listen to the major \nconcerns of our State's tobacco farmers, as well as to address one of \nNorth Carolina's top priorities, a tobacco quota buyout, which is \ncritical to the livelihood of all tobacco farmers and the economic \nsecurity of our State.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted for Mr. Pate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8221-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8221-S8222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, 2 months ago when President Bush declared \nan end to combat operations in Iraq, I rose to pay tribute to the seven \nservice members with Indiana roots who sacrificed their lives in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. I observed that while these seven fine young \nmen were engaged in a noble and worthy cause--making the world safer \nfor all freedom-loving peoples--their deaths again showed us that \nfreedom never comes without a heavy price in human lives.\n  At the time I delivered those remarks, I and all Americans understood \nthat there would still be dangerous times ahead for our service \nmembers, but we sincerely hoped there would be no more reports of \nAmerican service members killed in combat operations.\n  Today, I am sad to report, our troops in Iraq are still very much at \nrisk of injury or the ultimate sacrifice as they work to restore order \nand a civil society in this troubled country. It seems that almost \nevery day we receive news of soldiers being ambushed or attacked in \nhit-and-run type incidents. More than 40 American troops have fallen \nsince May 1st. We are still suffering combat casualties, and it is \nobvious that reconstruction of Iraq is going to be a lengthy and \ndifficult process.\n  During these past 2 months, three of those who fell were brave young \nmen with Indiana roots. Three more Indiana families have been \ndevastated by the loss of a loved one. Today, I would like to pay \ntribute to these three fine young men.\n  Marine Lance Corporal Matthew R. Smith of Anderson, IN, was killed on \nMay 10 in Kuwait when the Humvee he was riding in struck a trailer in a \nmilitary convoy. Matthew, a Marine Corps Reservist, was 20 years old \nand a sophomore at Indiana University. He went overseas with his unit \nin February and had traveled all the way to Baghdad while providing \nsupport to Marine combat forces.\n  On the day Matthew died, his father, David Smith, received the first \nletter from his son since he went overseas. Matthew wrote that he was \nproud to be in Iraq as a marine fighting for his country's freedom.\n  Matthew Smith will be missed.\n  Army Private Jesse Halling of Indianapolis was killed on June 10 in \nthe city of Tikrit when his military police squad became engaged in a \nfirefight after being ambushed. Jesse was in the turret of a Humvee \nfiring a machine gun at their attackers when a rocket-propelled grenade \nstruck the vehicle. His commander has recommended him for a Silver Star \nMedal for bravery under fire.\n  Jesse was 19 years old and had enlisted in the Army right after his \ngraduation from Ben Davis High School, where he had participated in \nJunior\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\nROTC. His friends remember him as a fun-loving teenager with a passion \nfor motorcycles. His fellow soldiers will remember him as a hero whose \nquick actions may well have saved the lives of others.\n  Jesse Halling will be missed.\n  Army Private Shawn Pahnke of Shelbyville was killed on June 16 in \nBaghdad, felled by a sniper round fired in the dead of night at the \nHumvee he was riding in. Shawn was 25 years old. He had joined the Army \nto become a crew member on an M-1 Abrams tank and was serving with the \n1st Armored Division in Germany before deploying to Iraq.\n  Shawn leaves behind a wife, Elisha, and a 3-month-old son, Dean \nPatrick, whom he never had a chance to see. Shawn was in Germany when \nthe baby was born, but the staff at Major Hospital in Shelbyville \nhooked up a phone connection to the delivery room so that Shawn could \nhear his child's first cries.\n  Shawn Pahnke will be missed.\n  All of Indiana mourns for the loss of these brave young men. Our \nhearts go out to these families.\n\n\n     Honoring Company A, 8th Tank Battalion, Marine Forces Reserve\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, on behalf of the State of Indiana, I wish to \nrecognize Maj. William P. Peeples of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves and \nhis fellow marines of Company A, 8th Tank Battalion, on the successful \ncompletion of their mission while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nMajor Peeples is from Indianapolis, IN, and it is with sincere pride \nthat I congratulate him on a successful tour of duty leading his \ndivision through its service in Iraq.\n  The unit was among the first involved in fighting when Operation \nIraqi Freedom began this March. Some members from the 3rd Platoon also \nassisted special forces with the rescue and recovery of PFC Jessica \nLynch and other remembers of her unit.\n  We are indebted for the many contributions and tremendous sacrifices, \npast and present, that the men and women of the Marine Corps have made \nin service to our great Nation. The strength, courage, and character \nthey exemplify can only inspire the admiration and appreciation of all \nAmericans.\n  Through their rapid mobilization and superior performance in the line \nof duty, the marines of Company A, 8th Tank Battalion, serve as shining \nexamples of the Corps' motto ``First to Fight.'' I know I speak for all \nHoosiers when I thank the returning members, and welcome them back \nhome.\n\n\n                    Honoring Private Shawn D. Pahnke\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nShelbyville, IN. Private Shawn D. Pahnke, twenty-five years old, was \nkilled in Baghdad on June 17, 2003 when he was shot in the back by an \nIraqi sniper. Shawn joined the Army with his entire life before him, \nwith a young wife and a newborn son at home. He chose to risk \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Shawn was the eighth Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, I join Shawn's family, his \nfriends, and the entire Shelbyville community in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over his death, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is this courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Shawn, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Shawn Pahnke wrote to his family only weeks before his death, telling \nthem that he was proud to serve in the Army and to follow in the \nfootsteps of his father, a Vietnam War veteran, and his grandfather, a \nWorld War II veteran. Shawn grew up in Manhattan, IL and graduated form \nLincoln Way High School in New Lenox, IL. He then joined the Army and \nserved as part of the 1st Armored Division's 1st Brigade. Shawn leaves \nbehind a wife, Elisha and their three-month-old son, Dean Patrick, who \nwas born after Shawn was sent to Friedberg Army Base in Germany. He \nalso leaves behind his parents, Tom and Linda Pahnke and two older \nbrothers.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Shawn Pahnke's \nsacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed \nthe families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot \ndedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave \nmen, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far \nabove our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor \nlong remember what we say her, but it can never forget what they did \nhere.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years \nago, as I am certain that the impact of Shawn Pahnke's actions will \nlive on far longer than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shawn D. Pahnke in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Shawn's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may Gold \nbless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8222-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8222-S8224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is said that editorialists can \neditorialize but can't take criticism. Not true. Chairman Donald Graham \nand editorial page editor Fred Hiatt readily accepted the following \nWashington Post editorial this morning for which I profoundly thank \nthem. Otherwise, since I referred to Pete Peterson, in fairness let me \nalso include his column in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent the articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 8, 2003]\n\n                        Deficits and Dysfunction\n\n                         (By Peter G. Peterson)\n\n       I have belonged to the Republican Party all my life. As a \n     Republican, I have served as a cabinet member (once), a \n     presidential commission member (three times), an all-purpose \n     political ombudsman (many times) and a relentless crusader \n     whom some would call a crank (throughout). Among the bedrock \n     principles that the Republican Party has stood for since its \n     origins in the 1850's is the principle of fiscal \n     stewardship--the idea that government should invest in \n     posterity and safeguard future generations from unsustainable \n     liabilities. It is a priority that has always attracted me to \n     the party. At various times in our history (especially after \n     wars), Republican leaders have honored this principle by \n     advocating and legislating painful budgetary retrenchment, \n     including both spending cuts and tax hikes.\n       Over the last quarter century, however, the Grand Old Party \n     has abandoned these original convictions. Without every \n     renouncing stewardship itself--indeed, while talking \n     incessantly about legacies, endowments, family values and \n     leaving ``no child behind''--the G.P.O leadership has by \n     degrees come to embrace the very different notion that \n     deficit spending is a sort of fiscal wonder drug. Like taking \n     aspirin, you should do it regularly just to stay healthy and \n     do lots of it whenever you're feeling out of sorts.\n       With the arrival of Ronald Reagan in the White House, this \n     idea was first introduced as part of an extraordinary \n     ``supply-side revolution'' in fiscal policy, needed (so the \n     thinking ran) as a one-time fix for an economy gripped by \n     stagflation. To those who worried about more debt, they said, \n     Relax, it won't happen--we'll ``grow out of it.'' Over the \n     course of the 1980's, under the influence of this revolution, \n     what grew most was federal debt, from 26 to 42 percent of \n     G.D.P. During the next decade, Republican leaders became less \n     conditional in their advocacy. Since 2001, the fiscal \n     strategizing of the party has ascended to a new level of \n     fiscal irresponsibility. For the first time ever, a \n     Republican leadership in complete control of our national \n     government is advocating a huge and virtually endless policy \n     of debt creation.\n       The numbers are simply breathtaking. When President George \n     W. Bush entered office, the 10-year budget balance was \n     officially projected to be surplus of $5.6 trillion--a vast \n     boon to future generations that Republican leaders ``firmly \n     promised'' would be committed to their benefit by, for \n     example, prefinancing the future cost of Social Security. \n     Those promises were quickly forgotten. A large tax cut and \n     continued spending growth, combined with a recession, the \n     shock of 9/11 and the bursting of the stock-market bubble, \n     pulled that surplus down to a mere $1 trillion by the end of \n     2002. Unfazed by this turnaround, the Bush administration \n     proposed a second tax-cut package in 2003 in the face of huge \n     new fiscal demands, including a war in Iraq and an urgent \n     ``homeland\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\n     security'' agenda. By midyear, prudent forecasters pegged the \n     10-year fiscal projection at a deficit of well over $4 \n     trillion.\n       So there you have it: in just two years there was a $10 \n     trillion swing in the deficit outlook. Coming into power, the \n     Republican leaders faced a choice between tax cuts and \n     providing genuine financing for the future of Social \n     Security. (What a landmark reform this would have been!) They \n     chose tax cuts. After 9/11, they faced a choice between tax \n     cuts and getting serious about the extensive measures needed \n     to protect this nation against further terrorist attacks. \n     They chose tax cuts. After war broke out in the Mideast, they \n     faced a choice between tax cuts and galvanizing the nation \n     behind a policy of future-oriented burden sharing. Again and \n     again, they chose tax cuts.\n       The recent $10 trillion deficit swing is the largest in \n     American history other than during years of total war. With \n     total war, of course, you have the excuse that you expect the \n     emergency to be over soon, and thus you'll be able to pay \n     back the new debt during subsequent years of peace and \n     prosperity. Yet few believe that the major drivers of today's \n     deficit projections, not even the war on terror, are \n     similarly short-term. Indeed, the biggest single driver of \n     the projections, the growing cost of senior entitlements, are \n     certain to become much worse just beyond the 10-year horizon \n     when the huge baby-boom generation starts retiring in \n     earnest. By the time the boomer age wave peaks, workers will \n     have to pay the equivalent of 25 to 33 percent of their \n     payroll in Social Security and Medicare before they retire \n     just to keep those programs solvent.\n       Two facts left unmentioned in the deficit numbers cited \n     above will help put the cost of the boomer retirement into \n     focus. First, the deficit projections would be much larger if \n     we took away the ``trust-fund surplus'' we are supposed to be \n     dedicating to the future of Social Security and Medicare; and \n     second, the size of this trust fund, even if we were really \n     accumulating it--which we are not--dwarfed by the $25 \n     trillion in total unfinanced liabilities still hanging over \n     both programs.\n       A longer time horizon does not justify near-term deficits. \n     If anything, the longer-terms demographics are an argument \n     for sizable near-term surpluses. As Milton Friedman put it, \n     if you cut taxes without cutting spending, you aren't really \n     reducing the tax burden at all. In fact, you're just pushing \n     it off yourself and onto your kids.\n       You might suppose that a reasoned debate over this deficit-\n     happy policy would at least be admissible within the \n     ``discussion tent'' of the Republican Party. Apparently, it \n     is not. I've seen Republicans get blackballed for \n     merely observing that national investment is limited by \n     national savings; that large deficits typically reduce \n     national savings; or that higher deficits eventually trigger \n     higher interest rates. I've seen others get pilloried for \n     picking on the wrong constituency--for suggesting, say, that \n     a tax loophole for a corporation or wealthy retiree is no \n     better, ethically or economically, than a dubious welfare \n     program.\n       For some ``supply side'' Republicans, the pursuit of lower \n     taxes has evolved into a religion, indeed a tax-cut theology \n     that simply discards any objective evidence that violates the \n     tenets of the faith.\n       So long as taxes are cut, even dissimulation is allowable. \n     A new Republican fad is to propose that tax cuts be \n     officially ``sunsetted'' in 2 or 5 or 10 years in order to \n     minimize the projected revenue loss--and then to go out and \n     sell supporters that, of course, the sunset is not to be \n     taken seriously and that rescinding such tax cuts is \n     politically unlikely. Among themselves, in other words, the \n     loudly whispered message is that a setting sun always rises.\n       What's remarkable is how so many elected Republicans go \n     along with the charade. The same Republican senators who \n     overwhelmingly approved (without a single nay vote) the \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act to crack down on shady corporate \n     accounting of investments worth millions of dollars see \n     little wrong with turning around and making utterly \n     fraudulent pronouncements about tax cuts that will cost \n     billions, or indeed, even trillions of dollars.\n       For some Republicans, all this tax-cutting talk is a mere \n     tactic. I know several brilliant and partisan Republicans who \n     admit to me, in private, that much of what they say about \n     taxes is of course not really true. But, they say it's the \n     only way to reduce government spending: chop revenue and \n     trust that the Democrats, like Solomon, will agree to cut \n     spending rather than punish our children by smothering them \n     with debt.\n       This clever apologia would be more believable if \n     Republicans--in all matters other than cutting the aggregate \n     tax burden--were to speak loudly and act decisively in favor \n     of deficit reductions. But it's hard to find the small-\n     government argument persuasive when, on the spending front, \n     the Republican leaders do nothing to reform entitlements, \n     allow debt-service costs to rise along with the debt and urge \n     greater spending on defense--and when these three functions \n     make up over four-fifths of all federal outlays.\n       The starve-government-at-the-source strategy is not only \n     hypocritical, it is likely to fail--with great injury to the \n     young--once the other party decides to raise the ante rather \n     than play the sucker and do the right thing. When the \n     Democratic presidential contender Dick Gephardt proposed in \n     April a vast new national health insurance plan, he justified \n     its cost, which critics put at more than $2 trillion over 10 \n     years, by suggesting that we ``pay'' for it by rescinding \n     most of the administrative tax legislation. Oddly, it never \n     occurred to these Republican strategists that two can play \n     the spend-the-deficit game.\n       Not surprisingly, many Democrats have thrown a spotlight on \n     the Republicans' irresponsible obsession with tax cutting in \n     order to improve their party's image with voters, even to the \n     extent of billing themselves as born-again champions of \n     fiscal responsibility. Though I welcome any newcomers to the \n     cause of genuine fiscal stewardship.\n       I doubt that the Democratic Party as a whole is any less \n     dysfunctional than the Republican Party. It's just \n     dysfunctional in a different way.\n       Yes, the Republican Party line often boils down to cutting \n     taxes and damning the torpedoes. And yes, by whipping up one-\n     sided popular support for lower taxes, the Republicans pre-\n     empt responsible discussion of tax fairness and force many \n     Democrats to echo weakly, ``Me, too.'' But it's equally true \n     that the Democratic Party line often boils down to boosting \n     outlays and damning the torpedoes. Likewise, Democrats \n     regularly short-circuit any prudent examination of the single \n     biggest spending issue, the future of senior entitlements, \n     by castigating all reformers as heartless Scrooges.\n       I have often and at great length criticized the free-lunch \n     games of many Republican reform plans for Social Security--\n     like personal accounts that will be ``funded'' by deficit-\n     financed contributions. But at least they pretend to have \n     reform plans. Democrats have nothing. Or as Bob Kerrey puts \n     it quite nicely, most of his fellow Democrats propose the \n     ``do-nothing plan,'' a blank sheet of paper that essentially \n     says it is O.K. to cut benefits by 26 percent across the \n     board when the money runs out. Assuming that Democrats would \n     feel genuine compassion for the lower-income retirees, widows \n     and disabled parents who would be most affected by such a \n     cut, I have suggested to them that maybe we ought to \n     introduce an ``affluence test'' that reduces benefits for fat \n     cats like me.\n       To my amazement, Democrats angrily respond with irrelevant \n     cliches like ``programs for the poor are poor programs'' or \n     ``Social Security is a social contract that cannot be \n     broken.'' Apparently, it doesn't matter that the program is \n     already unsustainable. They cling to the mast and are ready \n     to go down with the ship. To most Democratic leaders, federal \n     entitlements are their theology.\n       What exactly gave rise to this bipartisan flight from \n     integrity and responsibility--and when? My own theory, for \n     what it's worth, is that it got started during the ``Me \n     Decade,'' the 1970's, when a socially fragmenting America \n     began to gravitate around a myriad of interest groups, each \n     more fixated on pursuing and financing, through massive \n     political campaign contributions, its own agenda than on \n     safeguarding the common good of the nation. Political \n     parties, rather than helping to transcend these fissures and \n     bind the country together, instead began to cater to them and \n     ultimately sold themselves out.\n       I'm not sure what it will take to make our two-party system \n     healthy again. I hope that in the search for a durable \n     majority, Republicans will sooner or later realize that it \n     won't happen without coming to terms with deficits and debts, \n     and Democrats will likewise realize it won't happen for them \n     without coming to terms with entitlements.\n       Whether any of this happens sooner or later, of course, \n     ultimately depends upon the voters. Perhaps we will soon \n     witness the emergence of a new and very different crop of \n     young voters who are freshly engaged in mainstream politics \n     and will start holding candidates to a more rigorous and \n     objective standard of integrity. That would be good news \n     indeed for the future of our parties.\n       In any case, I fervently hope that America does not have to \n     drift into real trouble, either at home or abroad, before our \n     leaders get scared straight and stop playing chicken with one \n     another. That's a risky course, full of possible disasters. \n     It's not a solution that a great nation like ours ought to be \n     counting on.\n                                  ____\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 2003]\n\n                       Delusional on the Deficit\n\n                        (By Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       Nobody is paying any attention to the budget deficit. Last \n     month the House Budget Committee's Democrats forecast a \n     deficit of nearly $500 billion, and The Post reported the \n     story on Page A4. Last week the Congressional Budget Office \n     reported that the deficit would balloon to a record $400 \n     billion-plus, and The Post again buried the story on A4. \n     Spending trust funds, such as Social Security, is what keeps \n     the estimate at $400 billion. The actual deficit will be \n     approximately $600 billion.\n       That's a win for Mitch Daniels. The goal of the departed \n     Office of Management and Budget director was to keep any news \n     that could hurt President Bush's reelection prospects off the \n     front page, and The Post willingly aided and abetted him. In \n     fact, when Daniels left two weeks ago to run for governor of \n     Indiana, he told The Post that the government is ``fiscally \n     in fine shape.'' Good grief! During his 29-month tenure, he \n     turned a so-called $5.6 trillion, 10-year budget surplus into \n     a $4 trillion deficit--a mere $10 trillion downswing in just \n     two years. If this is\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\n     good fiscal policy, thank heavens Daniels is gone.\n       Congress is no better than the press. Republicans, totally \n     in control of this town, just casually raised the limit on \n     the national debt by a record trillion dollars so the \n     president could borrow more money to pay for tax cuts. I say \n     casually because the seriousness of this move was passed over \n     and hardly debated. In The Post, this story wasn't even \n     worthy of A4. It was relegated to A8.\n       Bush and Daniels used to talk about how they would repay \n     the nation's debt more quickly than any administration in \n     history. Before Sept. 11, 2001, the president bragged that \n     his budget reserved $1 trillion for unforeseen circumstances. \n     Perish the thought that the war on terrorism, Afghanistan and \n     Iraq cost $1 trillion. Those factors had an impact, but the \n     real culprit, according to the nonpartisan Concord Coalition, \n     is that this president has cut $3.12 trillion in revenue \n     since taking office. These are the largest tax cuts in \n     history, yet the administration claims they have no \n     relationship to the record deficits reported on Page A4. \n     Amazingly, he asks for more.\n       The London-based Financial Times, in a front-page lead \n     story, recently reported the Treasury Department projection \n     that at the present rate, fixing the deficit would require \n     ``the equivalent of an immediate and permanent 66 percent \n     across-the-board income tax increase.'' The White House deep-\n     sixed the Treasury study. The Post ignored it.\n       Former commerce secretary Peter Peterson, a lifelong \n     Republican, says that every time this administration faces a \n     choice, it chooses tax cuts. Between fiscal responsibility \n     and tax cuts, it picks tax cuts. Between preserving Social \n     Security and tax cuts, it picks tax cuts. Between providing \n     necessary funds to fight the war on terrorism and tax cuts, \n     it picks tax cuts. ``Again and again,'' Peterson says, ``they \n     choose tax cuts.''\n       The question: How huge must the deficit grow for this A4 \n     story to make the front page, and for the public to scream \n     for relief? Across the country teachers are being laid off, \n     there are more kids per classroom, the school year is \n     shorter, and tuition is up at state colleges. Bus service is \n     being cut off, volunteers are running park systems, prisoners \n     are being released, and subsidies for the working poor are \n     being slashed.\n       How much more must we dismantle before the public cannot \n     stomach this? Will it take a shutdown of all the national \n     parks? Or the release of all federal prisoners because we \n     can't afford to guard them? Or will workers need to pay half \n     their salaries to keep Social Security and Medicare from the \n     chopping block?\n       I dread to think how bad it has to get before Bush makes \n     some changes. But the Republican leadership in Congress is in \n     lockstep. They've just passed a budget calling for a $600 \n     billion deficit each year, every year, for the next 10 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8224-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise to tell my colleagues about \nan extraordinary volunteer program that is dramatically impacting the \nlives of underprivileged, underachieving students in Denver, CO.\n  It is called Whiz Kids and, frankly this program is a classic example \nof what happens when men and women of faith, who love kids, decide to \nmake things happen.\n  Each week, over 700 volunteers tutor elementary students in the \nDenver, Aurora, and Jefferson County school districts. Most of the \ntutoring takes place at urban churches, but at each of 44 sites, Whiz \nKids provides books, computers, snacks, club time-spiritual values, a \nsense of community and, most of all, the love of men and women who care \nenough about the kids to invest a few hours a week to help them read.\n  The results have been nothing short of fantastic--the average \nyoungster in Whiz Kids improves his or her reading ability by 1-3 \ngrades each year, according to tracking by Denver Public Schools. The \ntarget for Whiz Kids is schools and students with scores below average \nin CSAP, Colorado's statewide student testing program.\n  Whiz Kids is an 11-year-old, nonprofit organization which is \nsupported by over 700 volunteer tutors and more than 80 other key \nvolunteer leaders. Each tutor make a 1-year commitment to the program \nand the tutor retention rate is an amazing 95 percent with 60 percent \nof volunteer tutors re-upping from one year to the next.\n  Whiz Kids operates on a shoestring--the total cash budget is only \n$360,000 per year. But the dramatic results of this tutoring program, \nand its commendable cost efficiency, have called forth tremendous \nsupport from over 150 churches of many denominations.\n  The Colorado business community has also pitched in to help by \ndonating 120 computers and other in-kind contributions and financial \nsupport from companies such as AV Hunter, Best Buy, Janis, JD Edwards, \nKinder Morgan, King Soopers, Houghton Mifflin, Western Union, and \nothers.\n  Additional support comes from the Anschutz Family Foundation, Coors \nFoundation, Daniels Foundation, El Pomar, Fund for Colorado's Future, \nJack A. Vickers Foundation, PK Foundation, Sam S. Bloom Foundation, the \nSchlessman Family Foundation, Schramm Foundation and TYL Foundation.\n  The Denver Nuggets donated the entire Pepsi Center to Whiz Kids for a \n1-day Slam Dunk Saturday event at which 2,000 mentors and kids gather \nfor basketball clinics and drills. Then, mentors and kids are guests of \nthe Nuggets for the evening game. This is the largest gathering of its \nkind in the NBA. The Nuggets donate additional tickets for tutors, \nkids, and their parents throughout the season.\n  The Denver Broncos donate tickets to their kids camp. Whiz Kids has \nreceived the Denver Broncos Quarterback Award 2 years in a row. The \nColorado Rapids annually donate game tickets for kids and tutors.\n  Each year, Whiz Kids holds its year end Run to Read event at Denver's \nCity Park. More than a thousand tutors and kids gather for games, \nmusic, and fun to celebrate achievements of the year. Last year, this \nevent also raised pledges of more than $20,000 from tutors to buy \nadditional supplies for the following school year.\n  From start to finish, kids and tutors have a lot of fun, but the main \npurpose is completely serious--to get kids who are falling behind in \nreading back on track. It is a program that is working.\n  Whiz Kids has been called one of the top three faith-based tutoring \nprograms in America by Tony Campbell of America's Promise. And no \nwonder, it is already being copied in eight other States.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a moment to read a recent letter from \nthe Denver Public Schools which describes why Whiz Kids is such an \n``excellent model of collaboration'' between the public schools and the \nprivate sector.\n  ``To Whom It May Concern: In support of the Whiz Kids Tutoring \nProgram, this letter shall serve to detail the collaborative \nrelationship between our organizations. Whiz Kids Tutoring operates in \npartnership with the Denver Public Schools Office of Community \nPartnerships, as an independent agency providing services to our \nstudents. Because of this partnership by acting as the interface \nbetween the program and the principals and teachers of our district. At \nthe beginning of each school semester, we assist the program by \nidentifying students and facilitating student participation, and by \ncoordinating the participation of DPS liaison teachers. Our office \nprovides additional salary compensation for liaison teachers, based \nupon the number of sessions attended in a given school year. This \ncompensation totaled over $29,000 for the 2001-02 school year. In \naddition, our office provides Colorado Bureau of Investigations \nbackground screening for all incoming volunteers to the program, and we \nassist\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\nWhiz Kids with $500 in vouchers for books and other materials for each \nnew study hall session that opens. We also conducted an evaluation of \nthe program (1998/99) in conjunction with the Graduate School of \nEducation at the University of Denver. This study showed us that \nstudents engaged with Whiz Kids tutors gained between one and three \nacademic grade levels in reading competencies over a 1-year time frame.\n  ``For their part, Whiz Kids Tutoring provides Denver Public Schools \nwith a wonderful benefit each school year. Nearly 600 of our students \nreceive one-on-one academic support and mentoring each year, making \nWhiz Kids the largest single provider of such services to the district. \nThe agency provides excellent support and training to its volunteers, \nwhich is reflected by the extremely high commitment level the \nvolunteers exhibit. Recruitment, training, and management of all \nvolunteers are provided by Whiz Kids, eliminating any costs to DPS in \nthese areas. Also, by partnering with neighborhood churches and \ncommunity centers to provide space for group activities, Whiz Kids \ngreatly reduces the overhead costs of the program, which might \notherwise be incurred by the district in a school-based operation.\n  ``The relationship between Whiz Kids Tutoring and Denver Public \nSchools is an excellent model of collaboration and provides a vital \nservice to the children of our district. I appreciate your \nconsideration of the Whiz Kids Tutoring grant proposal and give it my \nfull endorsement as a partner. Should you require additional details \nregarding our partnership, please feel free to contact me at 303-764-\n3580. Sincerely, Christine Smith, Director, Denver Public Schools \nOffice of Community Partnerships and Enterprise Activity.''\n  Mr. President, Whiz Kids is a great program which enriches the lives \nof students, provides a fulfilling opportunity for volunteers, and \ngives them a wonderful opportunity to put their faith into action. \nEvery community ought to have a program like this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8225-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100th ANNIVERSARY OF THE VILLAGE OF SOUTH RANGE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \nVillage of South Range, located in the beautiful upper peninsula of my \nhome State of Michigan, as it celebrates its 100th anniversary. South \nRange is located in the middle of the Keweenaw Peninsula, which makes \nup the northernmost point of my home State.\n  The Village of South Range derives its name and much of its history \nfrom the copper mining industry that operated in that area from 1840 \nuntil the closing of the last mine in 1970. In 1903, the Wheal Kate \nMining Company sold off land from its failing copper mining business \nand created the town of South Range. During the early 1900s, much of \nthe Keweenaw Peninsula was controlled by the copper mining industry. \nThe creation of South Range provided miners the opportunity to \nindividually purchase property that had formerly been owned by the \nlarge mining companies.\n  Over the next 100 years, the residents of South Range watched many of \ntheir neighboring towns disappear as American industry declined and no \nlonger needed the resources that this region could provide. However, \nSouth Range survived because of the perseverance of the families who \nlived there and the businesses that grew to support them.\n  Today, the Village of South Range and its 800 residents enjoy a year-\nround tourism industry as well as the beautiful surroundings of the \nKeewenaw Peninsula.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah relative to the modification of census \n     data collection procedures for the 2010 Census to account for \n     United States Citizens who are living out of the country on a \n     temporary basis; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        Concurrent Resolution 1\n\n       Whereas, in 2000, and every preceding ten years, the United \n     States Census Bureau collected data on the citizens of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, census data is used for many purposes, including \n     the apportionment of congressional districts among the states \n     based on population;\n       Whereas, if 857 more individuals had been approved to be \n     included in the population data collected for Utah in the \n     2000 Census, the state would have been allocated an \n     additional congressional seat;\n       Whereas, the United States Census Bureau's technical \n     documentation manual for the 2000 Census states that \n     Americans temporarily overseas are to be enumerated at their \n     usual residence in the United States;\n       Whereas, U.S. military personnel and federal civilian \n     employees stationed outside the United States and their \n     dependents living with them, were included in the 2000 Census \n     apportionment count;\n       Whereas, among the several groups and individual citizens \n     from Utah that lived out of the country at the time of the \n     2000 Census were 11,176 members of the Church of Jesus Christ \n     of Latter-day Saints, serving temporarily as missionaries as \n     evidenced by the Affidavit of Robert B. Swensen, Director of \n     the Missionary Department at the international headquarters \n     of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which \n     affidavit is attached as Appendix A;\n       Whereas, members of the church from every state in the \n     union serve these mission;\n       Whereas, although young females can serve 18-month missions \n     and elderly couples may also serve anywhere from six-month to \n     two-year missions for the church, the vast majority of \n     missionaries are young males ages 19-21 who serve two-year \n     missions;\n       Whereas, as illustrated in Appendix B, data from Census \n     2000 Summary File 3 show that male representation in the Utah \n     population ranges from 50-53 percent from birth through 18 \n     years of age;\n       Whereas, the percentage of males in the Utah population who \n     are 19 years of age drops to just below 46 percent, reaches a \n     low of 42.4 percent at age 20, and increases to 47.7 percent \n     at age 21;\n       Whereas, beginning at age 22, the male representation in \n     Utah returns to the 50-53 percent range, where it remains \n     through age 49;\n       Whereas, using the Census 2000 Summary File 3 data, it is \n     estimated that over 17,000 young males ages 19 through 21 \n     were not included in Utah's census count, some of whom were \n     counted in other states' census counts but the vast majority \n     of whom were not counted as they were out of the country \n     temporarily serving missions overseas;\n       Whereas, the Census 2000 Summary File 3 data clearly \n     demonstrates the impact on the state's population of the many \n     young male members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\n     day Saints from Utah who temporarily leave the country for \n     mission service and then return;\n       Whereas, the present questionnaire does not provide for \n     those Americans temporarily living overseas to be enumerated \n     at their usual residence in the United States;\n       Whereas, the impact of the temporary nature of this \n     missionary service is not being factored into the \n     determination of state population for purposes of allocating \n     congressional seats; and\n       Whereas, the United States Census Bureau should reexamine \n     the census data collection procedures in order to collect \n     data that captures this portion of the state's population \n     whose absence from the state is only temporary and should not \n     be overlooked when determining the apportionment of \n     congressional seats:\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of the \n     state of Utah, the Governor concurring therein, strongly urge \n     the United States Census Bureau to review its census data \n     collection procedures and make corrections for the 2010 \n     Census, including the census questionnaire, to allow for the \n     collection of data that recognizes the temporary nature of \n     missionary service and permits those individuals out of the \n     country for this purpose to be included in the calculation of \n     state population.\n       Be it further Resolved, That this revised system be used in \n     future census years so that all the states, including Utah, \n     may be granted fair representation when future congressional \n     seats are allocated.\n       Be it further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be \n     sent to Charles Louis Kincannon, Director, United States \n     Census Bureau; Cathy McCully, Chief, Redistricting Data \n     Office; Donald L. Evans, United States Secretary of Commerce; \n     the House and Senate Congressional Committees chaired by the \n     following: Dan Burton, Chairman, House Committee on \n     Government Reform, Dave Weldon, Chairman, Subcommittee on \n     Civil Service, Census, and Agency Organization, and Susan \n     Collins, Chairman, Senate Committee on Government Affairs; \n     and to the members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-169. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to the compensation for the impact \n     of federal land ownership on the state's ability to fund \n     public education; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                          Joint Resolution 14\n\n       Whereas, for many years western states have grappled with \n     the challenge of providing the best education for their \n     citizens;\n       Whereas, western states face unique challenges in achieving \n     this goal;\n       Whereas, from 1979 to 1998 the percent change in \n     expenditures per pupil in 13 western states was 28%, compared \n     to 57% in the remaining states;\n       Whereas, in 2000-01, the pupil per teacher ratio in 13 \n     western states averaged 17.9% to one compared with 14.8% to \n     one in the remaining states;\n       Whereas, the conditions in western states are exacerbated \n     by projections that enrollment will increase by an average of \n     7.1%, compared to an average decrease of 2.6% in the rest of \n     the nation;\n       Whereas, despite the wide disparities in expenditures per \n     pupil and pupil per teacher ratio, western states tax a \n     comparable rate and allocate as much of their budgets to \n     public education as the rest of the nation;\n       Whereas, the ability of western states to fund education is \n     directly related to federal ownership of lands;\n       Whereas, the federal government owns an average of 51.9% of \n     the land in 13 western states, compared to 4.1% in the \n     remaining states;\n       Whereas, the enabling acts of most western states promise \n     that 5% of the proceeds from the sale of federal lands will \n     go to the states for public education;\n       Whereas, a federal policy change in 1976 ended these sales \n     resulting in an estimated $14 billion in lost public \n     education funding for western states;\n       Whereas, the ability of western states to fund public \n     education is further impacted by the fact that state and \n     local property taxes, which public education relies heavily \n     upon to fund education, cannot be assessed on federal lands;\n       Whereas, the estimated annual impact of this property tax \n     prohibition on western states is over $4 billion;\n       Whereas, the federal government shares only half of its \n     royalty revenue with the states;\n       Whereas, royalties are further reduced because federal \n     lands are less likely to be developed and federal laws often \n     place stipulations on the use of state royalty payments;\n       Whereas, the estimated annual impact of royalty payment \n     policies on western states is over $1.86 billion;\n       Whereas, much of the land that the federal government \n     transferred to states upon statehood as a trust for public \n     education is difficult to administer and to make productive \n     because it is surrounded by federal land;\n       Whereas, federal land ownership greatly hinders the ability \n     of western states to fund public education;\n       Whereas, the federal government should compensate western \n     states for the significant impact federal land ownership has \n     on the ability of western states to educate its citizens; and\n       Whereas, just compensation will allow western states to be \n     on equal footing with the rest of the nation in their efforts \n     to provide education for their citizens:\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of the \n     state of Utah urges the United States Congress to appropriate \n     just compensation to the state of Utah for the impact of \n     federal land ownership on the state's ability to find \n     public education.\n       Be it further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be \n     sent to the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President of the United States, and the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-170. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to wilderness areas and \n     wilderness study areas; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, The provisions of 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1131 et \n     seq., commonly referred to as the Wilderness Act, establish \n     the National Wilderness Preservation System, which consists \n     of areas of federal public land that are designated by \n     Congress as wilderness areas; and\n       Whereas, Congress has designated approximately 2 million \n     acres of certain federal public lands in Nevada as wilderness \n     areas; and\n       Whereas, If an area of federal public land is designated as \n     a wilderness area, it must be managed in a manner that \n     preserves the wilderness character of the area and ensures \n     that the area remains unimpaired for future use and enjoyment \n     as a wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, A reasonable amount of wilderness area in this \n     state provides for a diverse spectrum of recreational \n     opportunities in Nevada, promotes tourism and provides a \n     place for Nevadans to escape the pressures of urban growth; \n     and\n       Whereas, In conjunction with the provisions of the \n     Wilderness Act, the Bureau of Land Management of the \n     Department of the Interior in the late 1970s conducted an \n     initial inventory of approximately 49 million acres of \n     federal public lands in Nevada to determine the suitability \n     of such lands for designation as wilderness areas or \n     identification as wilderness study areas and, in 1980, \n     recommended that approximately 5.1 million acres of those \n     lands be identified as wilderness study areas; and\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\n       Whereas, Until a wilderness study area is designated by \n     Congress as a wilderness area or released for multiple use, \n     the wilderness study area must be managed in a manner that \n     does not impair its suitability or preservation as a \n     wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, In 1991, the Bureau of Land Management recommended \n     that Congress designate as wilderness areas approximately 1.9 \n     million acres of the 5.1 million acres of wilderness study \n     areas in Nevada and release the remainder of the wilderness \n     study areas for multiple use; and\n       Whereas, Although Congress recently enacted the Clark \n     County Conservation of Public Land and Natural Resources Act \n     of 2002, Public Law 107-282 (2002), which released \n     approximately 224,000 acres in Clark County from its current \n     status as wilderness study areas, the recommendations made by \n     the Bureau of Land Management in 1991 have largely not been \n     acted upon by Congress, and the Bureau continues to manage \n     approximately 3.86 million acres of federal public lands in \n     Nevada identified as wilderness study areas; and\n       Whereas, It is important that decisions concerning whether \n     to designate wilderness study areas as wilderness areas or \n     release those areas for multiple use are made in a timely \n     manner without any unnecessary delays as the identification \n     of federal public lands as wilderness study areas is believed \n     to impose significant restrictions on the management and use \n     of those lands; and\n       Whereas, It is also important to protect the ecological \n     health and existing and potential economic and recreational \n     benefits of wilderness areas and wilderness study areas in \n     this state by using reasonable and effective methods of fire \n     suppression in those areas; and\n       Whereas, Because approximately 2 million acres of federal \n     public land in Nevada have been designated as wilderness \n     areas and approximately 8.6 percent of the federal public \n     land in Nevada that is managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management has been identified as wilderness study areas and \n     because such designation or identification is believed to \n     impose significant restrictions concerning the management and \n     use of such land, including land used for mining, ranching \n     and recreation, the Legislative Commission appointed in 2001 \n     to conduct an interim study of wilderness areas and \n     wilderness study areas in this state; and\n       Whereas, During the 2001-2002 legislative interim, the \n     subcommittee met several times throughout this state and \n     facilitated important and wide-ranging discussions among many \n     agencies, organizations and persons with diverse interests, \n     perspectives and expertise concerning wilderness areas and \n     wilderness study areas; and\n       Whereas, The subcommittee received a great deal of valuable \n     input from those agencies, organizations and persons, \n     including many valuable recommendations for Congress to \n     consider in addressing the issues concerning wilderness areas \n     and wilderness study areas in a responsible, reasonable and \n     fair manner; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge \n     Congress to:\n       1. Support efforts to ensure that adequate access to \n     wilderness areas and wilderness study areas is afforded to \n     the appropriate agencies and persons so that those agencies \n     and persons may effectively combat fires in wilderness areas \n     and wilderness study areas;\n       2. Support the use of all reasonable and effective fire \n     suppression efforts in wilderness areas and wilderness study \n     areas without strictly confining such efforts only to the \n     tools determined by the federal agencies which manage federal \n     public lands to be the minimum tools necessary;\n       3. Accept the recommendation of the Bureau of Land \n     Management to designate 1.9 million acres of certain \n     wilderness study areas in Nevada as wilderness areas while \n     also incorporating in the designation process flexibility to \n     consider relevant information such as growth to ensure the \n     establishment of appropriate boundaries for those areas and \n     recognizing that such consideration may result in a \n     reasonable adjustment of those boundaries;\n       4. Oppose any efforts to conduct another inventory of the \n     federal public lands in Nevada for purposes of creating \n     wilderness areas or wilderness study areas without first \n     releasing wilderness study areas determined to be unsuitable \n     for designation as wilderness areas;\n       5. Ensure that more current information is considered \n     before acting on the recommendations of the Bureau of Land \n     Management concerning the designation of wilderness areas in \n     Nevada as the surveys of the Bureau were performed with \n     limited time, resources and technology; and\n       6. Avoid any unnecessary delays in releasing wilderness \n     study areas for multiple use by establishing a plan for \n     addressing the release of wilderness study areas in a timely \n     manner that includes a schedule or plan for the timely \n     consideration of important issues concerning wilderness study \n     areas; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-171. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to wilderness areas and \n     wilderness study areas; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 4\n\n       Whereas, The provisions of 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1131 et \n     seq., commonly referred to as the Wilderness Act, established \n     the National Wilderness Preservation System, which consists \n     of areas of federal public land that are designated by \n     Congress as wilderness areas; and\n       Whereas, Congress has designated approximately 2 million \n     acres of certain federal public lands in Nevada as wilderness \n     areas; and\n       Whereas, If an area of federal public land is designated as \n     a wilderness area, it must be managed in a manner that \n     preserves the wilderness character of the area and ensures \n     that the area remains unimpaired for future use and enjoyment \n     as a wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, A reasonable amount of wilderness area in this \n     state provides for a diverse spectrum of recreational \n     opportunities in Nevada, promotes tourism and provides a \n     place for Nevadans to escape the pressures of urban growth; \n     and\n       Whereas, In conjunction with the provisions of the \n     Wilderness Act, the Bureau of Land Management of the \n     Department of the Interior manages approximately 3.86 million \n     acres of federal public lands in Nevada identified as \n     wilderness study areas; and\n       Whereas, Until a wilderness study area is designated by \n     Congress as a wilderness area or released, the wilderness \n     study area must be managed in a manner that does not impair \n     its suitability for preservation as a wilderness area; and\n       Whereas, Because approximately 2 million acres of federal \n     public land in Nevada have been designated as wilderness \n     areas and approximately 8.6 percent of the federal public \n     land in Nevada that is managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management has been identified as wilderness study areas and \n     because such designation or identification is believed to \n     impose significant restrictions concerning the management and \n     use of such land, including land used for mining, ranching \n     and recreation, the Legislative Commission appointed a \n     subcommittee in 2001 to conduct an interim study of \n     wilderness areas and wilderness study areas in this state; \n     and\n       Whereas, During the 2001-2002 legislative interim, the \n     subcommittee met several times throughout this state and \n     facilitated important and wide-ranging discussions among many \n     agencies, organizations and persons with diverse interests, \n     perspectives and expertise concerning wilderness areas and \n     wilderness study areas; and\n       Whereas, The subcommittee received a great deal of valuable \n     input from those agencies, organizations and persons, \n     including many valuable recommendations for the Nevada \n     Congressional Delegation and Congress to consider in \n     addressing the issues concerning wilderness areas and \n     wilderness study areas in a responsible, reasonable and fair \n     manner; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge the \n     Nevada Congressional Delegation to work with all interested \n     Nevadans, land managers, affected parties, local governments, \n     special interest organizations and members of the American \n     public in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect to \n     address issues concerning the designation of wilderness areas \n     in Nevada; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge \n     Congress to:\n       1. Encourage education at all levels of government and of \n     all affected parties to ensure that facts are accurately \n     presented when wilderness issues are debated and that the \n     applicable laws are properly interpreted when officials carry \n     out legislation concerning wilderness areas and wilderness \n     study areas;\n       2. Require the development of accurate, consensus-vased \n     maps for boundaries of wilderness areas and wilderness study \n     areas using technologies such as Geographic Information \n     Systems;\n       3. Oppose the creation of buffer zones around wilderness \n     areas and instead support the requirement of clear and \n     concise boundaries based on recognizable features on the \n     ground, including, without limitation, roads and established \n     drainage routes;\n       4. Support efforts to ensure that existing roads are not \n     closed to create wilderness areas;\n       5. Support the implementation of appropriate measures, \n     including, without limitation, the use of roads, to ensure \n     that persons who are elderly or have a disability have \n     continued access to wilderness areas;\n       6. Support the preservation of roads that do not appear on \n     a map and may not have been documented but that have \n     historically been used to allow persons access to private \n     property;\n       7. For the purpose of allowing ranchers access to water \n     diversions located near wilderness areas or wilderness study \n     areas, support the use of ``cherry-stem'' roads, which are \n     dead-end roads that would geographically extend into \n     wilderness areas but are excluded from designation as parts \n     of wilderness areas because the boundaries of the wilderness \n     areas are drawn around and just beyond the edges of such \n     roads;\n       8. Specifically outline and guarantee all preexisting \n     rights of ranchers concerning grazing permits, water permits \n     and access to land and water necessary for ranching via \n     ``cherry-stem'' roads in any legislation concerning \n     wilderness areas and wilderness study areas;\n\n[[Page S8229]]\n\n       9. Support the use of appropriately managed techniques for \n     managing vegetation, including, without limitation, grazing, \n     and the use of appropriately managed logging as integral \n     tools for reducing potential fire danger in wilderness areas \n     and wilderness study areas;\n       10. Consider future population growth and urban expansion \n     when designating wilderness areas in Nevada, as Nevada has \n     been the state with the highest percentage population growth \n     in recent years and public lands in Nevada are increasingly \n     impacted by human activity and development;\n       11. Support the designation of the area of approximately \n     1,800 acres of land known as Marble Canyon, which is adjacent \n     to the Mt. Moriah Wilderness Area and which appears to have \n     been inadvertently excluded from the Nevada Wilderness \n     Protection Act of 1989, Public Law 101-195, as a wilderness \n     area;\n       12. Support national and state legislation which explicitly \n     requires that when a decision is made in the public land use \n     planning process which will affect economic activity on \n     public land, consideration must be given as to the effects of \n     the decision on communities that are dependent on natural \n     resources;\n       13. Hold extensive hearings in Washington, DC., and in \n     Nevada before making any changes to the designation of \n     wilderness areas in Nevada or the identification of \n     wilderness study areas in Nevada or any other changes \n     concerning public lands in Nevada;\n       14. Use a collaborative process when designating a \n     wilderness study area as a wilderness area; and\n       15. Support precise specification of the activities that \n     are authorized within wilderness areas and wilderness study \n     areas; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-172. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to migration issues and \n     citizens of the Freely Associated States who reside in the \n     State of Hawaii; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 62\n\n       Whereas, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic \n     of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau \n     (collectively, Freely Associated States), formerly part of \n     the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands under the United \n     Nations Charter, entered into an agreement with the \n     government of the United States known as the Compact of Free \n     Association (Compact); and\n       Whereas, the Compact was entered into with these nations in \n     part to terminate the trusteeship, recognize their \n     independence, provide them with critical economic development \n     aid, and allow their people to immigrate freely to the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, under the Compact, the United States provides \n     direct economic assistance, federal services, and military \n     protection to these nations, in exchange for defense rights; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Compact, codified as Title II of Public Law \n     99-239, was established in 1986 between the United States and \n     the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States \n     of Micronesia, and in 1994 with the Republic of Palau, \n     codified as Title II of Public Law 99-658; and\n       Whereas, section 104(e)(1) of Title I, Public Law 99-239, \n     regarding the interpretation of and United State policy \n     regarding the Compact, states that in approving the Compact, \n     ``it is not the intent of the Congress to cause any adverse \n     consequences for . . . the States of Hawaii''; and\n       Whereas, section 104(e)(4) of Title I, Public Law 99-239, \n     provides that ``if any adverse consequences to . . . the \n     State of Hawaii result from implementation of the Compact of \n     Free Association, the Congress will act sympathetically and \n     expeditiously to redress those adverse consequences''; and\n       Whereas, section 104(e)(5) of Title I, Public Law 99-239, \n     appropriated funds beginning after September 30, 1985, to \n     cover the costs, if any, incurred by Hawaii ``resulting from \n     any increased demands placed on educational and social \n     services by immigrants from the Marshall Islands and the \n     Federated States of Micronesia''; and\n       Whereas, section 104(e)(2) of Title I, Public Law 99-239, \n     requires the President of the United States to report \n     annually to the Congress on the impact of the Compact on the \n     State of Hawaii, identifying any adverse consequences \n     resulting from the Compact and making recommendations for \n     corrective action, focusing on such areas as trade, taxation, \n     immigration, labor, and environmental regulations; and\n       Whereas, section 104(e)(3) of Title I, Public Law 99-239, \n     further provides that in preparing these reports to Congress, \n     the President shall request the views of the government of \n     the State of Hawaii and transmit the full text of those views \n     to Congress as part of those reports; and\n       Whereas, the interpretation of and United States policy \n     regarding the Compact as set forth in section 104 of Title I, \n     Public Law 99-239, with respect to the Federated States of \n     Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, also \n     applies to the Republic of Palau, pursuant to section 102(a) \n     of Title I, Public Law 99-658, thereby making the State of \n     Hawaii eligible for additional funds resulting from increased \n     demands placed on the educational and social services of the \n     State of Hawaii by immigrants from the Freely Associated \n     States; and\n       Whereas, payments from the United States to the Republic of \n     the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia \n     under the Compact of Free Association will end on October 1, \n     2003, and Compact re-negotiation talks have been continuing; \n     and\n       Whereas, instead of mitigating the incentive for Freely \n     Associated States citizens to migrate by improving the \n     overall quality of life in the Freely Associated States \n     through increased economic aid, the United States has \n     proposed giving additional funds to regions affected by \n     ``Compact impacts,'' while creating ``various mechanisms'' \n     to ensure that migrants from Freely Associated States are \n     eligible for admission; and\n       Whereas, although the renegotiated Compacts with the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of \n     Micronesia will most likely continue to provide islanders \n     with visa-free entry to the United States, the United States \n     Congress should review the migration issue and increase the \n     amount of aid available for the Compact's educational and \n     social impact on Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, many residents of the Freely Associated States are \n     attracted to the State of Hawaii due to the State's increased \n     employment and educational opportunities, as well as similar \n     Pacific Island culture and lifestyle; and\n       Whereas, drawn by the promise of better medical care and a \n     better education for their children, over six thousand Freely \n     Associated States citizens have migrated to and are currently \n     residing in Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, Freely Associated States citizens that enter the \n     United States may have contagious diseases, criminal records, \n     or chronic health problems--conditions that are normally \n     grounds for inadmissibility into the United States; and\n       Whereas, the 1996 federal Welfare Reform Act cut off access \n     to federal welfare and medical assistance programs, forcing \n     citizens of the Freely Associated States residing in Hawaii \n     to rely on state aid; and\n       Whereas, the cost of supporting Freely Associated States \n     citizens residing in Hawaii, largely in healthcare and \n     education, totaled more than $101,000,000 between 1998 and \n     2002; and\n       Whereas, Freely Associated States students have higher \n     costs than other students due to poor language and other \n     skills, and because such students enter and leave school a \n     few times each year, their integration into the school system \n     has been difficult; and\n       Whereas, since the Compact went into effect in 1986 until \n     2001, Hawaii has spent over $64,000,000 to educate Freely \n     Associated States citizens and their children in public \n     schools, $10,000,000 in 2000 alone; and\n       Whereas, last year, the number of Freely Associated States \n     students in primary and secondary public schools in Hawaii \n     increased by twenty-eight percent, resulting in costs to the \n     State of over $13,000,000 for school year 2001-2002, and \n     bringing the total costs for education, since 1988, to about \n     $78,000,000; and\n       Whereas, during the academic school year 2001-2002, the \n     University of Hawaii lost over $1,200,000 in tuition revenue \n     systemwide, as a result of students from the Federated States \n     of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the \n     Republic of Palau paying resident rather than non-resident \n     tuition; and\n       Whereas, inadequate and delayed federal compensation to \n     Hawaii's education system results in a cost to Hawaii's own \n     children and contributes to Hawaii being substantially below \n     many other states in per pupil expenditures for public school \n     children in kindergarten through grade twelve; and\n       Whereas, state medical assistance payments for Freely \n     Associated States citizens from 1998 to 2002 totaled \n     $14,961,427, and financial assistance payments during the \n     same period totaled $13,378,692, with costs borne solely by \n     the State of Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, the financial stability and viability of private \n     hospitals and medical providers is threatened by staggering \n     debts and write-offs for medical services provided to Freely \n     Associated States citizens residing in Hawaii, in spite of \n     state Medicaid reimbursements; and\n       Whereas, between 1998 and 2002, $10.1 million in operating \n     losses attributable to healthcare for Freely Associated \n     States citizens residing in Hawaii were incurred at three \n     Honolulu hospitals (the Queen's Medical Center, Straub Clinic \n     and Hospital, and Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and \n     Children), and these types of losses were also incurred at \n     the twenty other hospitals in the State; and\n       Whereas, community health centers estimate an annual cost \n     of $420,000 for services to Freely Associated States citizens \n     residing in Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Health has also been \n     significantly impacted by the cost of public health services \n     to Freely Associated States citizens residing in Hawaii, with \n     $967,000 spent on screening vaccination and treatment of \n     communicable diseases and $190,000 spent for immunization and \n     outreach by public health nurses; and\n       Whereas, inadequate and delayed federal compensation \n     threaten to overwhelm Hawaii's health care systems, leading \n     to potential cutbacks in services and personnel that would \n     impact all of Hawaii's citizens; and\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\n       Whereas, it is imperative that Hawaii be granted immediate \n     and substantial federal assistance to meet these mounting \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, the fact that Micronesians should qualify for \n     federal benefits, while residing in Hawaii and the rest of \n     the United States, can best be summed up by the resolution \n     which was adopted September 9, 2001, in Washington, D.C., by \n     Grassroots Organizing for Welfare Leadership, supporting the \n     insertion of language in all federal welfare, food, and \n     housing legislation, because Micronesians are eligible for \n     these and other benefits as ``qualified non-immigrants'' \n     residing in the United States; and\n       Whereas, the United States government is not owning up to \n     its responsibility for what the United States did to the \n     Micronesian people by refusing them food stamps and other \n     federal benefits when they came to Hawaii and the rest of the \n     United States seeking help; and\n       Whereas, the excuse by the United States government to deny \n     any aid to the Micronesians in the United States is the word \n     ``nonimmigrant'' used in the Compact of Free Association to \n     describe Micronesians who move to Hawaii and the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, Micronesians have also developed high rates of \n     diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity as a result of \n     American dietary colonialism; and\n       Whereas, it is the intent of this Resolution to encourage \n     the responsible entities to implement the provisions of the \n     Compact of Freely Associated States, which authorizes compact \n     impact funds to be made available to states that welcome and \n     provide services to the people of the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of \n     Palau, because most of the Freely Associated States citizens \n     who migrate to Hawaii do so for medical problems related to \n     the United States' military testing of nuclear bombs; now, \n     therefore,\n       Be it Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-Second \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2003, \n     the House of Representatives concurring, That the Bush \n     Administration and the United States Congress are requested \n     to appropriate adequate financial impact assistance for \n     health, education, and other social services for Hawaii's \n     Freely Associated States citizens; and\n       Be it further Resolved, That the Bush Administration and \n     the United States Congress are requested to insert language \n     in all federal welfare, food, and housing legislation which \n     says that Micronesians are eligible for federal food stamps, \n     welfare, public housing, and other federal benefits as \n     ``qualified nonimmigrants'' residing in the United States; \n     and\n       Be it further Resolved, That the Bush Administration and \n     the United States Congress are requested to restore Freely \n     Associated States citizens' eligibility for federal public \n     benefits, such as Medicaid, Medicare, and food stamps; and\n       Be it further Resolved, That Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation is requested to introduce legislation in the \n     United States Congress calling for further review of the \n     migration issue and for increased aid for the educational and \n     social impact of the Compact of Free Association, and any \n     newly renegotiated Compact, on the State of Hawaii; and\n       Be it further Resolved, That Hawaii's congressional \n     delegates are requested to assure financial reimbursements, \n     through the establishment of a trust, escrow, or set-aside \n     account, to the State of Hawaii for educational, medical, and \n     social services and to Hawaii's private medical providers who \n     have provided services to Freely Associated States citizens; \n     and\n       Be it further Resolved, That certified copies of this \n     Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the President of the \n     United States; U.S. Secretary of State; President of the U.S. \n     Senate; Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; members \n     of Hawaii's congressional delegation, the Presidents of the \n     Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands, and the Republic of Palau, and their respective \n     Honolulu Offices;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah relative to the establishment of \n     requirements that clinical study sponsors perform subgroup \n     analysis of their studies to ensure that the health concerns \n     of women are addressed in clinical trial results; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Concurrent Resolution 2\n\n       Whereas, there is a pressing need to collect and assess \n     more accurate data regarding the health of women;\n       Whereas, subgroup analysis, a statistical procedure, takes \n     data from a general group of study subjects and looks for \n     differences within a subset of those subjects that share a \n     specific characteristic, such as sex, age, or state of \n     disease;\n       Whereas, studies have shown that, to improve the quality \n     and appropriateness of health services, the gender of those \n     participating in clinical trials must be factored into all \n     levels of biomedical research, creating a new paradigm for \n     data analysis;\n       Whereas, despite the mounting evidence of the need for \n     subgroup data analysis based on gender, recent reports show \n     that analysis is either not being conducted or not being \n     reported;\n       Whereas, although a 1993 policy guideline and a 1998 \n     regulation by the Food and Drug Administration recommends \n     that study sponsors perform subgroup analysis of their \n     studies, it is clear that these recommendations are not being \n     followed;\n       Whereas, a July 2001 report of the General Accounting \n     Office found that about one-third of new drug applications \n     submitted to the Food and Drug Administration by study \n     sponsors failed to provide gender-specific data from \n     subgroup-analysis conducted during the clinical trials; and\n       Whereas, without subgroup analyses, researchers and \n     clinicians cannot truly assess the safety and efficacy of new \n     drugs for women, and the development of potentially life \n     saving drugs may be abandoned if early trials fail to show \n     efficacy in one gender:\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of the \n     State of Utah, the Governor concurring therein, strongly urge \n     the Food and Drug Administration to strictly enforce \n     requirements that clinical study sponsors perform subgroup \n     analysis of their studies to ensure that the health concerns \n     of women are appropriately addressed in clinical trial \n     results.\n       Be it further Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be \n     sent to the Food and Drug Administration, the Utah Department \n     of Health, and the members of Utah's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-174.

A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     limits on the refinancing of long-term debt and on the \n     advance refunding of private activity bonds by state and \n     local government; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 98\n\n       Whereas, As state and local governments begin working on \n     their annual budgets, they are faced with weighing the \n     unpalatable\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\n     choices of program cuts, tax hikes or both to make up budget \n     shortfalls as a result of the sluggish economy; and\n       Whereas, In 1986 the Congress of the United States added a \n     limitation to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 providing \n     that state and local governments can refinance long-term debt \n     (municipal bonds) only once so that a flood of tax-exempt \n     municipal bonds would not deprive the United States Treasury \n     of tax revenue; and\n       Whereas, Many state and local governments refinanced their \n     long-term debt during the 1990s to take advantage of the \n     lower interest rates at that time; and\n       Whereas, The slowdown in the economy has led to even lower \n     interest rates and provides the potential for state and local \n     governments to refinance currently outstanding debt at \n     historically low-interest rates and may hold the answer \n     governments are looking for in an attempt to save badly \n     needed funds; and\n       Whereas, By Federal law, those same governments now have \n     only one opportunity to take advantage of favorable market \n     conditions and achieve lower borrowing costs; and\n       Whereas, Section 149(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 also prohibits the advance refunding of all private \n     activity bonds, other than qualified section 501(c)(3) bonds, \n     if the bonds are to maintain their tax-exempt status; and\n       Whereas, Private activity bonds are commonly used by state \n     agencies and local governments to finance important \n     initiatives such as housing and redevelopment projects; and\n       Whereas, Current economic uncertainties increasingly pinch \n     state and local government budgets compounded by the \n     increased and unforeseen burdens of funding safeguards \n     against terrorism; and\n       Whereas, In order to provide state and local governments \n     with the tools and flexibility they need to face these \n     changing circumstances, additional opportunities are needed \n     to advance the refunding of outstanding debt; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to restructure the requirement \n     in section 149(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     either legislatively or by regulation, to afford state and \n     local governments the flexibility they need to take advantage \n     of favorable market conditions by providing additional \n     opportunities to advance the refunding of outstanding long-\n     term debt; and be if further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 177.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah relative to a free trade agreement between \n     the Republic of China on Taiwan and the United States; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                           Joint Resolution 7\n\n       Whereas, the United States should promote the values of \n     freedom, democracy, and a commitment to open markets and the \n     free exchange of both goods and ideas at home and abroad;\n       Whereas, the Republic of China on Taiwan shares these \n     values with the United States and has struggled throughout \n     the past 50 years to create what is today an open and \n     thriving democracy;\n       Whereas, the United States must continue to support the \n     growth of democracy and ongoing market opening in Taiwan if \n     this relationship is to evolve and reflect the changing \n     nature of the global system in the 21st Century;\n       Whereas, despite the fact that Taiwan only recently became \n     a member of the World Trade Organization and that it has no \n     formal trade agreement with the United States, Taiwan has \n     nevertheless emerged as the United States' eighth largest \n     trading partner;\n       Whereas, American businesses and workers have benefitted \n     greatly from this dynamic trade relationship, most recently \n     in the computer and electronics sector;\n       Whereas, Taiwan is a gateway to other Pacific Rim markets \n     for United States exports, helping to preserve peace and \n     stability within the entire region;\n       Whereas, United States agricultural producers have been \n     particularly under represented in the list of United States \n     exports to the region, despite the importance of the market \n     for growers of corn, wheat, and soybeans;\n       Whereas, a free trade agreement would not only help \n     Taiwan's economy dramatically expand its already growing \n     entrepreneurial class, but it would also serve an important \n     political function;\n       Whereas, the United States needs to support partner \n     countries that are lowering trade barriers;\n       Whereas, Taiwan has emerged over the past two decades as \n     one of the United States' most important allies in Asia and \n     throughout the world;\n       Whereas, in the interest of supporting, preserving, and \n     protecting the democratic fabric of the government of Taiwan, \n     it is made clear that the United States supports the \n     withdrawal of missiles deployed as a threat against Taiwan by \n     the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas, Taiwan has forged an open, market-based economy \n     and a thriving democracy based on free elections and the \n     freedom of dissent;\n       Whereas, it is in the interest of the United States to \n     encourage the development of both these institutions;\n       Whereas, the United States has an obligation to its allies \n     and to its own citizens to encourage economic growth, market \n     opening, and the destruction of trade barriers as a means of \n     raising living standards across the board;\n       Whereas, a free trade agreement with Taiwan would be a \n     positive step toward accomplishing all of these goals; and\n       Whereas, the United States should also support the entry of \n     Taiwan into the World Health Organization, the United \n     Nations, and other relevant international organizations:\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of the \n     state of Utah urges the Bush Administration to support a free \n     trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan.\n       Be it further Resolved, That United States policy should \n     include the pursuit of some initiative in the World Trade \n     Organization which will give Taiwan meaningful participation \n     in a manner that is consistent with the organization's \n     requirements.\n       Be it further Resolbed, That a copy of this resolution be \n     sent to the President of the United States, the United States \n     Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health, Education, and \n     Welfare, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Government of Taiwan, the World Trade Organization, and \n     the members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-180. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Wisconsin relative to the \n     Medicare system; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          Senate Resolution 7\n\n       Whereas, the archaic and complex Medicare reimbursement \n     formula rewards Medicare providers in areas with high \n     historic\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\n     health costs while penalizing those providers in low-cost \n     areas for the same services; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin and other upper midwestern states have \n     traditionally been paid less per Medicare enrollee due to our \n     efficient, low-cost management of health care services; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin receives the 8th lowest Medicare \n     payments per enrollee in the nation; and\n       Whereas, if Wisconsin received Medicare payments at the \n     national average, an additional $1,000,000,000 in benefits \n     would flow to our seniors and their health care providers; \n     and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin should no longer be a ``donor'' state by \n     contributing its fair share to the federal program while \n     receiving fewer benefits and lower reimbursements in return; \n     and\n       Whereas, the failure of Wisconsin Medicare to cover the \n     cost of health care for its beneficiaries shifts the cost \n     burden to employers and the privately insured, translating \n     into a hidden tax increase that contributes to rising health \n     insurance premiums and the uninsured population; and\n       Whereas, an increase in the uninsured would have a \n     detrimental impact on the health of many Wisconsin citizens, \n     would drive up health care costs, and could lead to a \n     significant rise in the use of government programs such as \n     BadgerCare or Medical Assistance, thus requiring additional \n     funding from Wisconsin taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, another practical result of this payment inequity \n     is that Wisconsin's seniors are denied access to the broad \n     range of affordable benefits and services that seniors in \n     many other states take for granted; and\n       Whereas, in places where reimbursement rates are high, such \n     as Florida, Medicare health maintenance organizations can \n     offer their plans without a premium, while in Wisconsin the \n     Medicare population has limited access to health maintenance \n     organization care; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin's hospitals are paid 14% less than their \n     costs and thus rank 45th nationally in percentage of costs \n     paid for providing services to Medicare beneficiaries; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin physicians are paid approximately one-\n     third less of their costs, and Wisconsin consistently ranks \n     nationally as one of the 10 lowest states in Medicare \n     reimbursement for medical services provided; and\n       Whereas, the impact of this inequity has not translated \n     into the delay, by 50% of Wisconsin physicians who treat \n     Medicare patients, in the purchase of new and needed \n     equipment; and\n       Whereas, 15% of physicians have started restricting the \n     number of new Medicare patients that they will accept while \n     another 9% can no longer afford to accept new Medicare \n     patients, despite an aging Wisconsin population; and\n       Whereas, physicians who are still currently seeing Medicare \n     patients have reduced their number of weekly appointments by \n     18%; and\n       Whereas, the Medicare cuts cost Wisconsin physicians \n     $40,000,000 last year, forcing 6% of physicians to close \n     their private practices because they could no longer cover \n     their overhead costs and pay their staff; and\n       Whereas, the impact of this inequity means the poor, \n     disabled, and elderly will face serious challenges trying to \n     access care; and\n       Whereas, the impact of this inequity threatens the \n     viability of our health care providers, especially in rural \n     Wisconsin where Medicare enrollees typically constitute over \n     50% of a hospital's costs; and\n       Whereas, allowing Medicare reimbursement formula to exist \n     in its current form will guarantee even greater cost-\n     shifting, unending double-digit health insurance premium \n     increases, an increase in the uninsured, a continued decrease \n     in physicians accepting Medicare patients, and fewer \n     hospitals; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin hospitals, physicians, and insurers \n     stand united in their effort to ensure that Wisconsin \n     providers receive the payments that they deserve, and that \n     patients receive the benefits that they deserve; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, That the Wisconsin senate urges the \n     members of the congressional delegation from this state to \n     work to enact legislation that would reform the current \n     Medicare system and create a funding method that will \n     dispense equal benefits regardless of geography; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the senate chief clerk shall send copies of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     speaker of the U.S. house of representatives, the president \n     of the U.S. senate, and all of the members of the \n     congressional delegation from this state.\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HATCH, from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 724.

A bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after Paul Wellstone; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to give due recognition to a \ncolleague whose tragic passing is still fresh in our thoughts. Senator \nPaul Wellstone served 12 honorable years in the Senate for the State of \nMinnesota before suddenly perishing with his dear wife, Sheila, their \ndaughter, Marcia, three of his staffers, and two pilots in a plane \ncrash last October.\n  The bill I am proposing today seeks to rename the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis, MN, after Paul \nWellstone. His distinguished record of service for veterans clearly \ndemands such distinction. Indeed last October, just weeks before the \ncrash that took his life, Senator Wellstone proclaimed on the Senate \nfloor, ``It has been a labor of love for me working with veterans.''\n  Paul Wellstone served our Nation's veterans with passion and \ncommitment as a distinguished member of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs. His legacy includes the many veterans today whose \nlives have been turned around due to his unyielding service on their \nbehalf, such as veterans who are or have been homeless; veterans who \nare now receiving treatment for their service-related disabilities from \nexposure to radiation from atomic and nuclear weapons testing; and \nveterans who suffer from symptoms associated with Persian Gulf War \nSyndrome.\n  Year after year, Senator Wellstone rose in this very chamber to try \nto increase the VA health care budget. In 2000, the Senator was part of \nan effort to secure the largest one year increase ever for veterans' \nhealth care benefits. In 2001, Paul Wellstone successfully pushed \nthrough an amendment to the Budget Resolution that provided $17 billion \nover 10 years to boost health care funding for veterans. And just last \nJune, Senator Wellstone fought to include $417 million for veterans' \nhealth care in the Supplemental Appropriations Bill for FY 2002.\n  In recognition of his tireless advocacy, he was awarded a number of \ndistinctions by various veterans' service organizations, including: the \n1995 Legislator of the Year Award from the Vietnam Veterans of America; \nthe 1995 Patriot Award from the Paralyzed Veterans of America; the \nCongressional Leadership Award from the Forgotten 216th; the 1997 \nDistinguished Citizen Award from the Minnesota Veterans of Foreign \nWars; the 2002 Distinguished Science Award from the Disabled American \nVeterans; the 2002 Legislative Leadership Award from the National \nCoalition for Homeless Veterans; and the Vanguard Award for Legislative \nAchievement by the Non-Commissioned Officers Association.\n  George Washington once remarked, ``The willingness with which our \nyoung people are likely to serve in any war,\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\nno matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they \nperceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by \ntheir nation.'' Senator Wellstone knew this all too well and worked to \nmake the Department of Veterans Affairs a more responsive organization.\n  The Minneapolis VA Medical Center was a source of great pride for \nPaul. He once described the facility as having become ``the pride and \njoy of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and more important, of \nveterans throughout the region.'' The naming of the Paul Wellstone \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Medical Center will forever honor his \ncommitment to our veterans by distinguishing the very institution that \ncarries on his ``labor of love.'' Mr. President, this is only a small \nmark of the appreciation that we all owe to an individual who served \nveterans with such compassion and conviction.\n  Finally, I thank Frederick ``Rock'' Rochelle--a past President of the \nSt. Paul Chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America--for working with \nme on this legislation to honor the memory of Paul Wellstone. I have \ncompiled a list of statements made by friends and colleagues in \nremembrance of Senator Wellstone.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the above \nmentioned list of statements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and list of statements was ordered \nto be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n         Friends and Colleagues Remember Senator Paul Wellstone\n\n       ``As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, \n     Senator Wellstone was a tireless crusader for America's \n     veterans, an issue of paramount importance to him. I greatly \n     respected and admired him for his passion, his character and \n     his commitment for the causes in which he believed.''--\n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi\n       ``His unwavering support year after year of adequate \n     funding for veterans health care, in particular, was \n     something we could always count on. Similarly, he championed \n     the cause of homeless veterans to ensure that they were not \n     forgotten and that their needs were addressed by the nation \n     they served. Though not a veteran himself, he brought energy \n     and commitment to issues important to veterans and their \n     families. He was a fighter and leading voice and, if ever \n     there was a true friend of America's veterans, Senator \n     Wellstone was it.''--W.G. ``Bill'' Kilgore, national \n     commander of AMVETS\n       ``Senator Wellstone has been a strong and vocal supporter \n     of veterans' issues. His leadership will be missed, and all \n     veterans are grateful for his passionate support over the \n     years.''--Thomas H. Corey, national president of Vietnam \n     Veterans of America\n       ``The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States are \n     stunned and saddened by the untimely death of Senator Paul \n     Wellstone and his family. When it came to advocacy on behalf \n     of America's veterans, he was second to none. He constantly \n     and consistently crusaded and championed for the many issues \n     that were of vital interest to our veteran population. He was \n     tenacious in his efforts to assure passage of legislation \n     that would provide for those veterans suffering from \n     radiation exposure, Gulf War illness and those in need of VA \n     health care. He will be sorely missed. Our veterans have lost \n     a true hero. Our hearts and prayers are with the Wellstone \n     family.''--Ray Sisk, Commander-in-Chief, Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars\n       ``I always knew on Veterans Day that I would see the \n     senator on that day. We would always go out to the veterans \n     hospital. I would be there, and I never had any doubt that \n     when I got there Senator Wellstone would be there. He was a \n     great advocate for veterans and veteran causes and veterans \n     benefits.''--Former Minneosta Governor Jesse Ventura\n       ``The last speech he gave on the Senate floor, I was there. \n     He said, `You can call me soft if you want, but I care about \n     veterans in this country.' That was Paul Wellstone. He is \n     someone that looked out for those who didn't have someone \n     representing them and he wasn't afraid. He traveled a road \n     that was less traveled, but he traveled that road with his \n     shoulders back.''--Sen. Harry Reid\n       ``Paul Wellstone was one of the most courageous men I have \n     ever known. He was a distinguished member of the Senate \n     Veterans Affairs Committee, and he fought hard for those who \n     fought for our country.''--Former Sen. Max Cleland\n       ``Paul and I shared many of the same passions in the \n     Senate. We fought together side by side in the fight to save \n     our steel industry and together we were committed to \n     providing our nation's veterans with the benefits they \n     deserve. That was his style. He took on the toughest battles, \n     the ones that required years of effort and diligence, and he \n     always made a difference.''--Sen. Jay Rockefeller\n       ``Paul was a caring, persistent and passionate advocate for \n     veterans, children, the mentally ill, working families, and \n     all those who too often feel that no one in Washington hears \n     their voice. Paul Wellstone was their voice; he was their \n     champion.''--Sen. Daniel Akaka\n       ``Senator Wellstone believed deeply in causes that \n     transcended political lines, partisanship and ideology. I had \n     the privilege of working with him on legislation to end \n     homelessness among our nation's veterans. In our battle to \n     see this legislation enacted, time and time again we were \n     called up on to confront our own parties and colleagues. Each \n     and every time Paul Wellstone proved that his first concern \n     was to help those less fortunate than himself, even if it put \n     his political career at risk.''--Rep. Christopher Smith\n       ``Paul Wellstone was my closest friend in the Senate. He \n     was the most principled public servant I've ever known. Paul \n     truly had the courage of his convictions and his convictions \n     were based on the principles of hope, compassion, the Good \n     Samaritan, helping those left on the roadside of life. His \n     courage is an example for all.''--Sen. Tom Harkin\n       ``Paul Wellstone was the soul of the Senate. He was one of \n     the most noble and courageous men I have ever known. He was a \n     gallant and passionate fighter, especially for the less \n     fortunate. I am grateful to have known Paul and Sheila as \n     dear and close friends.''--Sen. Tom Daschle\n       ``He didn't look ahead to the next election; he looked \n     ahead to the next generation. The women of the Senate called \n     him our Galahad. He supported us and fought with us for child \n     care, access to health care, and better schools.''--Sen. \n     Barbara Mikulski\n       ``In his public service and private friendship, Paul \n     Wellstone embodied the Hebrew ideal of `tikkun olam,' which \n     means `to repair the world.' He was one of the most \n     passionate and principled people I've ever known. I feel \n     privileged to have worked with him.''--Sen. Joe Lieberman\n       ``Paul Wellstone had a passion for justice that was evident \n     to all of his colleagues. Throughout his life, Paul was a \n     fighter for the good cause. His passion for justice was only \n     matched by his charm, wit and kindness to his political \n     friends and foes alike.''--Sen. John McCain\n       ``He was a man of enormous ability but most of all, he was \n     a caring person. He was really a special person, a very \n     unique man.''--Sen. Ted Kennedy\n       ``He was a model and an inspiration to all of us who \n     followed in his footsteps. He was my close personal friend \n     and political ally for over 20 years. I will miss him \n     terribly.''--Sen. Mark Dayton\n       ``As fellow members of the Senate health and education \n     committee, I saw firsthand how passionate Paul could be on \n     the issues that were important to him. Paul had a remarkable \n     ability to maintain good relations with colleagues with whom \n     he disagreed.''--Sen. Jeff Sessions\n       ``Paul Wellstone was a passionate public servant who was \n     committed to helping average Americans. His enormous energy, \n     determination and passion made him one of our most respected \n     senators. America will miss a great senator, and I will miss \n     a good friend.''Sen. Bill Nelson.\n       ``He unfailingly represented his views eloquently and \n     emphatically. Paul Wellstone was a courageous defender of his \n     beliefs.''--Former Sen. Jesse Helms\n       ``He was the pied piper of modern politics--so many people \n     heard him and wanted to follow him in his fight. His loss is \n     monumental. I loved his passion, his spirit, and his zest for \n     making peoples' lives better. This is sad beyond any \n     words.''--Sen. John Kerry\n       ``His only interest in power was to help the powerless. He \n     was a happy warrior in the tradition of another great \n     Minnesota senator, Hubert Humphrey. He loved people and he \n     loved campaigning.''--Sen. Patrick Leahy\n       ``Paul Wellstone loved politics and never shied away from a \n     fight for what he believed. I admired that quality greatly. \n     We didn't always agree on issues, but we always walked away \n     from the debate as friends. We enjoyed and respected each \n     other. I'll miss him. This is a great loss.''--Sen. Chuck \n     Grassley\n       ``Nothing was trivial to Paul and no person was \n     unimportant. He was a thoughtful, sensitive, and caring with \n     people as he was astute and serious about ideas.''--Sen. Herb \n     Kohl\n       ``The people of Minnesota, America and the world have lost \n     a friend and a champion of working families, the poor, the \n     disenfranchised and the disabled. Paul's public life was a \n     profile in courage. He spoke, stood and voted on his \n     principles, even at the risk of his political career.''--\n     Former President Bill Clinton\n       ``He was a profoundly decent man, a man of principle, a man \n     of conscience. His passing is a loss not only for his family, \n     friends and constituents, but also for friends of the United \n     Nations.''--UN Secretary General Kofi Annan\n       ``Paul Wellstone was a stand-up guy. He used the power of \n     his office for good. His memory will forever be a blessing to \n     all of us who knew him. And his work will continue to be a \n     blessing to countless thousands of people across the globe \n     who never met him, but whose lives will be forever bettered \n     by his work.''--Secretary of State Colin Powell\n       ``He loved his job because it was the best way he could \n     serve the people of his state and his country. To cite one \n     example among many, Paul was by far the biggest and most \n     energetic champion of quality mental health coverage for all \n     Americans who need it. We worked with him closely on this \n     issue and on behalf of the mental health community has \n     passing leaves us with an irreplaceable loss.''--Former Vice \n     President Al Gore\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\n       ``Paul Wellstone was one of the most valiant public \n     servants I have ever known. He had a very good mind, but he \n     also had an honest mind. And he served what be believed in, \n     no matter what the challenge.''--Former President Walter \n     Mondale\n       ``Many noted changes in his manner and method after years \n     in Washington, but not much changed at the core of the man. \n     He remained an idealist and an optimist. He laughed easily, \n     often at himself and his 5-foot-5 stature. He always \n     remembered to thank the cooks and servers at a banquet, and \n     to greet the guards at office doors. He remembered names with \n     a facility that reminded old-timers of Hubert Humphrey. \n     Indeed, Wellstone had Humphrey's zeal for politics, policy \n     and--most of all--people.''--Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1289\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This bill will give municipal utilities additional \nflexibility in refinancing their debts, so they can respond to \nfavorable market conditions. I ask that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objections, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1290\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL ADVANCE REFUNDING OF ELECTRICITY BONDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 149 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to advance refunding) \n     is amended by redesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph (8) \n     and by inserting after paragraph (7) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(7) Special rule for certain electricity bonds.--\n       ``(A) General rule.--In the case of a bond described in \n     subparagraph (B), one additional advance refunding after the \n     date of the enactment of this paragraph shall be allowed \n     under paragraph (3)(A)(i) if the requirements of subparagraph \n     (C) are met.\n       ``(B) Bond described.--A bond is described in this \n     subparagraph if such bond is issued as part of an issue the \n     net proceeds of which are used to finance the costs of \n     electric generation, transmission, or distribution assets \n     owned by the issuer or by a consortium of State or local \n     governments which includes the issuer and which jointly own \n     such assets.\n       ``(C) Requirements.--The requirements of this subparagraph \n     are met with respect to any advance refunding of a bond \n     described in subparagraph (B) if--\n       ``(i) no advance refundings of such bond would be allowed \n     under any provision of law after the date of the enactment of \n     this paragraph,\n       ``(ii) the advance refunding bond is the only other \n     outstanding bond with respect to the refunded bond, and\n       ``(iii) the requirements of section 148 are met with \n     respect to all bonds issued under this subsection.\n       ``(D) Inapplicability to certain bonds.--Subparagraph (A) \n     shall not apply with respect to a bond described in section \n     1400L(e).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to advance refunding bonds issued after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1291. A bill to authorize the President to impose emergency import \nrestrictions on archaeological or ethnological materials of Iraq until \nnormalization of relations between the United States and the Government \nof Iraq has been established; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Emergency \nProtection for Iraqi Cultural Antiquities Act of 2003, the EPIC \nAntiquities Act of 2003. I am pleased that Senator Baucus joins me as \nan original cosponsor of this important legislation. The EPIC \nAntiquities Act of 2003 authorizes the President to impose immediate \nemergency import restrictions on the archaeological and ethnological \nmaterials of Iraq. The purpose of this bill is simple--to close a legal \nloophole which could allow looted Iraqi antiquities to be brought into \nthe United States. Allow me to explain how this might happen.\n  When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August of 1990, former President Bush \nissued Executive Orders 12722 and 12744, which declared a national \nemergency with respect to Iraq. Those orders imposed economic sanctions \nagainst Iraq, including a complete trade embargo which automatically \nprohibited trade in Iraqi antiquities as of that time. The United \nNations Security Council adopted Resolution 661 on August 6, 1990, \nwhich also imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. The sanctions imposed \nunder the Executive Orders are spelled out in the Iraqi Sanctions \nRegulations. These regulations are administered by the Treasury \nDepartment's Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC.\n  Now until recently, the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations continued to \nrestrict trade with Iraq, including trade in Iraqi antiquities. \nHowever, on May 22, 2003, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution \n1483, which lifted most sanctions on Iraq. Resolution 1483 also \nprovided that Member States should establish a prohibition on trade in \narchaeological, cultural, historical, religious, and rare scientific \nitems of Iraq, that may have been illegally removed from the country \nsince the adoption of Resolution 661 back in 1990. On May 23, 2003, \nOFAC implemented UN Resolution 1483 and issued a General License which \nlifted most of our trade sanctions with respect to Iraq. Importantly, \nOFAC's general license continues to ban trade in looted Iraqi \nantiquities. However, this legal structure that is currently in place \nis vulnerable to a potential loophole.\n  It is important to recognize that the legal authority for OFAC's \ncontinuing restrictions on trade in Iraqi antiquities derives from the \nExecutive Orders issued in 1990, which are themselves premised upon the \nexistence of emergency conditions with respect to Iraq. It is possible \nthat once an interim government is in place, the President may \ndetermine that emergency conditions no longer exist with respect to \nIraq and relations between the United States and Iraq will be \nnormalized. At that point, the legal authority for the OFAC \nrestrictions will be terminated. This bill is designed to bridge a \npotential gap in the protections afforded Iraqi antiquities by allowing \nthe President to impose emergency import restrictions without delay. \nThese emergency restrictions would be authorized for an interim period \nto extend beyond any termination of the OFAC restrictions, and would \nremain in place until such time as other, more lengthy, legal \nmechanisms for the protection of cultural antiquities can be completed. \nI will elaborate on these other legal mechanisms in a moment.\n  If Congress does not act to provide the means for establishing the \ninterim ban on trade contained in this bill, the door may be opened to \nimports of looted Iraqi antiquities into the United States. Already the \npress has reported allegations that European auction houses have traded \nin looted Iraqi antiquities. The last thing that we in Congress want to \ndo is to fail to act to prevent trade in looted Iraqi artifacts here in \nthe United States.\n  The stopgap authority in this bill derives from legislation \nimplementing the U.N. Convention on the protection of cultural \nproperty. This bill amends the Convention on Cultural Property \nImplementation Act, Implementation Act, to allow the President to \nimpose immediate emergency import restrictions with respect to Iraqi \nantiquities. The Implementation Act already authorizes the President to \nrestrict imports of cultural antiquities, but there is a somewhat \nlengthy process called for under the Implementation Act before the \nPresident may impose such restrictions. Since we passed the \nImplementation Act in 1983, we have imposed import restrictions on \narchaeological\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\nor ethnological materials from ten countries to assist in the \nprotection of their cultural property.\n  Unfortunately, the Implementation Act does not address the unique \nconditions that prevail in Iraq today. Normally, under the \nImplementation Act a country formally requests that the United States \nprohibit stolen or illegally exported cultural antiquities from \nentering into the United States. The State Department will then publish \na Federal Register notice announcing the request. Following \npublication, a Cultural Property Advisory Committee will investigate \nand review the request and report its recommendation to the President. \nWith the benefit of the Committee's report, the President can then \nproceed to negotiate a bilateral agreement with the foreign country. In \nthe past, this entire process has taken at least a year before import \nrestrictions are put in place.\n  There are two major deficiencies with the current process which \nnecessitate the bill we are introducing today. First, the \nImplementation Act requires a foreign government to make a formal \nrequest to the United States. Right now, there is no Government of Iraq \nto request such a bilateral agreement with the United States. The \nsecond problem is that, even if there were an Iraqi Government in place \nto make such a request, the administrative process called for under the \nImplementation Act just takes too long given the present \ncircumstances--although the extent of looting of museums, libraries, \nand archaeological sites in Iraq may not be as great as was first \nfeared, the fact remains that such looting has occurred and that \nillicit trade in such antiquities could spread if there is even a \ntemporary lifting of import restrictions.\n  Now granted, the Implementation Act does authorize the President to \nimpose emergency import restrictions even before a bilateral agreement \nis finalized. However, before the President can do so, all of the other \nadministrative processes under the Implementation Act must be \ncompleted; this includes a three month period for the preparation of a \nreport to the President by the Cultural Property Advisory Committee. \nAgain, the problem here is that the normal process for imposing even \nemergency import restrictions could take too long.\n  If the Administration were to normalize relations between the United \nStates and the next Government of Iraq, thereby terminating the OFAC \nimport restrictions, it is possible that looted Iraqi antiquities could \nbegin entering the United States while we sit and wait for a possible \nbilateral agreement to be finalized. The EPIC Antiquities Act of 2003 \nsolves this problem. This legislation provides a uniquely and narrowly \ntailored amendment to the Implementation Act which closes the potential \nlegal loophole between the time when relations are normalized and the \ntime when we can undertake and complete the normal processes for the \nprotection of cultural antiquities contained in the Implementation Act.\n  By extending the President's authority under the Implementation Act \nfor an interim period, this bill is narrowly designed to meet the \nunique circumstances in Iraq today. The EPIC Antiquities Act of 2003 \nprovides that this extension of the President's authority will \nterminate one year after relations are normalized, or by September 30, \n2004, so that the next Iraqi Government can determine for itself \nwhether to seek a bilateral agreement with the United States, and if \nso, the President can negotiate such an agreement with the benefit of \ninput from the Cultural Property Advisory Committee--as envisioned by \nthe Implementation Act. In short, our bill does not seek to supplant \nthe established process for protecting cultural antiquities under the \nImplementation Act; instead, it permits an extra guarantee of \nprotection for Iraq's cultural antiquities in the short term while Iraq \ncompletes its transition back into the community of nations.\n  I thank Senator Baucus for his support, and I hope our colleagues can \nalso support this important and timely bill. I hope we are able to move \nthis legislation quickly, perhaps as part of the Miscellaneous Trade \nand Technical Corrections Act of 2003, which is waiting for full Senate \napproval.\n  As we work to reestablish the free flow of trade with a liberated \nIraq, I believe it is very important that we in Congress remain mindful \nof the need to take steps to protect Iraq's cultural heritage. Our bill \nwill ensure that going forward we continue to adhere to the full spirit \nof Resolution 1483 and avoid any break in the protections afforded to \nIraqi antiquities. Our bill also provides an important signal of our \ncommitment to preserving Iraq's resources for the benefit of the Iraqi \npeople. It is time to close the potential gap in protections, and pass \nthe EPIC Antiquities Act of 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Protection for \n     Iraqi Cultural Antiquities Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EMERGENCY IMPLEMENTATION OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The President may exercise the authority of \n     the President under section 304 of the Convention on Cultural \n     Property Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 2603) with respect to \n     any archaeological or ethnological material of Iraq as if \n     Iraq were a State Party under that Act, except that, in \n     exercising such authority, subsection (c) of such section \n     shall not apply.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``archaeological \n     or ethnological material of Iraq'' means cultural property of \n     Iraq and other items of archaeological, historical, cultural, \n     rare scientific, or religious importance illegally removed \n     from the Iraq National Museum, the National Library of Iraq, \n     and other locations in Iraq, since the adoption of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 661 of 1990.\n\n     SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.\n\n       The authority of the President under section 2 shall \n     terminate upon the earlier of--\n       (1) the date that is 12 months after the date on which the \n     President certifies to Congress that normalization of \n     relations between the United States and the Government of \n     Iraq has been established; or\n       (2) September 30, 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1292. A bill to establish a servitude and emancipation archival \nresearch clearinghouse in the National Archives; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today on the 138th anniversary of \nthe day that Major General Gordon Granger and his Union soldiers \narrived in Galveston, TX. They brought the news that the war had ended \nand that the enslaved were now free. Since its origin in 1865, the \nobservance of June 19th as African American Emancipation Day, or \nJuneteenth, is the oldest known celebration of the ending of slavery.\n  It took two and a half years after the effective date of the \nEmancipation Proclamation set forth by President Lincoln for the news \nof freedom to arrive in Texas. Of course, this kind of delay in finding \nout about new national policy, especially a bold new initiative set \nforth by Executive Order, would be absurd in our present society. We \nare now part of the information age and access to the most up-to-date \nnews is commonplace. Unfortunately, African Americans who attempt to \ntrace their genealogy face undue delay in obtaining the necessary \ndocuments to try and piece together their unique heritage. For this \nreason, I am proposing the Servitude and Emancipation Archival Research \nClearinghouse, SEARCH, Act of 2003. This bill establishes a national \ndatabase within the National Archives and Records Administration, NARA, \nhousing various documents that would assist those in search of a \nhistory that because of slavery, can not easily be found in the most \ncommonly searched registered and census records.\n  Traditionally, someone researching their genealogy would try looking \nup wills and land deeds; however, enslaved African Americans were \nprohibited from owning property. In fact, African Americans were \nconsidered property, so the name of former slave owners would have to \nbe identified with the hopes that the owner kept record of pertinent \ninformation, such as births and deaths. In most cases, If records \nexist, many African Americans were not associated with last names, thus \nmaking them more difficult to trace. With slaves not being listed by \nname, this also precludes the use of the most popular and major source \nof genealogical research, the United States\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\nCensus. Even the use of letters, diaries, and other first-person \nrecordings of slave simply do not exist because slaves could not \nlegally learn to read or write.\n  We may think after 1865, African Americans could then begin to use \ntraditional genealogical records like voter registrations and school \nrecords. However, African Americans did not immediately begin to \nparticipate in may of the privileges of citizenship, including voting \nand attending school. Discrimination meant the prevention of African \nAmerican siting on juries or owning businesses. Segregation meant \nsegregated neighborhoods, schools, churches, clubs, and fraternal \norganizations. Therefore, many of the records were also segregated. For \nexample, some telephone directories in South Carolina did not include \nAfrican Americans in the regular alphabetical listing, but at the end \nof the book. An African American must maneuver these distinctive \nnuances in order to conduct proper genealogical research. In my own \nState of Louisiana, descendants of the 9th Calvary Regiment and the \n25th Infantry Regiment, known as the Buffalo Soldiers, would have to \nknow to look in the index of the United States Colored Troops and not \nthe index of the State Military Regiments.\n  Abraham Lincoln said, ``a man who cares nothing about his past can \ncare little about his future.'' In 1965, Alex Haley stumbled upon the \nnames of his maternal great-grandparents while going through post-Civil \nWar records at the National Archives here in Washington, D.C. This \ndiscovery led to an 11-year journey that resulted in the milestone of \nliterary history, Roots. By providing $5 million for the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission to establish and \nmaintain a national database, the SEARCH Act proposes to significantly \nreduce the time and painstaking efforts of those African Americans who \ntruly care about their American past, and care enough to contribute to \nthe American future. This bill also seeks to authorize $5 million for \nStates, colleges, and universities to preserve, catalogue, and index \nrecords locally.\n  In a democracy, records matter. The mission of NARA is to ensure that \nanyone can have access to the records that matter to them. The SEARCH \nAct of 2003 helps to fulfill that mission by helping African Americans \nto navigate the genealogical process, given the circumstances unique to \nthe African American experience. No longer should any American have to \nwait to find out about information leading to freedom.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating Juneteenth this year \nby passing this measure, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1292\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Servitude and Emancipation \n     Archival Research ClearingHouse Act of 2003'' or the ``SEARCH \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF DATABASE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Archivist of the United States shall \n     establish, as a part of the National Archives, a national \n     database consisting of historic records of servitude and \n     emancipation in the United States to assist African Americans \n     in researching their genealogy.\n       (b) Maintenance.--The database established by this Act \n     shall be maintained by the National Historical Publications \n     and Records Commission.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated--\n       (1) $5,000,000 to establish the national database \n     authorized by this Act; and\n       (2) $5,000,000 to provide grants to States and colleges and \n     universities to preserve local records of servitude and \n     emancipation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Hatch (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 1293. A bill to criminalize the sending of predatory and abusive \ne-mail; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, with Senators Leahy, \nSchumer, Grassley, Feinstein, DeWine, and Edwards, the Criminal Spam \nAct of 2003. This legislation, which enjoys bipartisan support, targets \nthe most egregious types of spammers--those who hijack computer systems \nand those who use other fraudulent means to send unsolicited commercial \nelectronic mail.\n  Over the course of the past several years, the amount of unsolicited \ncommercial email, or spam, has grown at an exponential rate. During a \nrecent Senate hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, Brightmail Inc., a provider of spam filtering software \nthat serves six of the ten largest U.S. Internet service providers, \nestimated that in April 2003, 46 percent of all email traffic was spam. \nThis figure represented a nearly five fold increase in spam in merely \n18 months. At the same hearing, America Online testified that on any \ngiven day, it blocks approximately 2.3 billion spam messages.\n  This tremendous growth rate is due in large part to sophisticated \nspammers who use abusive tactics to send millions of email messages \nquickly, at an extremely low cost. By using deceptive methods, these \nspammers conceal their identities, evade Internet service provider \nfilters, and exploit the Internet by advertising and promoting \npornographic web sites, illegally pirated software, questionable health \nproducts, pyramid schemes and other ``get rich quick'' or ``make money \nfast'' scams. The extraordinary volume of spam generated by their \nschemes imposes significant costs on Internet users, threatens to \ndisrupt Internet services, and undermines the public's confidence in \nonline commerce.\n  A recent study conducted by the Federal Trade Commission demonstrates \nthe alarming frequency with which spammers are using the Internet to \nconceal their true identities and the electronic paths of their \nmessages. This study found that 40 percent of email messages contain \nindicia of falsity in the body of the message; approximately 33 percent \ncontain indicia of falsity in the ``from'' lines of the spam; 22 \npercent contain indicia of falsity in the ``subject'' line; and some 66 \npercent contain at least one form of deception.\n  The Criminal Spam Act of 2003 targets fraudulent and deceptive spam \nby enhancing the ability of federal law enforcement authorities to \nprosecute and punish the most egregious wrongdoers. Specifically, the \nAct makes it a crime to hack into a computer, or to use a computer \nsystem that the owner has made available for other purposes, as a \nconduit for bulk commercial email. The Act also prohibits sending bulk \ncommercial email that conceals the true source, destination, routing or \nauthentication information of the email, or is generated from multiple \nemail accounts or domain names that falsify the identity of the actual \nregistrant.\n  The Act subjects violators to stiff criminal penalties of up to 5 \nyears' imprisonment where the offense is committed in furtherance of \nany felony, or where the defendant has previously been convicted of a \nsimilar Federal or state offense, and up to 3 years' imprisonment where \nother aggravating factors exist. It also contains criminal forfeiture \nprovisions and directs the Sentencing Commission to consider \nenhancements for offenders who obtain email addresses through illegal \nmeans, such as harvesting.\n  The strong deterrent effect of the legislation is further enhanced by \ncivil enforcement provisions that authorize the Department of Justice \nand aggrieved Internet service providers to bring suit for violations \nof the Act. In appropriate cases, courts may grant injunctive relief, \nimpose civil fines, and award damages of up to $25,000 per day of \nviolation, or between $2 and $8 per email initiated in violation of the \nAct.\n  Recognizing that spammers can send their fraudulent and deceptive \nmessages from any location in the world, the Act directs the Department \nof Justice and the Department of State to work through international \nfora to gain the cooperation of other countries in investigating and \nprosecuting spammers worldwide and to report to Congress about their \nefforts and any recommendations for addressing international predatory \nspam.\n  The Criminal Spam Act represents an important legislative step toward \ncurbing predatory and abusive commercial email. However, broader \nlegislative measures, coupled with technological\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\nsolutions, are also needed. Any effective solution to the spam problem \nrequires cooperative efforts between the government and the private \nsector, as well as the assistance of our international partners.\n  Recent years have witnessed extraordinary technological advances. \nThese innovations, and electronic communications in particular, have \nsignificantly increased the efficiencies, productivity and conveniences \nof our modern world. The abusive practices of fraudulent spammers \nthreaten to choke the lifeblood of the electronic age. This is a \nproblem that warrants swift but deliberative legislative action. I am \ncommitted to working with my colleagues in both Houses to address the \nspam problem on all fronts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                          SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This bill may be cited as the ``Criminal Spam Act of \n     2003''.\n\n\n   SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST PREDATORY AND ABUSIVE COMMERCIAL EMAIL\n\n       This section targets the four principal techniques that \n     spammers use to evade filtering software and hide their \n     trails. It creates a new federal crime that prohibits hacking \n     into a computer, or using a computer system that the owner \n     has made available for other purposes, to send bulk \n     commercial email. It also prohibits sending bulk commercial \n     email that either conceals the true source, destination, \n     routing and authentication information of the email, or is \n     generated from multiple email accounts or domain names that \n     falsify the identity of the actual registrant. Penalties \n     range from up to 5 years' imprisonment where the offense was \n     committed in furtherance of any felony, or where the \n     defendant was previously convicted of a similar federal or \n     state offense, and up to 3 years' imprisonment where other \n     aggravating factors exist. The U.S. Sentencing Commission is \n     directed to consider sentencing enhancements for offenders \n     who obtained email addresses through improper means, such as \n     harvesting.\n       In addition, this section provides for civil enforcement by \n     the Department of Justice and aggrieved Internet service \n     providers against spammers who engage in the conduct \n     described above. In appropriate cases, courts may grant \n     injunctive relief, impose civil penalties, and award damages.\n\n\n   SEC. 3. REPORT AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INTERNATIONAL SPAM.\n\n       Recognizing that an effective solution to the spam problem \n     requires the cooperation and assistance of our international \n     partners, this section asks the Administration to work \n     through international fora to gain the cooperation of other \n     countries in investigating and prosecuting spammers \n     worldwide, and to report to Congress about its efforts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing, with \nSenators Hatch, Schumer, Grassley, Feinstein, DeWine, and Edwards, the \nCriminal Spam Act of 2003. This bill is designed to counter the most \nobjectionable forms of email marketing. In an effort to clear \nelectronic channels for legitimate communications, the bill targets \nthose spammers who deceive Internet Service Providers, ``ISPs'', and \nemail recipients into thinking that messages come from someone other \nthan a spammer--a ploy many spammers use to increase the likelihood \nthat their unwanted ads will evade filtering software and be opened.\n  Without a doubt, spam is a serious problem today, one that is \nthreatening to undermine the vast potential of the Internet to foster \nthe free exchange of information and commerce. Businesses and \nindividuals currently wade through tremendous amounts of spam in order \nto access email that is of relevance to them--and this is after ISPs, \nbusinesses, and individuals have spent time and money blocking a large \npercentage of spam from reaching its intended recipients.\n  Email users are having the online equivalent of the experience of the \nwoman in the Monty Python skit, who seeks to order a spam-free \nbreakfast at a restaurant. Try as she might, she cannot get the \nwaitress to bring her the meal she desires. Every dish in the \nrestaurant comes with Spam; it's just a matter of how much. There's \n``egg, bacon and Spam''; ``egg, bacon, sausage and Spam''; ``Spam, \nbacon, sausage and Spam''; ``Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam''; \n``Spam, sausage, Spam, Spam, Spam, bacon, Spam, tomato and Spam''; and \nso on. Exasperated, the woman finally cries out: ``I don't like Spam! . \n. . I don't want ANY Spam!''\n  Individuals and businesses are reacting similarly to electronic spam. \nA Harris poll taken late last year found that 80 percent of respondents \nview spam as ``very annoying,'' and fully 74 percent of respondents \nfavor making mass spamming illegal. They are fed up.\n  ISPs are doing their best to shield customers from spam, blocking \nbillions of spam each day, but the spammers are winning the battle. \nMillions of unwanted, unsolicited commercial emails are received by \nAmerican businesses and individuals each day, despite their own, \nadditional filtering efforts. A recent study by Ferris Research \nestimates that spam costs U.S. businesses $8.9 billion annually as a \nresult of lost productivity and the need to purchase more powerful \nservers and additional bandwidth; to configure and run spam filters; \nand to provide help-desk support for spam recipients. The costs of spam \nare significant to individuals as well, including time spent \nidentifying and deleting spam, inadvertently opening spam, installing \nand maintaining anti-spam filters, tracking down legitimate messages \nmistakenly deleted by spam filters, and paying for the ISPs' blocking \nefforts.\n  And there are other less prominent but equally important costs of \nspam. It may introduce viruses, worms, and Trojan Horses into personal \nand business computer systems, including those that support our \nnational infrastructure. It is also fertile ground for deceptive trade \npractices. The FTC recently estimated that 96 percent of the spam \ninvolving investment and business opportunities, and nearly half of the \nspam advertising health services and products, and travel and leisure, \ncontains false or misleading information.\n  This rampant deception has the potential to undermine Americans' \ntrust of valid information on the Internet. Indeed, it has already \ncaused some Americans to refrain from using the Internet to the extent \nthat they otherwise would. For example, some have chosen not to \nparticipate in public discussion forums, and are hesitant to provide \ntheir addresses in legitimate business transactions, for fear that \ntheir email addresses will be harvested for junk email lists. And they \nare right to be concerned. The FTC found spam arriving at its computer \nsystem just nine minutes after posting an email address in an online \nchat room.\n  At a recent FTC forum on spam, experts agreed that the issue is ripe \nfor Federal action. Some 30 States now have anti-spam laws, but the \nnature of email makes it difficult to discern where any given piece of \nspam originated, and, thus, what State has jurisdiction and what State \nlaw applies. This may explain why spammers continue to flout State \nlaws. For example, several States require that spam begin the subject \nline with ``ADV,'' but the FTC has found that only 2 percent of spam \ncontains this label.\n  Technology will undoubtedly play a key role in fighting spam. \nHowever, a technological solution to the problem is not predicted in \nthe foreseeable future. In addition, given the adroitness with which \nspammers adapt to anti-spam technologies, the development and \nimplementation of technological fixes to spam entail constant vigilance \nand substantial financial investment. This raises the question: Why \nshould individuals and businesses be forced to invest large amounts of \ntime and money in buying, installing, and maintaining generation after \ngeneration of anti-spam technologies?\n  I have often said that the government should regulate the Internet \nonly when absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, spammers have caused \nthis to be one of those times. Congress needs to address the spam \nproblem quickly and prudently, and the Criminal Spam Act, by targeting \nthe most injurious types of spam, is a good start.\n  The bill that Senator Hatch and I introduce today would prohibit the \nfour principal techniques that spammers use to evade filtering software \nand hide their trails.\n  First, our bill would prohibit hacking into another person's computer \nsystem and sending bulk spam from or through that system. This would \ncriminalize the common spammer technique of obtaining access to other \npeople's email accounts on an ISP's email network, whether by password \ntheft or by inserting a ``Trojan horse'' program--that is, a program \nthat unsuspecting users\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\ndownload onto their computers and that then takes control of those \ncomputers--to send bulk spam.\n  Second, the bill would prohibit using a computer system that the \nowner makes available for other purposes as a conduit for bulk spam, \nwith the intent of deceiving recipients as to the spam's origins. This \nprohibition would criminalize another common spammer technique--the \nabuse of third parties' ``open'' servers, such as email servers that \nhave the capability to relay mail, or Web proxy servers that have the \nability to generate ``form'' mail. Spammers commandeer these servers to \nsend bulk commercial email without the server owner's knowledge, either \nby ``relaying'' their email through an ``open'' email server, or by \nabusing an ``open'' Web proxy server's capability to generate form \nemails as a means to originate spam, thereby exceeding the owner's \nauthorization for use of that email or Web server. In some instances \nthe hijacked servers are even completely shut down as a result of tens \nof thousands of undeliverable messages generated from the spammer's \nemail list.\n  The bill's third prohibition targets another way that outlaw spammers \nevade ISP filters: falsifying the ``header information'' that \naccompanies every email, and sending bulk spam containing that fake \nheader information. More specifically, the bill prohibits forging \ninformation regarding the origin of the email message, the route \nthrough which the message attempted to penetrate the ISP filters, and \ninformation authenticating the user as a ``trusted sender'' who abides \nby appropriate consumer protection rules. The last type of forgery will \nbe particularly important in the future, as ISPs and legitimate \nmarketers develop ``white list'' rules whereby emailers who abide by \nself-regulatory codes of good practices will be allowed to send email \nto users without being subject to anti-spamming filters. There is \ncurrently substantial interest among marketers and email service \nproviders in ``white list'' technology solutions to spam. However, such \n``white list'' systems would be useless if outlaw spammers are allowed \nto counterfeit the authentication mechanisms used by legitimate \nemailers.\n  Fourth and finally, the Criminal Spam Act prohibits registering for \nmultiple email accounts or Internet domain names, and sending bulk \nemail from those accounts or domains. This provision targets deceptive \n``account churning,'' a common outlaw spammer technique that works as \nfollows. The spammer registers, usually by means of an automatic \ncomputer program, for large numbers of email accounts or domain names, \nusing false registration information, then sends bulk spam from one \naccount or domain after another. This technique stays ahead of ISP \nfilters by hiding the source, size, and scope of the sender's mailings, \nand prevents the email account provider or domain name registrar from \nidentifying the registrant as a spammer and denying his registration \nrequest. Falsifying registration information for domain names also \nviolates a basic contractual requirement for domain name registration.\n  Penalties for violations of these provisions are tough but measured. \nRecidivists and those who send spam in furtherance of another felony \nmay be imprisoned for up to five years. Large-volume spammers, those \nwho hack into another person's computer system to send bulk spam, and \nspam ``kingpins'' who use others to operate their spamming operations \nmay be imprisoned for up to three years. Other offenders may be fined \nand imprisoned for no more than one year. Convicted offenders are also \nsubject to forfeiture of proceeds and instrumentalities of the offense.\n  In addition to these criminal penalties, offenders are also subject \nto civil enforcement actions, which may be brought by either the \nDepartment of Justice or by an ISP. Civil remedies are important as a \nsupplement to criminal enforcement for several reasons. First, bringing \ncases against outlaw spammers is very resource intensive because of the \nextensive forensic work involved in building a case; providing for \ncivil enforcement will allow ISPs to assemble evidence to make \nprosecutors' jobs easier. Second, although criminal prosecutions are a \ncritical deterrent against the most egregious spammers, the Justice \nDepartment is unlikely to prosecute all outlaw spam cases; civil \nenforcement, backed by strong financial penalties, will serve as a \nsecond layer of deterrence. Third, criminal penalties may not be \nappropriate in all cases, as for example in the case of teenagers hired \nby professional outlaw spammers to send out email for them; civil \nenforcement gives the Justice Department a more complete and refined \nrange of tools to address specific outlaw spam problems.\n  That describes the main provisions of our bill. In addition, because \ncommercial email can be, and is being, sent from all over the world \ninto the virtual mailboxes of Americans, the bill directs the \nAdministration to report on its efforts to achieve international \ncooperation in the investigation and prosecution of outlaw spammers.\n  Again, the purpose of the Criminal Spam Act is to deter the most \npernicious and unscrupulous types of spammers--those who use trickery \nand deception to induce others to relay and view their messages. \nRidding America's inboxes of deceptively delivered spam will \nsignificantly advance our fight against junk email. But the Criminal \nSpam Act is not a cure-all for the spam pandemic.\n  The fundamental problem inherent to spam--its sheer volume--may well \npersist even in the absence of fraudulent routing information and false \nidentities. In a recent survey, 82 percent of respondents considered \nunsolicited bulk email, even from legitimate businesses, to be \nunwelcome spam. Given this public opinion, and in light of the fact \nthat spam is, in essence, cost-shifted advertising, it may be wise to \ntake a broader approach to our fight against spam.\n  One approach that has achieved substantial support is to require all \ncommercial email to include an ``opt out'' mechanism, that is, a \nmechanism for consumers to opt out of receiving further unwanted spam. \nAt the recent FTC forum, several experts expressed concerns about this \napproach, which permits spammers to send at least one piece of spam to \neach email address in their database, while placing the burden on email \nrecipients to respond. People who receive dozens, even hundreds, of \nunwanted emails each day would have little time or energy for anything \nother than opting-out from unwanted spam.\n  According to one organization's calculations, if just one percent of \nthe approximately 24 million small businesses in the U.S. sent every \nAmerican just one spam a year, that would amount to over 600 pieces of \nspam for each person to sift through and opt-out of each day. And this \nfigure may be conservative, as it does not include the large businesses \nthat also engage in on-line advertising.\n  A second possible approach to spam--a national ``Do Not Spam'' \nregistry--raises a different but no less difficult set of concerns. The \ntwo FTC Commissioners who testified last month at the Senate Commerce \nCommittee's hearing on spam both questioned the potential of a national \nregistry to alleviate the spam problem. Although this approach would \nplace a smaller burden on consumers than would an opt-out system, it \nwould entail immense costs, complexity, and delay, all of which work in \nthe spammers' favor.\n  A third way of attacking spam--and one that was favored by many \npanelists and audience members at the FTC forum--is to establish an \nopt-in system, whereby bulk commercial email may only be sent to \nindividuals and businesses who have invited or consented to it. This \napproach has strong precedent in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act \nof 1991, TCPA, which Congress passed to eliminate similar cost-\nshifting, interference, and privacy problems associated with \nunsolicited commercial faxes. The TCPA's ban on faxes containing \nunsolicited advertisements has withstood First Amendment challenges in \nthe courts, and was adopted by the European Union in July 2002.\n  I have discussed three possible approaches to the spam problem, and \nthere are several others, some of which have already been codified in \nstate law. I encourage the consideration of all these anti-spam \napproaches in the weeks and months to come.\n  Reducing the volume of junk commercial email, and so protecting \nlegitimate Internet communications, will\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\nnot be easy. There are important First Amendment interests to consider, \nas well as the need to preserve the ability of legitimate marketers to \nuse email responsibly. If Congress does act, it must get it right, so \nas not to exacerbate an already terribly vexing problem.\n  The Criminal Spam Act is a first step in countering spam. If we can \nshut down the spammers who use deception to evade filters and confuse \nconsumers, we will give the next generation of anti-spam technologies a \nchance to do their work. Our bill targets the most egregious offenders, \nit provides a much-needed federal cause of action, and it allows the \nstates to continue to serve as a ``laboratory'' for tough anti-spamming \nregulation. I urge its speedy enactment into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1294. A bill to authorize grants for community telecommunications \ninfrastructure planning and market development, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp rural and underserved communities across the country get connected \nto the information economy.\n  Today I am introducing the Community Telecommunication Planning Act \nof 2003. I am proud to have Senators Boxer, Cantwell, Kennedy, Leahy, \nand Pryor as original cosponsors. This bill will give small and rural \ncommunities a new tool to attract high speed services and economic \ndevelopment.\n  Representative Inslee from my home State, along with several other \nmembers, will soon introduce a companion bill in the House. I \nappreciate him working with me to meet this challenge.\n  I am especially proud of how this legislation came about. For the \nlast four years, I've been working with a group of community leaders in \nWashington State to find ways to help communities get connected to \nadvanced telecommunications services.\n  I want to take a moment to thank the members of my Rural \nTelecommunication Working Group for their hard work on this bill. The \nmembers include: Brent Bahrenburg, Gregg Caudell, Dee Christensen, Dave \nDanner, Louis Fox, Tami Garrow, Larry Hall, Rod Fleck, Ray King, Dale \nKing, Terry Lawhead, Dick Llarman, Jim Lowery, Jim Miller, Joe Poire, \nSkye Richendrfer, Ted Sprague, Jim Schmit, and Ron Yenney.\n  We met as a working group, and we held forums around the State that \nattracted hundreds of people. We've tapped the ideas of experts, \nservice providers and people from across the State who are working to \nget their communities connected. The result is this legislation, which \nI am proud to say is part of Washington State's contribution to our \nnational effort to connect all parts of our country to the Internet.\n  The bill was originally introduced in the 107th Congress. I was able \nto attach a version of it to the Farm Bill. Unfortunately, the \nprovision was removed during Conference.\n  This bill addresses a real need in many communities. While urban and \nsuburban areas have strong competition between telecommunications \nproviders, many small and rural communities are far removed from the \nservices they need.\n  We must ensure that all communities have access to advanced \ntelecommunications like high speed internet access and the wireless \nInternet. Just as yesterday's infrastructure was built of roads and \nbridges, today our infrastructure includes advanced telecom services.\n  Advanced telecommunications can enrich our lives through activities \nlike distance-learning, and they can even save lives through efforts \nlike telemedicine. The key is access. Access to these services is \nalready turning some small companies in rural communities into \ninternational marketers of goods and services.\n  Unfortunately, many small and rural communities are having trouble \ngetting the access they need. Before communities can take advantage of \nsome of the help and incentives that are out there, they need to work \ntogether and got through a community planning process. Community plans \nidentify the needs and level of demand, create a vision for the future, \nand show what all the players must do to meet the telecom needs of \ntheir community for today and tomorrow. These plans take resources to \ndevelop, and my bill would provide those funds.\n  Providers say they're more likely to invest in an area if it has a \nplan that makes a business case for the costly infrastructure \ninvestment. Communities want to provide them with that plan, but they \nneed help developing it. Unfortunately, many communities get struck on \nthat first step. They don't have the resources to do the studies and \nplanning required to attract service. So the members of my Working \nGroup came up with a solution: have the Federal Government provide \ncompetitive grants that local communities can use to develop their \nplans. I took that idea and put it into this bill.\n  After determining what services they need, communities must then go \nout and make a market case to providers. That is why I've added \n``market development'' to the list of allowable uses of grant funding.\n  While this bill deals with new technology, it's really just an \nextension of the infrastructure support the federal government \ntraditionally provides to communities.\n  The Federal Government already provides money to help communities \nplan other infrastructure improvements--everything from roads and \nbridges to wastewater facilities. Because today's economic \ninfrastructure includes advanced telecom services, I believe the \nFederal Government should provide similar support for local technology \ninfrastructure.\n  In summary, this bill would provide rural and underserved communities \nwith grant money for creating community plans, technical assessments \nand other analytical work, and it would allow these communities to use \nthe funding to market these plans to providers.\n  With these grants, communities will be able to turn their desire for \naccess into real access that can improve their communities and \nstrengthen their economies. This bill can open the door for thousands \nof small and rural areas across our country to tap the potential of the \ninformation economy.\n  I urge the Senate to support this bill, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to see it passed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1294\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Telecommunications \n     Planning Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COMMUNITY TELECOMMUNICATIONS PLANNING GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Authority To Make Grants.--Each Secretary concerned \n     may, using amounts authorized to be appropriated by the \n     applicable paragraph of subsection (g), make grants to \n     eligible entities described in subsection (b) for the \n     community telecommunications infrastructure planning and \n     market development purposes described in subsection (c).\n       (b) Eligible Entities.--An entity eligible for a grant \n     under this section is any local or tribal government, local \n     non-profit entity, cooperative, public utility, or other \n     public entity that proposes to use the amount of the grant \n     for the community telecommunications infrastructure planning \n     and market development purposes described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Community Telecommunications Infrastructure Planning \n     and Market Development.--Amounts from a grant made under this \n     section shall be used for purposes of facilitating the \n     development of a telecommunications infrastructure and market \n     development plan for a locality by various means, including--\n       (1) by encouraging the involvement in the development of \n     the plan of interested elements of the community concerned, \n     including the business community, governments, \n     telecommunications providers, and secondary and, where \n     applicable, post-secondary educational institutions and their \n     students;\n       (2) by enhancing the focus of the development of the plan \n     on a wide range of telecommunications needs in the community \n     concerned, including needs relating to local business, \n     education, health care, and government;\n       (3) by enhancing the identification of a wide range of \n     potential solutions for such needs through advanced \n     telecommunications infrastructure; and\n       (4) by any other means that the Secretary concerned \n     considers appropriate.\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\n       (d) Grant Priority for Planning for Rural and Underserved \n     Areas.--In making grants under this section, each Secretary \n     concerned shall give priority to eligible entities that \n     propose to use the grants for community telecommunications \n     infrastructure planning and market development for rural \n     areas or underserved areas.\n       (e) Administration.--Each Secretary concerned shall \n     establish such administrative requirements for grants under \n     this section, including requirements for applications for \n     such grants, as such Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Rural area.--The term ``rural area'' means any county \n     having a population density of less than 300 people per \n     square mile as determined in the 2000 decennial census.\n       (2) Secretary concerned.--The term ``Secretary concerned'' \n     means each of the following:\n       (A) The Secretary of Commerce.\n       (B) The Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (C) The Secretary of Education.\n       (3) Underserved area.--The term ``underserved area'' means \n     any census tract as determined in the 2000 decennial census \n     which is located in--\n       (A) an empowerment zone or enterprise community designated \n     under section 1391 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n       (B) the District of Columbia Enterprise Zone established \n     under section 1400 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n       (C) a renewal community designated under section 1400E of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or\n       (D) a low-income community designated under section 45D of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (g) Authorizations of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated for purposes of making grants under this \n     section--\n       (1) for the Department of Commerce--\n       (A) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2004; and\n       (B) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2005 and \n     each subsequent fiscal year;\n       (2) for the Department of Agriculture--\n       (A) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2004; and\n       (B) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2005 and \n     each subsequent fiscal year; and\n       (3) for the Department of Education--\n       (A) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2004; and\n       (B) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2005 and \n     each subsequent fiscal year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Talent):\n  S. 1297. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, with respect \nto the jurisdiction of Federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court \nover certain cases and controversies involving the Pledge of Allegiance \nto the Flag; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce today the ``Protect the \nPledge Act of 2003.'' The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag has been an \nintegral part of this Nation's identity since its early days. It was \nfirst written by a Baptist minister in 1892 as part of the \ncommemoration of the 400th Anniversary of the discovery of America. For \nover a century, children and adults have recited this Pledge in \nschools, in government and military ceremonies, and on other formal \noccasions. It represents a promise of loyalty to the Flag itself, to \nthe country it represents, and to the government that unites all fifty \nstates. Perhaps more importantly, for many people, its recitation \nrepresents as essential element of what it means to be an American.\n  In United States v. Newdow, the Ninth Circuit jeopardized the \nintegrity of the Pledge of Allegiance. It held that a school district's \npolicy of teacher-led recitation of the Pledge violates the First \nAmendment Establishment Cause because it includes the phrase ``under \nGod.'' This decision is simply wrong. It claims that the American flag \nsymbolizes monotheism. It does no such thing. The Pledge represents our \ncountry, our independence, our government--simply, it represents \nliberty and justice for all. While the phrase ``under God'' undeniably \nhas some religious connotation, it is a term of art with de minimus \ntheological significance. It is not intended to establish a national \nreligion or to prohibit the free exercise of religious beliefs. The \nthirty-one words of the Pledge of Allegiance, however, are worthy of \nreverence and respect. To eliminate the phrase ``under God'' would be \nequivalent to depicting the flag with forty-nine stars or twelve \nstripes. It changes the constitution of our American identity.\n  The ``Protect the Pledge Act of 2003'' prevents further judicial \nencroachment by eliminating federal jurisdiction of claims that the \nrecitation of the Pledge violates the First Amendment. By passing this \nlegislation, Congress is exercising its Constitutional duty to preserve \nthe separation of powers. When the judiciary has oversteps its \nboundaries, as it has done in Newdow, Congress must act to protect the \nsanctity of the Pledge of Allegiance. This bill represents a reasoned \nresponse to Newdow. By limiting its scope to federal jurisdiction, it \nleaves open a potential remedy in state court, thereby obviating any \ndue process concerns.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues in both Houses will work \nexpeditiously, on a bi-partisan basis, to enact this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1297\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect the Pledge Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. JURISDICTION LIMITATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 99 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1632. Jurisdiction limitation\n\n       ``No court established by Act of Congress shall have \n     jurisdiction to hear or determine any claim that the \n     recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag (`I pledge \n     allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and \n     to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, \n     indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.') violates the \n     first article of amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 99 of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``1632. Jurisdiction limitation.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1298. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 to ensure the humane slaughter of non-ambulatory livestock, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Downed Animal \nProtection Act, a bill to provide for the humane treatment, handling, \nand euthanasia of non-ambulatory, downed, livestock unable to stand or \nwalk unassisted.\n  Farm animals such as cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and \nother equines that are too severely distressed and sick to move without \nassistance are often not handled humanely. Due to the extra effort and \ncost to individually feed and water non-ambulatory livestock, these \nanimals routinely endure very poor conditions. In most cases, the level \nof suffering of downed animals is so severe that the most humane \nsolution is to euthanize them as soon as possible. It is important to \nnote that non-ambulatory livestock comprise a tiny fraction, less than \none percent, of all animals at stockyards.\n  The humane euthanasia of non-ambulatory livestock would also protect \nhuman health. Many of the downed animals that survive in the stockyard \nare slaughtered for human consumption. A large majority of these non-\nambulatory animals are contaminated with fecal matter, the main cause \nof Salmonella. U.S. citizen groups, such as the Parents of Sickened \nChildren, have called for improved regulations to stop sickness and \ndeath from preventable diseases like Salmonella.\n  I commend responsible and conscientious livestock organizations and \nproducers such as the United Stockyards Corporation, the Minnesota \nLivestock Marketing Association, the National Pork Producers Council, \nthe Colorado Cattlemen's Association, and the Independent Cattlemen's \nAssociation of Texas for their efforts to address the issue of downed \nanimals. However, the need for stronger legislation to ensure that non-\nambulatory animals do not enter our food chain is evident, particularly \nwith the recent discovery of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy BSE, in \nCanada.\n  The Downed Animal Protection Act will remove the incentive for \nsending non-ambulatory livestock to stockyards, thereby reducing the \nrisk that these animals will be processed for human consumption and \ndiscouraging their inhumane treatment at farms and ranches. My bill \nwill complement the industry's current efforts to address this problem \nand make the issue of downed animals a priority.\n  My legislation would set a uniform national standard, thereby \nremoving\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\nany unfair advantage that might result from different standards \nthroughout the industry. Furthermore, no additional bureaucracy will be \nneeded as a consequence of my bill because inspectors regularly visit \nstockyards and slaughter facilities to enforce existing regulations. \nThus, the additional burden on the agency and stockyard operators will \nbe insignificant.\n  As I stated before, this bill will stop the inhumane and improper \ntreatment of downed animals while also helping to ensure that our food \nsupply remains safe. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.

A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to provide trade \nreadjustment and development enhancement for America's communities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``TRADE for \nAmerica's Communities Act'' in recognition of the critical need to \nprovide economic development assistance to communities, across this \nNation, that have been negatively impacted by trade. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Murkowski in offering this critical legislation.\n  We are faced with a challenge to a U.S. trade program from the \ninternational community and with communities that are being left behind \nin an era of global commerce. Congress must make the difficult \ndecisions to turn these two challenges into opportunities for this \nNation. In 1999, I supported the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset \nAct, authored by Senator DeWine, that used the revenue from \ncountervailing and antidumping tariff duties to provide assistance to \nthe firms that were affected by unfair trade. I supported that bill \nbecause it introduced an important policy principle: that the revenue \nfrom unfair trade should be used to help those hurt by trade.\n  Unfortunately, that act ran afoul of our international commitments. \nIn January, the World Trade Organization ruled that this program was in \nviolation of our Antidumping Agreement, and the President requested \nCongress repeal that program in order to bring the United States into \ncompliance. While I cannot support a full repeal of this program, I \nbelieve the bill we are introducing today will bring the United States \ninto compliance with our international obligations, while maintaining \nthe principle that this money be used to help those hurt by trade.\n  In fact, the TRADE for America's Communities Act builds upon the \nstrong foundation and principles of Senator DeWine's program and it is \nmy hope that other proponents of the CDSOA will support our efforts to \naddress the needs of these communities. While it is necessary to live \nup to our international agreements, it is just as imperative that we \nlive up to our responsibilities to the fishing towns, mining towns and \nmill towns of America where jobs have been lost.\n  With the momentum provided by the passage of Trade Promotion \nAuthority, the President has put forth an agenda on a bilateral, \nregional and global basis that promotes the liberalization of trade. As \nthe President has argued, this policy agenda creates new opportunities \nfor prosperity and growth.\n  At the same time, we must never forget that opportunities of market \naccess, improved consumer choice, and availability of manufacturing \ninputs, come with the price of transitions, dislocations, and shifts in \nthe U.S. economy. These dynamic changes that are outgrowths from trade \nare similar to technological advances in productivity that leave \nworkers out of jobs, or plants out of operation. However, while \ntechnological advances are the initiative of private enterprise, trade \nliberalization is the chosen policy of government. Free trade creates \nopportunities, but it also creates responsibilities that this \ngovernment must embrace just as firmly as it embraces free trade.\n  The bill we are introducing today address these issues by giving the \nDepartment of Commerce the revenue from these tariffs, which currently \ngoes to corporations, to provide technical assistance to communities \nthat have been negatively impacted by trade, to develop strategic plans \nthat would focus on creating and retaining jobs in a community and \npromote economic diversification. Once the strategic plans have been \napproved by the Department of Commerce, grants would be available, \nbased on the needs of the community, to implement economic development \nprojects, improve the local infrastructure, support the establishment \nof small businesses, and attract new businesses.\n  In small towns, where the livelihood of the local economy depends on \none industry, one plant, or one company, that is suffering under trade \nliberalization, it can cause devastation when that steel mill, paper \nmill, or textile mill shuts down. In towns like East Millinocket, ME, \nwhere Great Northern Paper went bankrupt, or in Waterville, Maine, \nwhere Hathaway shut down their plant and moved shirt production \noverseas, local economies were sent into disarray. That is just part of \nthe reason I was so adamant in my support last year for improvements in \nTrade Adjustment Assistance.\n  Congress did the right thing when we expanded TAA training and \nbenefits in the Trade Act of 2002, but one of the complaints leveled \nagainst TAA was the concern over what these workers would be able to do \nwith their new\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\ntraining in small towns that had few jobs to offer. The ``TRADE for \nAmerica's Communities Act'' seeks to answer those concerns by ensuring \nthat in towns where there may be few opportunities left, this \ngovernment takes the first step towards providing hope through economic \nadjustment assistance.\n  The ``TRADE for America's Communities Act'' would lay the groundwork \nfor an America where no community is left behind in the march towards a \nfree and open global economy. As the Finance Committee continues its \nwork on trade legislation and the numerous trade agreements being \nproposed by this Administration, I look forward to the opportunity to \naddress the economic development needs of these communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 1300. A bill to prohibit a health plan from contracting with a \npharmacy benefit manager (PBM) unless the PBM satisfies certain \nrequirements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Prescription \nDrug Consumer Information Act. I believe this legislation will \ndramatically improve the way in which prescription drug benefits are \nprovided to our Nation's 40 million senior citizens through the \nMedicare program.\n  The Prescription Drug Consumer Information Act is intended to provide \nsome assurances that the billions of dollars being spent on this new \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare is going as far as possible. The \nAct is focused primarily on the practices of pharmacy benefit managers, \nthe private companies that would most likely administer the new \nprescription drug benefit called for under the Prescription Drug \nBenefits Bill.\n  PBMs have come to dominate the prescription drug benefit market and \nsubsequently, have been the target of criticism by the employers and \nhealth plans that contract with them. The source of the controversy has \nbeen the cost cutting practices of PBMs, which have allowed them to \nmake prescription drug coverage more affordable. However, the fact that \ndrug prices continue to rise in the face of these cost-cutting efforts, \nhas led some to question PBM practices in the private sector. As we \nmove forward in providing prescription drug coverage within a \ngovernment-operated program as large as Medicare it is critical that \nthere be adequate safeguards in place. My bill would provide greater \nscrutiny and auditing of PBMs contracting with the government and also \nprovide some consumer protections for all Americans who purchase \nprescription drugs.\n  The market share of prescription drug benefits managed by PBMs has \ngrown enormously in recent years. Currently, 90 percent of Americans \nwith prescription drug coverage have their benefits administered by a \nPMB. Of that 90 percent, nearly 70 percent of those people are served \nby one of the four major PBM companies. PBMs provide benefits to nearly \n200 million Americans, including 65 percent of the Nation's senior \npopulation. PBMs have become as powerful in the delivery of \nprescription drug services as the manufacturers which produce \nmedications.\n  As PBMs have come to dominate the market, they are increasingly \ndrawing the attention of State lawmakers struggling with skyrocketing \nprescription drug costs for state workers and large programs like \nMedicaid. As States focus on reducing pharmaceutical costs, suspicions \nare growing among state lawmakers and health department officials that \nthe ``behind-closed-doors'' practices of PBMs are responsible for some \nof the escalating costs of prescription drugs. In 2002, Georgia become \nthe first State to regulate PBMs by requiring they be licensed as \npharmacies. This year, 19 States have introduced legislation to \nregulate or license PBMs.\n  At issue are the rebates, discounts and other savings that PBMs \nnegotiate with drug manufacturers in exchange for giving their \nmedications ``preferred'' status on the PBMs list of available drugs. \nThose contracts are a primary source of revenue for the PBMs and for \nthe drug manufacturers who see use of their products increase as the \nPBM steers its massive consumer base toward the preferred drug. \nHowever, because PBMs are so secretive about their arrangements with \nmanufacturers, it is difficult for PBM clients to know if a significant \nportion of the rebates are being passed back to them as the PBM \npromises.\n  PBMs also negotiate lower prices with pharmacies but fail to share \nthose savings with consumers, particularly on generic drugs. A recent \nWall Street Journal investigation found that for one drug fluoxetine, a \ngeneric of Prozac, PBMs were buying the drug from the pharmacy for \nabout 30 cents a pill. However, most of the PBMs clients were paying \n$1.06 a pill based on the average markup formula. The PBM was pocketing \nthe difference, which was 76 cents per pill. Multiply that by the \nnumber of fluoxetine pills dispensed by the PBMs and it is clear that \nthese private companies are getting rich while consumers continue to \npay unnecessarily high drug prices. This may be in the best interests \nof the PBMs shareholders, but it is a disservice to its customers, \nwhich turn to PBMs in an attempt to save money and lower drug costs.\n  Efforts to better understand the PBM industry have reinforced this \nattitude of secrecy and backroom deals. Last year, Senator Dorgan \nrequested a General Accounting Office study of whether PBMs were \nsharing the savings achieved through rebates and discounts with the \nmembers of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. Unfortunately, \nthe study provided us with little understanding of how the PBM industry \noperates because GAO was denied access to the financial documents of \nthe PBM companies. GAO had no way of fulfilling its obligation of \nreporting to Congress because the PBMs refused to disclose any \ninformation about rebates, discounts and other savings generated by \nFEHBP.\n  Yet, these same companies want the federal government to hand them \nbillions of dollars for a new Medicare drug benefit without providing \nany accounting of how that money was spent. Allowing the PBMs to \noperate a government program in such secrecy is outrageous and would \nset a terrible policy precedent.\n  The Prescription Drug Consumer Information Act would improve this \nsystem with a five-part approach. First, the Act would eliminate \npotential conflicts of interest by prohibiting cross ownership of \npharmaceutical manufacturing companies and PBMs. Second, it would \ncontain costs by requiring that any PBM contracting with Medicare \nprovide any cost savings negotiated with a pharmacy back to the PBM \nclient, be that client an employer, a health plan or the government.\n  Third, it would require all pharmacies to disclose the retail cost of \na prescription drug upon request by a consumer. Several States, \nincluding Washington State, Montana, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island, \nalong with the Virgin Islands, currently require pharmacies to make \nretail prices available to consumers. This provision is desperately \nneeded across the country. A 2002 survey conducted by the Washington \nState Attorney General's Office found that retail prices on \nprescriptions could vary as much as $25 within a city and within a \npharmacy chain. All consumers should be able to comparison shop for the \nbest price amongst pharmacies in their area but they cannot do that if \nthey do not know the retail price of various drugs.\n  Fourth, the amendment would require PBMs on an annual basis to make \npublic the percent of rebate received from the manufacturer that is \npassed back to the client, such as an employer, health plan or the \ngovernment. The amendment does not require full public disclosure of \nthe PBMs' negotiations with manufacturers because I realize that such a \nrequirement could damage their ability to get good deals from the \nmanufacturer. This disclosure does not have to take an all or nothing \napproach. The Act allows the PBM to keep private the specifics of their \ncontracts, but at the same time provides senior citizens some assurance \nthat they are benefiting from the savings achieved in those contracts.\n  Finally, my bill would strengthen the audit requirements for PBMs \nadministering the Medicare drug benefit to ensure that PBMs are passing \nthose rebates and other savings along to consumers. One of the problems \nfor employers and health plans using PBMs now is that it is difficult \nfor them to\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\nconfirm that the PBM is meeting its contractual obligations to pass on \na portion of its savings. Auditing provisions in my bill include \ncomplete disclosure of the amounts and types of rebates. The results of \nthe audit would not become public, to ensure the PBMs ability to \ncontinue to negotiate discounted prices. This approach strikes a fair \nbalance between the PBMs rights as private companies and the duty the \nPBMs have to share any savings generated by the new benefit with \nMedicare recipients.\n  Together, these provisions will ensure that senior citizens and the \ngovernment are getting the most out of every dollar spent on a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit and that other consumers who purchase \nprescription drugs are armed with information before spending their \nhard-earned money. Consumers should have some assurance that the \nprivate companies providing prescription drug insurance are not running \nup costs and cutting down coverage in an attempt to boost their own \nbottom lines. The Prescription Drug Consumer Information Act provides \nthose assurances and protections.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1301. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nvideo voyeurism in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of \nthe United States, and of other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with the Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer, to introduce the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act \nof 2003. Our legislation would criminalize the appalling practice of \nfilming or photographing victims without their knowledge or consent \nunder circumstances violating their privacy.\n  Video voyeurism encompasses what is referred to as ``upskirting'' or \n``downshirting.'' As the terms imply, this subset of video voyeurism \ninvolves the use of a tiny, undetectable camera to film up the skirt or \ndown the shirt of an unsuspecting target, most often a woman. One of my \nconstituents from Ohio became the victim of this shocking invasion of \nprivacy while she was innocently enjoying a church festival with her \n16-month old daughter. I would like to read you what she told the \nCincinnati Enquirer newspaper in an article published on October 10, \n2000:\n\n       As I crouched down to put the baby in my stroller, I saw a \n     video camera sticking out of his bag, taping up my dress. . . \n     . It rocked my whole sense of security.\n\n  According to an ABCNEWS.com article that also published this story, \nthis particular perpetrator had surreptitiously filmed a total of 13 \nwomen that day. Sadly, this is not an isolated event. The widespread \navailability of low-cost, high-resolution cameras has lead to an \nincrease in the number of high-profile cases of ``video-voyeurism'' all \nover our country. Reports of women being secretly videotaped through \ntheir clothing at shopping malls, amusement parks, and other public \nplaces are far too common.\n  The impact of video voyeurism on its victims is greatly exacerbated \nby the Internet. As a result of Internet technology, the pictures that \na voyeur captures can be disseminated to a worldwide audience in a \nmatter of seconds. A State representative from Ohio, Representative Ed \nJerse, stated it best when he told ABC News that when a woman's picture \nis posted on the Web, her privacy ``could be violated millions of \ntimes.''\n  Fortunately, my home State of Ohio has enacted a law that \nspecifically targets video voyeurism. But Ohio is one of only a few \nStates that have such a law. That means that in most areas around the \ncountry, victims of this practice are not only deprived of their \nsecurity and their privacy but are left without any recourse against \ntheir perpetrator. As the defense attorney for one video voyeur aptly \nobserved, ``the criminal law necessarily lags behind technology and \nhuman ingenuity.''\n  Our Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2003 seeks to close the gap in \nthe law and ensure that video voyeurs will be punished for their acts. \nOur bill would make it a crime to videotape, photograph, film, or \notherwise electronically record the naked or undergarment-clad \ngenitals, pubic area, buttocks, or female breast of an individual \nwithout that individual's consent. This bill would help ensure that \nwhen a person has a reasonable expectation that he or she will not be \nvideoed, filmed, or photographed as I have just described, that \nexpectation of privacy will be recognized in and protected by the law. \nAdditionally, our bill would make certain that perpetrators of video \nvoyeurism are punished, by imposing a sentence of a fine or \nimprisonment for up to 1 year.\n  Importantly, however, the mens rea requirements included in this bill \nguarantee that only those who are truly guilty of this crime will be \npunished. To be charged with video voyeurism, an actor must intend to \ncapture the prohibited image and must knowingly do so.\n  In closing, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the Video \nVoyeurism Prevention Act of 2003. This legislation would help safeguard \nthe privacy we all take for granted and would help ensure that our \ncriminal law reflects the realities of our rapidly changing technology.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill be printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n\n                                 S. 1301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A committee \n     to which an implementation bill is referred under this \n     paragraph may report such bill to the respective House \n     without amendment.\n       (3) Report or discharge.--If a committee to which an \n     implementation bill is referred has not reported such bill by \n     the end of the 15th calendar day after the date of the \n     introduction of such bill, such committee shall be \n     immediately discharged from further consideration of such \n     bill, and upon being reported or discharged from the \n     committee, such bill shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar.\n       (c) Floor Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--When the committee to which an \n     implementation bill is referred has reported, or has been \n     discharged under subsection (b)(3), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the \n     respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of \n     the implementation bill, and all points of order against the \n     implementation bill (and against consideration of the \n     implementation bill) are waived. The motion is highly \n     privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged \n     in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject \n     to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the implementation bill is agreed to, \n     the implementation bill shall remain the unfinished business \n     of the respective House until disposed of.\n       (2) Amendments.--An implementation bill may not be amended \n     in the Senate or the House of Representatives.\n       (3) Debate.--Debate on the implementation bill, and on all \n     debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall \n     be limited to not more than 20 hours, which shall be divided \n     equally between those favoring and those opposing the \n     resolution. A motion further to limit debate is in order and \n     not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or \n     a motion to recommit the implementation bill is not in order. \n     A motion to reconsider the vote by which the implementation \n     bill is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n       (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on an implementation bill, and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the implementation bill \n     shall occur.\n       (5) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the \n     case may be, to the procedure relating to an implementation \n     bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (d) Coordination With Action by Other House.--If, before \n     the passage by 1 House of an implementation bill of that \n     House, that House receives from the other House an \n     implementation bill, then the following procedures shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Nonreferral.--The implementation bill of the other \n     House shall not be referred to a committee.\n       (2) Vote on bill of other house.--With respect to an \n     implementation bill of the House receiving the implementation \n     bill--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     implementation bill had been received from the other House; \n     but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the \n     implementation bill of the other House.\n       (e) Rules of Senate and House of Representatives.--This \n     section is enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of an implementation bill described \n     in subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n      SEC. __04.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nEduardo Aguirre to serve as Director of the Bureau of Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (BCIS), in the newly-created Department of \nHomeland Security. I was very impressed with him at his nomination \nhearing, and I look forward to working with him in his new position.\n  I am pleased that this nomination was referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee, which continues to have jurisdiction over immigration \nlegislation and oversight. Similarly, I am pleased that we were able to \nobtain unanimous consent last week for the Judiciary Committee to \nreceive a subsequent referral on the nomination of Michael Garcia to \nhead the Bureau of Customs and Immigration Enforcement--BICE.\n  The recent Inspector General report on the treatment of ``9/11 \ndetainees''\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\nshows the severe consequences that can be faced by those immigrants who \nfail to mention their unlawful status. Of course, the responsibility to \nremain here legally falls upon immigrants, but there are occasions when \nimmigrants live up to that responsibility and are nonetheless failed by \nerrors and backlogs on the Government's part. I hope and trust that \npreventing such errors will be a major priority for Mr. Aguirre. I also \nhope that he will use his position to battle the perception in many \nimmigrant communities that the war on terrorism has become a war on \nimmigrants.\n  At his confirmation hearing, I talked to Mr. Aguirre about the former \nINS employees in Vermont who will be under his jurisdiction, including \nthose at the Vermont Service Center in St. Albans. I recommended to him \nthat he build on the established INS workforce throughout the State by \nmaking Vermont a regional center for his agency, and I was pleased that \nhe seemed to take that advice seriously. I am eager to work with him to \nsee that idea become a reality.\n  On the national level, it was a priority for many of us in Congress \nthat immigration services not be overlooked at the Department of \nHomeland Security. Although our security is paramount, the new \nDepartment must remember that our Nation's founding principals and \neconomic health demand that immigration be handled in a fair and \norderly way. After his confirmation hearing, I believe that Mr. \nAguirre--himself a refugee--understands this at a fundamental level.\n  He faces a challenging job. I have already written him about the \nbacklogs that plague our immigration system, and I hope that he is able \nto make meaningful change in that area. The President has pledged to \nreduce the average backlog for immigration petitions to 6 months by \n2006--to do so is going to take serious investment, and I hope Mr. \nAguirre will be a voice inside the administration to make that \ninvestment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8257-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF C.

Stewart Verdery, Jr., to be an \nAssistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Border and Transportation \nSecurity Policy. Mr. Verdery's nomination was approved unanimously by \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs on June 17, and his confirmation \nwill fill a vital position at the new Department of Homeland Security. \nI have known Stewart for over a decade, and believe that his \nexperience, Jeffersonian conservative principles, and personal \nqualities make him well-qualified to serve in the new Department.\n  The Assistant Secretary for Policy and Planning at the Border and \nTransportation Directorate, Department of Homeland Security, is the \nprincipal adviser to the BTS Under Secretary for policy development in \nthe substantive areas within the BTS Directorate, including immigration \nand customs enforcement, customs and border protection, transportation \nsecurity, Federal law enforcement training, and domestic preparedness. \nThe Assistant Secretary is responsible for ensuring that policies \ndeveloped for BTS and its component agencies are designed to achieve \nhomeland security objectives as directed by the DHS Secretary and BTS \nUnder Secretary and to fulfill the BTS mission statement to ``protect \nnational security and promote public safety by enforcing our nation's \nimmigration and customs laws, providing an effective defense against \nall external threats, including international terrorists, and other \nthreats such as illegal drugs and other contraband, while preserving \nthe free flow of legitimate trade and travel.''\n  Mr. Verdery is well-known to this body, having served for more than 6 \nyears in the U.S. Senate. He first served as counsel to my senior \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, in his personal office and on \nthe Senate Rules Committee. He joined the Senate Judiciary Committee in \n1998 as head of the crime and law enforcement unit, and then moved to \nbecome General Counsel to the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles. In this role, Mr. Verdery advised the Senate leadership on a \nhost of issues, including crime and law enforcement, commerce, judicial \nnominations, constitutional law, campaign finance, and \ntelecommunications. He was widely respected among his peers and relied \nupon not only by Senator Nickles, but by many other members of the \nRepublican Conference and their staffs as well.\n  Whether managing the high-profile investigation of the disputed 1996 \nLouisiana Senate election, helping direct the Clinton impeachment \ntrial, or a host of other assignments, Mr. Verdery's organizational \nskills, political instincts, and notable work ethics enabled him to \nthrive in the demanding environment of the U.S. Senate.\n  I had the opportunity to work closely with Stewart when the Senate \nRepublican leadership designated him as a lead staffer for the Senate \nRepublican High Tech Task Force, which has the goal of advancing \nconstructive technology policy in the Senate. As chairman of the High \nTech Task Force in 2001-2002, I was impressed by his extraordinary \ncommand of complex technology issues and, perhaps more important, his \nability to succinctly explain the issues to others. His advice and \ncounsel were always sound and thoughtful, and through his effective and \nfriendly manner, he instantly earned the respect of those with whom he \nworked.\n  Stewart Verdery played a key role in the transformation of the High \nTech Task Force into a lead advocate for the technology-friendly \npolicies in the Senate. With his assistance, my colleagues and I were \nbetter prepared to advance a positive technology policy agenda in the \nSenate, including: the passage of a clean, 2-year Internet tax \nmoratorium extension; passage of the upgraded Export Administration Act \nreauthorization; securing additional funding for anti-piracy \nprosecutions; and the hard-fought effort in the economic stimulus \ndebate to make the Research and Development tax credit permanent, to \nprovide enhanced expensing and to include the broadband tax credit.\n  Mr. Verdery will be a valuable member of the team at the Department \nof Homeland Security. I wish Stewart, his wife Jenny and their two \nyoung children, Isabelle and Chase, all the very best health and \nhappiness in this new endeavor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise today to support the Senate's \napproval of the nomination of Stewart Verdery as the Assistant \nSecretary for Policy and Planning at the Border and Transportation \nDirectorate of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I have worked with Stewart since his days as Counsel to the Senate \nRules Committee and while he was at the Senate Judiciary Committee. He \ndid an outstanding job in those capacities. As a matter of fact, he did \nsuch a great job I hired him to serve as my General Counsel in the \nAssistant Republican Leader's office. In his position there, he served \nnot only as my counsel, but as a counsel for the entire Senate. We deal \nwith a lot of issues in the U.S. Senate, and Stewart's counsel was \ninvaluable to me and other Senators.\n  I consider Stewart and his wife Jenny to be part of the family. Not \nonly were they married while he was on my staff, but their two children \nwere born as well. I respect him as both a professional and a family \nman.\n  I have no doubt Stewart will excel in this new position, and it is \nwith great pleasure that I support his nomination as Assistant \nSecretary for Policy and Planning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/19/senate-section/article/S8257-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the \nSenate a conference report to accompany S. 342, the Child Abuse \nProtection Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     342), to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act \n     to make improvements to and reauthorize programs under the \n     Act, and\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\n     for other purposes, having met, have agreed that the Senate \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the House, \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, signed by all of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nits consideration.\n  (The conference report is printed in the Record of the House \nproceedings of June 12, 2003)\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased today to speak in support of \nthe conference agreement reached by the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate for S. 342, the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of \n2003.\n  This act reauthorizes several programs that are key to protecting our \nmost vulnerable children and families: The child Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment Act, CAPTA; the Adoption Opportunities Act; The Abandoned \nInfants Assistance Act; the Family Violence Prevention and Services \nAct; and the Children's Justice Act.\n  The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act works to reduce child \nabuse and neglect by encouraging new training and better qualifications \nfor front-line child and family service workers. This legislation also \nimproves links between child protective services, health and mental \nhealth agencies, and judicial systems to improve services for at risk \nchildren and to mitigate the damaging impact that child abuse and \nneglect can cause.\n  For children who are removed from their homes as a result of child \nabuse or neglect, this Act helps to ensure they are placed into safe \nfoster care or adoptive homes. By requiring that criminal background \nchecks are performed on all adults residing in foster homes, this Act \nhelps to prevent further abuse to the child. Through the \nreauthorization of the Adoption Opportunities Act, this legislation \nalso helps to better facilitate the adoption of children with special \nneeds by working to eliminate interjurisdictional barriers to adoption.\n  Lastly, the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act gives victims of \ndomestic violence greater access to shelters in times of emergency \nthrough the reauthorization of the Family Violence Prevention and \nServices Act.\n  This important legislation responds to some of the most serious needs \nof children and families. I commend the work of the House of \nRepresentatives, who acted earlier today to pass this Conference \nreport. I also thank the ranking member of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee Senator Kennedy for his work on this \nbill, as well as Senators Alexander and Dodd, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Children and Families.\n  Protecting our most vulnerable populations is a significant priority \nand passage of this legislation sends a clear message that Congress is \ndeeply committed to the interests of children and their families. I am \nvery pleased that the House and Senate will send the Keeping Children \nand Families Safe Act of 2003 to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the bipartisan legislation before the \nSenate today will continue our Federal commitment to see that the \nNation's most vulnerable children are protected and safe.\n  Child abuse and child neglect continue to be serious problems. Each \nyear, thousands of children suffer. On any given day, 2,400 children \nare discovered to be victims of child abuse or neglect. Tragically, 3 \nof those children die each day as a result.\n  Abuse and neglect harm children from all backgrounds and all walks of \nlife. Too many children are in situations in which their basic needs \nare not provided for. Too many children are subject to physical harm or \nemotional trauma. Too many children are victims of sexual abuse. We can \ndo better and we must do better.\n  For nearly 30 years, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act has \nsupported States in their efforts to respond to the immediate needs of \nchildren subjected to abuse and neglect, and helped them and their \nfamilies take the road to recovery.\n  We all know it's a huge challenge. Each week, child protective \nservice agencies in local communities respond to more than 50,000 \nsuspected cases of child abuse and neglect. Despite their hard work, \nnearly half of all children in substantiated cases of abuse receive no \nfollow-up services or support.\n  This legislation is an important step toward responding to the needs \nof every neglected and abused child in every community in our country. \nIt is an important step toward seeing that children in desperate \ncircumstances have the support they need to stop the abuse and deal \nwith the harmful effects.\n  This legislation will renew our federal commitment to help states \nimprove their own response to child abuse and neglect. More will be \ndone to promote better planning at the Federal, State, and local \nlevels, facilitate more effective referrals to the available services, \nand broaden the scope of the response.\n  More will be done to see that those responsible for investigating or \nworking with abused children and their families have the necessary \ntraining and skills to do their jobs effectively and efficiently. \nStates will be encouraged to provide new safety training to child abuse \ncaseworkers. New cross-training will help caseworkers identify signs of \ndomestic violence and substance abuse that often signal child abuse.\n  More will be done to strengthen community efforts. Our bill will \nensure that local citizens oversee, review, and improve the practices \nof child protective services. It will promote partnerships between \npublic agencies and community-based organizations to share the \nresponsibility of reducing child abuse and neglect in their \ncommunities.\n  More will be done to end geographic barriers to adoption and provide \npermanent homes for abused children.\n  More will be done to combat the destructive effects of family \nviolence and provide immediate help to its victims. A new electronic \nnetwork will link victims to organizations available to help them, 24-\nhours-a-day, 365 days-a-year.\n  More will also be done to reduce the social and emotional impact of \ndomestic violence on children. A new demonstration program will support \ndirect services, referrals, and appropriate interventions for the 10 \nmillion children who witness domestic violence each year.\n  Our colleague, Senator Wellstone, was one of the greatest champions \nfor abused children. I commend the conferees for their work to include \nthis important program that he cared about so deeply.\n  As our communities across the nation continue their efforts to \nrespond more effectively to every incident of child abuse and neglect, \nthey must do so with resources already stretched thin. This bipartisan \nlegislation increases the authorization for the Child Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Act to $200 million in order to deliver the support that \nlocal communities need to do this important work.\n  I commend Senator Gregg and all of the conferees for their work and \ntheir leadership on this legislation. It's a major step toward \nguaranteeing help for children and families to overcome the devastating \neffects of abuse, neglect, and violence in their lives.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues \nSenators Gregg, Kennedy, and Dodd to pass the conference report for S. \n342, ``The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003.'' I also \nwant to congratulate Senator Gregg, the chairman of the conference \ncommittee, and commend his leadership.\n  Unlike many Federal Government programs, this is a relatively small \nlevel of funding, but it is vital for the safety and sanctity of our \nmost precious resource--our children. S. 342 reauthorizes the ``Child \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment Act, (CAPTA),'' which provides grants to \nStates to improve child protection systems and grants to support \ncommunity-based family resource and support services. The changes made \nto this program will encourage new training and better qualifications \nfor child and family service workers. Additionally, this program will \ncreate or improve coordination between child protection services and \neducation, health, mental health, and judicial systems to ensure that \nchildren who are abused and neglected are properly identified and \nreceive referrals to appropriate services.\n  Tennessee has used CAPTA funding for many innovative pilot programs, \nsuch as Therapeutic Visitation Services. This is a pilot project that \nprovides intensive service to families with\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\nchildren in the foster care system from four rural areas in east \nTennessee. The goal is to preserve and strengthen family relationships \nwhile facilitating visitation between children and biological parents. \nChildren in the pilot program saw their parents sooner and more \nfrequently.\n  In Davidson County, the Chap-Plus program provides service and helps \ncoordinate care for families that are stressed due to their child's \nmedical condition, such as a life threatening disease. Another program \nthat receives CAPTA funding is the University of Tennessee Legally \nDefensible Child Interviewing program, which trains Child Protective \nServices case managers. This training is focused on improving \ninterviewing skills of investigative teams when they interview children \nwho are the possible victims of sexual, physical, or emotional abuse.\n  These important programs will benefit from this legislation. I thank \nmy colleagues for voting for this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in \nsupporting the conference report on legislation to reauthorize CAPTA, \nthe Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. This measure is very \naptly called the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003.\n  The conference report we are approving today would strengthen efforts \nto prevent child abuse and neglect. It would promote increased sharing \nof information and partnerships between child protective services and \neducation, health, and juvenile justice systems. It would encourage a \nvariety of new training programs to improve child protection, \nparticularly cross-training in recognizing domestic violence and \nsubstance abuse in addition to child abuse detection and protection \ntraining.\n  The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 renews grants to \nStates to improve child protection systems and increases to $200 \nmillion the authorization for child abuse investigations, training of \nchild protection service, CPS, workers, and community child abuse \nprevention programs.\n  For States to receive funding, they must meet several new \nrequirements: have triage procedures to provide appropriate referrals \nof a child ``not at risk of imminent harm'' to a community organization \nor for voluntary preventive services; have policies and procedures for \nthe referral of abused children under the age of three to early \nintervention services funded under Part C of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act; have policies in place to address the needs \nof infants who are born and identified as having been physically \naffected by prenatal exposure to illegal drugs, which must include a \nsafe plan of care for the child; have policies of improved training, \nretention, and supervision of caseworkers; and require criminal \nbackground record checks for prospective foster and adoptive parents \nand all other adults living in the household, not later than 2 years \nafter the law's enactment.\n  Child abuse and neglect continue to be significant problems in the \nUnited States.\n  Nearly 3 million referrals concerning the welfare of about 5 million \nchildren were made to Child Protection Services, CPS, agencies \nthroughout the Nation in 2001. Of these referrals, about two-thirds, \n67.3 percent, were ``screened-in'' for further assessment and \ninvestigation. Professionals, including teachers, law enforcement \nofficers, social service workers, and physicians made more than half, \n56.5 percent, of the screened-in reports. About 903,000 children were \nfound to be victims of child maltreatment. Over half, 59 percent, \nsuffered neglect, including medical neglect; 19 percent were physically \nabused; 10 percent were sexually abused; 6.8 percent were emotionally \nmaltreated; and 19.5 percent were associated with ``other'' forms of \nmaltreatment such as abandonment, threats of harm to the child, and \ndrug addiction. About 275,000, or 20 percent, of abused children were \nplaced in foster care as a result of CPS investigation or assessment.\n  Many of these children fail to receive adequate protection and \nservices.\n  The most tragic consequence of child maltreatment is death. In 2001, \nabout 1,300 children died of abuse and/or neglect. Children younger \nthan six years of age accounted for 85 percent of child fatalities and \nchildren younger than one year of age accounted for 41 percent of child \nfatalities.\n  Child abuse is not a new phenomenon. For more than a decade, numerous \nreports have called attention to the tragic abuse and neglect of \nchildren and the inadequacy of our Child Protection Service systems to \nprotect our children.\n  In 1990, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect concluded \nthat ``child abuse and neglect is a national emergency.'' In 1995, the \nU.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect reported that ``State \nand local CPS caseworkers are often overextended and cannot adequately \nfunction under their current caseloads.'' The report also stated that, \n``in many jurisdictions, caseloads are so high that CPS response is \nlimited to taking the complaint call, making a single visit to the \nhome, and deciding whether or not the complaint is valid, often without \nany subsequent monitoring of the family.''\n  A 1997 General Accounting Office, GAO, report found that, ``the CPS \nsystem is in crisis, plagued by difficult problems, such as growing \ncaseloads, increasingly complex social problems and underlying child \nmaltreatment, and ongoing systemic weakness in day-to-day operations.'' \nAccording to GAO, CPS weaknesses include ``difficulty in maintaining a \nskilled workforce; the inability to consistently follow key policies \nand procedures designed to protect children; developing useful case \ndata and record-keeping systems, such as automated case management; and \nestablishing good working relationships with the courts.''\n  According to a May 2001 report conducted by the American Public Human \nServices Association, APHSA, the Child Welfare League of America, CWLA, \nand the Alliance for Children and Families, annual staff turnover is \nhigh and morale is low among CPS workers. The report found that CPS \nworkers had an annual turnover rate of 22 percent, 76 percent higher \nthan the turnover rate for total agency staff. The ``preventable'' \nturnover rate was 67 percent, or two-thirds higher than the rate for \nall other direct service workers and total agency staff. In some \nStates, 75 percent or more of staff turnovers were preventable.\n  States rated a number of retention issues as highly problematic. In \ndescending order they are: workloads that are too high and/or \ndemanding; caseloads that are too high; too much worker time spent on \ntravel, paperwork, courts, and meetings; workers not feeling valued by \nthe agency; low salaries; supervision problems; and insufficient \nresources for families and children.\n  To prevent turnover and retain quality CPS staff, some States have \nbegun to increase in-service training, increase education \nopportunities, increase supervisory training, increase or improve \norientation, increase worker safety, and offer flex-time or changes in \noffice hours. Most States, however, continue to grapple with staff \nturnover and training issues.\n  Continued public criticism of CPS efforts, continued frustration by \nCPS staff and child welfare workers, and continued abuse and neglect, \nand death, of our Nation's children, served as the backdrop as we \ncomposed the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act CAPTA, \nreauthorization bill this year.\n  The Child Protection System mission must focus on the safety of \nchildren. To ensure that the system works as intended, CPS needs to be \nappropriately staffed. The staff need to receive appropriate training \nand cross-training to better recognize substance abuse and domestic \nviolence problems.\n  The conference agreement we are passing today encourages triage \napproaches and differential response systems so that those reports \nwhere children are most at risk of imminent harm can be prioritized.\n  The bill specifically emphasizes collaborations in communities \nbetween CPS, health agencies, including mental health agencies, \nschools, and community-based groups to help strengthen families and \nprovide better protection for children.\n  The bill provides grants for prevention programs and activities to \nprevent child abuse and neglect. By focusing this assistance on at-risk \nfamilies, we can help improve the likelihood that a\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\nchild will grow up on a home without violence, abuse, or neglect.\n  Beyond the CAPTA title of this legislation, the bill reauthorize the \nFamily Violence Prevention and Services Act, including new efforts to \naddress the needs of children who witness domestic violence, and a new \nhighly secure web site to increase the likelihood that when an abused \nspouse calls for help, such calls will be handled as efficiently as \npossible with on-line links to shelters immediately letting the caller \nknow of open shelters and the services these shelters offer. The \nmeasure also reauthorizes the Adoption Opportunities Act, and the \nAbandoned Infants Assistance Act.\n  Child protection ought not be a partisan issue. This bill will help \nensure that it is not. I want to commend and thanks my colleagues on \nthe conference committee--Chairman Gregg, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nAlexander, and Senator DeWine as well as my colleagues in the House for \ntheir efforts to craft a bipartisan initiative that can help to prevent \nand alleviate suffering among our Nation's children.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.
